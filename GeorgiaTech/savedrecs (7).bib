Abstract = {{Many computer models contain unknown parameters which need to be
   estimated using physical observations. Tuo and Wu (2014) show that the
   calibration method based on Gaussian process models proposed by Kennedy
   and O'Hagan {[}J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. Stat. Methodol. 63 (2001)
   425-464] may lead to an unreasonable estimate for imperfect computer
   models. In this work, we extend their study to calibration problems with
   stochastic physical data. We propose a novel method, called the L-2
   calibration, and show its semiparametric efficiency. The conventional
   method of the ordinary least squares is also studied. Theoretical
   analysis shows that it is consistent but not efficient. Numerical
   examples show that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Carbide-derived carbons are synthesized by chlorination of Fe3C at
   temperatures ranging from 200 to 1000 degrees C. The complex extraction
   method of Fe from Fe3C at moderate temperatures (600 degrees C) allows
   for the tailored inclusion of FeCl2, FeCl3, or Fe nanoparticles in the
   resulting CDC by controlling the synthesis conditions and post-treatment
   methods. In this study, we extend the synthesis to other temperatures in
   order to understand the role of chlorination temperature on the physical
   and textural properties of the resulting CDC. We also examine the
   activity of Fe3C-CDCs with embedded FeCl3 nanoparticles for ammonia
   adsorption. Materials synthesized at 600 degrees C show exceptional
   results in ammonia breakthrough experiments, and achieved dynamic
   loadings of 1.88 mmol g(-1) at 0\% relative humidity and 3.44 mmol g(-1)
   at 75\% relative humidity calculated at initial breakthrough when
   {[}NH3] > 0 ppm. NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and
   Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments suggest that
   the uptake is primarily due to ammonia complexation with FeCl3
   nanoparticles under dry conditions, and additional interactions with
   trapped chlorine in the presence of water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The density of commercially available polyacrylonitrile-based carbon
   fibers is in the range of 1.75-1.93 g/cm(3). It will be of great benefit
   to reduce the density of carbon fiber without compromising mechanical
   properties, so that high-performance structures made from such fibers
   can be lighter than those made from the solid carbon fibers. With the
   goal to produce high-strength and high-modulus carbon fibers with
   densities in the range of 0.9-1.3 g/cm(3), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based
   precursor fibers were produced with a honeycomb structure. Using dry-jet
   wet spinning and an islands-in-a-sea geometry bicomponent spinning
   method, honeycomb precursor fibers were manufactured that consisted of
   PAN as the sea component and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the
   islands component. Subsequently, the precursor fibers were stabilized
   and carbonized to produce hollow carbon fibers. Resulting carbon fibers
   have an estimated density of around 1.2 g/cm(3) with high tensile
   modulus of up to 209 N/tex. Raman spectroscopy mapping of the carbonized
   honeycomb fiber cross-section exhibited a strong Raman G-band intensity
   not only at the outer surface of the carbon fiber but also at the
   surface of inner walls of the honeycomb structure, suggesting that
   highly ordered graphitic structure was developed at these regions. (C)

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Abstract = {{Co-assemble diverse functional nanomaterials with single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs) to form folded structured SWCNT hybrid papers are
   potentially desirable for the applications in flexible conductors and
   phase change materials, due to the combination of folded porous
   structure and the synergistic effects between SWCNTs and nanomaterials.
   Herein, we report a scalable strategy to fabricate multifunctional
   folded structured SWCNT hybrid papers via processes of freeze
   drying-mechanically pressing technique. These characteristics featuring
   high porosity, flexibility and interconnection enable the compartmental
   films to be bent, resulting in folded structure. To investigate their
   properties and applications, the specific folded paper based on SWCNTs,
   Ag nanoparticles and alginate is developed. The folded structure enables
   the conductors to possess excellent mechanical performance and
   resistance-strain stability under various deformations. Moreover, the
   folded porous paper is also employed as temperature-driven switch to be
   capable of tuning the contact angle of water with superior reversibility
   by thermally activating the transition between
   air/liquid(1)/liquid(2)/solid system and air/liquid/solid system via the
   thermo-responsive phase change of paraffin, indicating an important
   branch of liquid transfer. We have a great expectation that the assembly
   proposed can afford a universal route to prepare other folded structured
   hybrid papers based on various functional nanoparticles, nanotubes and
   nanosheets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature dependences of gas transport and sorption properties on four
   previously isothermally studied 6FDA based carbon molecular sieve (CMS)
   membranes: 6FDA/DETDA, 6FDA: BPDA(1: 1)/DETDA, 6FDA/DETDA: DABA(3: 2)
   and 6FDA/1,5-ND: ODA(1: 1), were examined over the temperature range
   from 35 degrees C to 50 degrees C. The permeability, sorption and
   diffusivity of these materials are reported, and activation energies of
   permeation and diffusion as well as heats of sorption for gases CO2,
   CH4, O-2, and N-2 of these materials are compared. Permselectivity of
   these materials at 35 degrees C was probed for three gas pairs: CO2/CH4,
   O-2/N-2, and N-2/CH4, and results show that diffusion selectivity is the
   dominant factor in providing permselectivity. Diffusion selectivity can
   be factored further into an energetic selectivity and an entropic
   selectivity. The temperature dependence of both energetic and entropic
   selectivity and their contributions to overall diffusion selectivity are
   discussed in detail in this study. All four CMS membranes showed larger
   than unity entropic selectivity discriminations. 6FDA/DETDA derived CMS
   membrane, with the most compact structure, showed the largest entropic
   selectivity for CO2/CH4, O-2/N-2, and N-2/CH4 as about 7.40, 4.24, and
   2.17 respectively. Analysis of the selectivity factors provides insights
   into the effects of polymer precursor backbone structures on key
   transport and sorption properties in CMS materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this letter, a large scale investigation is carried out, utilizing
   several spectral shapes as the source for direct modulation-based
   frequency dithering (DMFD). DMFD mitigates the nonlinear effect of
   long-term evolution radio-over-fiber systems. The dithering signal
   shapes are sine, square, saw, sinc, and Gaussian with different spectral
   width characteristics. We show that by varying the dithering signal with
   increasing spectral width, no additional distortion is introduced in the
   linear and optimum optical launch power regions, which are dominated by
   the frequency chirp and chromatic dispersion. In addition, it is
   revealed herein that introducing dithering signals with varying spectral
   widths does not change the nonlinear compensator characteristic toward
   suppression of nonlinearity. The reason for this is that as long as the
   optical source linewidth is larger than stimulated Brillouin scattering
   (SBS) linewidth, the proposed method completely suppresses SBS. Finally,
   the degree of freedom for the dithering signal is infinite, with an
   optical power budget improvement of up to 8 dB at an optical launch
   power of 10 dBm, which can in turn be used towards connecting multiple
   relay nodes.}},

Title = {{Variational asymptotic analysis for plates of variable thickness}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75-76}},
Pages = {{81-87}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is a common assumption in plate theory that the effect of varying
   thickness on plate elastic constants can be simply accounted for by
   incorporating the thickness distribution in the formulae obtained for a
   plate of uniform thickness. For plates whose thickness varies linearly
   in the global directions, the variation described by a set of taper
   parameters, a plate theory has been developed using the
   variational-asymptotic method. In a first of its kind development, both
   the 8 x 8 stiffness matrix and the 3D stress and strain recovery are
   shown to contain these taper parameters explicitly, as opposed to their
   merely being present by virtue of the varying plate thickness.
   Furthermore, terms such as bending-shear and twist-shear coupling are
   shown to be present, which are typically disregarded in published works
   on tapered plates. It is later clearly demonstrated using the full 3D
   finite-element solutions from a test case that an analysis of this kind
   is needed to accurately determine the complete stress distribution. In
   conclusion, merely changing the thickness distributions in results for
   uniform plates may work for some problems but it is clearly not
   sufficient in general, nor can it guarantee good agreement with all
   aspects of plate analysis. This is because these kinds of approximations
   are not in tune with the mechanics of such a problem, as they disregard
   the tilt of the outward-directed normals in the boundary conditions for
   top and bottom surfaces. Furthermore, as always, a theory developed
   using the variational-asymptotic method does not make any assumptions
   regarding the deformation and is generally well suited for capturing
   such effects without fundamental changes in the procedure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of periodic geometric undulations on
   the dispersion properties of 1D and 2D elastic structures. Periodic
   undulations result from the spatial modulation of the curvature of beams
   and plates, which leads to the coupling of transverse and in-plane
   motion. Such coupling affects the modal structure, and leads to
   interactions that produce complete, modal and partial frequency bandgaps
   along with directional wave motion. The effects of relevant geometrical
   parameters defining the undulation, such as spatial period and
   undulation amplitude, are investigated through the application of the
   Plane Wave Expansion Method and a Finite Element-based analysis of
   dispersion. Experimental illustration of the bandgap behavior of
   undulated beams, and numerical simulations of wave motion in plates
   serve as partial validations of the analytical predictions, and as
   demonstrations of the potential application of the concept for the
   design of structural components and elastic waveguides with tailored
   bandgap and directional properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is a low cycle fatigue process in which
   material life is correlated to the mechanical strain amplitude. However,
   it is well known that several other factors influence this life. This
   paper examines several of these parameters and their influence on life
   using experiments conducted on a second generation
   directionally-solidified (DS) Ni-base superalloy. The parameters
   considered include the influence of the temperature extremums (T-max of
   either 750 or 950 degrees C and T-min, of either 100 or 500 degrees C),
   strain ratio (R-e), the strain-temperature phasing (in-phase (IP) and
   out-of-phase (OP)), the influence of dwells at the high temperature end
   of the cycle resulting in a creep-fatigue (CF) interaction, and material
   anisotropy associated with the grain growth direction (longitudinal
   versus transverse). Results suggest that the phasing has a primary role
   in controlling the mechanism of degradation. IP TMF is dominated by
   crack formation in volumes surrounding debonded carbides for both
   continuously cycling (CC) and CF at 950 and 750 degrees C, while OP TMF
   is dominated by surface oxidation and repetitive cracking of the oxide
   that reforms at the crack tip at 950 degrees C. Decreasing the T-max to
   750 degrees C the environmental and creep effects are reduced resulting
   in virtually pure fatigue exposure under OP conditions. With decreasing
   T-min from 500 degrees C to 100 degrees C was observed an increase in
   inelastic strain amplitude and corresponding decrease in life.
   Variations in R-epsilon were found to have no significant influence on
   life or stabilized stress behavior. TMF loading in the transverse
   orientation resulted in life reductions over the longitudinal
   orientation due to cracks propagating in a transgranular manner. Lastly,
   only in material exposed to CF with a T-max of 950 degrees C rafting of
   the gamma' precipitates was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{191-201}},

Abstract = {{The aging of the microstructure of Ni-base superalloys during service is
   primarily characterized by coarsening and rafting of the gamma'
   precipitates. The influence of these different aged microstructures on
   thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) under either continuously cycled (CC) and
   creep-fatigue (CF) was investigated. Three different aged
   microstructures, generated through accelerated aging and pre-creep
   treatments, were studied: stress-free coarsened gamma'. rafted with
   orientation perpendicular to loading direction (N-raft), and rafted with
   orientation parallel to loading direction (P-raft). Under most
   conditions, the aged microstructures were less resistant to TMF than the
   virgin microstructure; however, there were exceptions. Both stress-free
   coarsened and N-raft microstructures resulted in a reduction in TMF life
   under both CC and CF conditions in comparison to the virgin material.
   P-raft microstructure also resulted in reduction in TMF life under CC
   conditions; however, an increase in life over that of the virgin
   material was observed under CF conditions. These differences are
   discussed and hypothesized to be related to the interactions of the
   dislocations in the gamma channels with gamma` precipitates. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis of a reciprocating hydraulic rod seal, considering

   consists of coupled fluid mechanics, contact mechanics and load support
   analyses. The fluid transport, friction force, film thickness
   distribution, contact pressure distribution and fluid pressure
   distribution in the sealing zone have been computed for a polyurethane
   U-cup seal. Starved conditions lead to a smaller region of pressurized
   fluid in the sealing zone, higher contact pressures and a higher
   friction force than with flooded conditions. If the fluid deposited on
   the rod during the preceding outstroke is insufficient to fill the
   sealing zone, starvation will occur during the instroke. If, however,
   sufficient fluid is deposited, flooded conditions will occur. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper concerns optimal mode-scheduling in autonomous switched-mode
   hybrid dynamical systems, where the objective is to minimize a
   cost-performance functional defined on the state trajectory as a
   function of the schedule of modes. The controlled variable, namely the
   modes' schedule, consists of the sequence of modes and the switchover
   times between them. We propose a gradient-descent algorithm that adjusts
   a given mode-schedule by changing multiple modes over time-sets of
   positive Lebesgue measures, thereby avoiding the inefficiencies inherent
   in existing techniques that change the modes one at a time. The
   algorithm is based on steepest descent with Armijo step sizes along GA
   cent teaux differentials of the performance functional with respect to
   schedule-variations, which yields effective descent at each iteration.
   Since the space of mode-schedules is infinite dimensional and
   incomplete, the algorithm's convergence is proved in the sense of
   Polak's framework of optimality functions and minimizing sequences.
   Simulation results are presented, and possible extensions to problems
   with dwell-time lower-bound constraints are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cooling of refrigerant blends R404A and R410A at critical and
   supercritical pressures in horizontal tubes with 0.76 < D < 9.4 mm is
   investigated. Local heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops are
   measured at P-r = 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, mass fluxes of 200 < G < 800 kg

   that simultaneously allows accurate measurement of low local
   supercritical gas cooling heat duties and deduction of the heat transfer
   coefficient from the measured overall resistance is used. The sharp
   variations in the fluid properties in the vicinity of the critical point
   are found to have a substantial effect on heat transfer coefficients.
   Due to these abrupt property variations, the heat transfer coefficients
   show sharp peaks near the critical temperature. Models for predicting f
   and Nu are developed based on the prevailing flow regime (liquid-like,
   pseudo-critical transition and gas-like). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We present measurements from batch crystallization as a trajectory in
   the phase space mapped out by the crystal mass and the total chord
   count. This new perspective yields a framework for monitoring and
   controlling crystallization that has two beneficial attributes: first,
   crystallization is seen as movement we find that this fosters an
   intuitive understanding of crystallization kinetics; and, second, the
   problem of controlling the average crystal size is cast as a
   trajectory-endpoint control problem-we find that this promotes the
   development of spatially-oriented control schemes.
   The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by application. In
   particular, we apply the framework to: 1) elucidate the effects of
   simple temperature manipulations on the crystallization kinetics; 2)
   interpret the actions applied by supersaturation control (SSC) and
   direct nucleation control (DNC) to produce large crystals; and 3)
   develop a control scheme-termed spatially-guided action trajectory
   endpoint control (sGATEC)-that can be applied to produce crystals of
   pre-selected average size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   modifications to use the HMM VC system in a cross-lingual conversion
   scenario and compares it with a cross-lingual VC system based on
   artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results of the tests show
   improved performance of the proposed HMM VC system compared with both

Abstract = {{The chemical structure and electrical properties of anodized titania are
   investigated for their application as conformal ultra-thin dielectrics
   on high surface area titanium electrodes. The chemical structure is
   studied by XPS depth profiling for the first time along with the role of
   anodization conditions on dielectric thickness, leakage current, and
   capacitance densities. Different leakage current models were used to
   identify the defect mechanisms in the titania film formed at different
   voltages. EDS and structural SEM studies were performed to investigate
   the morphology and structure of the titania films. This research also
   demonstrates the fabrication and characterization of high-density
   capacitors using high surface area titanium metal electrodes, conformal
   high K, and thin-film dielectric of titania. High-permittivity and
   thin-film titania dielectric was grown on high surface area titanium
   anodes using anodization, while conducting polymer was used as the
   cathode. The fabricated capacitor showed 7.15 A mu F cm(-2) at 100 kHz
   which corresponded to 7.5X enhancement in surface area compared to
   planar thin-film capacitors. This is the first demonstration of
   high-density capacitors using high surface area titanium anodes along

Title = {{Scheduling network maintenance jobs with release dates and deadlines to

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{113-129}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider a problem that marries network flows and scheduling,
   motivated by the need to schedule maintenance activities in
   infrastructure networks, such as rail or general logistics networks.
   Network elements must undergo regular preventive maintenance, shutting
   down the arc for the duration of the activity. Careful coordination of
   these arc maintenance jobs can dramatically reduce the impact of such
   shutdown jobs on the flow carried by the network. Scheduling such jobs
   between given release dates and deadlines so as to maximize the total
   flow over time presents an intriguing case to study the role of time
   discretization. Here we prove that if the problem data is integer, and
   no flow can be stored at nodes, we can restrict attention to integer job
   start times. However if flow can be stored, fractional start times may
   be needed. This makes traditional strong integer programming scheduling
   models difficult to apply. Here we formulate an exact integer
   programming model for the continuous time problem, as well as integer
   programming models based on time discretization that can provide dual
   bounds, and that can with minor modifications - also yield primal
   bounds. The resulting bounds are demonstrated to have small gaps on test
   instances, and offer a good trade-off for bound quality against
   computing time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new practical method is presented to estimate
   supercapacitor state for wireless sensor nodes. The self-discharge
   process of supercapacitor, as an energy storage device in sensor nodes,
   is usually considered as the main factor that needs to be taken into
   account for power management. Recent studies have demonstrated that a
   supercapacitor charge-redistribution process may also have significant
   impact on power management. To consider charge redistribution in power
   management of a real-time system, a practical method is presented to
   estimate the state of a supercapacitor. The accuracy of the method is
   validated by experiments. The impact of time step on the proposed model
   is also investigated. The results indicate that the proposed model can
   achieve good accuracy with relatively large time step. Moreover, the
   model is easy to implement, and has low memory usage and computational
   cost for practical applications in a real-time system. Based on the
   practical model, estimations of charge and energy transferred during the
   redistribution process are presented, which provide important
   information toward developing energy aware algorithms in wireless sensor
   networks.}},

Title = {{Characterizing and automatically detecting crowdturfing in Fiverr and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As human computation on crowdsourcing systems has become popular and
   powerful for performing tasks, malicious users have started misusing
   these systems by posting malicious tasks, propagating manipulated
   contents, and targeting popular web services such as online social
   networks and search engines. Recently, these malicious users moved to
   Fiverr, a fast growing micro-task marketplace, where workers can post
   crowdturfing tasks (i.e., astroturfing campaigns run by crowd workers)
   and malicious customers can purchase those tasks for only \$5. In this
   manuscript, we present a comprehensive analysis of crowdturfing in
   Fiverr and Twitter and develop predictive models to detect and prevent
   crowdturfing tasks in Fiverr and malicious crowd workers in Twitter.
   First, we identify the most popular types of crowdturfing tasks found in
   Fiverr and conduct case studies for these crowdturfing tasks. Second, we
   build crowdturfing task detection classifiers to filter these tasks and
   prevent them from becoming active in the marketplace. Our experimental
   results show that the proposed classification approach effectively
   detects crowdturfing tasks, achieving 97.35 \% accuracy. Third, we
   analyze the real-world impact of crowdturfing tasks by purchasing active
   Fiverr tasks and quantifying their impact on a target site (Twitter). As
   part of this analysis, we show that current security systems
   inadequately detect crowd-sourced manipulation, which confirms the
   necessity of our proposed crowdturfing task detection approach. Finally,
   we analyze the characteristics of paid Twitter workers, find
   distinguishing features between these workers and legitimate Twitter
   accounts, and use these features to build classifiers that detect
   Twitter workers. Our experimental results show that our classifiers are
   able to detect Twitter workers effectively, achieving 99.29 \% accuracy.}},

   the rod tip where space charges are widely distributed, precipitating
   discharges of wide range of amplitudes. At relatively larger spacing,
   the discharge behavior is largely controlled by electric field
   distribution. In the fixed gap experiments, the local field is varied by
   introducing polymer nanocomposites that have different filler content.
   For a fixed gap and constant voltage, discharge magnitudes are lower in
   samples with nanofiller content below the percolation threshold than in
   the base polymer. The scatter in discharge magnitudes is lower in
   samples with nanoparticle content below the percolation threshold than
   in samples with nanofiller content above the threshold. The major
   conclusion is the maximum advantage of adding nanofillers is gained only
   when the particle content is below the percolation threshold. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Safe operation and reliability of the electrical power systems
   necessitate full observability of the power grid. Phasor measurement
   units (PMUs) are the state-of-the-art intelligent devices that collect
   synchronized phasors of voltages and currents in real time. It is not
   economically justifiable to install PMUs at all buses of the power grid.
   Hence, designing the PMUs network and determining their optimal
   placement in the power grid is an investment decision. In this paper, we
   propose a new investment decision model to determine the optimal
   placement of PMUs that guarantees the full observability of the power
   grid. Network observability rules are applied to reduce the capital cost
   of installing PMUs. A problem-specific genetic algorithm is developed to
   determine the optimal investment decision. The N - 1 reliability
   requirement of the power grid has been integrated in the model as well
   to obtain the resilient network design against all single contingencies
   such as failure of a PMU or a transmission line. Furthermore, a
   two-phase investment plan is proposed, which provides the power system
   investors with more flexibility and avoids unnecessary investment costs.
   In the first phase, PMUs are installed to achieve full observability of
   the power grid whereas additional PMUs will be installed in the second
   phase to guarantee the full observability in case of single
   contingencies. To test the efficacy of the proposed model, experiments
   are conducted on multiple IEEE test systems with and without considering
   zero-injection buses. The results are compared to the other methods such
   as integer linear programming and heuristic methods. The analysis shows
   that the proposed approach is promising and verifies its efficacy. (C)

Abstract = {{Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a new population-based meta-heuristic
   which imitates the music improvisation process and has been successfully
   applied to a variety of combination optimization problems. In this
   paper, a self-adaptive harmony particle swarm optimization search
   algorithm, named SHPSOS, is proposed to solve global continuous
   optimization problems. Firstly, an efficient initialization scheme based
   on the PSO algorithm is presented for improving the solution quality of
   the initial harmony memory (HM). Secondly, a new self-adaptive adjusting
   scheme for pitch adjusting rate (PAR) and distance bandwidth (BW), which
   can balance fast convergence and large diversity during the
   improvisation step, are designed. PAR is dynamically adapted by
   symmetrical sigmoid curve, and BW is dynamically adjusted by the median
   of the harmony vector at each generation. Meanwhile, a new effective
   improvisation scheme based on differential evolution and the best
   harmony (best individual) is developed to accelerate convergence
   performance and to improve solution accuracy. Besides, Gaussian mutation
   strategy is presented and embedded in the SHPSOS algorithm to reinforce
   the robustness and avoid premature convergence in the evolution process
   of candidates. Finally, the global convergence performance of the SHPSOS
   is analyzed with the Markov model to testify the stability of algorithm.
   Experimental results on thirty-two standard benchmark functions
   demonstrate that SHPSOS outperforms original HS and the other related
   algorithms in terms of the solution quality and the stability. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Hydrogen separation using metal membranes offers significant energetic,
   technological, and economic advantages over conventional separation
   processes, resulting in extensive efforts to develop favorable membrane
   materials. Intermetallics are stoichiometric compounds of two or more
   metals that form an ordered structure. This work exhibits a systematic
   search for intermetallic membrane materials for hydrogen separation from
   potential candidates using density functional theory (DFT)-based methods
   to quantitatively predict solubility, diffusivity, and permeability.
   Geometric correlations were used to significantly decrease the number of
   calculations performed without compromising on the accuracy of the
   predictions. In this work, 1001 intermetallic structures were screened,
   and eight materials, MnTi, MgZn2, PtTl2, FeHf2, HfTa, NiTi, TiV, and
   Fe2Y, were identified as potential candidates for hydrogen separation
   membranes based on the calculated hydrogen permeability. This work, in
   addition to identifying novel membrane materials, highlights the
   significance of computational tools for screening large libraries of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a rectangular, anisotropic nanolaminated CoNiFe core
   that possesses a magnetically hard axis in the long geometric axis
   direction. Previously, we have developed nanolaminated cores comprising
   tens to hundreds of layers of 300-1000 nm thick metallic alloys (i.e.
   Ni80Fe20 or Co44Ni37Fe19) based on sequential electrodeposition,
   demonstrating suppressed eddy-current losses at MHz frequencies. In this
   work, magnetic anisotropy was induced to the nanolaminated CoNiFe cores
   by applying an external magnetic field (50-100 mT) during CoNiFe film
   electrodeposition. The fabricated cores comprised tens to hundreds of
   layers of 500-1000 nm thick CoNiFe laminations that have the hard-axis
   magnetic property. Packaged in a 22-turn solenoid test inductor, the
   anisotropic core showed 10\% increased effective permeability and 25\%
   reduced core power losses at MHz operation frequency, compared to an
   isotropic core of the identical geometry. Operating the anisotropic
   nanolaminated CoNiFe core in a step-down dc-dc converter (15 V input to
   5 V output) demonstrated 81\% converter efficiency at a switching
   frequency of 1.1 MHz and output power of 6.5 W. A solenoid microinductor
   with microfabricated windings integrated with the anisotropic
   nanolaminated CoNiFe core was fabricated, demonstrating a constant
   inductance of 600 nH up to 10 MHz and peak quality factor exceeding 20
   at 4 MHz. The performance of the microinductor with the anisotropic
   nanolaminated CoNiFe core is compared with other previously reported
   microinductors.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial activation of neural circuitry through electrical
   microstimulation and optogenetic techniques is important for both
   scientific discovery of circuit function and for engineered approaches
   to alleviate various disorders of the nervous system. However, evidence
   suggests that neural activity generated by artificial stimuli differs
   dramatically from normal circuit function, in terms of both the local
   neuronal population activity at the site of activation and the
   propagation to downstream brain structures. The precise nature of these
   differences and the implications for information processing remain
   unknown. Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging of primary
   somatosensory cortex in the anesthetized rat in response to deflections
   of the facial vibrissae and electrical or optogenetic stimulation of
   thalamic neurons that project directly to the somatosensory cortex.
   Although the different inputs produced responses that were similar in
   terms of the average cortical activation, the variability of the
   cortical response was strikingly different for artificial versus sensory
   inputs. Furthermore, electrical microstimulation resulted in highly
   unnatural spatial activation of cortex, whereas optical input resulted
   in spatial cortical activation that was similar to that induced by
   sensory inputs. A thalamocortical network model suggested that observed
   differences could be explained by differences in the way in which
   artificial and natural inputs modulate the magnitude and synchrony of
   population activity. Finally, the variability structure in the response
   for each case strongly influenced the optimal inputs for driving the
   pathway from the perspective of an ideal observer of cortical activation
   when considered in the context of information transmission.}},

Abstract = {{In the quest to improve the performance of organic bulk heterojunction
   solar cells, many recent efforts have focused on developing molecular
   and polymer alternatives to commonly used fullerene acceptors. Here,
   molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate polymer:molecule
   blends comprised of the polymer donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with
   a series of acceptors based on trialkylsilylethynyl-substituted
   pentacene. A matrix of nine pentacene derivatives, consisting of
   systematic chemical variation both in the nature of the alkyl groups and
   electron-withdrawing moieties appended to the acene, is used to draw
   connections between the chemical structure of the acene acceptor and the
   nanoscale properties of the polymer:molecule blend, which include
   polymer and molecular diffusivity, donor-acceptor packing and
   interfacial (contact) area, and miscibility. The results point to the
   very significant role that seemingly modest changes in chemical
   structure play during the formation of polymer:molecule blend
   morphologies.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is limited data examining the association of combined
   fitness and central obesity with health related quality of life (HRQoL)
   in adults. We examined the association of combined cardiorespiratory
   fitness (CRF) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in the form of a fit-fat
   index (FFI) with the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental
   Component Summary (MCS) HRQoL scores in United States Navy servicemen.
   Methods: As part of a health fitness assessment, a total of 709 healthy
   males aged 18-49 years completed a submaximal exercise test, WHtR
   measurement, and HRQoL survey (SF-12v2) between 2004 and 2006. FFI level
   was classified into thirds with the lowest FFI tertile serving as the
   referent group. PCS and MCS scores >= 50 were taken to indicate average
   or better. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) and
   95 \% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: The prevalence of average or better HRQoL scores was lowest in
   the referent FFI tertile, PCS 60.2 \% and MCS 57.6 \%. Compared with the
   lowest FFI group in multivariate analyses, the OR (95 \% CI) of having
   average or better PCS was 1.63 (1.09-2.42) and 3.12 (1.95-4.99) for
   moderate and high FFI groups respectively; MCS was 1.70 (1.13-2.55) and
   4.89 (3.03-7.89) for moderate and high FFI groups respectively (all P <
   0.001). Consistent and progressive independent associations were
   observed between age and MCS, and also between CRF and MCS.
   Conclusion: Among males in the United States Navy, higher levels of FFI
   were independently and more consistently associated with having average
   or better HRQoL (physical and mental) than other known predictors of
   HRQoL.}},

Title = {{Mesenchymal Stem Cells Induce Directional Migration of Invasive Breast
   Cancer Cells through TGF-beta}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited to the tumor
   microenvironment and influence tumor progression; however, how MSCs
   induce the invasion of cancer cells is not completely understood. Here,
   we used a 3D coculture model to determine how MSCs affect the migration
   of invasive breast cancer cells. Coculture with MSCs increases the
   elongation, directional migration, and traction generation of breast
   cancer cells. MSC-induced directional migration directly correlates with
   traction generation and is mediated by transforming growth factor beta
   (TGF-beta) and the migratory proteins rho-associated kinase, focal
   adhesion kinase, and matrix metalloproteinases. Treatment with MSC
   conditioned media or recombinant TGF-beta 1 elicits a similar migration
   response to coculture. Taken together, this work suggests TGF-beta is
   secreted by MSCs, leading to force-dependent directional migration of
   invasive breast cancer cells. These pathways may be potential targets
   for blocking cancer cell invasion and subsequent metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding intracellular redox chemistry requires new tools for the
   site-specific visualization of intracellular oxidation. We have
   developed a spatially-resolved intracellular sensor of hydrogen
   peroxide, HyPer-Tau, for time-resolved imaging in live cells. This
   sensor consists of a hydrogen peroxide-sensing protein tethered to
   microtubules. We demonstrate the use of the HyPer-Tau sensor for three
   applications; dose-dependent response of human cells to exogenous
   hydrogen peroxide, a model immune response of mouse macrophages to
   stimulation by bacterial toxin, and a spatially-resolved response to
   localized delivery of hydrogen peroxide. These results demonstrate that
   HyPer-Tau can be used as an effective tool for tracking changes in
   spatially localized intracellular hydrogen peroxide and for future
   applications in redox signaling.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to improved sanitation, hygiene, and better access to safe
   water, oral cholera vaccines can help to control the spread of cholera
   in the short term. However, there is currently no systematic method for
   determining the best allocation of oral cholera vaccines to minimize
   disease incidence in a population where the disease is endemic and
   resources are limited. We present a mathematical model for optimally
   allocating vaccines in a region under varying levels of demographic and
   incidence data availability. The model addresses the questions of where,
   when, and how many doses of vaccines to send. Considering vaccine
   efficacies (which may vary based on age and the number of years since
   vaccination), we analyze distribution strategies which allocate vaccines
   over multiple years. Results indicate that, given appropriate
   surveillance data, targeting age groups and regions with the highest
   disease incidence should be the first priority, followed by other groups
   primarily in order of disease incidence, as this approach is the most
   life-saving and cost-effective. A lack of detailed incidence data
   results in distribution strategies which are not cost-effective and can
   lead to thousands more deaths from the disease. The mathematical model
   allows for what-if analysis for various vaccine distribution strategies
   by providing the ability to easily vary parameters such as numbers and
   sizes of regions and age groups, risk levels, vaccine price, vaccine
   efficacy, production capacity and budget. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   regression analysis was used to relate PM2.5 emission sources to
   ROS-generation potential and to estimate historical levels of DTT
   activity for use in an epidemiologic analysis for the period of
   1998-2009. Light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGV) exhibited the highest
   intrinsic DTT activity, followed by biomass burning (BURN) and
   heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDV) (0.11 +/- 0.02, 0.069 +/- 0.02, and
   0.052 +/- 0.01 nmol min(-1) mu g(source)(-1), respectively). BURN
   contributed the largest fraction to total DTT activity over the study
   period, followed by LDGV and HDDV (45, 20, and 14\%, respectively). DTT
   activity was more strongly associated with emergency department visits
   for asthma/wheezing and congestive heart failure than PM2.5. This work
   provides further epidemiologic evidence of a biologically plausible
   mechanism, that of oxidative stress, for associations of adverse health
   outcomes with PM2.5 mass and supports continued assessment of the
   utility of the DTT activity assay as a measure of ROS-generating
   potential of particles.}},

Abstract = {{Furanic and phenolic compounds are problematic byproducts resulting from
   the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass during biofuel production. The
   capacity of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEG) to produce hydrogen gas
   (H-2) using a mixture of two furanic (furfural, FF; 5-hydroxymethyl
   furfural, HMF) and three phenolic (syringic acid, SA; vanillic acid, VA;
   and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, NBA) compounds as the substrate in the
   bioanode was assessed. The rate and extent of biotransformation of the
   five compounds and efficiency of H-2 production, as well as the
   structure of the anode microbial community, were investigated. The five
   compounds were completely transformed within 7-day batch runs and their
   biotransformation rate increased with increasing initial concentration.
   At an initial concentration of 1200 mg/L (8.7 mM) of the mixture of the
   five compounds, their biotransformation rate ranged from 0.85 to 2.34
   mM/d. The anode Coulombic efficiency was 44-69\%, which is comparable to
   that of wastewater-fed MECs. The H-2 yield varied from 0.26 to 0.42 g
   H-2 COD/g COD removed in the anode, and the bioanode volume-normalized
   H-2 production rate was 0.07-0.1 L/L-d. The biotransformation of the
   five compounds took place via fermentation followed by
   exoelectrogenesis. The major identified fermentation products that did
   not transform further were catechol and phenol. Acetate was the direct
   substrate for exoelectrogenesis. Current and H-2 production were
   inhibited at an initial substrate concentration of 1200 mg/L, resulting
   in acetate accumulation at a much higher level than that measured in
   other batch runs conducted with a lower initial concentration of the
   five compounds. The anode microbial community consisted of
   exoelectrogens, putative degraders of the five compounds, and syntrophic
   partners of exoelectrogens. The MEC H, production demonstrated in this
   study is an alternative to the currently used process of reforming
   natural gas to supply H-2 needed to upgrade bio-oils to stable
   hydrocarbon fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperbranched amine polymers (HAS) grown from the mesoporous silica
   SBA-15 (hereafter ``SBA-15-HAS{''}) exhibit large capacities for CO2
   adsorption. We have used static in situ and magic-angle spinning (MAS)
   ex situ C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to examine the adsorption
   of CO, by SBA-15-HAS. C-13 NMR distinguishes the signal of gas-phase
   (CO2)-C-13 from that of the chemisorbed species. HAS polymers possess
   primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, leading to multiple
   chemisorption reaction outcomes, including carbamate (RnNCOO-), carbamic
   acid (RnNCOOH), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) moieties. Carbamates and
   bicarbonate fall within a small C-13 chemical shift range (162-166 ppm),
   and a mixture was observed including carbamic acid and carbamate, the
   former disappearing upon evacuation of the sample. By examining the
   C-13-N-14 diolar coupling through low-field (B-0 = 3 T) (13C)\{H-1\}
   cross-polarization MAS NMR, carbamate is confirmed through splitting of
   the C-13 resonance. A third species that is either bicarbonate or a
   second carbamate is evident from bimodal T, decay times of the similar
   to 163 ppm peak, indicating the presence of two species comprising that
   single resonance. The mixture of products suggests that (1) the presence
   of amines and water leads to bicarbonate being present and/or (2) the
   multiple types of amine sites in HAS permit formation of chemically
   distinct carbamates.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of palygorskite on chemical forms of heavy

   palygorskite to reduce the bioavailability of a model metal, Cu, during
   the composting process. The Biolog EcoPlate(TM) test revealed that the
   microbial community showed better capability of utilizing complex
   macro-molecules (such as miscellaneous and polymers) in the presence of
   palygorskite. Increasing the palygorskite contents from 1\% to 5\%, the
   microbial activity showed an increasing tendency. However, continuously
   increasing the palygorskite resulted in a decline of the microbial
   metabolism. Therefore, appropriate content of palygorskite is an ideal
   additive for composting, not only enhancing the microbial activity, but
   also reducing the metal toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid nanophotonic platforms based on three-dimensional integration of
   different photonic materials are emerging as promising ecosystems for
   the optoelectronic device fabrication. In order to benefit from key
   features of both silicon (Si) and silicon nitride (SiN) on a single
   chip, we have developed a wafer-scale hybrid photonic platform based on
   the integration of a thin crystalline Si layer on top of a thin SiN
   layer with an ultra-thin oxide buffer layer. A complete optical path in
   the hybrid platform is demonstrated by coupling light back and forth
   between nanophotonic devices in Si and SiN layers. Using an adiabatic
   tapered coupling method, a record-low interlayer coupling-loss of 0.02
   dB is achieved at 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength window. We also
   demonstrate high-Q resonators on the hybrid material platform with
   intrinsic Q's as high as 3 x 10(6) for a 60 mu m-radius microring

Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic wood has been created using a combination of O-2 plasma
   etching and plasma deposition of thin films to achieve the necessary
   combination of surface roughness and chemistry. Inherently hydrophobic
   fluorocarbon films (from pentafluoroethane (PFE) precursor) and
   hydrophilic diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings (from acetylene
   precursor) were both used to create highly water repellent substrates.
   The effect of O-2 plasma etching on surface roughness was investigated
   using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Scanning Confocal
   Microscope (LSCM) profilomeny. The wetting behavior of the resulting
   wood was determined by static water contact angle and droplet sliding
   angle measurements. Wood samples subjected to O-2 plasma etching prior
   to fluorocarbon deposition exhibited ``roll-off{''} superhydrophobicity
   with low sliding angles; the sample in this study with the most extreme
   wetting properties has the highest water contact angle and lowest
   sliding angle reported to date for modified wood substrates (WCA 161.2
   degrees +/- 1.5 degrees and sliding angle similar to 15 degrees),
   without affecting visual appearance of the wood. Due to our ability to
   control roughness, etched samples that were coated with hydrophilic DLC
   films displayed superhydrophobic behavior (WCA), although the surface
   was ``sticky{''} in that water droplets did not slide or dislodge from
   vertically-held substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Metal on metal wear at high sliding speeds and high contact pressures
   results in the melting of one or both of the sliding solid bodies due to
   heat generated at the contact interface. Understanding the influence of
   sliding speeds and contact pressures on normalized wear rates is
   important in developing predictive models for designing more efficient
   and effective engineering system components. Typical engineering
   applications subjected to extreme sliding conditions include ultrahigh
   speed machining, rocket sleds, large caliber cannon, and electromagnetic
   launchers. Sliding speeds on the order of 1000 m/s and contact pressures
   in excess of 100 MPa are common in these applications and difficult to
   replicate in a laboratory environment. A unique electromagnetic
   tribometer based on a minor caliber electromagnetic launcher has been
   designed and implemented to characterize wear deposition of a 6061-T6
   aluminum pin (slider) on a UNS C11000-H2 copper flat (guider) at sliding
   speeds from 0 to 1200 m/s and contact pressures from 100 to 225 MPa.
   Optical microscopy and 3D profilometry were used to investigate and
   quantify slider wear. Three distinct wear regions were observed. Test
   results provided evidence that the aluminum slider contact interface was
   molten and experimental wear data showed a dependence on both pressure
   and velocity. Comparisons between melt lubrication theory and
   experimental data provide insight into the nature of the contact
   interface under the sliding conditions tested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue exacting a
   substantial personal and economic burden globally. With the advent of
   big data approaches to understanding complex systems, there is the
   potential to greatly accelerate knowledge about mechanisms of injury and
   how to detect and modify them to improve patient outcomes. High quality,
   well-defined data are critical to the success of bioinformatics
   platforms, and a data dictionary of common data elements (CDEs), as well
   as unique data elements has been created for clinical TBI research.
   There is no data dictionary, however, for preclinical TBI research
   despite similar opportunities to accelerate knowledge. To address this
   gap, a committee of experts was tasked with creating a defined set of
   data elements to further collaboration across laboratories and enable
   the merging of data for meta-analysis. The CDEs were subdivided into a
   Core module for data elements relevant to most, if not all, studies, and
   Injury-Model-Specific modules for non-generalizable data elements. The
   purpose of this article is to provide both an overview of TBI models and
   the CDEs pertinent to these models to facilitate a common language for
   preclinical TBI research.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Truss-like cellular structures have great potential to be applied in
   light-weight design applications. However, determining the appropriate
   designs for these truss-like cellular structures can be a challenging
   task due to theft geometric complexities and prohibitive computational
   costs in the design process. In this research, a new design method is
   proposed which can drastically reduce computational costs and design
   parameters, while maintaining the performance of the targeted outcome.
   Furthermore, the proposed method facilitates cellular structure designs
   that can handle multiple loading conditions. The proposed method
   utilizes the relative density information obtained from a solid topology
   optimization to automatically determine the diameter of each individual
   strut in the structure, which collectively represent the set of design
   variables This allows the method to produce lattice structures that can
   perform reliably under multiple loading conditions and also reduce the
   computational cost associated with the design of these structures. The
   efficacy of the developed method is compared to existing methods
   including the size matching and scaling method that combines solid-body
   analysis and a predefined unit-cell library. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A novel design of a GPM-filled pipe structure was proposed to improve
   the heat transfer and reduce pressure drop of fluid flowing through the
   pipes filled with gradient porous materials. The pore-size gradient and
   porosity gradient were studied for both partially and fully filled
   configurations. The effects of GPMs on the fluid flow and heat transfer
   in the pipes were investigated and compared with the those under the
   conditions of non-porous materials and homogeneous porous materials
   (HPMs) serving as controls. Some typical GPM configurations were studied
   with Rp = 0.6 and Rp = 1.0, showing an enhanced heat transfer and a
   relatively low friction factor can be reached in comparison with the
   controls. An attempt was made to illustrate the mechanism of heat
   transfer enhancement with the field synergy theory. Velocity-based
   average pore-size was introduced to explain the reduction in friction
   factors in GPM configurations. A tradeoff analysis between pressure drop
   and heat transfer enhancement was made based on performance evaluation
   criteria (PEC). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of the minimum number of sensors within a network to
   satisfy a certain estimation performance metric is an interesting
   problem with a plethora of applications. The problem becomes even more
   interesting in a distributed configuration when each sensor has to
   decide itself whether it should contribute to the estimation or not. In
   this paper, we explore the sparsity embedded within the problem and
   propose a sparsity-aware sensor selection paradigm for both uncorrelated
   and correlated noise experienced at different sensors. We also present
   reasonably low-complexity and elegant distributed algorithms in order to
   solve the centralized problems with convergence guarantees within a
   bounded error. Furthermore, we analytically quantify the complexity of
   the distributed algorithms compared to centralized ones. Our simulation
   results corroborate our claims and illustrate a promising performance
   for the proposed centralized and distributed algorithms.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{665-679}},

Abstract = {{Quasi-static damage in multidirectional polymer composite (PMC)
   laminates developing during manufacturing and quasi-static loading
   degrades the modulus and strength. A model to predict simultaneous
   evolution of quasi-static transverse cracking in multiple plies and its
   effect on modulus of multidirectional PMCs is presented. A 3-D
   variational analysis formulating the in-plane and out-of-plane stresses
   of the plies in occurrence of multiple cracking has been developed to
   work within a lamination theory-based model framework. The stress state
   in the plies is determined using the lamination theory during an
   incremental change in loading. The strain energy, determined using this
   stress state, is compared to strain energy-based failure criteria to
   determine if a ply cracks after the increment. If crack is predicted,
   crack density of the ply is updated and the variational analysis is used
   to determine the perturbation in ply stresses due to cracking. The new
   stress state is used to determine the laminate modulus after cracking
   and the ply stresses for the next increment. This procedure is repeated
   to determine the crack evolution and modulus until reaching the desired
   load. Model predictions compare very well with experimental results for
   a {[}+/-theta(m)/90(n)](s) laminate at two elevated test temperatures of
   80 degrees C and 180 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Stability of amine-based hollow fiber CO2 adsorbents in the presence of
   NO and SO2}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{153-164}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Comparative studies of the cyclic stability of primary, secondary, and
   tertiary amine-grafted silica/polymer composite fiber adsorbents upon
   exposure to simulated flue gas are reported. A simulated dry flue gas
   mixture with 200 ppm NO does not cause degradation of the amine grafted
   fiber adsorbents and all fibers retain their CO2 capacity in the
   presence of NO. In contrast, upon exposure to dry flue gas in the
   presence of 200 ppm SO2 at 35 degrees C, the primary amine containing
   adsorbent, CA-S-APS, shows a CO2 capacity reduction of 55\% over 120
   cyclic adsorption-desorption runs. As the initial SO2 induced
   degradation occurs in this adsorbent, the amine sites first irreversibly
   adsorb SO2 and then begin to gradually adsorb SO2 reversibly, as
   evidenced from a quantitative comparison of the amount of adsorbed SO2
   to the amount of desorbed SO2. The secondary amine containing adsorbent,
   CA-S-MAPS, exhibits an improved stability and approximately 25\% CO2
   capacity loss is observed during cycling in the presence of SO2.
   Therefore, the secondary amine based CA-S-MAPS adsorbent demonstrates
   some degree of tolerance to SO2 in comparison to the CA-S-APS sample.
   Under humid conditions, SO2 imposes significant detrimental impacts on
   the two adsorbents, as a result of increased SO2 adsorption capacities
   in the presence of moisture. Although the CO2 uptake is nearly zero in
   the tertiary amine adsorbent, CA-S-DMAPS, the SO2 capacity of this
   adsorbent reaches 0.43 mmol/g under humid conditions and this material
   has the highest SO2/N ratio of the fiber adsorbents studied. More
   importantly, this CA-S-DMAPS sample demonstrates reversible SO2
   adsorption, as indicated from the SO2 cyclic adsorption experiments. The
   tertiary amine based fiber adsorbents have good potential for flue gas
   desulfurization, with advantageous characteristics of high SO2/N ratio,
   excellent reversibility, low CO2 adsorption and relatively low
   regeneration temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Patchiness and depth-keeping of copepods in response to simulated
   frontal flows}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{539}},
Pages = {{65-76}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{When presented with a fine-scale upwelling or downwelling shear flow in
   a laboratory flume, 2 tropical copepods from the Red Sea, Acartia
   negligens and Clausocalanus furcatus, performed a set of behaviors that
   resulted in apparent depth-keeping and the potential for producing
   patchiness. Analyses of free-swimming trajectories revealed a behavioral
   threshold shear deformation rate value of 0.05 s(-1) for both species.
   This threshold marked the transition to a range of behaviorally relevant
   shear deformation rate values and triggered statistically significant
   changes in path kinematics (i.e. relative swimming speed and turn
   frequency) in the shear layer versus out-of-layer. Gross path
   characteristics (i.e. net-to-gross displacement ratio, NGDR, and
   proportional vicinity time, PVT) were also significantly different in
   the shear layer treatments compared to controls. The vertical
   net-to-gross displacement ratio (VNGDR) was introduced here to explain a
   spectrum of depth-keeping behaviors. The mean value of VNGDR
   significantly increased in the treatments and suggested that the
   upwelling and downwelling shear layers induced vertical transport with
   large net vertical displacement. However, histograms of VNGDR revealed a
   bimodality, which indicated that a sizable portion of the population was
   also displaying depth-keeping behavior (low VNGDR). Those copepod
   trajectories not displaying depth-keeping behavior at the scale of the
   observation (high VNGDR) predominately consisted of copepods attempting
   to swim against the flow, thereby resisting vertical advection, which is
   another potential depth-keeping mechanism. Preferential depth-keeping
   was consistent with in situ acoustic tracking studies and could improve
   survival by increasing residence time near fronts, which are often
   coincident with food and mates.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Tal-effector nucleases (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short
   palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are
   genome editing tools with unprecedented potential. However, the ability
   to deliver optimal amounts of these nucleases into mammalian cells with
   minimal toxicity poses a major challenge. Common delivery approaches are
   transfection- and viral-based methods; each associated with significant
   drawbacks. An alternative method for directly delivering genome-editing
   reagents into single living cells with high efficiency and controlled
   volume is microinjection. Here, we characterize a glass
   microcapillary-based injection system and demonstrate controlled
   co-injection of TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 together with donor template into
   single K562 cells for targeting the human beta-globin gene. We
   quantified nuclease induced insertions and deletions (indels) and found
   that, with beta-globin-targeting TALENs, similar levels of on-and
   off-target activity in cells could be achieved by microinjection
   compared with nucleofection. Furthermore, we observed 11\% and 2\%
   homology directed repair in single K562 cells co-injected with a donor
   template along with CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs respectively. These results
   demonstrate that a high level of targeted gene modification can be
   achieved in human cells using glass-needle microinjection of genome
   editing reagents.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient utilization and broader commercialization of alternative
   energies (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal) hinges on the performance
   and cost of energy storage and conversion systems. For now and in the
   foreseeable future, the combination of rechargeable batteries and
   electrochemical capacitors remains the most promising option for many
   energy storage applications. Porous carbonaceous materials have been
   widely used as an electrode for batteries and supercapacitors. To date,
   however, the highest specific capacitance of an electrochemical double
   layer capacitor is only similar to 200 F/g, although a wide variety of
   synthetic approaches have been explored in creating optimized porous
   structures. Here, we report our findings in the synthesis of porous
   carbon through a simple, one-step process: direct carbonization of kelp
   in an NH3 atmosphere at 700 degrees C. The resulting oxygen- and
   nitrogen-enriched carbon has a three-dimensional structure with specific
   surface area greater than 1000 m(2)/g. When evaluated as an electrode
   for electrochemical double layer capacitors, the porous carbon structure
   demonstrated excellent volumetric capacitance (>360 F/cm(3)) with
   excellent cycling stability. This simple approach to low-cost
   carbonaceous materials with unique architecture and functionality could
   be a promising alternative to fabrication of porous carbon structures
   for many practical applications, including batteries and fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{Supported amines are promising candidate adsorbents for the removal of
   CO2 from flue gases and directly from ambient air. The incorporation of
   additives into polymeric amines such as poly(ethylenimine) (PEI)
   supported on mesoporous oxides is an effective strategy to improve the
   performance of the materials. Here, several practical aspects of this
   strategy are addressed with regards to direct air capture. The influence
   of three additives (CTAB, PEG200, PEG1000) was systematically explored
   under dry simulated air capture conditions (400 ppm of CO2, 30 degrees
   C). With SBA-15 as a model support for poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), the
   nature of the additive induced heterogeneities in the deposition of
   organic on the interior and exterior of the particles, an important
   consideration for future scale up to practical systems. The PEG200
   additive increased the observed thermodynamic performance (similar to
   60\% increase in amine efficiency) of the adsorbents regardless of the
   PEI content, while the other molecules had less positive effects. A
   threshold PEG200/PEI value was identified at which the diffusional
   limitations of CO2 within the materials were nearly eliminated. The
   threshold PEG/PEI ratio may have physical origin in the interactions
   between PEI and PEG, as the optimal ratio corresponded to nearly
   equimolar OH/reactive (1 degrees, 2 degrees) amine ratios. The strategy
   is shown to be robust to the characteristics of the host support, as
   PEG200 improved the amine efficiency of PEI when supported on two
   varieties of mesoporous gamma-alumina with PEI.}},

Abstract = {{Nature provides remarkable examples of mass-produced microscale
   particles with structures and chemistries optimized by evolution for
   particular functions. Synthetic chemical tailoring of such sustainable
   biogenic particles may be used to generate new multifunctional
   materials. Herein, we report a facile method for the development of
   bioenabled core/shell microparticles consisting of surface-modified
   ragweed pollen with a magnetic core, for which both multimodal adhesion
   and optical reflectivity can be tailored. Adhesion of the magnetic-core
   pollen can be tuned, relative to native pollen, through the combination
   of tailorable short-range interactions (over similar to 5 nm, via van
   der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding), an intermediate-range (over
   several mu m) capillary force, and long-range (over similar to 1 mm)
   magnetic attraction. The magnetic force could be controlled by the
   amount of iron oxide loaded within the core of the pollen particle,
   while the short-range interactions and capillary force can be tuned by
   coating with polystyrene nanoparticles and/or a layer of viscous
   pollenkitt on the exine shell surface. Such coatings were also used to
   tailor the optical reflectance of the magnetic pollen particles; that
   is, the light-reflectance intensity was enhanced by coating with
   pollenkitt and significantly reduced by coating with polystyrene
   nanoparticles. This approach for generating multifunctional core/shell
   microparticles with tailorable adhesion and optical reflectivity may be
   extended to other pollen or biological particles or to synthetic
   biomimetic particles. Such independent control of the core and shell
   chemistries enabled by this approach also allows for the generation of
   microparticles with a variety of combination in functions tailorable to
   other properties.}},

Abstract = {{Electric charging of colloidal particles in nonpolar solvents plays a
   crucial role for many industrial applications and products, including
   rubbers, engine oils, toners, or electronic displays. Although
   disfavored by the low solvent permittivity, particle charging can be
   induced by added surfactants, even nonionic ones, but the underlying
   mechanism is poorly understood, and neither the magnitude nor the sign
   of charge can generally be predicted from the particle and surfactant
   properties. The conclusiveness of scientific studies has been limited
   partly by a traditional focus on few surfactant types with many
   differences in their chemical structure and often poorly defined
   composition. Here we investigate the surface charging of poly(methyl
   methacrylate) particles dispersed in hexane-based solutions of three
   purified polyisobutylene succinimide polyamine surfactants with
   ``subtle{''} structural variations. We precisely vary the surfactant
   chemistry by replacing only a single electronegative atom located at a
   fixed position within the polar headgroup. Electrophoresis reveals that
   these small differences between the surfactants lead to qualitatively
   different particle charging. In the respective particle-free surfactant
   solutions we also find potentially telling differences in the size of
   the surfactant aggregates (inverse micelles), the residual water
   content, and the electric solution conductivity as well as indications
   for a significant size difference between oppositely charged inverse
   micelles of the most hygroscopic surfactant. An analysis that accounts
   for the acid/base properties of all constituents suggests that the
   observed particle charging is better described by asymmetric adsorption
   of charged inverse micelles from the liquid bulk than by charge creation
   at the particle surface. Intramicellar acid-base interaction and
   intermicellar surfactant exchange help rationalize the formation of
   micellar ions pairs with size asymmetry.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of achieving phase-dependent deterministic switching of
   the magnetoelectric spin wave detector in the presence of thermal noise
   has been discussed. The proposed idea relies on the modification of the
   energy landscape by partially canceling the out-of-plane demagnetizing
   field and the resultant change in the intrinsic magnetization dynamics
   to drive the nanomagnet towards a preferential final magnetization
   state. The remarkable increase in the probability of successful
   switching can be accounted for by the shift in the location of the
   saddle point in the energy landscape and a resultant change in the
   nature of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization from a highly
   precessional to a fairly damped one and an increased dependence on the
   initial magnetization values, a crucial requirement for phase-dependent
   spin wave detection. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless microsensors can add energy-and life-saving intelligence to
   remote and inaccessible places like factories, hospitals and so on. For
   this, they normally house sensors, data converters, digital processors,
   memory, transmitters, and power supplies. Although some of these
   functions can demand milliwatts at a time, the events monitored are
   typically so sporadic and sparse in time that average consumption is in
   microwatts. Still, tiny batteries cannot supply power for long, so power
   supplies cannot afford to burn much power. This is why reducing the
   power that switched-inductor supplies lose when delivering microwatts is
   critical. For these power levels, balancing switches to deliver fixed
   energy packets in discontinuous-conduction mode and adjusting their
   frequency to modify power level is the most efficient means of managing
   a DC-DC converter. In otherwords, fixing the inductor's peak current and
   adjusting frequency is more efficient than fixing frequency and
   adjusting peak current. In fact, experimental measurements show that
   fixing peak current to 6 mA and adjusting frequency to supply up to 250
   mu W is 2-10\% more efficient than fixing frequencies at 40, 80, and 120
   kHz and 1.4-7\% more efficient than fixing currents at 5 and 10 mA.}},

Title = {{Effects of in vitro endochondral priming and pre-vascularisation of
   human MSC cellular aggregates in vivo}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: During endochondral ossification, both the production of a
   cartilage template and the subsequent vascularisation of that template
   are essential precursors to bone tissue formation. Recent studies have
   found the application of both chondrogenic and vascular priming of
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhanced the mineralisation potential of
   MSCs in vitro whilst also allowing for immature vessel formation.
   However, the in vivo viability, vascularisation and mineralisation
   potential of MSC aggregates that have been pre-conditioned in vitro by a
   combination of chondrogenic and vascular priming, has yet to be
   established. In this study, we test the hypothesis that a tissue
   regeneration approach that incorporates both chondrogenic priming of
   MSCs, to first form a cartilage template, and subsequent
   pre-vascularisation of the cartilage constructs, by co-culture with
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, will improve
   vessel infiltration and thus mineral formation once implanted in vivo.
   Methods: Human MSCs were chondrogenically primed for 21 days, after
   which they were co-cultured with MSCs and HUVECs and cultured in
   endothelial growth medium for another 21 days. These aggregates were
   then implanted subcutaneously in nude rats for 4 weeks. We used a
   combination of bioluminescent imaging, microcomputed tomography,
   histology (Masson's trichrome and Alizarin Red) and immunohistochemistry
   (CD31, CD146, and alpha-smooth actin) to assess the vascularisation and
   mineralisation potential of these MSC aggregates in vivo.
   Results: Pre-vascularised cartilaginous aggregates were found to have
   mature endogenous vessels (indicated by alpha-smooth muscle actin walls
   and erythrocytes) after 4 weeks subcutaneous implantation, and also
   viable human MSCs (detected by bioluminescent imaging) 21 days after
   subcutaneous implantation. In contrast, aggregates that were not
   pre-vascularised had no vessels within the aggregate interior and human
   MSCs did not remain viable beyond 14 days. Interestingly, the
   pre-vascularised cartilaginous aggregates were also the only group to
   have mineralised nodules within the cellular aggregates, whereas
   mineralisation occurred in the alginate surrounding the aggregates for
   all other groups.
   Conclusions: Taken together these results indicate that a combined
   chondrogenic priming and pre-vascularisation approach for in vitro
   culture of MSC aggregates shows enhanced vessel formation and increased
   mineralisation within the cellular aggregate when implanted
   subcutaneously in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The porous hollow BaFe12O19/CoFe2O4 microrods were prepared by an easy
   and reproducible in situ synthetic method. Cotton cellulose was used as
   the sacrificial bio-template. The as-prepared hard/soft ferrite
   composites were homogeneously distributed on the surface of the
   microrods. It was demonstrated that the porous hollow microrods-like
   structure and the exchange-coupled interaction between hard and soft
   ferrites were beneficial to improve the microwave absorption properties.
   The weight content of the hard/soft ferrite composites was low to 60
   wt\%, whereas reflection loss could reach to -10 dB in the frequency
   range of 8.2-16.3 GHz. The fabrication of porous hollow
   BaFe12O19/CoFe2O4 microrods was an efficient approach to solve the heavy
   mass problem of the conventional hard/soft ferrite matrix microwave
   absorption materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Hybridized Power Panel to Simultaneously Generate Electricity from
   Sunlight, Raindrops, and Wind around the Clock}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{With the solar panels quickly spreading across the rooftops worldwide,
   solar power is now very popular. However, the output of the solar cell
   panels is highly dependent on weather conditions, making it rather
   unstable. Here, a hybridized power panel that can simultaneously
   generate power from sunlight, raindrop, and wind is proposed and
   demonstrated, when any or all of them are available in ambient
   environment. Without compromising the output performance and conversion
   efficiency of the solar cell itself, the presented hybrid cell can
   deliver an average output of 86 mW m(-2) from the water drops at a
   dripping rate of 13.6 mL s(-1), and an average output of 8 mW m(-2) from
   wind at a speed of 2.7 m s(-1), which is an innovative energy
   compensation to the common solar cells, especially in rainy seasons or
   at night. Given the compelling features, such as cost-effectiveness and
   a greatly expanded working time, the reported hybrid cell renders an
   innovative way to realize multiple kinds of energy harvesting and as an
   useful compensation to the currently widely used solar cells. The
   demonstrated concept here will possibly be adopted in a variety of
   circumstances and change the traditional way of solar energy harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-8 nm titanium oxynitride (TiON) nanoparticles were uniformly formed
   on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by annealing amorphous TiO2
   (a-TiO2) conformally coated CNTs (CNTs/a-TiO2) at 600 degrees C in
   ammonia gas. The novel CNTs/TiON nanocomposite was systematically
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy imaging (HRTEM), scanning transmission electron
   microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDX), and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that Ti, O, and N are
   homogeneously distributed in TiON nanoparticles. The specific
   capacitance of CNTs/TiON exhibits 187 F g(-1) at a current density of
   0.5 A g(-1), which is much higher than that of CNTs (33.4 F g(-1)) and
   CNTs/TiO2 (83.4 F g(-1)) obtained by annealing CNTs/a-TiO2 at 450
   degrees C in nitrogen gas. CNTs/TiON also exhibits enhanced cycle
   durability, which enables it to be considered as a promising candidate
   for supercapacitors.}},

   measurements. Least-squares (LS) is a commonly used method for the
   parameter estimation in the network reconstruction problems. The LS
   algorithm implicitly assumes that the measurement noise is confined only
   to the dependent variables. However, a discrete time model for the
   genetic network systems will lead to serially correlated noise terms
   that appear in both the dependent and independent variables. A
   constrained total least-squares algorithm (CTLS) used in signal and
   image processing applications showed significant improvements in such an
   estimation problem over the LS and total least-squares (TLS) methods. In
   this paper, we propose an extended CTLS algorithm that estimates
   parameters for all the dependent variables simultaneously, instead of
   estimating them separately for each dependent variable, as in the
   original CTLS algorithm. In addition, the CTLS algorithm is further
   generalized to assign weights to the error terms according to the
   variances or covariances of the measurement noise. We demonstrate its
   improved performance over the original CTLS method, as well as the
   commonly used LS and TLS methods on a widely adopted artificial genetic
   network example, under a variety of noise conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid room-temperature synthesis of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is
   highly desired for industrial implementation and commercialization. Here
   we find that a (Zn,Cu) hydroxy double salt (HDS) intermediate formed in
   situ from ZnO particles or thin films enables rapid growth (<1 min) of
   HKUST-1 (Cu-3(BTC)(2)) at room temperature. The space-time-yield reaches
   >3 X 10(4) kg.m(-3).d(-1), at least 1 order of magnitude greater than
   any prior report. The high anion exchange rate of (Zn,Cu) hydroxy
   nitrate HDS drives the ultrafast MOF formation. Similarly, we obtained
   Cu-BDC, ZIF-8, and IRMOE-3 structures from HDSs, demonstrating synthetic
   generality. Using ZnO thin films deposited via atomic layer deposition,
   MOP patterns are obtained on pre-patterned surfaces, and dense HKUST-1
   coatings are grown onto various form factors, including polymer spheres,
   silicon wafers, and fibers. Breakthrough tests show that the
   MOF-functionalized fibers have high adsorption capacity for toxic gases.
   This rapid synthesis route is also promising for new MOP-based composite
   materials and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Open-burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major source of PM
   emissions in developing world cities, but few studies have characterized
   this phenomenon at the city and intracity (neighborhood) scale relevant
   to human health impacts. This paper develops a consistent field method
   for measuring the spatial frequency of the incidence of MSW-burning and
   presents results in three neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status
   (SES) in Delhi, India, observed in winter and summer over 2 years. Daily
   MSW-burning incidents ranged from 24 to 130/km(2)-day during winter and
   5-87/km(2)-day during summer, with the highest intensity in low SES
   neighborhoods. Distinct seasonal and diurnal patterns are observed. The
   daily mass of MSW-burned was also estimated at 90-1170 kg/km(2)-day and
   13-1100 kg/km(2)-day in highest to low SES neighborhoods, in winter and
   summer, respectively. The scaled-up estimate of total MSW-burned for
   Delhi city ranged from 190 to 246 tons/day, about 2\%-3\% of total
   generated MSW; morning-burning contributed >65\% of the total. MSW
   composition varied systematically across neighborhoods and season. Agra
   had much higher MSW-burning (39-202 incidents/km(2)-day; 672-3485
   kg/km(2)-day) in the summer. The field method thus captures differences
   in MSW-burning across cities, neighborhoods, diurnally and seasonally,
   important for more fine grained air pollution modeling, and for
   tracking/monitoring policy effectiveness on-ground.}},

Abstract = {{Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) is a versatile motif widely present in
   adhesive proteins and signal-transducing receptors. The concave
   structure formed by a group of LRRs is thought to facilitate binding to
   globular protein domains with increased affinities. However, little is
   known about the conformational dynamics of LRRs in such a structure,
   e.g., whether and how force induces conformational changes in LRRs to
   regulate protein binding and signal transduction. Here we investigated
   the platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb alpha), a demonstrated
   mechanoreceptor with known crystal structures for the N-terminal domain
   (GPIb alpha N), as a model for LRR-containing proteins using a combined
   method of steered molecular dynamics simulations and single-molecule
   force spectroscopy with a biomembrane force probe. We found that
   force-induced unfolding of GPIb alpha N starts with LRR2-4 and
   propagates to other LRRs. Importantly, force-dependent lifetimes of
   individual VWF-A1 bonds with GPIb alpha are prolonged after LRR
   unfolding. Enhancement of protein-protein interactions by force-induced
   LRR unfolding may be a phenomenon of interest in biology.}},

   in optical band gap and increase in refractive index with increasing

Abstract = {{Fast pricing of American-style options has been a difficult problem
   since it was first introduced to the financial markets in 1970s,
   especially when the underlying stocks' prices follow some jump-diffusion
   processes. In this paper, we extend the true martingale algorithm'
   proposed by Belomestny et al. {[}Math. Finance, 2009, 19, 53-71] for the
   pure-diffusion models to the jump-diffusion models, to fast compute true
   tight upper bounds on the Bermudan option price in a non-nested
   simulation manner. By exploiting the martingale representation theorem
   on the optimal dual martingale driven by jump-diffusion processes, we
   are able to explore the unique structure of the optimal dual martingale
   and construct an approximation that preserves the martingale property.
   The resulting upper bound estimator avoids the nested Monte Carlo
   simulation suffered by the original primal-dual algorithm, therefore
   significantly improving the computational efficiency. Theoretical
   analysis is provided to guarantee the quality of the martingale
   approximation. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the
   efficiency of our algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Constrained Ranking and Selection (R\&S) aims to select the best system
   according to a primary performance measure, while also satisfying
   constraints on secondary performance measures. Several procedures have
   been proposed for constrained R\&S, but these procedures seek to
   minimize the number of samples required to choose the best constrained
   system without taking into account the setup costs incurred when
   switching between systems. We introduce a new procedure that minimizes
   the number of such switches, while still making a valid selection of the
   best constrained system. Analytical and experimental results show that
   the procedure is valid for independent systems and efficient in terms of
   total cost (incorporating both switching and sampling costs). We also
   inspect the use of the Common Random Numbers (CRN) approach to improve
   the efficiency of our new procedure. When implementing CRN, we see a
   significant decrease in the samples needed to identify the best
   constrained system, but this is sometimes achieved at the expense of a
   valid Probability of Correct Selection (PCS) due to the comparison of
   systems with an unequal number of samples. We propose four variance
   estimate modifications and show that their use within our new procedure

Abstract = {{We propose a new class of estimators for the asymptotic variance
   parameter of a stationary simulation output process. The estimators are
   based on Standardized Time Series (STS) functionals that converge to
   Brownian bridges that are themselves derived from appropriately
   reflected Brownian motions. The main result is that certain linear
   combinations of reflected estimators have substantially smaller
   variances than their constituents. We illustrate the performance of the
   new estimators via Monte Carlo experiments. These experiments show that
   the reflected estimators behave as expected and, in addition, perform
   better than certain competitors such as nonoverlapping batch means
   estimators and STS folded estimators.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical Informatics is a growing interdisciplinary field in which
   research topics and citation trends have been evolving rapidly in recent
   years. To analyze these data in a fast, reproducible manner, automation
   of certain processes is needed. JAMIA is a ``generalist{''} journal for
   biomedical informatics. Its articles reflect the wide range of topics in
   informatics. In this study, we retrieved Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
   terms and citations of JAMIA articles published between 2009 and 2014.
   We use tensors (i.e., multidimensional arrays) to represent the
   interaction among topics, time and citations, and applied tensor
   decomposition to automate the analysis. The trends represented by
   tensors were then carefully interpreted and the results were compared
   with previous findings based on manual topic analysis. A list of most
   cited JAMIA articles, their topics, and publication trends over recent
   years is presented. The analyses confirmed previous studies and showed
   that, from 2012 to 2014, the number of articles related to MeSH terms
   Methods, Organization \& Administration, and Algorithms increased
   significantly both in number of publications and citations. Citation
   trends varied widely by topic, with Natural Language Processing having a
   large number of citations in particular years, and Medical Record
   Systems, Computerized remaining a very popular topic in all years.}},

Abstract = {{Tin-based electrodes have attracted much attention because of their
   potential to offer high energy and power density while maitaining
   excellent cycling stability. Here we report our findings from the
   rational design and synthesis of a high-performance Cu6Sn5@SnO2-C
   electrode, a tin-based anode with a unique core/shell structure
   consisting of a tin-copper intermetallic (Cu6Sn5) core and a tin dioxide
   (SnO2)/carbon (C) shell. The hybrid structure was synthesized by a
   simple and cost-effective two-step process. When used as an electrode,
   the Cu6Sn5@SnO2-C hybrid nanocomposite demonstrated a reversible
   capacity of 619 mA h/g after 500 cycles between 0.05 and 3.0 V vs.
   Li/Li+ at 0.2 A/g, with stable capacities of similar to 300 mA h/g from
   the reversible conversion reaction of SnO2 in a potential range of
   1.1-2.0 V. Results suggest that the maximum volume change of the
   Cu6Sn5@SnO2-C electrode during cycling was relatively small (12.7\%) so
   that the Cu6Sn5 core components and the core/shell structure remained
   relatively stable over many cycles, leading to significantly enhanced
   reaction reversibility and cycling stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The identification of salt-dome boundaries in migrated seismic data
   volumes is important for locating petroleum reservoirs. The presence of
   noise in the data makes computer-aided salt-dome interpretation even
   more challenging. We have developed noise-robust algorithms that could
   label boundaries of salt domes effectively and efficiently. Our research
   is twofold. First, we used a texture-based gradient to accomplish
   salt-dome detection. We found that by using a dissimilarity measure
   based on the 2D discrete Fourier transform, the algorithm was capable of
   efficiently detecting salt-dome boundaries with accuracy. At the same
   time, our analysis determined that the proposed algorithm was robust to
   noise. Once the detection is performed for an initial 2D seismic
   section, we track the initial boundaries through the data volume to
   accomplish an efficient labeling process by avoiding the parameter
   tuning that would have been necessary if detection had been performed
   for every seismic section. The tracking process involves a tensor-based
   subspace learning process, in which we built texture tensors using
   patches from different seismic sections. To accommodate noise components
   with various levels in a texture tensor, we used noise-adjusted
   principal component analysis, so that principal components corresponding
   to greater signal-to-noise-ratio values might be selected for tracking.
   We validated our detection and tracking algorithms through experiments
   using seismic data sets acquired from the Netherlands offshore F3 block
   in the North Sea with very encouraging results.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriolytic enzymes often possess a C-terminal binding domain that
   recognizes specific motifs on the bacterial surface and a catalytic
   domain that cleaves covalent linkages within the cell wall
   peptidoglycan. PlyPH, one such lytic enzyme of bacteriophage origin, has
   been reported to be highly effective against Bacillus anthracis, and can
   kill up to 99.99\% of the viable bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
   this enzyme, however, appears to be strongly dependent on the age of the
   bacterial culture. Although highly bactericidal against cells in the
   early exponential phase, the enzyme is substantially less effective
   against stationary phase cells, thus limiting its application in
   real-world settings. We hypothesized that the binding domain of PlyPH
   may differ in affinity to cells in different Bacillus growth stages and
   may be primarily responsible for the age-restricted activity. We
   therefore employed an in silico approach to identify phage lysins
   differing in their specificity for the bacterial cell wall. Specifically
   we focused our attention on Ply, an enzyme with improved cell
   wall-binding ability and age-independent bactericidal activity. Although
   PlyPH and Ply have dissimilar binding domains, their catalytic domains
   are highly homologous. We characterized the biocatalytic mechanism of
   Ply by identifying the specific bonds cleaved within the cell wall
   peptidoglycan. Our results provide an example of the diversity of phage
   endolysins and the opportunity for these biocatalysts to be used for
   broad-based protection from bacterial pathogens. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Reactivation mechanism of natural fractures by hydraulic fracturing in

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing technique has been commonly used in the development
   of shale reservoir aiming to produce from complex network of fractures.
   One of the key parameters that affects the hydraulic fracture complexity
   is the natural fracture in the shale reservoir. Hydraulic fractures
   being trapped by natural fractures propagate non-planar fracture in
   three dimensions. Therefore, conventional hydraulic fracture model
   cannot include the non-planar characteristics of these fractures. In
   case a hydraulic fracture crosses a natural fracture, the dependence of
   the natural fracture reactivation on injection rate remains poorly
   understood. A non-planar propagation model for hydraulic fracturing in
   naturally fractured shale reservoirs was developed based on PKN model. A
   dynamic model was derived to calculate the stress intensity factor for a
   natural fracture being crossed by a hydraulic fracture based on the
   theory of rock fracture mechanics. Based on the experimental data from
   Longmaxi shale reservoir, the fluid pressure threshold to activate the
   natural fractures was obtained for different approaching angles. The
   effects of fluid pressure on the propagation angle of natural fracture
   were discussed. According to different initial injection rates and
   approaching angles, the time and minimum injection rate were determined
   to adjust the pump, which can improve the complexity of hydraulic
   fracture. True tri-axial hydraulic fracturing test with rapidly variable
   injection rate was conducted on the shale outcrop from Longmaxi
   formation. Experimental results proved that increasing the injection
   rate at the right time can reactivate the natural fractures, which can
   induce a network of fractures in shale reservoirs. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{The sinuous antenna is modified to improve its performance for
   ultrawideband (UWB) radar applications. The radiated waveforms in the
   time domain of typical sinuous antennas contain a long ringing tail
   after the chirp-like main pulse when excited by a temporally short
   pulse. The ringing is due to resonances that are set up on the antenna
   arms and are essentially eliminated by modifying the shape of the arms.
   The first modification removes the sharp ends where the arms terminate,
   and the second changes the shape of the arms where they bend. These
   modifications are also shown to improve the gain flatness of the
   antennas. Three representative sinuous antennas are fabricated, tested,
   and demonstrated in a monostatic radar experiment. The measured results
   clearly show the advantages of the improved antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Performance optimization of guided, gun-launched projectiles is a
   difficult task due to nonlinear flight behavior, complex aerodynamic
   interactions, and unique engineering constraints. Historically, the
   design process for many smart weapons has been iterative in which a
   series of design improvements are made until performance requirements
   have been met. This paper presents an alternative formal methodology for
   smart weapons conceptual airframe design and optimization based on
   design of experiments. At the initial stage, a basic aerobody shape is
   defined along with candidate control actuators and associated design
   parameters. Based on a design of experiments, a kriging response surface
   is generated mapping design variables to performance criteria.
   Simultaneously, a neural network is trained to recognize unstable
   designs. Finally, a genetic algorithm determines the optimal projectile
   design with respect to a predefined cost function. By varying this cost
   function, a Pareto frontier of optimal designs can be generated
   reflecting performance tradeoffs. A detailed description of the
   methodology is given, along with an example in which the fin
   configuration of a projectile is optimized based on multivariate
   criteria that seeks to maximize range and impact velocity while
   minimizing angle of attack. Results show that the proposed automated
   optimization process is a feasible and valuable tool for smart weapons
   conceptual airframe design.}},

Title = {{Premature deaths attributed to source-specific BC emissions in six urban
   US regions}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that exposure to particulate black carbon (BC)
   has significant adverse health effects and may be more detrimental to
   human health than exposure to PM2.5 as a whole. Mobile source BC
   emission controls, mostly on diesel-burning vehicles, have successfully
   decreased mobile source BC emissions to less than half of what they were
   30 years ago. Quantification of the benefits of previous emissions
   controls conveys the value of these regulatory actions and provides a
   method by which future control alternatives could be evaluated. In this
   study we use the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)
   model to estimate highly-resolved spatial distributions of benefits
   related to emission reductions for six urban regions within the
   continental US. Emissions from outside each of the six chosen regions
   account for between 7\% and 27\% of the premature deaths attributed to
   exposure to BC within the region. While we estimate that nonroad mobile
   and onroad diesel emissions account for the largest number of premature
   deaths attributable to exposure to BC, onroad gasoline is shown to have
   more than double the benefit per unit emission relative to that of
   nonroad mobile and onroad diesel. Within the region encompassing New
   York City and Philadelphia, reductions in emissions from large
   industrial combustion sources that are not classified as EGUs (i.e.,
   non-EGU) are estimated to have up to triple the benefits per unit
   emission relative to reductions to onroad diesel sectors, and provide
   similar benefits per unit emission to that of onroad gasoline emissions
   in the region. While onroad mobile emissions have been decreasing in the
   past 30 years and a majority of vehicle emission controls that regulate
   PM focus on diesel emissions, our analysis shows the most efficient
   target for stricter controls is actually onroad gasoline emissions.}},

Abstract = {{We address how feedback to a bursting biological pacemaker with
   intrinsic variability in cycle length can affect that variability.
   Specifically, we examine a hybrid circuit constructed of an isolated
   crab anterior burster (AB)/pyloric dilator (PD) pyloric pacemaker
   receiving virtual feedback via dynamic clamp. This virtual feedback
   generates artificial synaptic input to PD with timing determined by
   adjustable phase response dynamics that mimic average burst intervals
   generated by the lateral pyloric neuron (LP) in the intact pyloric
   network. Using this system, we measure network period variability
   dependence on the feedback element's phase response dynamics and find
   that a constant response interval confers minimum variability. We
   further find that these optimal dynamics are characteristic of the
   biological pyloric network. Building upon our previous theoretical work
   mapping the firing intervals in one cycle onto the firing intervals in
   the next cycle, we create a theoretical map of the distribution of all
   firing intervals in one cycle to the distribution of firing intervals in
   the next cycle. We then obtain an integral equation for a stationary
   self-consistent distribution of the network periods of the hybrid
   circuit, which can be solved numerically given the uncoupled pacemaker's
   distribution of intrinsic periods, the nature of the network's feedback,
   and the phase resetting characteristics of the pacemaker. The stationary
   distributions obtained in this manner are strongly predictive of the
   experimentally observed distributions of hybrid network period. This
   theoretical framework can provide insight into optimal feedback schemes
   for minimizing variability to increase reliability or maximizing
   variability to increase flexibility in central pattern generators driven
   by pacemakers with feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanofibril (CNF) aerogels with grafted beta-cyclodextrin
   (beta-CD) were prepared for the adsorption of phenol pollutants from
   water. Compared with regular wood fibers, CNF aerogel not only can
   immobilize more beta-CDs, but also it provides higher porosity and a
   larger specific surface area for phenol absorption. The CNF-CD aerogel
   becomes mechanically robust through chemical crosslinking. It can be
   easily separated from water after adsorbing phenol pollutants without
   complicated centrifugation or filtration. A series of studies on phenol
   adsorption was conducted. The results indicated that the CNF-CD aerogel
   prepared with a suspension concentration of 3\% (w/w) had the highest
   adsorption capability. In addition, the CNF-CD aerogel showed an
   excellent reusability. The results indicated that the CNF-CD aerogel is
   an environmentally friendly and promising adsorbent for removing phenol
   pollutants from water.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The traditional power grid in many countries suffers from high
   maintenance costs and scalability issues along with the huge expense of
   building new power stations, and lack of efficient system monitoring
   that could increase the overall performance by acting proactively in
   preventing potential failures. To address these problems, a
   next-generation electric power system, called the smart grid (SG), has
   been proposed as an evolutionary system for power generation,
   transmission, and distribution. To this end, the SGs utilize renewable
   energy generation, smart meters and modern sensing and communication
   technologies for effective power system management, and hence,
   succeeding in addressing many of the requirements of a modern power grid
   system while significantly increase its performance. Recently, wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) have been recognized as a promising technology to
   achieve seamless, energy efficient, reliable, and low-cost remote
   monitoring and control in SG applications. In these systems, the
   required information can be provided to electric utilities by wireless
   sensor systems to enable them to achieve high system efficiency. The
   real-time information gathered from these sensors can be analyzed to
   diagnose problems early and serve as a basis for taking remedial action.
   In this paper, first WSN-based SG applications have been explored along
   with their technical challenges. Then, design challenges and protocol
   objectives have been discussed for WSN-based SG applications. After
   exploring applications and design challenges, communication protocols
   for WSN-based SG applications have been explained in detail. Here, our
   goal is to elaborate on the role of WSNs for smart grid applications and
   to provide an overview of the most recent advances in MAC and routing
   protocols for WSNs in this timely and exciting field. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Time-dependent gate dielectric breakdown (TDDB) is a leading reliability
   concern for modern microprocessors. In this paper, a framework is
   proposed to analyze the impact of TDDB on state-of-art microprocessors
   and to estimate microprocessor lifetimes due to TDDB. Our methodology
   finds the detailed electrical stress and temperature of each device
   within a microprocessor system running a variety of standard benchmarks.
   Combining the electrical stress profiles, thermal profiles, and
   device-level models, we perform timing analysis on the critical paths of
   a microprocessor using our methodology to characterize microprocessor
   performance degradation due to TDDB and to estimate the lifetime
   distribution of logic blocks. In addition, we study DC noise margins in
   conventional 6T SRAM cells as a function of TDDB degradation to estimate
   memory lifetime distributions. The lifetimes of memory blocks are then
   combined with the lifetimes of logic blocks to provide an estimate of
   the system lifetime distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{During clot formation, platelets are subjected to various different
   signals and cues as they dynamically interact with extracellular matrix
   proteins such as von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibrin(ogen) and collagen.
   While the downstream signaling of platelet-ligand interactions is
   well-characterized, biophysical cues, such as hydrodynamic forces and
   mechanical stiffness of the underlying substrate, also mediate these
   interactions and affect the binding kinetics of platelets to these
   proteins. Recent studies have observed that, similar to nucleated cells,
   platelets mechanosense their microenvironment and exhibit dynamic
   physiologic responses to biophysical cues. This review discusses how
   platelet mechanosensing is affected by the hydrodynamic forces that
   dictate vWF-platelet interactions and fibrin polymerization and network
   formation. The similarities and differences in mechanosensing between
   platelets and nucleated cells and integrin-mediated platelet
   mechanosensing on both fibrin(ogen) and collagen are then reviewed.
   Further studies investigating how platelets interact with the mechanical
   microenvironment will improve our overall understanding of the
   hemostatic process. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental study on pressure
   drop during condensation of refrigerant blends R404A and R410A at
   near-critical pressures inside tubes of 0.76 <= D <= 9.4 mm. Local
   frictional pressure gradients were measured at reduced pressures (P-r)
   of 0.8 and 0.9 for the mass flux range 200 <= G <= 800 kg m(-2) s(-1),
   in small quality increments. The data were compared with adiabatic and
   diabatic two-phase pressure drop correlations from the literature. These
   correlations were not able to adequately predict the pressure drop over
   the range of tube sizes and mass fluxes under consideration here at high
   reduced pressures. A new correlation for pressure drop is introduced,
   which accounts for property variations and microchannel effects. The
   correlation predicts 85\% of the data within +/- 25\%, with an average
   deviation between model predictions and data of +/- 14\%. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Controlled interactions between fluidic actuators and the cross flow
   over the aft end of a wire-mounted axisymmetric wind tunnel bluff body
   model (Re-D=2.3.10(5)) are exploited for modification of the near wake
   dynamics, and the consequent global aerodynamic loads. Actuation is
   effected using an array of four aft-facing synthetic jet modules through
   narrow, azimuthally-segmented slots that are equally distributed around
   the perimeter of the tail end. The model is supported by eight wires,
   each including a miniature inline force transducer for measurements of
   the time-resolved tension. The model's position is varied in a
   prescribed trajectory by synchronous activation of shape memory alloy
   (SMA) segments in each of the mounting wires, and the aerodynamic forces
   and moments are manipulated over a range of pitch attitude. The
   effectiveness of the flow control approach is demonstrated by decoupling
   of the wake response from the body's pitch motion at a low pitch
   frequency (k=0.013). It is shown that, under the active control, the
   wake symmetry can be restored or its asymmetry can be amplified. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents the PolyTop++, an efficient and modular framework
   for parallel structural topology optimization using polygonal meshes. It
   consists of a C++ and CUDA (a parallel computing model for GPUs)
   alternative implementations of the PolyTop code by Talischi et al.
   (Struct Multidiscip Optim 45(3):329-357 2012b). PolyTop++ was designed
   to support both CPU and GPU parallel solutions. The software takes
   advantage of the C++ programming language and the CUDA model to design
   algorithms with efficient memory management, capable of solving
   large-scale problems, and uses its object-oriented flexibility in order
   to provide a modular scheme. We describe our implementation of different
   solvers for the finite element analysis, including both direct and
   iterative solvers, and an iterative `matrix-free' solver; these were all
   implemented in serial and parallel modes, including a GPU version.
   Finally, we present numerical results for problems with about 40 million
   degrees of freedom both in 2D and 3D.}},

Abstract = {{One of the greatest problems facing transit agencies that operate
   high-frequency routes is maintaining stable headways and avoiding bus
   bunching. In this work, a real-time holding mechanism is proposed to
   dispatch buses on a loop-shaped route using real-time information. Holds
   are applied at one or several control points to minimize passenger
   waiting time while maintaining the highest possible frequency, i.e.
   using no buffer time. The bus dispatching problem is formulated as a
   stochastic decision process. The optimality equations are derived and
   the optimal holding policy is found by backward induction. A control
   method that requires much less information and that closely approximates
   the optimal dispatching policy is found. A simulation assuming
   stochastic operating conditions and unstable headway dynamics is
   performed to assess the expected average waiting time of passengers at
   stations. The proposed control strategy is found to provide lower
   passenger waiting time and better resiliency than methods used in
   practice and recommended in the literature. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Growing congestion is a problem faced by cities around the world.
   Traditional solutions considered include new capital works to increase
   network capacity and expanding public transport offerings to make public
   transport more attractive. Dynamic ridesharing is a recent alternative
   in which people with similar travel plans are matched and travel
   together. Dynamic ridesharing requires no new network infrastructure and
   offers more convenience than public transport. The (long-term) success
   of ridesharing schemes, however, depends on their ability to attract a
   large number of users. We investigate the benefits, complexities, and
   costs of employing a small number of dedicated drivers to serve riders
   who would otherwise remain unmatched. An extensive computational study
   demonstrates the potential benefits of dedicated drivers and identifies
   environments in which dedicated drivers are most useful. (C) 2015

   mainly on two dimensionless parameters: the mean block length to green
   ratio and the mean red to green ratio. The theory is validated with an

Abstract = {{The composition of aerosol from cloud droplets differs from that below
   cloud. Its implications for the Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) activity
   are the focus of this study. Water-soluble organic matter from below
   cloud, and cloud droplet residuals off the coast of Monterey, California
   were collected; offline chemical composition, CCN activity and surface
   tension measurements coupled with Kohler Theory Analysis are used to
   infer the molar volume and surfactant characteristics of organics in
   both samples. Based on the surface tension depression of the samples, it
   is unlikely that the aerosol contains strong surfactants. The activation
   kinetics for all samples examined are consistent with rapid (NH4)(2)SO4
   calibration aerosol. This is consistent with our current understanding
   of droplet kinetics for ambient CCN. However, the carbonaceous material
   in cloud drop residuals is far more hygroscopic than in sub-cloud
   aerosol, suggestive of the impact of cloud chemistry on the hygroscopic
   properties of organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Algal biofuels are investigated as a promising alternative to petroleum
   fuel sources to satisfy transportation demand. Despite the high growth
   rate of algae, predation by rotifers, ciliates, golden algae, and other
   predators will cause an algae in open ponds to crash. In this study,
   Chlorella kessleri was used as a model alga and the freshwater rotifer,
   Brachionus calyciflorus, as a model predator. The goal of this study was
   to test the selective toxicity of the chemical, quinine sulfate (QS), on
   both the alga and the rotifer in order to fully inhibit the rotifer
   while minimizing its impact on algal growth. The QS LC50 for B.
   calyciflorus was 17 mu M while C. kessleri growth was not inhibited at
   concentrations <25 mu M. In co-culture, complete inhibition of rotifers
   was observed when the QS concentration was 7.7 mu M, while algal growth
   was not affected. QS applications to produce 1 million gallons of
   biodiesel in one year are estimated to be \$0.04/gallon or similar to
   1\% of Bioenergy Technologies Office's (BETO) projected cost of \$5/gge
   (gallon gasoline equivalent). This provides algae farmers an important
   tool to manage grazing predators in algae mass cultures and avoid pond

Abstract = {{Hybrid wing-body configurations are currently an active field of
   research as potential candidates to meet NASA Environmentally
   Responsible Aviation N + 2 goals. One characteristic of these
   configurations is the presence of a large number of redundant flight
   control surfaces. However, the design process and decision rationale for
   a given control surface layout is rarely discussed in the open
   literature. This work investigated tradeoffs between drag, control
   authority, actuator weight, and actuation power requirements as a
   function of the number and spacing of elevons. The actuators were sized
   based on hinge moments computed during nominal and failed control flight
   conditions. These effects were propagated upward to estimate changes to
   fuel burn, a system-level metric important to the Environmentally
   Responsible Aviation program, via the Breguet range equation. A model of
   the NASA N2A-EXTE hybrid wing-body configuration concept was used to
   demonstrate these tradeoffs. The study concluded that adjacent elevons
   could be combined to achieve reductions in weight, power usage, and fuel
   burn. This resulted in a reduced number of elevons from the baseline and
   unequal span fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The high degree of complexity and uncertainty associated with aerospace
   engineering applications has driven systems analysts toward the use of
   probabilistic and statistical analysis tools in order to understand and
   design for that uncertainty. Common themes in aerospace applications of
   probabilistic theory include the assumed independence of random
   variables and the arbitrary or unjustified use of certain probability
   distributions to represent random variables. These incorrect assumptions
   are often unknowingly used in systems analysis and can lead to
   inaccuracies in uncertainty quantification, poor decision making, and
   flawed designs. Copulas theory can be used in conjunction with the
   inversion method to mitigate both of these concerns while improving the
   accuracy of probabilistic assessments and enabling decision makers to
   better represent the uncertainty associated with the problem at hand.
   This paper provides a basic introduction of copulas to the aerospace
   audience with a focus on the needs of the practitioner. We provide a
   method for the selection of copulas and also demonstrate where copulas
   can be applied through three representative applications of copulas in a
   canonical airplane performance analysis problem.}},

Abstract = {{In flight estimations of helicopter mass and center of gravity are
   critical for health and lifecycle maintenance, flight control system
   feedback, and mission planning. This paper explores the use of an
   extended state observer for online estimation of helicopter mass and
   center-of-gravity location. The core algorithm is a nonlinear observer
   that offers provable stability properties. After describing the
   methodology, it is applied to a simulation of a commercial
   radio-controlled microcoaxial helicopter. Monte Carlo trade studies
   employing a comprehensive rotorcraft flight dynamics model are used to
   assess the algorithm's estimation accuracy in the presence of model and
   measurement errors. Results show the helicopter mass, longitudinal
   center-of-gravity location, and lateral center-of-gravity location are
   estimated accurately in the presence of expected errors. The vertical
   center-of-gravity position is more difficult to estimate due to its
   limited observability during typical maneuvers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of aircraft featuring truss-braced wing
   configurations that have been optimized for minimum fuel consumption
   using multidisciplinary design optimization. The investigation proceeds
   following an earlier Boeing Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research N + 3
   study, which selected the truss-braced wing concept as the most
   promising of several N + 3 concept vehicles. This comes from the fact
   that a significantly higher-aspect-ratio wing could achieve substantial
   reductions in induced drag but requires major structural changes to
   support such a large span. This problem was explored through the use of
   a multidisciplinary design and analysis environment implemented in Model
   Center (R). Optimization was performed using ModelCenter's Design
   Explorer and Darwin genetic algorithm optimizers. Using the
   multidisciplinary environment, a large multidimensional design space,
   featuring design variables spread across the major aircraft design
   disciplines, was explored. Configurations featuring a strut-braced wing
   and truss-braced wings with one and two juries were evaluated for
   different span limits. Subsequently, different laminar wing design
   options were investigated in conjunction with lift augmentation system
   options. The multidisciplinary optimization used for this investigation
   was able to produce candidate designs with the desired attributes and
   performance improvements while satisfying all relevant geometric and
   performance constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of micro-texture below the machined surface is
   computationally modeled and experimentally verified. The orientation
   distribution functions of the grains below the surface were represented
   in spectral form. The microstructure descriptor coefficients were
   derived, and their change with respect to the change in the cutting feed
   rate was computationally calculated and monitored. Micro-texture
   experimental observations conducted by electron back-scatter diffraction
   technique verify the modeling outputs. Continuation of changing the
   process parameter was done by finite element method, and the evolution
   in texture was investigated by computational modeling. The process path
   function which correlates micro-texture evolution and cutting feed rate,
   was obtained by applying the principle of orientation conservation in
   the Euler space. As a result of the major finding of this work, i.e.,
   derivation of process path functions, the evolution of texture as a
   function of the material feed rate is numerically determined without any
   need to texture modeling or finite element analyses.}},

Abstract = {{As animals vocalize, their vocal organ transforms motor commands into
   vocalizations for social communication. In birds, the physical
   mechanisms by which vocalizations are produced and controlled remain
   unresolved because of the extreme difficulty in obtaining in vivo
   measurements. Here, we introduce an ex vivo preparation of the avian
   vocal organ that allows simultaneous high-speed imaging, muscle
   stimulation and kinematic and acoustic analyses to reveal the mechanisms
   of vocal production in birds across a wide range of taxa. Remarkably, we
   show that all species tested employ the myoelastic-aerodynamic (MEAD)
   mechanism, the same mechanism used to produce human speech. Furthermore,
   we show substantial redundancy in the control of key vocal parameters ex
   vivo, suggesting that in vivo vocalizations may also not be specified by
   unique motor commands. We propose that such motor redundancy can aid
   vocal learning and is common to MEAD sound production across birds and
   mammals, including humans.}},

   concept of integrating the self-powered triboelectric microfluidic
   nanosensor (TMN) with mu TAS, but also demonstrate that the developed
   system can be used as an in situ tool to quantify the flowing liquid for
   microfluidics and solution chemistry. The TMN automatically generates
   electric outputs when the fluid passing through it and the outputs are
   affected by the solution temperature, polarity, ionic concentration, and
   fluid flow velocity. The self-powered TMN can detect the flowing water
   velocity, position, reaction temperature, ethanol, and salt
   concentrations. We also integrate the TMNs in a mu TAS platform to
   directly characterize the synthesis of Au nanoparticles by a chemical

Abstract = {{We report a MAPbI(3)-based self-powered photodetector (SPPD). It has a
   dual sensing mechanism that relies on the joint properties of a
   photoelectric effect and a triboelectric effect of the perovskite
   material. Both the photoconductivity and the surface triboelectric
   density of the MAPbI(3)-based composite thin film are significantly
   altered upon solar illumination, which results in considerable reduction
   of the output voltage. The SPPD exhibits excellent responsivity (7.5 V
   W-1), rapid response time (<80 ms), great repeatability, and broad
   detection range that extends from UV to visible regions. This work
   presents a route to designing high-performance self-powered
   photodetectors from the aspect of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Bone tissue has a remarkable ability to regenerate and heal itself.
   However, large bone defects and complex fractures still present a
   significant challenge to the medical community. Current treatments
   center on metal implants for structural and mechanical support and auto-
   or allo-grafts to substitute long bone defects. Metal implants are
   associated with several complications such as implant loosening and
   infections. Bone grafts suffer from donor site morbidity, reduced
   bioactivity, and risk of pathogen transmission. Surgical implants can be
   modified to provide vital biological cues, growth factors and cells in
   order to improve osseointegration and repair of bone defects. Here we
   review strategies and technologies to engineer metal surfaces to promote
   osseointegration with the host tissue. We also discuss strategies for
   modifying implants for cell adhesion and bone growth via integrin
   signaling and growth factor and cytokine delivery for bone defect
   repair. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation of waste vibration energy into low-power electricity
   has been heavily researched over the last decade to enable
   self-sustained wireless electronic components. Monostable and bistable
   nonlinear oscillators have been explored by several research groups in
   an effort to enhance the frequency bandwidth of operation. Linear
   two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) configurations as well as the combination
   of a nonlinear single-DOF harvester with a linear oscillator to
   constitute a nonlinear 2-DOF harvester have also been explored to
   develop broadband energy harvesters. In the present work, the concept of
   nonlinear internal resonance in a continuous frame structure is explored
   for broadband energy harvesting. The L-shaped beam-mass structure with
   quadratic nonlinearity was formerly studied in the nonlinear dynamics
   literature to demonstrate modal energy exchange and the saturation
   phenomenon when carefully tuned for two-to-one internal resonance. In
   the current effort, piezoelectric coupling and an electrical load are
   introduced, and electromechanical equations of the L-shaped energy
   harvester are employed to explore primary resonance behaviors around the
   first and the second linear natural frequencies for bandwidth
   enhancement. Simulations using approximate analytical frequency response
   equations as well as numerical solutions reveal significant bandwidth
   enhancement as compared to a typical linear 2-DOF counterpart. Vibration
   and voltage responses are explored, and the effects of various system
   parameters on the overall dynamics of the internal resonance-based
   energy harvesting system are reported.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6, 2}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the safety assessment of a grounding system at an
   indoor-type 161/23.9-kV substation based on voltage-dependent body
   resistance. For a grounding system to be safe, the maximum actual touch
   and step voltages should not exceed postulated safety criteria. Thus,
   the safety assessment of a grounding system is referred to a procedure
   by which the actual maximum touch and step voltages are computed and
   compared to the maximum allowable (safe) touch and step voltages. The
   safety criteria in terms of allowable body current have been defined by
   two widely accepted standards, i.e., the IEEE Std. 80 and the IEC
   60479-1. Then, the allowable body current is translated into the
   allowable touch and step voltages. However, the two standards differ in
   their definitions of body resistance. The IEC 6047-1 provides data for
   the body resistance as a function of body voltage and data for the body
   resistance as a function of path, while the IEEE Std. 80 uses a constant
   value of 1000 Omega for the body resistance. Thus, a comparison of
   allowable touch and step voltages computed by these two standards is
   included in this study.}},

Title = {{The effect of noncondensables on buoyancy-thermocapillary convection of
   volatile fluids in confined geometries}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{678-688}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent experimental studies have shown that buoyancy-thermocapillary
   convection in a layer of volatile liquid subjected to a horizontal
   temperature gradient is strongly affected by the presence of
   noncondensable gases, such as air. Specifically, it was found that
   removing most of the air from a sealed cavity containing the liquid and
   its vapors significantly alters the flow structure and, in particular,
   suppresses transitions between the different convection patterns found
   at atmospheric conditions. Yet, at the same time, the concentration of
   noncondensables has almost no effect on the flow speeds in the liquid
   layer, at least for the parameter range studied in the experiments. To
   understand these results, we have formulated and numerically implemented
   a detailed model that accounts for mass and heat transport in both
   phases as well as the phase change at the interface. The predictions of
   this model, which assumes that the gas phase is dominated by either
   noncondensables or the vapor, agree well with experiments in both
   limits. Furthermore, we find that noncondensables have a large effect on
   the flow at concentrations even as low as 1\%, i.e., values much lower
   than those achieved in experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We describe an automated, volumetric particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   and tracking method that measures time-resolved, 3D zooplankton
   trajectories and surrounding volumetric fluid velocity fields
   simultaneously and non-intrusively. The method is demonstrated for
   groups of copepods flowing past a wall-mounted cylinder. We show that
   copepods execute escape responses when subjected to a strain rate
   threshold upstream of a cylinder, but the same threshold range elicits
   no escape responses in the turbulent wake downstream. The method was
   also used to document the instantaneous slip velocity of zooplankton and
   the resulting differences in trajectory between zooplankton and
   non-inertial fluid particles in the unsteady wake flow, showing the
   method's capability to quantify drift for both passive and motile
   organisms in turbulent environments. Applications of the method extend
   to any group of organisms interacting with the surrounding fluid
   environment, where organism location, larger-scale eddies and
   smaller-scale fluid deformation rates can all be tracked and analyzed.}},

Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{3551-3558}},

Abstract = {{The remora fishes are capable of adhering to a wide variety of natural
   and artificial marine substrates using a dorsal suction pad. The pad is
   made of serial parallel pectinated lamellae, which are homologous to the
   dorsal fin elements of other fishes. Small tooth-like projections of
   mineralized tissue from the dorsal pad lamella, known as spinules, are
   thought to increase the remora's resistance to slippage and thereby
   enhance friction to maintain attachment to a moving host. In this work,
   the geometry of the spinules and host topology as determined by
   micro-computed tomography and confocal microscope data, respectively,
   are combined in a friction model to estimate the spinule contribution to
   shear resistance. Model results are validated with natural and
   artificially created spinules and compared with previous remora pull-off
   experiments. It was found that spinule geometry plays an essential role
   in friction enhancement, especially at short spatial wavelengths in the
   host surface, and that spinule tip geometry is not correlated with
   lamellar position. Furthermore, comparisons with pull-off experiments
   suggest that spinules are primarily responsible for friction enhancement
   on rough host topologies such as shark skin.}},

   tractable, quantitative methods to test hypotheses of redox mechanisms
   that may be simultaneously operative during signal transduction. The
   interleukin-4 (IL-4) pathway, which has previously been reported to
   induce reactive oxygen species and oxidation of PTP1B, may be controlled
   by several other putative mechanisms of redox regulation; widespread
   proteomic thiol oxidation observed via 2D redox differential gel
   electrophoresis upon IL-4 treatment suggests more than one
   redox-sensitive protein implicated in this pathway. Through
   computational modeling and a model selection strategy that relied on
   characteristic STAT6 phosphorylation dynamics of IL-4 signaling, we
   identified reversible protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) oxidation as
   the primary redox regulatory mechanism in the pathway. A systems-level
   model of IL-4 signaling was developed that integrates synchronous
   pan-PTP oxidation with ROS-independent mechanisms. The model
   quantitatively predicts the dynamics of IL-4 signaling over a broad
   range of new redox conditions, offers novel hypotheses about regulation
   of JAK/STAT signaling, and provides a framework for interrogating
   putative mechanisms involving receptor-initiated oxidation.}},

   Frameworks: A Model System for Understanding Ligand Effects}},

Abstract = {{Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials with highly
   tunable properties that make them ideal for a wide array of adsorption
   applications. Through careful choice of metal and ligand precursors, one
   can target the specific functionality and pore characteristics desired
   for the application of interest. However, among the wide array of MOFs
   reported in the literature, there are varying trends in the effects that
   ligand identity has on the adsorption, chemical stability, and intrinsic
   framework dynamics of the material. This is largely due to ligand
   effects being strongly coupled with structural properties arising from
   the differing topologies among frameworks. Given the important role such
   properties play in dictating adsorbent performance, understanding these
   effects will be critical for the design of next generation functional
   materials.
   Pillared MOFs are ideal platforms for understanding how ligand
   properties can affect the adsorption, stability, and framework dynamics
   in MOFs. In this Account, we highlight our recent work demonstrating how
   experiment and simulation can be used to understand the important role
   ligand identity plays in governing the properties of isostructural MOFs
   containing interconnected layers pillared by bridging ligands. Changing
   the identity of the linear, ditopic ligand in either the 2-D layer or
   the pillaring third dimension allows targeted modulation of the chemical
   functionality, porosity, and interpenetration of the framework. We will
   discuss how these characteristics can have important consequences on the
   adsorption, chemical stability, and dynamic properties of pillared MOFs.
   The structures discussed in this Account comprise the greatest diversity
   of isostructural MOFs whose stability properties have been studied,
   allowing valuable insight into how ligand properties dictate the
   chemical stability of isostructural frameworks. We also discuss how
   functional groups can affect adsorbate energetics at their most
   favorable adsorption sites to elucidate how functional groups can affect
   the adsorptive performance of these materials in ways that are
   unexpected based on the isolated ligand's properties. We then highlight
   a variety of simulation tools that not only can be used to understand
   the differing molecular-level behavior of the adsorbate and framework
   dynamics within these isostructural MOFs, but also can shed light on
   possible mechanisms that govern the differing chemical stability
   properties among these materials. Lastly, we provide perspective on the
   challenges and opportunities for utilizing the structure property
   relationships arising from the ligand effects described in this Account
   for the design of further MOFs with enhanced chemical stability and
   adsorption properties.}},

Abstract = {{Spectroscopic analysis of large biomolecules is critical in a number of
   applications, including medical diagnostics and label-free biosensing.
   Recently, it has been shown that the Raman spectroscopy of proteins can
   be used to diagnose several diseases, including a few types of cancer.
   The development of the assays based on surface enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS), which are suitable for large biomolecules, could
   lead to a substantial decrease in the amount of specimen necessary for
   these experiments. We present a new method to achieve high local field
   enhancement in SERS, through the simultaneous adjustment of the lattice
   plasmons and localized surface plasmon polaritons, in a periodic bilayer
   nanoantenna array resulting in a high enhancement factor over the
   sensing area, with relatively high uniformity. The proposed plasmonic
   nanostructure is comprised of two interacting nanoantenna layers,
   providing a sharp band-edge lattice plasmon mode and a wide-band
   localized surface plasmon for the separate enhancement of the pump and
   emitted Raman signals. We demonstrate the application of the proposed
   nanostructure for the spectral analysis of large biomolecules by binding
   a protein (streptavidin) selectively on the hot spots between the two
   stacked layers, using a low concentration solution (100 nM), and we
   successfully acquire its SERS spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{The collective oscillation of the massless electrons in graphene ribbons
   can interact with photons to create graphene plasmon polaritons. The
   resonance-induced absorption is critical in signal detection and energy
   harvesting applications. However, because of their atomic thickness,
   high absorptance is difficult to achieve with graphene ribbons alone. In
   this work, a hybrid plasmonic system composed of an array of graphene
   ribbons over a periodic metal grating is theoretically investigated. It
   is shown that the localized resonances, that is, magnetic polaritons, in
   metal gratings can couple with the plasmonic resonance in graphene
   ribbons, resulting in significantly enhanced absorption in graphene.
   Moreover, the coupling phenomenon depends on the width of the ribbons
   and the relative positions of the ribbon and the grating. The coupling
   between the grating and a continuous graphene monolayer sheet is also
   investigated and the results are compared to those with graphene
   ribbons. The findings of this work may facilitate the design of
   optoelectronic devices and metamaterials structures based on hybrid
   nanostructures and graphene.}},

Abstract = {{With continued technology scaling and increased power and thermal

   mitigate these effects must be based on a profound understanding of how

   introduce an integrated power, thermal, and reliability modeling

   microarchitectures, and various physical phenomena, including energy,
   power, thermal, cooling, and reliability. The KitFox framework
   implements a standard interface to bridge multiple physical models,

   significantly degrade the clock signal, a key signal in digital systems,
   which in turn degrades system performance. In this paper, we investigate
   the effect of thermal gradients on the clock distribution network in the

   power-efficient compensation methods for minimizing temperature-induced
   skew using the thermoelectrical analysis and use them to design a custom

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss three different design criteria for a
   distributed antenna system (DAS). They include maximizing throughput
   under the constraint of the overall transmit power, minimizing the
   overall transmit power while guaranteeing the minimum spectral
   efficiency (SE) requirements, and maximizing energy efficiency (EE)
   under the constraints of minimum SE requirements and overall transmit
   power. The optimization problems for the first two criteria are
   signomial programming (SP) problems when considering the interference
   among the mobile stations (MSs), which are nonlinear nonconvex and do
   not lead to the closed-form solutions directly. Exploiting the nature of
   geometric mean, we transform the SP problems into geometric programming
   (GP) problems, which can be solved by turning them into convex problems.
   For the third criterion, using the theorem of fractional programming, we
   first transform the fractional optimization problem into an equivalent
   optimization problem in a subtractive form, which is an SP problem. We
   then obtain its solution by transforming the SP to the GP problem as we
   have done for the previous two problems. Based on these design criteria,
   three power allocation algorithms are developed for the downlink
   multiuser DAS. Depending on the application environments, we can use the
   first and second criteria to achieve the highest throughput and to save
   energy, respectively, while balancing throughput and energy consumption
   using the third criterion.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study was carried out for absorptance of light with
   wavelength in the range of 400-900 nm at normal incidence on a 3-layer
   plasmonic metamaterial, consisting of an array of Au nanoshell
   structures on the top and a Au layer at the bottom with a Al2O3 layer in
   between. The Finite-difference time-domain method with appropriate
   dielectric functions is used to obtain numerical results for the
   absorptance of light in the plasmonic metamaterial. It was found that
   the geometric configuration of the nanoshell could change the wavelength
   of the surface plasmon resonance without lowering the absorptance. The
   core material in the nanoshell has little effect on absorptance or on
   the resonance wavelength. The distance between nanoshells affects
   absorptance greatly but affects plasmon resonance wavelength only
   slightly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of ionophores as antiparasitic drugs plays an important role in
   US poultry production, especially in the broiler (Gallus gallus
   domesticus) industry. However, administered ionophores can pass through
   the bird's digestive system and appear in broiler litter, which, when
   applied to agricultural fields, can present an environmental hazard.
   Stacking (storing or stockpiling) broiler litter for some time might
   decrease the litter ionophore concentrations before land application.
   Because ionophores undergo abiotic hydrolysis at low pH, decreasing
   litter pH with acidic aluminum sulfate (alum) might also decrease
   ionophore concentrations. We assessed the change in ionophore
   concentrations in broiler litter in response to the length of time
   broiler litter was stored (stacking time) and alum addition. We spiked
   broiler litter with monensin and salinomycin, placed alum-amended litter
   (similar to pH 4-5) and unamended litter (similar to pH 8-9) into
   1.8-m(3) bins, and repeatedly sampled each bin for 112 d. Our findings
   showed that stacking broiler litter alone did not have an impact on
   monensin concentration, but it did slowly reduce salinomycin
   concentration by 55\%. Adding alum to broiler litter reduced monensin
   concentration by approximately 20\% relative to unamended litter, but it
   did not change salinomycin concentration. These results call for
   continued search for alternative strategies that could potentially
   reduce the concentration of ionophores in broiler litter before their
   application to agricultural soils.}},

Abstract = {{We used the differential stress-induced damage (DSID) model to predict
   anisotropic crack propagation under tensile and shear stress. The damage
   variable is similar to a crack density tensor. The damage function and
   the damage potential are expressed as functions of the energy release
   rate, defined as the thermodynamic force that is work-conjugate to
   damage. Contrary to the previous damage models, flow rules are obtained
   by deriving dissipation functions by the energy release rate, and
   thermodynamic consistency is ensured. The damage criterion is adapted
   from the Drucker-Prager yield function. Simulations of biaxial stress
   tests showed that: (1) three-dimensional states of damage can be
   obtained for three-dimensional states of stress; (2) no damage
   propagates under isotropic compression; (3) crack planes propagate in
   the direction parallel to major compression stress; (4) damage
   propagation hardens the material; (5) stiffness and deformation
   anisotropy result from the anisotropy of damage. There is no one-to-one
   relationship between stress and damage. We demonstrated the effect of
   the loading sequence in a two-step simulation (a shear loading phase and
   a compression loading phase): the current state of stress and damage can
   be used to track the effect of stress history on damage rotation. We
   finally conducted a sensitivity analysis with the finite element method,
   to explore the stress conditions in which damage is expected to rotate
   around a circular cavity subject to pressurization or depressurization.
   Simulation results showed that: (1) before damage initiation, the DSID
   model matches the analytical solution of stress distribution obtained
   with the theory of elasticity; (2) the DSID model can predict the extent
   of the tensile damage zone at the crown, and that of the compressive
   damage zone at the sidewalls; (3) damage generated during a vertical
   far-field compression followed by a depressurization of the cavity is
   more intense than that generated during a depressurization of the cavity
   followed by a vertical far-field compression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to gain fundamental understanding of the microscopic
   mechanisms that control the transition between secondary and tertiary
   creep around salt caverns in typical geological storage conditions. We
   use a self-consistent inclusion-matrix model to homogenize the
   viscoplastic deformation of halite polycrystals and predict the number
   of broken grains in a Representative Elementary Volume of salt. We use
   this micro-macro modeling framework to simulate creep tests under
   various axial stresses, which gives us the critical viscoplastic strain
   at which grain breakage (i.e., tertiary creep) is expected to occur. The
   comparison of simulation results for short-term and long-term creep
   indicates that the initiation of tertiary creep depends on the stress
   and the viscoplastic strain. We use the critical viscoplastic
   deformation as a yield criterion to control the transition between
   secondary and tertiary creep in a phenomenological viscoplastic model,
   which we implement into the Finite Element Method program POROFIS. We
   model a 850-m-deep salt cavern of irregular shape, in axis-symmetric
   conditions. Simulations of cavern depressurization indicate that a
   strain-dependent damage evolution law is more suitable than a
   stress-dependent damage evolution law, because it avoids high damage
   concentrations and allows capturing the formation of a damaged zone
   around the cavity. The modeling framework explained in this paper is
   expected to provide new insights to link grain breakage to
   phenomenological damage variables used in Continuum Damage Mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{The automotive industry is witnessing a revolution with the advent of
   advanced vehicular technologies, smart vehicle options, and fuel
   alternatives. However, there is very limited research on consumer
   preferences for such advanced vehicular technologies. The deployment and
   penetration of advanced vehicular technologies in the marketplace, and
   planning for possible market adoption scenarios, calls for the
   collection and analysis of consumer preference data related to these
   emerging technologies. This study aims to address this need, offering a
   detailed analysis of consumer preference for alternative fuel types and
   technology options using data collected in stated choice experiments
   conducted on a sample of consumers from six metropolitan cities in South
   Korea. The results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in
   consumer preferences for various smart technology options such as
   wireless internet, vehicle connectivity, and voice command features, but
   relatively less heterogeneity in the preference for smart vehicle

Title = {{New formulas for the tortuosity factor of electrochemically conducting
   channels}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{52-55}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Porous composite mediums consisting of multiple interpenetrating
   percolating phases are widely used in electrochemical cells and
   batteries. The electrochemical species, for example electrons, ions, and
   gaseous molecules, are confined to transport within the specific
   conducting phase networks. Our ability to understand physical and
   chemical processes within these tortuous networks is often limited by
   the lack of suitable mathematical representation of their tortuosity
   factor. Thus, the quantitative formulation of tortuosity factor is
   urgently needed in this regard. From purely geometric perspectives, this
   work has proposed new formulas to calculate the tortuosity factor for a
   single conducting channel and a bundle of channels, using the
   coordinates of the channel central line and the channel radius
   distribution along the channel central line. The formulas are easy to
   use and statistically identical to the ideal value of tortuosity factor.
   The new formulas can serve as a practical tool for analysis and rational
   design of the three-dimensional conducting networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{42-48}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The majority of the work on underwater communication has mainly been
   based on acoustic communication. Acoustic communication faces many known
   problems, such as high propagation delays, very low data rates, and
   highly environment-dependent channel behavior. In this article, to
   address these shortcomings, magnetic induction is introduced as a
   possible communication paradigm for underwater applications.
   Accordingly, all research challenges in this regard are explained.
   Fundamentally different from the conventional underwater communication
   paradigm, which relies on EM, acoustic, or optical waves, the underwater
   MI communications rely on the time varying magnetic field to covey
   information between the transmitting and receiving parties. MI-based
   underwater communications exhibit several unique and promising features
   such as negligible signal propagation delay, predictable and constant
   channel behavior, sufficiently long communication range with high
   bandwidth, as well as silent and stealth underwater operations. To fully
   utilize the promising features of underwater MI-based communications,
   this article introduces the fundamentals of underwater MI
   communications, including the MI channel models, MI networking protocols
   design, and MI-based underwater localization.}},

Abstract = {{A wheelchair-propelling robot has been developed to measure the
   efficiency of manual wheelchairs. The use of a robot has certain
   advantages compared to the use of human operators with respect to
   repeatability of measurements and the ability to compare many more
   wheelchair configurations than possible with human operators. Its design
   and implementation required significant engineering and validation of
   hardware and control systems. The robot can propel a wheelchair
   according to pre-programmed accelerations and velocities and measures
   the forces required to achieve these maneuvers. Wheel velocities were
   within 0.1 m/s of programmed values and coefficients of variation (CV) <
   2\%. Torque measurements were also repeatable with CV < 10\%. By
   determining the propulsion torque required to propel the wheelchair
   through a series of canonical maneuvers, task-dependent input work for
   various wheelchairs and configurations can be compared. This metric
   would serve to quantify the combined inertial and frictional resistance
   of the mechanical system.}},

Title = {{Dominance of sulfur-fueled iron oxide reduction in low-sulfate

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{A central tenant in microbial biogeochemistry is that microbial
   metabolisms follow a predictable sequence of terminal electron acceptors
   based on the energetic yield for the reaction. It is thereby oftentimes
   assumed that microbial respiration of ferric iron outcompetes sulfate in
   all but high-sulfate systems, and thus sulfide has little influence on
   freshwater or terrestrial iron cycling. Observations of sulfate
   reduction in low-sulfate environments have been attributed to the
   presumed presence of highly crystalline iron oxides allowing sulfate
   reduction to be more energetically favored. Here we identified the
   iron-reducing processes under low-sulfate conditions within columns
   containing freshwater sediments amended with structurally diverse iron
   oxides and fermentation products that fuel anaerobic respiration. We
   show that despite low sulfate concentrations and regardless of iron
   oxide substrate (ferrihydrite, Al-ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite),
   sulfidization was a dominant pathway in iron reduction. This process was
   mediated by (re) cycling of sulfur upon reaction of sulfide and iron
   oxides to support continued sulfur-based respiration-a cryptic sulfur
   cycle involving generation and consumption of sulfur intermediates.
   Although canonical iron respiration was not observed in the sediments
   amended with the more crystalline iron oxides, iron respiration did
   become dominant in the presence of ferrihydrite once sulfate was
   consumed. Thus, despite more favorable energetics, ferrihydrite
   reduction did not precede sulfate reduction and instead an inverse redox
   zonation was observed. These findings indicate that sulfur (re)cycling
   is a dominant force in iron cycling even in low-sulfate systems and in a
   manner difficult to predict using the classical thermodynamic ladder.}},

Title = {{Impact of the presence of noise on RR interval-based atrial fibrillation
   detection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, but is
   currently under-diagnosed since it can be asymptomatic. Early detection
   of AF could be highly beneficial for the prevention of stroke, which is
   one major risk associated with AF, with a five fold increase.
   mHealth applications have been recently proposed for early screening of
   paroxysmal AF. Several automatic AF detections have been suggested, and
   they are mostly based on features extracted from the RR interval
   time-series, since this is more robust to ambulatory noise than p-wave
   based algorithms. The RR. interval features highlight the irregularity
   and unpredictability of the rhythm due to the chaotic electrical
   conduction through the AV node. Such approach has proved to be accurate
   on openly available databases.
   However, current techniques are limited by their assumption of almost
   perfect R peak detection, and RR time-series features are
   usually-estimated from manual annotations. Analysis of the huge amount
   of data an mHealth application may create has to be automated, robust to
   noise, and should incorporate a confidence index based on an estimation
   of the signal quality.
   In this study, we present an in depth analysis of the performance of AF
   detection algorithms as a function of noise and QRS detection
   performance. We show a linear decrease of AF detection accuracy with
   respect to the SNR. Finally, we will demonstrate how the use of an
   automatic signal quality index can ensure a given level of performance
   in AF detection, more than 95\% AF detection accuracy by analyzing
   segments with a median SQI over 0.8. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We study a deterministic maritime inventory routing problem with a long
   planning horizon. For instances with many ports and many vessels,
   mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) solvers often require hours to
   produce good solutions even when the planning horizon is 90 or 120
   periods. Building on the recent successes of approximate dynamic
   programming (ADP) for road-based applications within the transportation
   community, we develop an ADP procedure to generate good solutions to
   these problems within minutes. Our algorithm operates by solving many
   small subproblems (one for each time period) and by collecting
   information about how to produce better solutions. Our main contribution
   to the ADP community is an algorithm that solves MIP subproblems and
   uses separable piecewise linear continuous, but not necessarily concave
   or convex, value function approximations and requires no off-line
   training. Our algorithm is one of the first of its kind for maritime
   transportation problems and represents a significant departure from the
   traditional methods used. In particular, whereas virtually all existing
   methods are ``MIP-centric,{''} i.e., they rely heavily on a solver to
   tackle a nontrivial MIP to generate a good or improving solution in a
   couple of minutes, our framework puts the effort on finding suitable
   value function approximations and places much less responsibility on the
   solver. Computational results illustrate that with a relatively simple
   framework, our ADP approach is able to generate good solutions to
   instances with many ports and vessels much faster than a commercial
   solver emphasizing feasibility and a popular local search procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The field of three-dimensional quantitative phase imaging (3D QPI) is
   expanding rapidly with applications in biological, medical, and
   industrial research, development, diagnostics, and metrology. Much of
   this research has centered on developing optical diffraction tomography
   (ODT) for biomedical applications. In addition to technical difficulties
   associated with coherent noise, ODT is not congruous with optical
   microscopy utilizing partially coherent light, which is used in most
   biomedical laboratories. Thus, ODT solutions have, for the most part,
   been limited to customized optomechanical systems which would be
   relatively expensive to implement on a wide scale. In the present work,
   a new phase reconstruction method, called tomographic deconvolution
   phase microscopy (TDPM), is described which makes use of commercial
   microscopy hardware in realizing 3D QPI. TDPM is analogous to methods
   used in deconvolution microscopy which improve spatial resolution and
   3D-localization accuracy of fluorescence micrographs by combining
   multiple through-focal scans which are deconvolved by the system point
   spread function. TDPM is based on the 3D weak object transfer function
   theory which is shown here to be capable of imaging ``nonweak{''} phase
   objects with large phase excursions. TDPM requires no phase unwrapping
   and recovers the entire object spectrum via object rotation, mitigating
   the need to fill in the ``missing cone{''} of spatial frequencies
   algorithmically as in limited-angle ODT. In the present work, TDPM is
   demonstrated using optical fibers, including single-mode,
   polarization-maintaining, and photonic-crystal fibers as well as an
   azimuthally varying CO2-laser-induced long-period fiber grating period
   as test phase objects. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Tissue remodeling is a characteristic of many solid tumor malignancies
   including melanoma. By virtue of tumor lymphatic transport, remodeling
   pathways active within the local tumor microenvironment have the
   potential to be operational within lymph nodes (LNs) draining the tumor
   interstitium. Here, we show that lymphatic drainage from murine B16
   melanomas in syngeneic, immune-competent C57Bl/6 mice is associated with
   LN enlargement as well as nonuniform increases in bulk tissue elasticity
   and viscoelasticity, as measured by the response of whole LNs to
   compression. These remodeling responses, which quickly manifest in
   tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) after tumor inoculation and before
   apparent metastasis, were accompanied by changes in matrix composition,
   including up to 3-fold increases in the abundance of soluble collagen
   and hyaluronic acid. Intranodal pressures were also significantly
   increased in TDLNs (+1 cmH(2)O) relative to both non-tumor-draining LNs
   (-1 cmH(2)O) and LNs from naive animals (-1 to 2 cmH(2)O). These data
   suggest that the reorganization of matrix structure, composition, and
   fluid microenvironment within LNs associated with tumor lymphatic
   drainage parallels remodeling seen in primary malignancies and has the
   potential to regulate the adhesion, proliferation, and signaling
   function of LN-resident cells involved in directing melanoma disease
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{In dual energy CT (DECT), noise amplification during signal
   decomposition significantly limits the utility of basis material images.
   Since clinically relevant objects typically contain a limited number of
   different materials, we propose an Image-domain Decomposition method
   through Entropy Minimization (IDEM) for noise suppression in DECT.
   Pixels of decomposed images are first linearly transformed into 2D
   clusters of data points, which are highly asymmetric due to strong
   signal correlation. An optimal axis is identified in the 2D space via
   numerical search such that the projection of data clusters onto the axis
   has minimum entropy. Noise suppression is performed on each image pixel
   by estimating the center-of-mass value of each data cluster along the
   direction perpendicular to the projection axis. The IDEM method is
   distinct from other noise suppression techniques in that it does not
   suppress pixel noise by reducing spatial variation between neighboring
   pixels. As supported by studies on Catphan(C)600 and anthropomorphic
   head phantoms, this feature endows our algorithm with a unique
   capability of reducing noise standard deviation on DECT decomposed
   images by approximately one order of magnitude while preserving spatial
   resolution and image noise power spectra (NPS). Compared with a
   filtering method and recently developed iterative method at the same
   level of noise suppression, the IDEM algorithm obtains high-resolution
   images with less artifacts. It also maintains accuracy of electron
   density measurements with less than 2\% bias error. The IDEM method
   effectively suppresses noise of DECT for quantitative use, with
   appealing features on preservation of image spatial resolution and NPS.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Precision placement of guided airdrop systems necessarily requires some
   mechanism enabling effective directional control of the vehicle. Often
   this mechanism is realized through asymmetric deflection of the parafoil
   canopy trailing-edge brakes. In contrast to conventional trailing-edge
   deflection used primarily for lateral steering, upper-surface bleed air
   spoilers have been shown to be extremely effective for both lateral and
   longitudinal (i.e., glide slope) control of parafoil and payload
   systems. Bleed air spoilers operate by opening and closing several
   spanwise slits in the upper surface of the parafoil canopy, thus
   creating a virtual spoiler from the stream of expelled ram air. The work
   reported here considers the autonomous landing performance of a
   small-scale parafoil and payload system using upper-surface bleed air
   spoilers exclusively for both lateral steering and glide slope control.
   Landing accuracy statistics computed from a series of Monte Carlo
   simulations in a variety of atmospheric conditions and experimental
   flight tests were found to be in good agreement. Median miss distances
   for the combined lateral and longitudinal control logic are on the order
   of 13m, indicating an improvement in landing accuracy of nearly 50\%
   over similar systems employing only lateral steering control.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Although postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) has been
   shown to reduce breast cancer burden and improve survival, PMRT may
   negatively influence outcomes after reconstruction. The goal of this
   study was to compare current opinions of plastic and reconstructive
   surgeons (PRS) and surgical oncologists (SO) regarding the optimal
   timing of breast reconstruction for patients requiring PMRT.
   Methods: Members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), the
   American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS), and the Society of Surgical
   Oncology (SSO) were asked to participate in an anonymous web-based
   survey. Responses were solicited in accordance to the Dillman method,
   and they were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics.
   Results: A total of 330 members of the ASPS and 348 members of the ASBS
   and SSO participated in our survey. PRS and SO differed in patient-payor
   mix (p < 0.01) and practice setting (p < 0.01), but they did not differ
   by urban versus rural setting (p = 0.65) or geographic location (p =
   0.30). Although PRS favored immediate reconstruction versus SO, overall
   timing did not significantly differ between the two specialists (p =
   0.14). The primary rationale behind delayed breast reconstruction
   differed significantly between PRS and SO (p < 0.01), with more PRS
   believing that the reconstructive outcome is significantly and adversely
   affected by radiation. Both PRS and SO cited ``patient-driven desire to
   have immediate reconstruction{''} ( p = 0.86) as the primary motivation
   for immediate reconstruction.
   Conclusions: Although the optimal timing of reconstruction is
   controversial between PRS and SO, our study suggests that the timing of
   reconstruction in PMRT patients is ultimately driven by patient
   preferences and the desire of PRS to optimize aesthetic outcomes. (C)

   Methods: This study received an exemption from the institutional review
   board. Subjects consisted of nonradiology health care trainees. Subjects
   underwent training and assessment of pulmonary nodule identification
   skills on chest radiographs at simulated radiology workstations. Subject
   performance was quantified by changes in area under the localization
   receiver operating characteristic curve. At the conclusion of the study,
   all subjects were given a questionnaire with five questions comparing
   learning at a simulated workstation with training using conventional
   materials. Statistical significance for questionnaire responses was
   tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
   Results: Subjects demonstrated statistically significant improvement in
   nodule identification after training at a simulated radiology
   workstation (change in area under the curve, 0.1079; P =.015). Subjects
   indicated that training on simulated radiology workstations was
   preferable to conventional training methods for all questions; P values
   for all questions were less than .01.
   Conclusions: Simulation may be a useful tool for teaching and assessment
   of skills related to medical image perception and interpretation.
   Further study is needed to determine which skills and trainee
   populations may be most amenable to training and assessment using

Title = {{A minimum spanning forest based classification method for dedicated

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6190-6202}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and test an automated algorithm to classify
   different types of tissue in dedicated breast CT images.
   Methods: Images of a single breast of five different patients were
   acquired with a dedicated breast CT clinical prototype. The breast CT
   images were processed by a multiscale bilateral filter to reduce noise
   while keeping edge information and were corrected to overcome cupping
   artifacts. As skin and glandular tissue have similar CT values on breast
   CT images, morphologic processing is used to identify the skin based on
   its position information. A support vector machine (SVM) is trained and
   the resulting model used to create a pixelwise classification map of fat
   and glandular tissue. By combining the results of the skin mask with the
   SVM results, the breast tissue is classified as skin, fat, and glandular
   tissue. This map is then used to identify markers for a minimum spanning
   forest that is grown to segment the image using spatial and intensity
   information. To evaluate the authors' classification method, they use
   DICE overlap ratios to compare the results of the automated
   classification to those obtained by manual segmentation on five patient
   images.
   Results: Comparison between the automatic and the manual segmentation
   shows that the minimum spanning forest based classification method was
   able to successfully classify dedicated breast CT image with average
   DICE ratios of 96.9\%, 89.8\%, and 89.5\% for fat, glandular, and skin
   tissue, respectively.
   Conclusions: A 2D minimum spanning forest based classification method
   was proposed and evaluated for classifying the fat, skin, and glandular
   tissue in dedicated breast CT images. The classification method can be
   used for dense breast tissue quantification, radiation dose assessment,
   and other applications in breast imaging. (C) 2015 American Association

   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) arrays driven by wind power. Using
   the controllable voltage output of the TENG arrays, the SPAO system was
   shown to regulate the pore depth and pore size of the mesoporous Al2O3.
   In contrast to traditional AO systems, this technique takes advantage of
   the high output voltage of TENG arrays without any additional energy
   costs. In addition, the SPAO system can be used for the preparation of
   other mesoporous materials.}},

Abstract = {{Rotator cuff tears are common and cause a great deal of lost
   productivity, pain, and disability. Tears are typically repaired by
   suturing the tendon back to its bony attachment. Unfortunately, the
   structural (e.g., aligned collagen) and compositional (e.g., a gradient
   in mineral) elements that produce a robust attachment in the healthy
   tissue are not regenerated during healing, and the repair is prone to
   failure. Two features of the failed healing response are deposition of
   poorly aligned scar tissue and loss of bone at the repair site.
   Therefore, the objective of the current study was to improve
   tendon-to-bone healing by promoting aligned collagen deposition and
   increased bone formation using a biomimetic scaffold seeded with
   pluripotent cells. An aligned nanofibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
   scaffold with a gradient in mineral content was seeded with
   adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and implanted at the repair site of
   a rat rotator cuff model. In one group, cells were transduced with the
   osteogenic factor bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). The healing
   response was examined in four groups (suture only, acellular scaffold,
   cellular scaffold, and cellular BMP2 scaffold) using histologic, bone
   morphology, and biomechanical outcomes at 14, 28, and 56 days.
   Histologically, the healing interface was dominated by a fibrovascular
   scar response in all groups. The acellular scaffold group showed a
   delayed healing response compared to the other groups. When examining
   bone morphology parameters, bone loss was evident in the cellular BMP2
   group compared to other groups at 28 days. When examining repair-site
   mechanical properties, strength and modulus were decreased in the
   cellular BMP2 groups compared to other groups at 28 and 56 days. These
   results indicated that tendon-to-bone healing in this animal model was
   dominated by scar formation, preventing any positive effects of the
   implanted biomimetic scaffold. Furthermore, cells transduced with the
   osteogenic factor BMP2 led to impaired healing, suggesting that this
   growth factor should not be used in the tendon-to-bone repair setting.}},

Abstract = {{Given the known mechanosensitivity of the lymphatic vasculature, we
   sought to investigate the effects of dynamic wall shear stress (WSS) on
   collecting lymphatic vessels while controlling for transmural pressure.
   Using a previously developed ex vivo lymphatic perfusion system (ELPS)
   capable of independently controlling both transaxial pressure gradient
   and average transmural pressure on an isolated lymphatic vessel, we
   imposed a multitude of flow conditions on rat thoracic ducts, while
   controlling for transmural pressure and measuring diameter changes. By
   gradually increasing the imposed flow through a vessel, we determined
   the WSS at which the vessel first shows sign of contraction inhibition,
   defining this point as the shear stress sensitivity of the vessel. The
   shear stress threshold that triggered a contractile response was
   significantly greater at a transmural pressure of 5 cmH(2)O (0.97
   dyne/cm(2)) than at 3 cmH(2)O (0.64 dyne/cm(2)). While contraction
   frequency was reduced when a steady WSS was applied, this inhibition was
   reversed when the applied WSS oscillated, even though the mean wall
   shear stresses between the conditions were not significantly different.
   When the applied oscillatory WSS was large enough, flow itself
   synchronized the lymphatic contractions to the exact frequency of the
   applied waveform. Both transmural pressure and the rate of change of WSS
   have significant impacts on the contractile response of lymphatic
   vessels to flow. Specifically, time-varying shear stress can alter the
   inhibition of phasic contraction frequency and even coordinate
   contractions, providing evidence that dynamic shear could play an
   important role in the contractile function of collecting lymphatic
   vessels.}},

Abstract = {{Goal: We tested the hypothesis that the ballistocardiogram (BCG)
   waveform could yield a viable proximal timing reference for measuring
   pulse transit time (PTT). Methods: From 15 healthy volunteers, we
   measured PTT as the time interval between BCG and a noninvasively
   measured finger blood pressure (BP) waveform. To evaluate the efficacy
   of the BCG-based PTT in estimating BP, we likewise measured pulse
   arrival time (PAT) using the electrocardiogram (ECG) as proximal timing
   reference and compared their correlations to BP. Results: BCG-based PTT
   was correlated with BP reasonably well: the mean correlation coefficient
   (r) was 0.62 for diastolic (DP), 0.65 for mean (MP), and 0.66 for
   systolic (SP) pressures when the intersecting tangent method was used as
   distal timing reference. Comparing four distal timing references
   (intersecting tangent, maximum second derivative, diastolic minimum, and
   systolic maximum), PTT exhibited the best correlation with BP when the
   systolic maximum method was used (mean r value was 0.66 for DP, 0.67 for
   MP, and 0.70 for SP). PTT was more strongly correlated with DP than PAT
   regardless of the distal timing reference: mean r value was 0.62 versus
   0.51 (p = 0.07) for intersecting tangent, 0.54 versus 0.49 (p = 0.17)
   for maximum second derivative, 0.58 versus 0.52 (p = 0.37) for diastolic
   minimum, and 0.66 versus 0.60 (p = 0.10) for systolic maximum methods.
   The difference between PTT and PAT in estimating DP was significant (p =
   0.01) when the r values associated with all the distal timing references
   were compared altogether. However, PAT appeared to outperform PTT in
   estimating SP (p = 0.31 when the r values associated with all the distal
   timing references were compared altogether). Conclusion: We conclude
   that BCG is an adequate proximal timing reference in deriving PTT, and
   that BCG-based PTT may be superior to ECG-based PAT in estimating DP.
   Significance: PTT with BCG as proximal timing reference has potential to
   enable convenient and ubiquitous cuffless BP monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a formalism of a compact physical model for crosstalk noise
   analysis between two coplanar backward volume spin-wave interconnects.
   Comparing the amplitudes of the signal in the active line and the noise
   in the victim line, we introduce a figure of merit for crosstalk-the
   longitudinal or line-to-line coupling. It is shown that the crosstalk
   becomes prohibitively high as the edge-to-edge spacing between the lines
   goes down, and thus putting a limitation on the routing and placement in
   a spin-wave bus network. The position of the peak crosstalk noise
   coupling for different spacings and frequencies of excitation reveals a
   new limitation to the maximum interconnect length. Furthermore, the
   technique of superposition analogous to RLC interconnects is exploited
   to explain the complicated nature of crosstalk noise and develop a
   mechanism for modeling crosstalk. Finally, a compact physical model is
   derived using analytical expressions, which demonstrate a reasonably
   good agreement with the actual full micromagnetic simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer demand profiles and fluctuating renewable power generation are
   two main sources of uncertainty in matching demand and supply. This
   paper proposes a model of the electricity market that captures the
   uncertainties on both the operator and user sides. The system operator
   (SO) implements a temporal linear pricing strategy that depends on
   real-time demand and renewable generation in the considered period
   combining real-time pricing with time-of-use pricing. The announced
   pricing strategy sets up a noncooperative game of incomplete information
   among the users with heterogeneous, but correlated consumption
   preferences. An explicit characterization of the optimal user behavior
   using the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution concept is derived. This
   explicit characterization allows the SO to derive pricing policies that
   influence demand to serve practical objectives, such as minimizing
   peak-to-average ratio or attaining a desired rate of return. Numerical
   experiments show that the pricing policies yield close to optimal
   welfare values while improving these practical objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Incoherent undersampling-based waveform acquisition provides a low-cost
   test setup for characterizing high-speed systems. A periodic waveform
   reconstruction using incoherent undersampling remaps time indices of
   samples using the modulus of the suspected period of the signal,
   effectively folding the signal into a time window equal to one period.
   The major cost and accuracy limitations of the reconstruction technique
   arise from estimation of the waveform period. Multiple cost functions
   have been proposed to estimate the period, including frequency domain
   metrics, which are computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose
   a new time domain zero-crossing (ZC)-based metric, where the metric
   gives the number of ZC in the reconstructed waveform for an assumed
   period of the waveform. The reconstruction technique is also extended to
   beyond the track-and-hold amplifier bandwidth using a novel test setup
   combining the incoherent undersampling with multichannel bandwidth
   interleaving.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated multiscale modeling framework that incorporates a

   Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is employed in the upscaling procedure
   to handle the computational burden caused by the input uncertainties.
   Efficient uncertainty quantification is achieved at the mesoscale level
   by utilizing the developed upscaling technique. The homogenized
   parameters of mesostructures are utilized again at the macroscale level
   in the upscaling procedure to accurately obtain the overall material
   properties of the target cellular structure. Actual experimental results

Title = {{Level Set Topology Optimization of Printed Active Composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multimaterial polymer printers allow the placement of different material
   phases within a composite, where some or all of the materials may
   exhibit an active response. Utilizing the shape memory (SM) behavior of
   at least one of the material phases, active composites can be
   three-dimensional (3D) printed such that they deform from an initially
   flat plate into a curved structure. This paper introduces a topology
   optimization approach for finding the spatial arrangement of shape
   memory polymers (SMPs) within a passive matrix such that the composite
   assumes a target shape. The optimization approach combines a level set
   method (LSM) for describing the material layout and a generalized
   formulation of the extended finite-element method (XFEM) for predicting
   the response of the printed active composite (PAC). This combination of
   methods yields optimization results that can be directly printed without
   the need for additional postprocessing steps. Two multiphysics PAC
   models are introduced to describe the response of the composite. The
   models differ in the level of accuracy in approximating the residual
   strains generated by a thermomechanical programing process. Comparing
   XFEM predictions of the two PAC models against experimental results
   suggests that the models are sufficiently accurate for design purposes.
   The proposed optimization method is studied with examples where the
   target shapes correspond to a plate-bending type deformation and to a
   localized deformation. The optimized designs are 3D printed and the XFEM
   predictions are compared against experimental measurements. The design
   studies demonstrate the ability of the proposed optimization method to
   yield a crisp and highly resolved description of the optimized material
   layout that can be realized by 3D printing. As the complexity of the
   target shape increases, the optimal spatial arrangement of the material
   phases becomes less intuitive, highlighting the advantages of the
   proposed optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{We first investigate the fundamental properties of rigid serial
   manipulators as related to the control design. Then, a new optimal
   robust control is proposed for serial-link mechanical manipulators with
   fuzzy uncertainty. Fuzzy set theory is used to describe the uncertainty.
   The desirable system performance is deterministic (assuring the bottom
   line) and also fuzzy (enhancing the cost consideration). The proposed
   control is deterministic and is not the usual if-then rules-based
   control. The resulting controlled system is uniformly bounded and
   uniformly ultimately bounded proved via the Lyapunov minimax approach. A
   performance index (the combined cost, which includes average fuzzy
   system performance and control effort) is proposed based on the fuzzy
   information. The optimal design problem associated with the control can
   then be solved by minimizing the performance index. The resulting
   control design is systematic and is able to guarantee the deterministic
   performance as well as minimizing the cost. In the end, a cylindrical
   robot manipulator is chosen for demonstration.}},

   performance status not progressing after first-line induction
   chemotherapy: Results by performance status, EGFR mutation, histology

Abstract = {{Background: Recent trials have suggested that maintenance treatments
   improve outcomes for patients not progressing after first-line therapy
   for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, physicians
   have little guidance on selecting which patients benefit the most and
   what drug or regimen is optimal. Here, we report a systematic review and
   network meta-analysis of maintenance treatments in subgroups determined
   by performance status (PS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
   mutation, histology and response to induction.
   Methods: PubMed and conference proceedings were reviewed and individual
   study relative efficacy measures were meta-analysed in a Bayesian
   hierarchical model. The primary outcome, overall survival (OS), was
   evaluated in terms of (i) posterior surface under cumulative ranking
   curve (SUCRA), (ii) probability of being best treatment, (iii)
   probability of outperforming no maintenance, and (iv) posterior median
   hazard ratio (95\% credible interval). Secondary outcomes were
   progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events.
   Findings: Twelve trials evaluating eight maintenance treatments in 3850
   patients were meta-analysed. Selected maintenance treatments showed
   clinically meaningful benefits of >= 20\% reduction in hazards of death
   with >= 90\% probability of outperforming no maintenance in terms of OS:
   (i) switch to or continue pemetrexed (nonsquamous), continue
   gemcitabine, or switch to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for PS
   0 patients, (ii) switch to pemetrexed (nonsquamous) for PS 1 patients,
   (iii) switch to EGFR TKI for EGFR mutation positive patients, (iv)
   switch to or continue pemetrexed or switch to EGFR TKI for nonsquamous
   patients, (v) continue gemcitabine for squamous patients, (vi) switch to
   docetaxel or continue gemcitabine for responders to induction, or (vii)
   switch to or continue pemetrexed (nonsquamous) or switch to EGFR TKI for
   patients with stable disease post-induction.
   Interpretation: Maintenance treatments show clinically meaningful
   survival benefits in good performance status patients with advanced
   NSCLC not progressing after first-line chemotherapy. Benefits are
   optimised by targeting specific maintenance to individual patients
   guided by PS, EGFR mutation status, histology and response to induction.

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms underlying spatial cognition in the context of
   exploring realistic city maps are unknown. We conducted a novel brain
   imaging study to address the question of whether and how features of
   special importance for map exploration are encoded in the brain to make
   a spatial decision. Subjects explored by eyes small city maps
   exemplifying five different street network types in order to locate a
   hypothetical City Hall, while neural activity was recorded continuously
   by 248 magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensors at high temporal resolution.
   Monitoring subjects' eye positions, we locally characterized the maps by
   computing three spatial parameters of the areas that were explored. We
   computed the number of street intersections, the total street length,
   and the regularity index in the circular areas of 6 degrees of visual
   angle radius centered on instantaneous eye positions. We tested the
   hypothesis that neural activity during exploration is associated with
   the spatial parameters and modulated by street network type. All time
   series were rendered stationary and nonautocorrelated by applying an
   autoregressive integrated moving average model and taking the residuals.
   We then assessed the associations between the prewhitened time-varying
   MEG time series from 248 sensors and the prewhitened spatial parameters
   time series, for each street network type, using multiple linear
   regression analyses. In accord with our hypothesis, ongoing neural
   activity was strongly associated with the spatial parameters through
   localized and distributed networks, and neural processing of these
   parameters depended on the type of street network. Overall, processing
   of the spatial parameters seems to predominantly involve right frontal
   and prefrontal areas, but not for all street network layouts. These
   results are in line with findings from a series of previous studies
   showing that frontal and prefrontal areas are involved in the processing
   of spatial information and decision making. Modulation of neural
   processing of the spatial parameters by street network type suggests
   that some street network layouts may contain other types of spatial
   information that subjects use to explore maps and make spatial
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse gas emission becomes a recent global concern for
   manufacturing. As product design has a profound effect on a product's
   carbon footprint in its life cycle, recent research efforts of
   low-carbon design provided valuable insights and contributions. Yet,
   most of the research is about detailed design instead of the conceptual
   stage. Conceptual design of a product determines over 70 \% of its life
   cycle costs. The decisions made during the conceptual design also have
   extensive impacts on the environment. Therefore, it is important to
   estimate the carbon footprint of a product at its conceptual design
   stage. In this paper, we present a carbon footprint model and a
   low-carbon conceptual design framework where the environmental impacts
   throughout the life cycle of a product can be assessed. In the carbon
   footprint model, the amount of carbon emission is estimated at the five
   stages of the entire product life cycle. The carbon footprint analysis
   is based on product life cycle assessment. Sensitivity analysis for
   design parameters is also performed to measure the effects of design
   parameters on the estimation of product carbon footprint quantitatively.
   The conceptual design of a cold heading machine is used to demonstrate
   the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major risk factor for inflammatory dermatologic diseases,
   including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In addition, recent studies
   have shown that obesity impairs lymphatic function. As the lymphatic
   system is a critical regulator of inflammatory reactions, we tested the
   hypothesis that obesity-induced lymphatic dysfunction is a key regulator
   of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions in obese mice. We found that
   obese mice have impaired lymphatic function, characterized by leaky
   capillary lymphatics and decreased collecting vessel pumping capacity.
   In addition, obese mice displayed heightened dermatitis responses to
   inflammatory skin stimuli, resulting in both higher peak inflammation
   and a delayed clearance of inflammatory responses. Injection of
   recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor-C remarkably increased
   lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic function, and lymphatic endothelial cell
   expression of chemokine (C C motif) ligand 21, while decreasing
   inflammation and expression of inducible nitrous oxide synthase. These
   changes resulted in considerably decreased dermatitis responses in both
   lean and obese mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that
   obesityinduced changes in the lymphatic system result in an amplified
   and a prolonged inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{Silica-supported platinum (Pt/SiO2) and alumina-supported platinum
   (Pt/Al2O3) catalysts have been prepared by an aerosol spray pyrolysis

   XPS revealed that crystalline and metallic Pt nanoparticles were well
   dispersed on the surface of silica and alumina supports. The sintering
   effect on Pt particles over Al2O3 at high temperature (similar to 250
   degrees C) is more prominent than those over SiO2; this suggests that
   there is stronger interaction between Pt particles and SiO2 support,
   when compared to Pt over Al2O3 support, resulting in Pt particles size
   below 3 nm. Moreover, steady-state catalytic experiments for selective
   reduction of nitrogen monoxide by propene have demonstrated that NOx
   conversions to N2O and N-2 in Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are 29.8\%

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an optimization methodology for
   selecting the lowest monetary cost combinations of building technologies
   to meet set operational energy reduction targets. The new optimization
   algorithm introduced in this paper departs from the notion that optimal
   design choices over a large set of design parameters and properties can
   be driven by energy targets. We assume that design parameters are
   determined by many concurrent considerations fighting over the attention
   span of the design team. Our approach starts from a design outcome and
   asks the question, which set of discrete technologies are the right mix
   to reach an energy target in the cost optimal way? Such an approach has
   to face the challenge that the properties of market-available building
   technologies have a discrete nature that makes their optimal selection a
   combinatorial problem. The optimization algorithm searches the discrete
   combinatoric space by maximizing the following objective function:
   calculated energy savings divided by premium cost, where cost is defined
   as the additional cost over a baseline solution. The algorithm is
   codified into a custom MATLAB script and when compared to prescriptive
   methodologies is shown to be more cost effective and generically
   applicable given a palette of building technology alternatives and their
   corresponding cost data.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to multiple gas sensing on decorated porous silicon (PS)
   substrates is presented. The simple microelectromechanical
   systems/nanoelectromechanical systems platform that we have developed
   facilitates the modeling of the interaction of nanostructured metal
   oxide islands with the analytes of interest, which are exemplified by NO
   and NH3. These conductometric sensors operate at room temperature and
   atmospheric pressure and, as they are forgiving, do not require
   film-based technology or lithography for their construction. We show
   that diffusion dominates the conductometric response. The direct
   response and the derivatives of this response are considered. The first
   derivative allows a quick evaluation of sensor response and the
   derivative is linear with concentration. The spectral simulations have
   been refined to include adsorption/desorption effects of the analyte gas
   and assess subsequent non-linear interface sensitivities. By including
   the physics of adsorption/desorption, the simulated sensor response is
   now a non-linear function of concentration. We model the
   absorption/diffusion through the use of the Langmuir absorption isotherm
   and find substantial agreement with experiment for the mixed analyte
   interactions of NH3 and NO combinations on several metal oxide decorated
   PS interfaces.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Identifying a person by his or her voice is an important human trait
   most take for granted in natural human-to-human
   interaction/communication. Speaking to someone over the telephone
   usually begins by identifying who is speaking and, at least in cases of
   familiar speakers, a subjective verification by the listener that the
   identity is correct and the conversation can proceed. Automatic
   speaker-recognition systems have emerged as an important means of
   verifying identity in many e-commerce applications as well as in general
   business interactions, forensics, and law enforcement. Human experts
   trained in forensic speaker recognition can perform this task even
   better by examining a set of acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic
   characteristics of speech in a general approach referred to as
   structured listening. Techniques in forensic speaker recognition have
   been developed for many years by forensic speech scientists and
   linguists to help reduce any potential bias or preconceived
   understanding as to the validity of an unknown audio sample and a
   reference template from a potential suspect. Experienced researchers in
   signal processing and machine learning continue to develop automatic
   algorithms to effectively perform speaker recognition-with
   ever-improving performance-to the point where automatic systems start to
   perform on par with human listeners. In this article, we review the
   literature on speaker recognition by machines and humans, with an
   emphasis on prominent speaker-modeling techniques that have emerged in
   the last decade for automatic systems. We discuss different aspects of
   automatic systems, including voice-activity detection (VAD), features,
   speaker models, standard evaluation data sets, and performance metrics.
   Human speaker recognition is discussed in two parts-the first part
   involves forensic speaker-recognition methods, and the second
   illustrates how a naive listener performs this task from a neuroscience
   perspective. We conclude this review with a comparative study of human
   versus machine speaker recognition and attempt to point out strengths
   and weaknesses of each.}},

Abstract = {{Practical implementations of secret-key generation are often based on
   sequential strategies, which handle reliability and secrecy in two
   successive steps, called reconciliation and privacy amplification. In
   this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on polar codes that
   jointly deals with reliability and secrecy. Specifically, we propose
   secret-key capacity-achieving polar coding schemes for the following
   models: (i) the degraded binary memoryless source (DBMS) model with
   rate-unlimited public communication, (ii) the DBMS model with one-way
   rate-limited public communication, (iii) the 1-to-m broadcast model and
   (iv) the Markov tree model with uniform marginals. For models (i) and
   (ii) our coding schemes remain valid for non-degraded sources, although
   they may not achieve the secret-key capacity. For models (i), (ii) and
   (iii), our schemes rely on pre-shared secret seed of negligible rate;
   however, we provide special cases of these models for which no seed is
   required. Finally, we show an application of our results to secrecy and
   privacy for biometric systems. We thus provide the first examples of
   low-complexity secret-key capacity-achieving schemes that are able to
   handle vector quantization for model (ii), or multiterminal
   communication for models (iii) and (iv).}},

Title = {{Geometry Preserving Active Polygon-Incorporated Sign Detection Algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A generalized traffic sign detection algorithm incorporating a hybrid
   active contour (HAC) model has been previously developed to
   automatically detect all types of traffic signs. Although the HAC model
   has shown some promising results, there are still some false negatives
   remaining due to the over-evolution of the HAC model. Therefore, further
   improvement is needed to reduce the number of these false negatives.
   This paper is aimed at developing a new geometry-preserving active
   polygon (GPAP) model to address the over-evolution issue in the HAC
   model for improving the computation speed. The contributions of this
   paper include (1) proposing a new geometry-preserving evolution that
   ensures that the ``contour{''} only evolves at its vertices instead of
   at every point along the edges; (2) tailoring a new energy function that
   enables a polygon to effectively converge to traffic sign regions
   without losing its geometry integrity by using both local color contrast
   feature and global elongation and rectangularity features; (3) proposing
   a generalized Hough transform that can make an efficient initial guess
   for the active polygon based on the manual for uniform traffic control
   devices (MUTCD) sign shape template with a multiscale implementation.
   The experimental test shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve a
   per-sign detection rate of 85.6\% out of 2,329 tested signs, while it
   can successfully avoid over-evolution and detect 233 traffic signs that
   could not be detected previously by the existing algorithm. By
   incorporating the proposed GPAP model into the existing generalized
   detection algorithm, the test on selected datasets with diverse image
   qualities, image contexts, and data acquisition configurations shows
   that the per-frame false negative rate is decreased by 12.2\%; also, the
   average processing time reduces the existing algorithm's processing time
   by 50.2\%. The proposed GPAP model shows the promise of improving both
   the accuracy and efficiency of the existing sign detection algorithm,
   which can be used to improve transportation agencies' image-based sign
   inventory. (c) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Generating Absolute-Scale Point Cloud Data of Built Infrastructure
   Scenes Using a Monocular Camera Setting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The global scale of point cloud data (PCD) generated through monocular
   photography and videogrammetry is unknown and can be calculated using at
   least one known dimension of the scene. Measuring one or more dimensions
   for this purpose induces a manual step in the three-dimensional
   reconstruction process; this increases the effort and reduces the speed
   of reconstructing scenes, and induces substantial human error in the
   process due to the high level of measurement accuracy needed. Other ways
   of measuring such dimensions are based on acquiring additional
   information by either using extra sensors or specific classes of objects
   existing in the scene; it was found that these solutions are not simple,
   cost effective, or general enough to be considered practical for
   reconstructing both indoor and outdoor built infrastructure scenes. To
   address the issue, this paper proposes a novel method for automatically
   calculating the absolute scale of built infrastructure PCD. A
   premeasured cube for outdoor scenes and a sheet of paper for indoor
   environments are used as the calibration patterns. Assuming that the
   dimensions of these objects are known, the proposed method extracts the
   objects' corner points in two-dimensional video frames using a novel
   algorithm. The extracted corner points are then matched between the
   consecutive frames. Finally, the corresponding corner points are
   reconstructed along with other features of the scenes to determine the
   real-world scale. To evaluate the performance of the method, 10 indoor
   and 10 outdoor cases were selected and the absolute-scale PCD for each
   case was computed. Results illustrated the proposed algorithm is able to
   reconstruct the predefined objects with a high success rate, while the
   generated absolute-scale PCD is sufficiently accurate. (C) 2014 American

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we revisit Janssen's (J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 33 (4),
   2003, pp. 863-884) formulation for the dynamic excess kurtosis of weakly
   nonlinear gravity waves in deep water. For narrowband directional
   spectra, the formulation is given by a sixfold integral that depends
   upon the Benjamin Feir index and the parameter R =
   sigma(2)(theta)/2v(2), a measure of short-crestedness for the dominant
   waves, with v and sigma(theta) denoting spectral bandwidth and angular
   spreading Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for the
   dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a
   Gaussian-type spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas
   initially homogeneous and Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime
   dynamic kurtosis grows initially, attaining a positive maximum (negative
   minimum) at the intrinsic time scale tau(c) = v(2) omega(0)t(c) = 1/root
   3R, or t(c)/T-0 approximate to 0.13/v sigma(theta), where omega(0) = 2
   pi/T-0 denotes the dominant angular frequency. Eventually the dynamic
   excess kurtosis tends monotonically to zero as the wave field reaches a
   quasi-equilibrium state characterized by nonlinearities mainly due to
   bound harmonics. Quasi-resonant interactions are dominant only in
   unidirectional or long-crested seas where the longer-time dynamic
   kurtosis can be larger than that induced by bound harmonics, especially
   as the Benjamin-Feir index increases. Finally, we discuss the
   implication of these results for the prediction of rogue waves.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Transportation and state DOTs across the nation
   seek private investments to leverage their shrinking financial resources
   and fulfill their growing funding shortfalls. The decision to involve
   the private sector in financing highway projects varies from state to
   state in several aspects. State DOTs pursue a wide range of objectives
   when they utilize private financing for highway projects. State DOTs
   utilize different procurement methods for project financing and use
   different approaches to evaluate financial qualifications and proposals.
   State DOTs face different kinds of financial, political, legal,
   management, and organizational issues affecting their abilities to
   attract private investments in highway projects. Various strategies have
   been utilized by state DOTs to facilitate adoption of private financing
   in their highway projects. Considering variations in current practices
   of private financing among state DOTs, there is a need for a study to
   enhance the state of knowledge about current practices of private
   financing among different state DOTs. The major objective of this study
   is to capture the underpinnings of private financing as utilized by
   state DOTs in development of highway projects. A national survey was
   developed and sent to transportation officials in 50 state DOTs. Results
   of this survey were examined and analyzed in detail. The results of the
   survey indicate that only some state DOTs have established mature
   private financing programs, and private financing will remain a viable
   alternative for highway project development in these state DOTs. It was
   found out that state DOTs typically think of private financing more as
   an instrument to bridge their funding gaps and financing shortfalls and
   less as an innovative solution to gain life cycle cost efficiencies,
   encourage competition, and transfer critical project risks to the
   private sector. Stringent organizational policies and inefficient
   project development processes were found to be among the major concerns
   of state DOTs in effective utilization of private financing. Statutory
   limitations and inefficient frameworks for project financing and
   procurement method in the public sector were recognized as major
   barriers for private sector involvement in financing highway projects.
   Legislative flexibility for engaging private financing and commitment of
   key project stakeholders and top state officials were identified as
   critical factors that significantly enhance the adoption of private
   financing in highway project development. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a parametric study on flow ripple for guiding the
   design of a piston pump. For the purpose of minimizing flow ripple, a
   detailed simulation model is built. In this simulation model, a modified
   method for computing precisely leakage flow rate from the oil film
   between valve plate and cylinder block, the oil film between cylinder
   block and piston, and the oil film between the slipper and the swash
   plate is proposed. Then the influence of fluid characteristics, such as
   the fluid compressibility and viscosity and the air contained in the
   fluid, is taken into consideration in the simulation model. In addition,
   the motion of the piston, cylinder, and slipper is referenced in one
   simulation model making the simulation model closer to a real pump.
   Validated using test results obtained from the secondary source method,
   the computational accuracy with the modified simulation has been
   adequately improved for analyzing the parametric effects on flow ripple
   and optimizing the design of a piston pump. The findings conclude that
   for the same working conditions, the fluid compressibility has been
   identified to be the most significant cause responsible for flow ripple.
   The leakage flow rate and fluid viscosity play the next important roles
   on the generation of flow ripple as compared to the effects due to the
   piston movement. When there is no cavitation in the working conditions,
   the effect of the air contained in the fluid on flow ripple can be
   neglected.}},

Abstract = {{Serving as cache disks, flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) can
   significantly boost the performance of read-intensive applications.
   However, frequent data updating, the necessary condition for classical
   replacement algorithms (e.g., LRU, MQ, LIRS, and ARC) to achieve a high
   hit rate, makes SSDs wear out quickly. To address this problem, we
   propose a new approach-write-efficient caching (WEC)-to greatly improve
   the write durability of SSD cache. WEC is conducive to reducing the
   total number of writes issued to SSDs while achieving high hit rates.
   WEC takes two steps to improve write durability and performance of SSD
   cache. First, WEC discovers write-efficient data, which tend to be
   active for a long time period and to be frequently accessed. Second, WEC
   keeps the write-efficient data in SSDs long enough to avoid excessive
   number of unnecessary updates. Our findings based on a wide range of
   popular real-world traces show that write-efficient data does exist in a
   wide range of popular read-intensive applications. Our experimental
   results indicate that compared with the classical algorithms, WEC
   judiciously improves the mean hits of each written block by
   approximately two orders of magnitude while exhibiting similar or even
   higher hit rates.}},

Abstract = {{Having regulatory T cells (Tregs) with the same Ag specificity as the
   responding conventional T cells is thought to be important in
   maintaining peripheral tolerance. It has been demonstrated that during
   experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis there are myelin
   oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific Tregs that infiltrate into
   the CNS. However, the affinity of naturally occurring polyclonal Tregs
   for any self-antigen, let alone MOG, has not been analyzed in the
   periphery or at the site of autoimmune disease. Utilizing the highly
   sensitive micropipette adhesion frequency assay, which allows one to
   determine on a single-cell basis the affinity and frequency of
   polyclonal Ag-specific T cells directly ex vivo, we demonstrate that at
   peak disease MOG-specific Tregs were progressively enriched in the
   draining cervical lymph nodes and CNS as compared with spleen. These
   frequencies were greater than the frequencies measured by tetramer
   analysis, indicative of the large fraction of lower affinity T cells
   that comprise the MOG-specific conventional T cell (Tconv) and Treg
   response. Of interest, the self-reactive CD4(+) Tconvs and Tregs
   displayed overlapping affinities for MOG in the periphery, yet in the
   CNS, the site of neuroinflammation, Tconvs skew toward higher
   affinities. Most of the MOG-specific Tregs in the CNS possessed the
   methylation signature associated with thymic-derived Tregs. These
   findings indicate that thymic-derived Treg affinity range matches that
   of their Tconvs in the periphery and suggest a change in TCR affinity as
   a potential mechanism for autoimmune progression and escape from immune
   regulation.}},

   SPCs with relatively good tensile and interfacial properties were

   degrees C. Melt-spun HDPE fibers were made from the same resin as the
   matrix. The fibers were heat treated in silicone oil, with and without
   tension, to study the changes of fiber properties upon exposure to high
   temperature. HDPE SPCs containing about 30 wt\% lab-made HDPE fabric
   achieved a tensile strength of 50 MPa, 2.8 times that of neat HDPE. The
   peel strength of HDPE SPCs increased with increasing injection
   temperature and achieved a maximum value of 16.7 N/cm. Optical
   micrographs of polished transverse cross-sections of the SPC samples

   coagulation occurred in a solvent-free or solvent/nonsolvent coagulation

   effect of fiber processing conditions was studied to understand their
   effect on the as-spun fiber cross-sectional shape, as well as the
   as-spun fiber morphology. Increased coagulation bath temperature and a
   higher concentration of solvent in the coagulation bath medium resulted
   in more circular fibers and smoother fiber surface. as-spun fibers were
   then drawn to investigate the relationship between as-spun fiber
   processing conditions and the drawn precursor fiber structure and
   mechanical properties. PAN precursor fiber tows were then stabilized and
   carbonized in a continuous process for the manufacture of PAN based
   carbon fibers. Carbon fibers with tensile strengths as high as 5.8 GPa
   and tensile modulus as high as 375 GPa were produced. The highest

Abstract = {{The 2007-2008 French National Travel Survey (FNTS) included questions
   about the trip experience for a random subsample of the respondents'
   daily travel, offering a rare opportunity to examine a national profile
   of attitudes toward travel. This study analyzes the self-reported
   (mental and/or physical) fatigue associated with the selected trip, and
   its (un)pleasantness. Only 8 \% of trips were tiring, and fewer than 4
   \% were unpleasant, indicating that travel is by no means universally
   distasteful. We present a bivariate probit model of the mental and
   physical fatigue associated with the trip, and binary logit models of
   whether the trip was pleasant (yes/no) or unpleasant (yes/no). For the
   most part, socioeconomic variables and indicators of trip length,
   distance, purpose, and mode have logical relationships to fatigue and
   pleasantness. However, 11 variables out of 31 common to both sets of
   models have impacts on fatigue that are opposite to those on
   un/pleasantness, pointing to conditions under which a trip can be
   fatiguing but pleasant, or conversely. Accordingly, a key contribution
   of the research is to demonstrate the value of jointly considering both
   constructs in order to more comprehensively capture the overall
   attitudes toward the travelling activity. It is also of interest that
   activities conducted during the trip appear in both sets of models. In
   particular, the results suggest that although listening to the
   radio/music decreases the tendency to rate the trip as mentally
   fatiguing, it tends to be seen as ameliorating the disutility of a
   tedious trip more than increasing the pleasantness of the trip. Among
   the policy-relevant findings, we note the especially negative attitudes
   towards multimodal trips and trips mainly involving driving cars.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated theoretical and computational
   investigation into the macroscopic behavior of composite materials
   containing multi-phase reinforcing particles with simultaneous nonlinear
   debonding along the microconstituent interfaces. The interfacial
   debonding is characterized by the nonlinear Park-Paulino-Roesler
   potential-based cohesive zone model. The extended Mori-Tanaka method is
   employed as the basis for the theoretical model, which enables
   micromechanical formulations for composite materials with high particle
   volume fractions. The computational analysis is performed using a
   three-dimensional finite element-based cohesive zone model with
   intrinsic cohesive elements. To place the generality and robustness of
   the proposed technique in perspective, we consider several examples of
   composite materials with single or double separation along the
   interfaces of coated particles. The effects of many microstructural
   parameters, such as the geometry of the microstructure, the location of
   debonding, the material properties of the coating layer (i.e. homogenous
   and functionally graded coatings), and the fracture parameters, are
   comprehensively investigated by both theoretical and numerical
   approaches. We verify that both theoretical and numerical results agree
   well with one another in estimating the macroscopic constitutive
   relationship of corresponding composite materials. The strong dependence
   of the overall response of composite materials on their microstructure
   is well recognized for all hardening, snap-back, and softening stages.}},

Abstract = {{Recent long-term studies showed an unsatisfactory recurrence rate of
   severe mitral regurgitation 3-5 years after surgical repair, suggesting
   that excessive tissue stresses and the resulting strain-induced tissue
   failure are potential etiological factors controlling the success of
   surgical repair for treating mitral valve (MV) diseases. We hypothesized
   that restoring normal MV tissue stresses in MV repair techniques would
   ultimately lead to improved repair durability through the restoration of
   MV normal homeostatic state. Therefore, we developed a micro- and macro-
   anatomically accurate MV finite element model by incorporating actual
   fiber microstructural architecture and a realistic structure-based
   constitutive model. We investigated MV closing behaviors, with extensive
   in vitro data used for validating the proposed model. Comparative and
   parametric studies were conducted to identify essential model fidelity
   and information for achieving desirable accuracy. More importantly, for
   the first time, the interrelationship between the local fiber ensemble
   behavior and the organ-level MV closing behavior was investigated using
   a computational simulation. These novel results indicated not only the
   appropriate parameter ranges, but also the importance of the
   microstructural tuning (i.e., straightening and re-orientation) of the
   collagen/elastin fiber networks at the macroscopic tissue level for
   facilitating the proper coaptation and natural functioning of the MV
   apparatus under physiological loading at the organ level. The proposed
   computational model would serve as a logical first step toward our
   long-term modeling goal-facilitating simulation-guided design of optimal
   surgical repair strategies for treating diseased MVs with significantly
   enhanced durability.}},

Abstract = {{We show useful seasonal deterministic and probabilistic prediction skill
   of streamflow and nutrient loading over watersheds in the Southeastern
   United States (SEUS) for the winter and spring seasons. The study
   accounts for forecast uncertainties stemming from the meteorological
   forcing and hydrological model uncertainty. Multi-model estimation from
   three hydrological models, each forced with an ensemble of forcing
   derived by matching observed analogues of forecasted quartile rainfall
   anomalies from a seasonal climate forecast is used. The attained useful
   hydrological prediction skill is despite the climate model
   overestimating rainfall by over 23\% over these SEUS watersheds in
   December-May period. The prediction skill in the month of April and May
   is deteriorated as compared to the period from December-March (zero lead
   forecast). A nutrient streamflow rating curve is developed using a log
   linear tool for this purpose. The skill in the prediction of seasonal
   nutrient loading is identical to the skill of seasonal streamflow
   forecast. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes an analysis of data obtained from an instrumented
   compressor of an operational, heavy duty industrial gas turbine; the
   goal of the aforementioned analysis is to understand some of the
   fundamental drivers, which may lead to compressor blade vibration.
   Methodologies are needed to (1) understand the fundamental drivers of
   compressor blade vibration, (2) quantify the severity of ``events,{''}
   which accelerate the likelihood of failure and reduce the remaining life
   of the blade, and (3) proactively detect when these issues are occurring
   so that the operator can take corrective action. The motivation for this
   analysis lies in understanding the correlations between different
   sensors, which may be used to measure the fundamental drivers and blade
   vibrations. In this study, a variety of dynamic data was acquired from
   an operating engine, including acoustic pressure, bearing vibration, tip
   timing, and traditional gas path measurements. The acoustic pressure
   sensors were installed on the first four compressor stages, while the
   tip timing was installed on the first stage only. These data show the
   presence of rotating stall instabilities in the front stages of the
   compressor, occurring during every startup and shutdown, and manifesting
   itself as increased amplitude oscillations in the dynamic pressure
   measurements, which are manifested in blade and bearing vibrations. The
   data that lead to these observations were acquired during several
   startup and shutdown events, and clearly show that the amplitude of
   these instabilities and the rpm at which they occur can vary
   substantially.}},

Abstract = {{We perform simulations on nanoimprinting metallic glasses to investigate
   the thermoplastic deformation and structural evolutions via molecular
   dynamics analysis. The atomic diffusion mechanisms, including single
   atomic and highly collective hopping, are observed in metallic glass
   block. Mold filling speed is significantly affected by the initial
   metallic glass film thickness, and the film with the thickness
   approaching the width of the pattern on mold is optimal to shorten mold
   filling time and save materials. With the support of a modified equation
   of plane Poiseuille flow, we analyze the resistance of boundary
   condition and capillary force, which have reasonably explained the
   thickness effect. We then show the structural evolutions to assess the
   impact of the mold filling process on the short-range and the
   middle-range orders in metallic glasses. Lower fractions of icosahedra
   and icosahedra-like clusters and smaller aggregated clusters have been
   detected in the processed structure than in the billets, showing that
   the processed metallic glasses are more symmetrical and have more
   disorder. The results further suggest that the mold filling process has
   broken the original structures in metallic glasses, resulting in less
   icosahedra and bond networks, which lead to a better plasticity in the
   processed metallic glasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Probabilistic Framework for Representing Dialog Systems and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for goal-driven
   spoken dialog systems. A new dynamic stochastic state (DS-state) is then
   defined to characterize the goal set of a dialog state at different
   stages of the dialog process. Furthermore, an entropy minimization
   dialog management (EMDM) strategy is also proposed to combine with the
   DS-states to facilitate a robust and efficient solution in reaching a
   user's goals. A song-on-demand task, with a total of 38 117 songs and 12
   attributes corresponding to each song, is used to test the performance
   of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation, assuming no errors,
   the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among all
   tested approaches, returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on
   average. Furthermore, in a practical scenario, with top five candidates
   to handle the unavoidable automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural
   language understanding (NLU) errors, the results show that only 61.7\%
   of the dialog goals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on
   average when random questions are asked by the system, whereas if the
   proposed DS-states are updated with the top five candidates from the SLU
   output using the proposed EMDM strategy executed at every DS-state, then
   a 86.7\% dialog success rate can be accomplished effectively within 5.17
   dialog turns on average. We also demonstrate that entropy-based DM
   strategies are more efficient than non-entropy based DM. Moreover, using
   the goal set distributions in EMDM, the results are better than those
   without them, such as in sate-of-the-art database summary DM.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated to
   provide photonic-aided precoding quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
   signal transmission in multi-antenna radio over fiber system to increase
   the throughput. For downlink, two different multi-level
   amplitude-shift-keying (MASK) modulated signals, such as 4-ASK signals,
   are applied on two uncorrelated optical Mach-Zehnder modulators at
   central office. After photonic-aided pre-coding module and
   photo-detection process, the received M-ASK mm-waves from two remote
   access units (RAUs) can be synthesized to a M-2-QAM signal in the
   proposed system. Regardless of forward error correction (FEC) coding
   overhead, the 4-Gb/s and 8-Gb/s 16-QAM mm-wave signals are obtained from
   two independent 2-Gb/s and 4-Gb/s 4-ASK 40-GHz channels, respectively.
   The experimental results show that a doubled bit rate of the original
   4-ASK one can be achieved without additional digital signal processing
   (DSP) in small cell RAUs and mobile users. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Engineering of spinning solution compositions, conditions and polymer
   molecular weight is described to create intrinsically defect-free
   thin-skinned precursors for high performance ester-crosslinked
   asymmetric hollow fiber membranes. The ultimate goal is to crosslink the
   precursors to provide robust performance for an aggressive natural gas
   teed. To provide insights free from CO2-induced changes in properties in
   the uncrosslinked samples, studies with less interacting O-2, N-2 and He
   feeds were also used to assess properties. The combined analyses
   indicate an absence of substructure resistance within the hollow fibers
   and an effective selective layer between 0.1 and 0.14 mu m. This
   thickness represents a valuable reduction over previously achievable
   values for this so-called propane-diol monoesterified crosslinkable
   polyimide (PDMC) polymer in defect-free asymmetric form, which were
   previously in the range of 0.5 mu m. Indeed, the significantly reduced
   skin layer thickness offers the potential to improve the gas separation
   productivity by 3.6X if this advantage can be carried forward into the
   ultimate crosslinked fibers. Additional comparisons to the free acid
   form of the precursor (without esterification) show advantages to the
   current less hydrophilic precursor in terms of ability to create a
   thinner precursor selective layer prior to crosslinking than for the
   free acid form. To date, the free acid analog to PDMC has only been able
   to be created with a 0.7 mu m selective layer vs the current 0.1-0.14 mu
   m skin reported here. Optimization of the crosslinking process for both
   precursors is beyond the scope of this work, since it is itself, complex
   and still underway. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   shows random flaws of about 2 nm size, which results in limiting tensile

Abstract = {{Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PAN/carbon nanotube (CNT) based carbon
   fibers at various CNT content have been processed and their structural
   development was investigated using high resolution transmission electron

   templating agents for the graphitic carbon structure development in
   their vicinity at the carbonization temperature of 1450 degrees C, which
   is far below the graphitization temperature of PAN based carbon fiber
   (>2200 degrees C). The addition of 1 wt\% CNT in the gel spun precursor
   fiber results in carbon fibers with a 68\% higher thermal conductivity
   when compared to the control gel spun PAN based carbon fiber, and a
   103\% and 146\% increase over commercially available IM7 and T300 carbon
   fibers, respectively. The electrical conductivity of the gel spun
   PAN/CNT based carbon fibers also showed improvement over the
   investigated commercially available carbon fibers. Increases in thermal
   and electrical conductivities are attributed to the formation of the
   highly ordered graphitic structure observed in the HR-TEM images. Direct

   properties in the PAN/CNT based carbon fiber suggest new applications

Title = {{Computational homogenization of the debonding of particle reinforced

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{209-224}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There are four primary factors which influence the macroscopic
   constitutive response of particle reinforced composites: component
   properties, component concentrations, interphases, and interfacial
   debonding. Interphases are often a byproduct of surface treatments
   applied to the particles to control agglomeration. Alternatively, in
   polymer based materials such as carbon-black reinforced rubber, an
   interphase or ``bound rubber{''} phase often occurs at the
   particle-matrix interface. This interphasial region has been known to
   exist for many decades, but is often omitted in computational
   investigations of such composites. In this paper, we present an
   investigation into the influence of interphases on the large deformation
   response of particle reinforced composites. In addition, since particles
   tend to debond from the matrix at large deformations, we investigate the
   influence of interfacial debonding on the macroscopic constitutive
   response. The investigation considers two different microstructures;
   both a simplified single particle model, and a more complex polydisperse
   representative unit cell. Cohesive elements, which follow the
   Park-Paulino-Roesler traction-separation relation, are inserted between
   each particle and its corresponding interphase to account for debonding.
   To account for friction, we present a new, coupled cohesive-friction
   model and detail its formulation and implementation. For each
   microstructure, we discuss the influence of the interphase thickness and
   stiffness on the global constitutive response in both uniaxial tension
   and simple shear. To validate the computational framework, comparisons
   are made with experimental results available in the literature. (C) 2015

   structures. Up to 2.5 m of read range is achieved by a proof-of-concept
   prototype patch antenna sensor with a strain sensitivity around -760
   Hz/mu epsilon, which is equivalent to a normalized strain sensitivity of
   -0.74 ppm/mu epsilon. In this paper, we propose to consider the change
   of the substrate dielectric constant due to strain when modeling the
   antenna sensor. An enhanced strain sensitivity model is introduced for
   more accurately estimating the strain sensing performance of the hereby
   introduced smart skin antenna sensor. Laboratory experiments are carried
   out to quantify the dielectric constant change under strain. The
   measurement results are incorporated into a mechanics-electromagnetics
   coupled simulation model. Accuracy of the multi-physics coupled
   simulation is improved by integrating dielectric constant change in the
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Microcystis aeruginosa (blue-green alga) commonly blooms in summer and
   Cyclotella meneghiniana (diatom) outbreaks in fall in the reservoirs
   that serve as drinking water sources in Southeast China. Herein, an
   evaluation of disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP) from
   them during chlorination should be conducted. Five DBPs including
   trichloromethane (TCM), trichloronitromethane (TCNM),
   dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), 1,1-dichloropropanone (1,1-DCP) and
   1,1,1-trichloropropanone (1,1,1-TCP) were monitored. The formation
   potential of TCM and TCNM was enhanced with the increase of reaction
   time and chlorine dosage, whereas that of DCAN, 1,1-DCP and 1,1,1-TCP
   increased first and then fell with continuing reaction time. M.
   aeruginosa showed higher DBPFP than C. meneghiniana, the yield of DBPs
   varied with components of algal cells. The DBPFP order from components
   of M. aeruginosa was cell suspension (CS) approximate to intracellular
   organic matter (IOM) > extracellular organic matter (EOM) > cell debris
   (CD), which indicated that IOM was the main DBP precursors for M.
   aeruginosa. The yields of DBPs from components of C. meneghiniana were
   in the order of CS > IOM approximate to CD approximate to EOM,
   suggesting that three components made similar contributions to the total
   DBP formation. The amount of IOM with higher DBPFP leaked from both
   algae species increased with the chlorine dosage, indicating that
   chlorine dosage should be considered carefully in the treatment of
   eutrophic water for less destroying of the cell integrity. Though
   fluorescence substances contained in both algae species varied
   significantly, the soluble microbial products (SMPs) and aromatic
   protein-like substances were the main cellular components that
   contributed to DBP formation for both algae. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{538-546}},

Abstract = {{Calcium peroxide (CP) combined persulfate (PS) oxidation is an emerging
   in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) technology for ground water
   remediation. Many field cases also confirm its effectiveness in ground
   water remediation while few research articles document it. This study
   investigated the performance of alpha-methylnaphthalene (MN) degradation
   by PS/CP to further understand this dual oxidant application in ISCO.
   Results showed that MN could be completely oxidized in 72 h with 1 g L-1
   PS and 1 g L-1 CP. The degradation rates of MN increased with the
   increase of PS and CP concentration. MN degradation was significantly
   enhanced with the solution pH decrease, because CF was easier to
   dissolve and generated more radicals in acidic condition. Solutes in
   ground water including chloride ions, alkalinity and natural organic
   matters presented inhibitory effect on MN degradation in this dual
   oxidant system. Plausible mechanisms of the sulfate and hydroxyl
   radicals in the system were proposed based on the results of radical
   scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests. It
   appeared that surface (OH)-O-center dot of CP was also responsible for
   the MN removal. The major oxidation products in this study were
   1-naphthaldehdye, naphthalene-1-ylmethanol and
   4-hydroxy-4-methylnaphthalen-1(4H)-one. To better understand PS/CP in
   ISCO, the degradation of MN was tested in ground water matrix, which
   showed satisfactory efficiency. The results of this study provided some
   detail information of PS/CP dual oxidant in degradation organic
   contaminants, which might provide some references for the application of
   this technology in ISCO. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of different bioethanol fermentation broths components

   in lignocellulosic hydrolysates) on the pervaporation performance of the
   vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) modified silicalite-1/PDMS/PAN thin-film
   composite membrane was detailedly investigated in this work. The results
   showed that succinic acid and glycerol are impermeable components,
   whereas formic acid, acetic acid, and furfural can permeate through the
   membrane. Succinic acid have no obvious influence on the membrane
   performance. Meanwhile, the composite membrane can effectively remove
   formic acid, acetic acid, and furfural present in lignocellulosic
   hydrolysates. The maximum furfural/water selectivity of 95 and furfural
   flux of 130 g/m(2) h were obtained with adding 15 g/L furfural into 2
   wt.\% ethanol binary solution at the feed temperature of 35 degrees C.
   This research reveals a novel detoxification method of lignocellulosic

   properties of the modified membrane. The contact angle and zeta
   potential decreased significantly after modification. A small increase
   in rejection capacity for the selected pharmaceuticals after
   modification was observed. The modified membrane also displayed less
   tendency to be fouled by humic acid than the virgin one. The pH of the
   feed solution had less impact on the rejection of pharmaceuticals by the
   modified membrane than the virgin membrane, which was likely due to
   changes in the zeta potential and functional groups of the modified
   membrane. We demonstrated that adsorption plays a significant role in
   TCS removal but not in the removal of MTP and SMX. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel comprehensive operation and self-healing
   strategy for a distribution system with both dispatchable and
   nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs). In the normal operation
   mode, the control objective of the system is to minimize the operation
   costs and maximize the revenues. A rolling-horizon optimization method
   is used to schedule the outputs of dispatchable DGs based on forecasts.
   In the self-healing mode, the on-outage portion of the distribution
   system will be optimally sectionalized into networked self-supplied
   microgrids (MGs) so as to provide reliable power supply to the maximum
   loads continuously. The outputs of the dispatchable DGs will be
   rescheduled accordingly too. In order to take into account the
   uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumptions, we formulate the
   problems as a stochastic program. A scenario reduction method is applied
   to achieve a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the
   computational burden. A modified IEEE 123-node distribution system is
   used as a test system. The results of case studies demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{A microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC) was used to
   produce hydrogen gas from fermentation wastewater without the need for
   additional electrical energy. Increasing the number of cell pairs in the
   reverse electrodialysis stack from 5 to 10 doubled the maximum current
   produced from 60 A/m(3) to 120 A/m(3) using acetate. However, more rapid
   COD removal required a decrease in the anolyte hydraulic retention time
   (HRT) from 24 to 12 h to stabilize anode potentials. Hydrogen production
   using a fermentation wastewater (10 cell pairs, HRT = 8 h) reached 0.9
   +/- 0.1 L H-2/L-reactor/d (1.1 +/- 0.1 L H-2/g-COD), with 58 +/- 5\% COD
   removal and a coulombic efficiency of 74 +/- 5\%. These results
   demonstrated that consistent rates of hydrogen gas production could be
   achieved using an MREC if effluent anolyte COD concentrations are
   sufficient to produce stable anode potentials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Present results and experience show that currently used brake pads for
   carbon-based or conventional systems limits the broader use of C/C-SiC
   composites. In this work, the C/C-SiC brake composites were modified by
   in situ grown carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on carbon fibers surface,
   pyrolytic carbon (PyC) matrix was fabricated by chemical vapor
   infiltration, and SiC ceramic matrix was fabricated by liquid silicon
   infiltration. The effects of CNFs on the tribological properties and
   mechanisms of the friction pairs of C/C-SiC composites mating with
   metallic counterpart were investigated. The results indicated that the
   density and open porosity of the materials were 2.18 g/cm(3) and 6.3\%,
   respectively. Due to the growth of CNFs, a better bonding interface
   formed between PyC and carbon fibers, and leaded to excellent
   tribological characteristics of C/C-SiC composites. Compared to the
   C/C-SiC composites without CNFs modification, the C/C-SiC composites in
   this work showed higher static friction coefficient (0.38) and dynamic
   friction coefficient (0.29). As a result the composites braked steadily,
   with lower temperature on friction subsurface (396 degrees C), and the
   linear wear rates of C/C-SiC with CNFs modification and counterpart were
   2.23 mu m cycle(-1) and 1.24 pm cycle(-1), respectively, which were
   superior in wear resistance. The brake process of the friction pairs of
   C/C-SiC with CNFs modification mating with metallic counterpart could be
   divided into three stages, and the main wear mechanisms consisted of
   grain abrasion, fatigue wear, adhesive wear and oxidation abrasion. (C)

Abstract = {{Inductive power transfer technology has become a popular solution for
   battery charging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, problems such as
   varied magnetic coupling caused by coil misalignment still limit its
   practical applications, by safety and stability issues. Meanwhile, the
   growing market of EVs asks for a universal charger for various models.
   This paper presents the design process of a universal inductive charger
   (UIC) for EVs. The proposed UIC is capable of adaptively providing a
   constant or controllable charging voltage to various EVs, with a wide
   range of varied magnetic coupling between the transmitting and receiving
   coils. With a series-connected LC circuit, zero-voltage switching of the
   primary dc-ac inverter is universally realized in every charging cycle.
   A simple yet effective control method based on the frequency variation
   is used to automatically select the optimal frequency in different
   coupling conditions and adjust the frequency during the charging
   process. The design of the charging interface is also optimized with
   higher efficiency and power-transfer capability. Simulations and
   prototypes validate that the proposed UIC is accurate, robust, and
   applicable.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally and numerically study the statistical properties of a

   obtained from experiments is better fitted by a Laplacian distribution;
   both in experiments and simulations, the distribution pattern of the
   differential signal obtained from two independent intensities, as well
   as of that computed from its high-order finite differences, converges to
   a well-fitted Gaussian profile for high pump currents. This helps us to
   understand the changes in statistical properties of the intensity with
   varying control parameters and achieve desired entropy sources for
   random number generators. Furthermore, in numerical simulations, we find
   the distribution of the differential signal undergoes a marked
   transition from a Gaussian to Laplacian profile as the feedback rate
   increases at low to moderate pump currents.}},

Abstract = {{A novel inkjet printing technology is introduced as a process to coat
   metal microneedle arrays with three anticancer agents 5-fluororacil,
   curcumin and cisplatin for transdermal delivery. The hydrophilic graft
   copolymer Soluplus (R) was used as a drug carrier and the coating
   formulations consisted of drug-polymer solutions at various ratios. A
   piezoelectric dispenser jetted microdroplets on the microneedle surface
   to develop uniform, accurate and reproducible coating layers without any
   material losses. Inkjet printing was found to depend on the nozzle size,
   the applied voltage (mV) and the duration of the pulse (mu s). The drug
   release rates were determined in vitro using Franz type diffusion cells
   with dermatomed porcine skin. The drug release rates depended on the
   drug-polymer ratio, the drug lipophilicity and the skin thickness. All
   drugs presented increased release profiles (750 mu m skin thickness),
   which were retarded for 900 mu m skin thickness. Soluplus assisted the
   drug release especially for the water insoluble curcumin and cisplatin
   due to its solubilizing capacity. Inkjet printing has been shown to be
   an effective technology for coating of metal microneedles which can then
   be used for further transdermal drug delivery applications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We in this study investigated a novel electrochemical approach combining
   electro-enzyme and electrocoagulation to precipitate bisphenol A (BPA)
   from water containing humic acid (HA). Horseradish peroxidase was
   immobilized on the graphite felt of Ti electrode as HRP-GF/Ti cathode,
   with aluminum plate anode establishing a pair of working electrodes. BPA
   was 100\% removed and the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC)
   reached 95.1\% after 20-min sequencing treatment with the current
   density of 2.3 mA/cm(2). Real wastewater (TOC= 28.76 mg/L, BPA =4.1 mu
   g/L) also can achieve 94\% BPA removal and 52\% TOC reduction after
   sequencing treatment. Additionally, coupled electro-system with
   continuous flow only required energy of 0.016 kWh/m(3) to achieve
   simultaneous 90\% BPA and 85\% TOC removal. As indicated in the
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry and FTIR spectra, the electro-enzymatic
   process not only oxidized BPA into dimer and BPA-3,4-quinone, but also
   greatly altered the chemical and structural features of HA, where
   hydrophilic moieties (phenolic and alcohols) transformed into
   hydrophobic forms (ethers, quinone and aliphatic). These polymerized
   products were effectively separated from aquous solution during anodic
   electrocoagulation, leading to significant removal of BPA and TOC. Thus,
   the coupled process may provide a faster and less energy strategy to
   control certain emerging contaminants in water/wastewater treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, the impact of annealing treatment on the ionic transfer
   and storage stability of 70Li(2)S -30P(2)S(5) glass-ceramic solid
   electrolyte (SE) pellets are investigated. The ionic conductivity is
   enhanced from 1 to 1.5 mS cm(-1), while the total interfacial resistance
   of Li/SE/Li cell is reduced by over an order of magnitude with
   increasing annealing temperature up to 250 degrees C. Higher annealing
   temperature induced formation of a low conductivity Li4P2S6 phase, which
   increased ionic and interfacial resistances. Storage stability is also
   improved by annealing treatments. Preparation of exemplary Li4Ti5O12
   (LTO) electrodes involving mechanical milling with SE particles
   undesirably induces formation of a TiS2 phase at the interfaces.
   Annealing the cells at 250 degrees C induces further reaction between
   LTO and SE, increasing TiS2 content and reducing cell rate performance.
   High reactivity between metal oxides and sulfide-based SE may be an
   obstacle for the preparation of high performance rechargeable solid

Abstract = {{Efficient penetration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles (NPs)
   inside solid tissues and tumors is paramount to their therapeutic and
   diagnostic success. While many studies have reported the effect of NP
   size and charge on intratissue distribution, role of shape, and aspect
   ratio on NP transport inside solid tissues remain unclear. Here
   experimental and theoretical studies are reported on how nanoscale
   geometry of Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography-fabricated,
   polyethylene-glycol-based anionic nanohydrogels affect their penetration
   and distribution inside 3D spheroids, a model representing the
   intervascular region of solid, tumor-like tissues. Unexpectedly, low
   aspect ratio cylindrical NPs (H/D approximate to 0.3; disk-like
   particles, 100 nm height, and 325 nm diameter) show maximal intratissue
   delivery (>50\% increase in total cargo delivered) and more uniform
   penetration compared to nanorods or smaller NPs of the same shape. This
   is in contrast to spherical NPs where smaller NP size resulted in
   deeper, more uniform penetration. Our results provide fundamental new
   knowledge on NP transport inside solid tissues and further establish
   shape and aspect ratio as important design parameters in developing more
   efficient, better penetrating, nanocarriers for drug, or contrast-agent
   delivery.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Microstructure in polycrystalline materials is composed of grain
   boundary plane, triple junction line, and vertex point. They are the
   integral parts of the grain boundary network structure and the
   foundation for the structure-property relations. In polycrystalline,
   especially nanocrystalline, materials, it becomes increasingly difficult
   to probe the atomistic structure of the microstructure components
   directly in experiment due to the size limitation. Here, we present a
   numerical approach using pair correlation function from atomistic
   simulation to obtain the detailed information for atomic order and
   disorder in the grain boundary network in nanocrystalline materials. We
   show that the atomic structures in the different microstructural
   components are related closely to their geometric size and shape,
   leading to unique signatures for atomic structure in microstructural
   characterization at nanoscales. The dependence varies systematically
   with the characteristic dimension of the microstructural component:
   liquid-like disorder is found in vertex points, but a certain order
   persists in triple junctions and grain boundaries along the extended
   dimensions of these microstructure components. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Understanding how to control transport properties of zeolitic

   and adsorbents to a wide spectrum of gas and vapor separations: In this
   work, we report a facile post-synthetic thermal modification (PSTM)
   technique to tailor ZIFs' transport properties by balancing diffusivity
   and diffusion selectivity. With controllable dissociation of framework
   methyl groups from a precursor ZIF (ZIF-8), we have prepared thermally
   modified ZIFs showing substantially increased n-butane diffusivity and
   attractive n/iso-butane diffusion selectivity. Hybrid ZIP/polymer
   mixed-matrix membranes formed using these thermally modified ZIFs are
   expected to deliver attractive butane isomer separation performance.
   Membranes based on such materials can potentially be used to retrofit
   refinery alkylation units for producing premium gasoline blending

Abstract = {{This work is part of our continuing efforts to address engineering
   issues related to the removal of tritiated water from off-gases produced
   in used nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. In the current study,
   adsorption equilibrium of water on molecular sieve 3A beads was
   investigated. Adsorption isotherms for water on the UOP molecular sieve
   3A were measured by a continuous-flow adsorption system at 298, 313,
   333, and 353 K. Experimental data collected were analyzed by the
   Generalized Statistical Thermodynamic Adsorption (GSTA) isotherm model.
   The K+/Na+ molar ratio of this particular type of molecular sieve 3A was
   similar to 4:6. Our results showed that the GSTA isotherm model worked
   very well to describe the equilibrium behavior of water adsorption on
   molecular sieve 3A. The optimum number of parameters for the current
   experimental data was determined to be a set of four equilibrium
   parameters. This result suggests that the adsorbent crystals contain
   four energetically distinct adsorption sites. In addition, it was found
   that water adsorption on molecular sieve 3A follows a three-stage
   adsorption process. This three-stage adsorption process confirmed
   different water adsorption sites in molecular sieve crystals. The second
   adsorption stage is significantly affected by the K+/Na+ molar ratio. In
   this stage, the equilibrium adsorption capacity at a given water vapor
   pressure increases as the K+/Na+ molar ratio increases.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 90\% of natural lightning occurs over land, but recent
   observations, using Global Lightning Detection (GLD360) geolocation peak
   current estimates and satellite optical data, suggested that
   cloud-to-ground flashes are on average stronger over the ocean. We
   present initial statistics from a novel experiment using a Low Frequency
   (LF) magnetic field receiver system installed aboard the National
   Oceanic Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) Ronald W. Brown research vessel that
   allowed the detection of impulsive radio emissions from deep-oceanic
   discharges at short distances. Thousands of LF waveforms were recorded,
   facilitating the comparison of oceanic waveforms to their land
   counterparts. A computationally efficient electromagnetic radiation
   model that accounts for propagation over lossy and curved ground is
   constructed and compared with previously published models. We include
   the effects of Earth curvature on LF ground wave propagation and
   quantify the effects of channel-base current risetime, channel-base
   current falltime, and return stroke speed on the radiated LF waveforms
   observed at a given distance. We compare simulation results to data and
   conclude that previously reported larger GLD360 peak current estimates
   over the ocean are unlikely to fully result from differences in
   channel-base current risetime, falltime, or return stroke speed between
   ocean and land flashes.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for
   lithium-ion batteries and exhibit a high reversible capacity exceeding
   250mAhg(-1). However, voltage fade is the major problem that needs to be
   overcome before they can find practical applications. Here,
   Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (LLMO) oxides are subjected to nanoscale
   LiFePO4 (LFP) surface modification. The resulting materials combine the
   advantages of both bulk doping and surface coating as the LLMO crystal
   structure is stabilized through cationic doping, and the LLMO cathode
   materials are protected from corrosion induced by organic electrolytes.
   An LLMO cathode modified with 5wt\% LFP (LLMO-LFP5) demonstrated
   suppressed voltage fade and a discharge capacity of 282.8mAhg(-1) at
   0.1C with a capacity retention of 98.1\% after 120 cycles. Moreover, the

Title = {{Evidence for bandgap opening in buckled epitaxial graphene from

Abstract = {{We utilize ultrafast time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as a
   direct, sensitive, and non-contact all-optical probe to investigate the
   hot-carrier relaxation and cooling dynamics of buckled epitaxial
   graphene. This special form of graphene is grown epitaxially on
   nitrogen-seeded single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC(000 (1) over bar))
   substrates by thermal decomposition of Si atoms. The pre-deposited
   interfacial nitrogen atoms pin the first graphene layer to the SiC
   substrate, and cause it and subsequent graphene layers to buckle into
   nanoscale folds, which opens an energy gap of up to similar to 0.7 eV.
   We observe a remarkable increase of up to two orders of magnitude in the
   relaxation rate of the THz carrier dynamics of this semiconducting form
   of epitaxial graphene relative to pristine epitaxial graphene, which we
   attribute to a large enhancement of the optical-phonon-mediated carrier
   cooling and recombination over a wide range of electron temperatures due
   to the finite bandgap. Our results suggest that the introduced bandgap
   is spatially non-homogenous, with local values close to the optical
   phonon energy of similar to 200 meV, which allows the conduction and the
   valence band to be bridged by optical phonon emission. We also
   demonstrate that carrier relaxation times can be modified by orders of
   magnitude by careful bandgap engineering, which could find application
   in novel graphene-based devices that incorporate both metallic and
   semiconducting forms of graphene. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{A retrospective study of californium-252 neutron brachytherapy combined
   with EBRT versus 3D-CRT in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell
   cancer}},
Journal = {{RADIATION ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: We conducted a retrospective analysis on 884 patients who
   were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and
   treated with either the neutron brachytherapy in combination with
   external beam radiotherapy (NBT + EBRT) or 3-dimensional conformal
   radiation therapy (3D-CRT) to determine the differences in efficacy and
   morbidity between the two treatment groups.
   Methods: The 884 ESCC patients treated with either NBT + EBRT or 3D-CRT
   between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.
   Multivariable Cox regression was used to compare oncologic outcomes of
   the two groups of patients in the context of other clinically relevant
   variables. The acute and chronic toxicities associated with the two
   groups were compared using Fisher exact and log-rank tests,
   respectively.
   Results: Among the 884 patients, 545 received NBT + EBRT and 339
   received 3D-CRT (i.e. EBRT-only). The age range is 39-95 years (median
   66). The follow-up time range is 3-145 months (median 32). The analysis
   shows that the NBT + EBRT group has higher overall survival rate and
   local control rate than that of the 3D-CRT group. The acute toxicity
   effects were acceptable for both groups of patients with the NBT + EBRT
   group showing higher rates of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia and the
   3D-CRT group showing higher rates on fistula and massive bleeding.
   Conclusions: The patients treated with NBT + EBRT showed better
   oncologic outcomes than those treated with 3D-CRT. The toxicity effects
   were acceptable for both groups with the NBT + EBRT group showing higher
   rates on the acute effects and the 3D-CRT group showing higher rates on
   the late effects.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between muscle activity and behavioral output
   determines how the brain controls and modifies complex skills. In vocal
   control, ensembles of muscles are used to precisely tune single acoustic
   parameters such as fundamental frequency and sound amplitude. If
   individual vocal muscles were dedicated to the control of single
   parameters, then the brain could control each parameter independently by
   modulating the appropriate muscle or muscles. Alternatively, if each
   muscle influenced multiple parameters, a more complex control strategy
   would be required to selectively modulate a single parameter.
   Additionally, it is unknown whether the function of single muscles is
   fixed or varies across different vocal gestures. A fixed relationship
   would allow the brain to use the same changes in muscle activation to,
   for example, increase the fundamental frequency of different vocal
   gestures, whereas a context-dependent scheme would require the brain to
   calculate different motor modifications in each case. We tested the
   hypothesis that single muscles control multiple acoustic parameters and
   that the function of single muscles varies across gestures using three
   complementary approaches. First, we recorded electromyographic data from
   vocal muscles in singing Bengalese finches. Second, we electrically
   perturbed the activity of single muscles during song. Third, we
   developed an ex vivo technique to analyze the biomechanical and acoustic
   consequences of single-muscle perturbations. We found that single
   muscles drive changes in multiple parameters and that the function of
   single muscles differs across vocal gestures, suggesting that the brain
   uses a complex, gesture-dependent control scheme to regulate vocal
   output.}},

   Adsorption: Parametric Studies on Depressurization}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using adsorbent-coated microchannels for a pressure
   swing adsorption (PSA) process for carbon dioxide removal is
   investigated by analyzing the effectiveness of depressurization. As a
   result of large adsorbent particle size and the correspondingly large
   mass transfer resistances and a diffusion-based process design, the
   cycle times for conventional adsorbent-bed-based PSA processes are long,
   and gas removal capacities normalized with adsorbent mass are modest.
   However, this computational investigation of the depressurization stage
   that involves the pressure, temperature, and adsorbent capacity response
   in a microchannel analogous to bed depressurization for Zeolite SA and
   13X and activated carbon shows that gas removal capacities during
   depressurization are greater than those for a conventional bed-based PSA
   process under the same operating pressure limits, feed compositions, and
   stage times. An activated carbon monolith yields the highest operating
   gas removal capacity during depressurization when compared to other
   adsorbents as a result of the smaller selectivity of the activated
   carbon. A parametric study on the microchannel geometry shows that an
   increase in channel size aids in fast depressurization because of the
   reduced frictional resistance at the microchannel walls. It is found
   that the use of adsorbent microchannels in adsorption purification
   techniques can yield benefits through the reduction of total cycle time
   and overall plant capacity.}},

Title = {{Hybrid dispersive media with controllable wave propagation: A new take
   on smart materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on the wave transmission characteristics of a
   hybrid one dimensional (1D) medium. The hybrid characteristic is the
   result of the coupling between a 1D mechanical waveguide in the form of
   an elastic beam, supporting the propagation of transverse waves and a
   discrete electrical transmission line, consisting of a series of
   inductors connected to ground through capacitors. The capacitors
   correspond to a periodic array of piezoelectric patches that are bonded
   to the beam and that couple the two waveguides. The coupling leads to a
   hybrid medium that is characterized by a coincidence condition for the
   frequency/wavenumber value corresponding to the intersection of the
   branches of the two waveguides. In the frequency range centered at
   coincidence, the hybrid medium features strong attenuation of wave
   motion as a result of the energy transfer towards the electrical
   transmission line. This energy transfer, and the ensuing attenuation of
   wave motion, is alike the one obtained through internal resonating units
   of the kind commonly used in metamaterials. However, the distinct shape
   of the dispersion curves suggests how this energy transfer is not the
   result of a resonance and is therefore fundamentally different. This
   paper presents the numerical investigation of the wave propagation in
   the considered media, it illustrates experimental evidence of wave
   transmission characteristics and compares the performance of the
   considered configuration with that of internal resonating metamaterials.
   In addition, the ability to conveniently tune the dispersion properties
   of the electrical transmission line is exploited to adapt the
   periodicity of the domain and to investigate diatomic periodic
   configurations that are characterized by a richer dispersion spectrum
   and broader bandwidth of wave attenuation at coincidence. The medium
   consisting of mechanical, piezoelectric, and analog electronic elements
   can be easily interfaced to digital devices to offer a novel approach to
   smart materials. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Azobenzene dyes have large refractive index near their main resonance,
   but the poor figure of merit (FOM) limits their potential for
   all-optical applications. To improve this situation, disperse red 1
   (DR1) molecules were dispersed in a sol-gel germanium/Ormosil
   organic-inorganic hybrid matrix. Z-scan measurement results showed a
   good compatibility between the dopant and the matrix, and also, an
   improved FOM was obtained as compared to the DR1/polymer films reported
   previously. To demonstrate the all-optical signal processing effect, a
   cw Nd:YAG laser emitting at 532 nm and a He-Ne laser emitting at 632.8
   nm were used as pump and probe beams, respectively. DR1 acts as an
   initiator of the photo-induced transient holographic grating, which is
   attributed to the trans-cis-trans photoisomerization. Thus, a three
   inputs AND all-optical logic gate was achieved by using choppers with
   different frequencies. The detailed mechanism of operation is discussed.
   These results indicate that the DR1 doped germanium/Ormosil
   organic-inorganic hybrid film with an improved FOM has a great potential
   in all-optical devices around its main resonance. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Part I of this study presented a computational model-based approach for
   enhancing the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with
   designed microarchitecture. The performance of such SOFCs was predicted
   to greatly improve through a systematic computational design and

   fabrication and characterization that microarchitectured SOFC
   performance can be improved as predicted by the model. A real and
   specific SOFC is chosen, fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the
   proof-of-concept. Fabrication techniques using sintering and laser
   ablation are demonstrated. Pore size and geometry are characterized by
   interferometry-based surface profilometry and scanning electron
   microscopy. SOFC button cell performance testing including power output
   performance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are performed.
   The results show that SOFC performance in a microarchitectured cell can
   be improved over a baseline button cell by 9-17\% in current density and
   by 7-19\% in power density. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric composition is governed by the interplay of emissions,
   chemistry, deposition, and transport. Substantial questions surround
   each of these processes, especially in forested environments with strong
   biogenic emissions. Utilizing aircraft observations acquired over a
   forest in the southeast U.S., we calculate eddy covariance fluxes for a
   suite of reactive gases and apply the synergistic information derived
   from this analysis to quantify emission and deposition fluxes, oxidant
   concentrations, aerosol uptake coefficients, and other key parameters.
   Evaluation of results against state-of-the-science models and
   parameterizations provides insight into our current understanding of
   this system and frames future observational priorities. As a near-direct
   measurement of fundamental process rates, airborne fluxes offer a new
   tool to improve biogenic and anthropogenic emissions inventories,
   photochemical mechanisms, and deposition parameterizations.}},

Abstract = {{Fibronectin(Fn) is a promiscuous ligand for numerous cell adhesion
   receptors or integrins. The vast majority of Fn-integrin interactions
   are mediated through the Fn Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif located within the
   tenth type III repeat. In the case of integrins alpha IIb beta 3 and
   alpha 5 beta 1, the integrin binds RGD and the synergy site (PHSRN)
   located within the adjacent ninth type III repeat. Prior work has shown
   that these synergy-dependent integrins are exquisitely sensitive to
   perturbations in the Fn integrin binding domain conformation. Our own
   prior studies of epithelial cell responses to recombinant fragments of
   the Fn integrin binding domain led us to hypothesize that integrin alpha
   3 beta 1 binding may also be modulated by the synergy site. To explore
   this hypothesis, we created a variety of recombinant variants of the Fn
   integrin binding domain: (i) a previously reported (Leu -> Pro)
   stabilizing mutant (FnIII9'10), (ii) an Arg to Ala synergy site mutation
   (FnIII9(R)->(A)10), (iii) a two-Gly (FnIII9(2G)10) insertion, and (iv) a
   four-Gly (FNIII9(4G)10) insertion in the interdomain linker region and
   used surface plasmon resonance to determine binding kinetics of integrin
   alpha 3 beta 1 to the Fn fragments. Integrin alpha 3 beta 1 had the
   highest affinity for FnIII9'10 and FnIII9(2G)10. Mutation within the
   synergy site decreased integrin alpha 3 beta 1 binding 17-fold, and the
   four-Gly insertion decreased binding 39-fold compared with FnIII9'10.
   Cell attachment studies demonstrate that alpha 3 beta 1-mediated
   epithelial cell binding is greater on FnIII9'10 compared with the other
   fragments. These studies suggest that the presence and spacing of the
   RGD and synergy sites modulate integrin alpha 3 beta 1 binding to Fn.}},

Title = {{Factor XIIIa-dependent retention of red blood cells in clots is mediated
   by fibrin alpha-chain crosslinking}},

Pages = {{1940-1948}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Factor XIII(a) {[}FXIII(a)] stabilizes clots and increases resistance to
   fibrinolysis and mechanical disruption. FXIIIa also mediates red blood
   cell (RBC) retention in contracting clots and determines venous thrombus
   size, suggesting FXIII(a) is a potential target for reducing thrombosis.
   However, the mechanism by which FXIIIa retains RBCs in clots is unknown.
   We determined the effect of FXIII(a) on human and murine clot weight and
   composition. Real-time microscopy revealed extensive RBC loss from clots
   formed in the absence of FXIIIa activity, and RBCs exhibited transient
   deformation as they exited the clots. Fibrin band-shift assays and flow
   cytometry did not reveal crosslinking of fibrin or FXIIIa substrates to
   RBCs, suggesting FXIIIa does not crosslink RBCs directly to the clot.
   RBCs were retained in clots from mice deficient in alpha(2)-antiplasmin,
   thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, or fibronectin, indicating
   RBC retention does not depend on these FXIIIa substrates. RBC retention
   in clots was positively correlated with fibrin network density; however,
   FXIIIa inhibition reduced RBC retention at all network densities. FXIIIa
   inhibition reduced RBC retention in clots formed with fibrinogen that
   lacks gamma-chain crosslinking sites, but not in clots that lack
   alpha-chain crosslinking sites. Moreover, FXIIIa inhibitor
   concentrations that primarily block alpha-, but not gamma-, chain
   crosslinking decreased RBC retention in clots. These data indicate
   FXIIIa-dependent retention of RBCs in clots is mediated by fibrin
   alpha-chain crosslinking. These findings expose a newly recognized,
   essential role for fibrin crosslinking during whole blood clot formation
   and consolidation and establish FXIIIa activity as a key determinant of
   thrombus composition and size.}},

Abstract = {{Selectins facilitate the recruitment of circulating cells from the
   bloodstream by mediating rolling adhesion, which initiates the cell-cell
   signaling that directs extravasation into surrounding tissues. To
   measure the relative efficiency of cell adhesion in shear flow for in
   vitro drug screening, we designed and implemented a microfluidic-based
   analytical cell adhesion chromatography system. The juxtaposition of
   instantaneous rolling velocities with elution times revealed that human
   metastatic cancer cells, but not human leukocytes, had a reduced
   capacity to sustain rolling adhesion with P-selectin. We define a new
   parameter, termed adhesion persistence, which is conceptually similar to
   migration persistence in the context of chemotaxis, but instead
   describes the capacity of cells to resist the influence of shear flow
   and sustain rolling interactions with an adhesive substrate that might
   modulate the probability of extravasation. Among cell types assayed,
   adhesion persistence to P-selectin was specifically reduced in
   metastatic but not leukocyte-like cells in response to a low dose of
   heparin. In conclusion, we demonstrate this as an effective methodology
   to identify selectin adhesion antagonist doses that modulate homing cell
   adhesion and engraftment in a cell-subtype-selective manner.}},

Title = {{Support for the slip hypothesis from whisker-related tactile perception
   of rats in a noisy environment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Rodents use active whisker movements to explore their environment. The
   ``slip hypothesis{''} of whisker-related tactile perception entails that
   short-lived kinematic events (abrupt whisker movements, called
   ``slips{''}, due to bioelastic whisker properties that occur during
   active touch of textures) carry the decisive texture information.
   Supporting this hypothesis, previous studies have shown that slip
   amplitude and frequency occur in a texture-dependent way. Further,
   experiments employing passive pulsatile whisker deflections revealed
   that perceptual performance based on pulse kinematics (i.e., signatures
   that resemble slips) is far superior to the one based on time-integrated
   variables like frequency and intensity. So far, pulsatile stimuli were
   employed in a noise free environment. However, the realistic scenario
   involves background noise (e.g., evoked by rubbing across the texture).
   Therefore, if slips are used for tactile perception, the tactile
   neuronal system would need to differentiate slip-evoked spikes from
   those evoked by noise. To test the animals under these more realistic
   conditions, we presented passive whisker-deflections to head-fixed
   trained rats, consisting of ``slip-like{''} events (waveforms mimicking
   slips occurring with touch of real textures) embedded into background
   noise. Varying the (i) shapes (ramp or pulse); (0 kinematics (amplitude,
   velocity, etc.); and (iii) the probabilities of occurrence of slip-like
   events, we observed that rats could readily detect slip-like events of
   different shapes against noisy background. Psychophysical curves
   revealed that the difference of slip event and noise amplitude
   determined perception, while increased probability of occurrence
   (frequency) had barely any effect. These results strongly support the
   notion that encoding of kinematics dominantly determines whisker-related
   tactile perception while the computation of frequency or intensity plays
   a minor role.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently shown that two-dimensional (2D) and force-regulated
   kinetics of TCR-peptide-bound MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions predict
   responses of CD8(+) T cells. To test whether these findings are
   applicable to CD4(+) T cells, we analyzed the in situ 3.L2 TCR-pMHC-II
   interactions for a well-characterized panel of altered peptide ligands
   on the T cell surface using the adhesion frequency assay with a
   micropipette and the thermal fluctuation and force-clamp assays with a
   biomembrane force probe. We found that the 2D effective TCR-pMHC-II
   affinity and off-rate correlate with, but better predict the T cell
   response than, the corresponding measurements with the surface plasmon
   resonance in three dimensions. The 2D affinity of the CD4 for MHC-II was
   very low, approaching the detection limit, making it one to two orders
   of magnitude lower than the affinity of CD8 for MHC-I. In addition, the
   signal-dependent cooperation between TCR and coreceptor for pMHC binding
   previously observed for CD8 was not observed for CD4. Interestingly,
   force elicited TCR-pMHC-II catch-slip bonds for agonists but slip-only
   bonds for antagonists, thereby amplifying the power of discrimination
   between altered peptide ligands. These results show that the
   force-regulated 2D binding kinetics of the 3.L2 TCR for pMHC-II
   determine functions of CD4(+) T cells.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{A low voltage electropolishing of metal wires is attractive for
   nanotechnology because it provides centimeter long and micrometer thick
   probes with the tip radius of tens of nanometers. Using X-ray
   nanotomography we studied morphological transformations of the surface
   of tungsten wires in a specially designed electrochemical cell where the
   wire is vertically submersed into the KOH electrolyte. It is shown that
   stability and uniformity of the probe span is supported by a porous
   shell growing at the surface of tungsten oxide and shielding the wire
   surface from flowing electrolyte. It is discovered that the kinetics of
   shell growth at the triple line, where meniscus meets the wire, is very
   different from that of the bulk of electrolyte. Many metals follow
   similar electrochemical transformations hence the discovered
   morphological transformations of metal surfaces are expected to play
   significant role in many natural and technological applications.}},

Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{130-143}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear mechanics of layered composites
   that include a stiff elastic constituent and a soft viscoelastic
   constituent. Layered composites buckle with an infinite wavelength at
   small compressive strains in the case of a high volume fraction of the
   stiff constituent (the non-dilute case). An iterative algorithm is
   derived for the finite deformation of viscoelastic non-dilute layered
   composites with neo-Hookean phases. After validation by comparison to
   nonlinear finite element simulations, we analyze the effect of initial
   layer direction, strain rate, and prestrain on the response to
   time-dependent prescribed compressive strains. Interestingly, these
   composites have both a very high stiffness prior to buckling and a large
   energy dissipation capacity in the postbuckling regime. When these
   composites are subjected to cyclic strains of small amplitude, the
   effective stiffness and damping properties can be tuned by orders of
   magnitude by adjusting the prestrain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{492}},
Pages = {{400-411}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{To achieve greater hydrophilicity and improved antifouling ability, an
   ultrafiltration (UF) membrane was modified using a surface coating of
   raw and functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).
   Initially, raw MWCNTs were chemically treated to prepare MWCNTs with
   carboxylic groups (MWCNTs-COOH) and MWCNTs with polyethylene glycol
   groups (MWCNTs-PEG), and their physicochemical properties were
   systematically characterized. The results indicated that the MWCNTs-COOH
   exhibited the strongest negative charge among the three investigated
   MWCNTs, whereas the MWCNTs-PEG exhibited the best dispersion ability.
   Subsequently, the UF membranes were coated with the three MWCNTs, and
   the surface morphologies and permeability of the modified membranes
   under different transmembrane pressure (TMP) levels were compared.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   images demonstrated that the modified membranes had a rougher surface
   than the virgin membrane because of the modification layer of MWCNTs.
   The pure water flux values of all the modified membranes were slightly
   reduced in comparison with that of the virgin membrane, but the flux
   sacrifice was very minor. Three natural organic matter (NOM) models,
   humic acid (HA), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate (SA),
   were employed to investigate the antifouling potentials of the
   membranes. The modified membranes exhibited strikingly improved
   antifouling properties compared with those of virgin membrane for all of
   the tested NOM foulants, which was probably a consequence of the
   decreased direct membrane-foulant contact due to the MWCNT coating
   layer. In addition, decreased surface negative charge and increased
   surface roughness were two important factors contributing to the
   enhanced antifouling properties. The r-membranes and the COOH-membrane
   exhibited satisfactory stabilities during pure-water backwashing at TMP
   of 60 kPa, with dislodged ratios of 1.9\% and 4.54\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transition metal fluorides (MFx) offer remarkably high theoretical
   energy density. However, the low cycling stability, low electrical and
   ionic conductivity of metal fluorides have severely limited their
   applications as conversion-type cathode materials for lithium ion
   batteries. Here, a scalable and low-cost strategy is reported on the
   fabrication of multifunctional cobalt fluoride/carbon nanotube nonwoven
   fabric nanocomposite, which demonstrates a combination of high capacity
   (near-theoretical, 550mAhg(CoF2)(-1)) and excellent mechanical
   properties. Its strength and modulus of toughness exceed that of many
   aluminum alloys, cast iron, and other structural materials, fulfilling
   the use of MFx-based materials in batteries with load-bearing
   capabilities. In the course of this study, cathode dissolution in
   conventional electrolytes has been discovered as the main reason that
   leads to the rapid growth of the solid electrolyte interphase layer and
   attributes to rapid cell degradation. And such largely overlooked
   degradation mechanism is overcome by utilizing electrolyte comprising a
   fluorinated solvent, which forms a protective ionically conductive layer
   on the cathode and anode surfaces. With this approach, 93\% capacity
   retention is achieved after 200 cycles at the current density of 100 mA
   g(-1) and over 50\% after 10 000 cycles at the current density of 1000
   mA g(-1)}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of vanadium oxide is a viable means to add
   pseudocapacitive layers to porous carbon electrodes. Two commercial
   activated carbon materials with different surface areas and pore
   structures were acid treated and coated by V2O5 ALD using vanadium
   triisopropoxide and water at 150 degrees C. The V2O5 ALD process was
   characterized at various temperatures to confirm saturated ALD growth
   conditions. Capacitance and electrochemical impedance analysis of
   subsequently constructed electrochemical capacitors (ECs) showed
   improved charge storage for the ALD coated electrodes, but the extent of
   improvement depended on initial pore structure. The ALD of V2O5 onto
   mesoporous carbon increased the capacitance by up to 46\% after 75 ALD
   cycles and obtained a maximum pseudocapacitance of 540 F/g(V2O5) after
   25 ALD cycles, while maintaining low electrical resistance, high
   columbic efficiency, and a high cycle life. However, adding V2O5 ALD to
   microporous carbons with pore diameters of <11 angstrom showed far less
   improvement, likely due to ``blocking off{''} of the micropores and
   reducing the accessible surface area. Results show that ALD is a viable
   means to construct high-performance supercapacitors from activated
   carbon which is the basis for commercial products, and a clear
   understanding of carbon electrode pore structure, layer conformality,
   and layer thickness are necessary to fully optimize performance.}},

Abstract = {{While manganese oxide (MnO2) has been extensively studied as an
   electrode material for pseudocapacitors, a clear understanding of its
   charge storage mechanism is still lacking. Here we report our findings
   in probing the structural changes of a thin-film model MnO2 electrode
   during cycling using in operando Raman spectroscopy. The spectral
   features (e.g., band position, intensity, and width) are correlated
   quantitatively with the size (Li+, Na+, and K+) of cations in different
   electrolytes and with the degree of discharge to gain better
   understanding of the cation-incorporation mechanism into the interlayers
   of pseudocapacitive MnO2. Also, theoretical calculations of phonon
   energy associated with the models of interlayer cation-incorporated MnO2
   agree with the experimental observations of cation-size effect on the
   positions of Raman bands. Furthermore, the cation-size effects on
   spectral features at different potentials of MnO2 electrode are
   correlated quantitatively with the amount of charge stored in the MnO2
   electrode. The understanding of the structural changes associated with
   charge storage gained from Raman spectroscopy provides valuable insights
   into the cation-size effects on the electrochemical performances of the
   MnO2 electrode.}},

Abstract = {{The novel approach to chemically tuning the electronic properties of
   bio-bond graphene paper suggested here allows for the facile fabrication
   of large area, flexible, robust, and highly conductive films. A layer of
   anodic metal deposited on the surface of the initial laminated graphene
   oxide-silk films with micrometer thickness is used to initiate the fast
   and spontaneous electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide to the
   electrically conductive states at predetermined depths under ambient
   conditions. By controlling the reaction conditions, a wide range of
   conductivities from those common for semiconductors to semimetals can be
   achieved at different stages of the defect-removal process. Ultimately,
   the electrical conductivity can be increased over 6 orders of magnitude
   from similar to 1 x 10(-2) S/m for pristine bio-bond graphene oxide
   paper up to 1.5 x 10(4) S/m for a fully transformed film. The
   conductivity achieved using this environmentally friendly technique is
   by far the highest among the reduced graphene oxide papers, and
   moreover, the mechanical performance and bending resilience of the films
   remains extremely high. We propose that the mechanism responsible for
   this process involves the balance of the internal potential drop due to
   the electric resistance of graphene oxide layers and the diffusion of
   oxygen containing species to the reactive interface. This
   electrochemical reduction technique is facile, conducted at ambient
   conditions, and adaptable for large-scale fabrication of the robust, and
   lightweight thin film for flexible electronic devices for sensing,
   energy storage, and wearable electronics where the charge transportation
   characteristics and great mechanical robustness are critical.}},

   reactions. Variation in the chemical structures of the pendant acidic
   sulfonate moieties and their effects on membrane properties including

   were systemically investigated. Membranes containing the short -OCF2SO3H

   proton conductivity than those containing the longer pendants
   -OCF2CF2SO3H (PSU-S-1) and -SCF2CF2SO3H (PSU-S-4), likely due to the
   short chain's less favorable aggregation and lower acidity. Polymer
   electrolyte membranes with unique branched fluoroalkyl sulfonate
   pendants (PSU-S-6) gave larger ionic domain sizes, more uniform
   hydrophilic channels, and higher proton conductivity than samples with

Abstract = {{We have performed direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and
   isotropic turbulence in a periodic box with 8,1923 grid points. These
   are the largest simulations performed, to date, aimed at improving our
   understanding of turbulence small-scale structure. We present some basic
   statistical results and focus on ``extreme{''} events (whose magnitudes
   are several tens of thousands the mean value). The structure of these
   extreme events is quite different from that of moderately large events
   (of the order of 10 times the mean value). In particular, intense
   vorticity occurs primarily in the form of tubes for moderately large
   events whereas it is much more ``chunky{''} for extreme events (though
   probably overlaid on the traditional vortex tubes). We track the
   temporal evolution of extreme events and find that they are generally
   short-lived. Extreme magnitudes of energy dissipation rate and enstrophy
   occur simultaneously in space and remain nearly colocated during their
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Progressive fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of
   extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in gross alterations in tissue
   mechanics. Changes in tissue mechanics can further augment scar
   deposition through fibroblast mechanotransduction. In idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal form of progressive lung fibrosis, previous
   work has shown that loss of Thy-1 (CD90) expression in fibroblasts
   correlates with regions of active fibrogenesis, thus representing a
   pathologically relevant fibroblast subpopulation. We now show that Thy-1
   is a regulator of fibroblast rigidity sensing. Thy-1 physically couples
   to inactive alpha(v)beta(3) integrins via its RGD-like motif, altering
   baseline integrin avidity to ECM ligands and also facilitating
   preadhesion clustering of integrin and membrane rafts via Thy-1's
   glycophosphatidylinositol tether. Disruption of Thy-1-alpha(v)beta(3)
   coupling altered recruitment of Src family kinases to adhesion complexes
   and impaired mechanosensitive, force-induced Rho signaling, and rigidity
   sensing. Loss of Thy-1 was sufficient to induce myofibroblast
   differentiation in soft ECMs and may represent a physiological mechanism
   important in wound healing and fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{We report on simultaneous broadband observations of the TeV-emitting
   blazar Markarian 501 between 2013 April 1 and August 10, including the
   first detailed characterization of the synchrotron peak with Swift and
   NuSTAR. During the campaign, the nearby BL Lac object was observed in
   both a quiescent and an elevated state. The broadband campaign includes
   observations with NuSTAR, MAGIC, VERITAS, the Fermi Large Area
   Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope and UV Optical Telescope, various
   ground-based optical instruments, including the GASP-WEBT program, as
   well as radio observations by OVRO, Metsahovi, and the F-Gamma
   consortium. Some of the MAGIC observations were affected by a sand layer
   from the Saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-event
   corrections derived with a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) facility.
   This is the first time that LIDAR information is used to produce a
   physics result with Cherenkov Telescope data taken during adverse
   atmospheric conditions, and hence sets a precedent for the current and
   future ground-based gamma-ray instruments. The NuSTAR instrument
   provides unprecedented sensitivity in hard X-rays, showing the source to
   display a spectral energy distribution (SED) between 3 and 79 keV
   consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard X-ray variability on
   hour timescales. None (of the four extended NuSTAR observations) show
   evidence of the onset of inverse-Compton emission at hard X-ray
   energies. We apply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-Compton
   (SSC) model to five simultaneous broadband SEDs. We find that the SSC
   model can reproduce the observed broadband states through a decrease in
   the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increase in the
   luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for the
   high-energy emission.}},

Abstract = {{Cell membranes perform important biological roles including
   compartmentalization, signaling, and transport of nutrients. Supported
   lipid membranes mimic the behavior of cell membranes and are an
   important model tool for studying membrane properties in a controlled
   laboratory environment. Lipid membranes may be supported on solid
   substrates; however, protein and lipid interactions with the substrate
   typically result in their denaturation. In this report, we demonstrate
   the formation of intact lipid membranes tethered on nanoporous metal
   thin films obtained via a dealloying process. Uniform lipid membranes
   were formed when the surface defect density of the nanoporous metal film
   was significantly reduced through a two-step dealloying process reported
   here. We show that the tethered lipid membranes on nanoporous metal
   substrates maintain both fluidity and electrical resistivity, which are
   key attributes to naturally occurring lipid membranes. The lipid
   assemblies supported on nanoporous metals provide a new platform for
   investigating lipid membrane properties, and potentially membrane
   proteins, for numerous applications including next generation biosensor
   platforms, targeted drug-delivery, and energy harvesting devices.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous flow processing represents an emerging technology in the
   chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Herein, we describe a tandem,
   bicatalytic continuous flow cyclopropanation-homo-Nazarov-type
   ring-opening cyclization to form hydropyrido{[}1,2-a]indoles, which
   represents a naturally occurring chemical scaffold present in many
   bioactive and therapeutically relevant molecules. The tandem flow
   reactions provided high conversions (>97\%) with product throughputs on
   the order of 3-5 g h(-1). The individual transformations
   (cyclopropanation and ring-opening cyclization) were separately
   optimized in the batch then successfully transferred to the flow.
   Significantly, this represents the first literature example of
   continuous flow cydopropane ring-opening cydizations;
   hydropyrido{[}1,2-a]indoles are formed on a multigram scale (>4 g h(-1)
   throughput) in near-quantitative yields from N-indolyl-1,1-cyclopropyl
   beta-amidoesters. Overall, the continuous flow technology exhibited
   superior yields, relative to the batch reactions, for both the
   ring-opening cyclizations and the tandem, bicatalytic reactions. These
   results provide the basis for large-scale implementation of bicatalytic
   cyclopropanation-ring-opening cyclization reactions for complex
   synthesis and represent initial efforts toward the development of an
   industrially viable, four-step continuous flow synthesis of hydropyrido
   {[}1,2-a]indoles.}},

Abstract = {{Thin sheets have long been known to experience an increase in stiffness
   when they are bent, buckled, or assembled into smaller interlocking
   structures. We introduce a unique orientation for coupling rigidly
   foldable origami tubes in a ``zipper{''} fashion that substantially
   increases the system stiffness and permits only one flexible deformation
   mode through which the structure can deploy. The flexible deployment of
   the tubular structures is permitted by localized bending of the origami
   along prescribed fold lines. All other deformation modes, such as global
   bending and twisting of the structural system, are substantially stiffer
   because the tubular assemblages are overconstrained and the thin sheets
   become engaged in tension and compression. The zipper-coupled tubes
   yield an unusually large eigenvalue bandgap that represents the unique
   difference in stiffness between deformation modes. Furthermore, we
   couple compatible origami tubes into a variety of cellular assemblages
   that can enhance mechanical characteristics and geometric versatility,
   leading to a potential design paradigm for structures and metamaterials
   that can be deployed, stiffened, and tuned. The enhanced mechanical
   properties, versatility, and adaptivity of these thin sheet systems can
   provide practical solutions of varying geometric scales in science and
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{For a solid tumor to grow, it must be able to support the compressive
   stress that is generated as it presses against the surrounding tissue.
   Although the literature suggests a role for the cytoskeleton in
   counteracting these stresses, there has been no systematic evaluation of
   which filaments are responsible or to what degree. Here, using a
   three-dimensional spheroid model, we show that cytoskeletal filaments do
   not actively support compressive loads in breast, ovarian, and prostate
   cancer. However, modulation of tonicity can induce alterations in
   spheroid size. We find that under compression, tumor cells actively
   efflux sodium to decrease their intracellular tonicity, and that this is
   reversible by blockade of sodium channel NHE1. Moreover, although
   polymerized actin does not actively support the compressive load, it is
   required for sodium efflux. Compression-induced cell death is increased
   by both sodium blockade and actin depolymerization, whereas increased
   actin polymerization offers protective effects and increases sodium
   efflux. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cancer cells
   modulate their tonicity to survive under compressive solid stress.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin and robust nanocomposite membranes were fabricated by
   incorporating graphene oxide (GO) sheets into a silk fibroin (SF) matrix
   by a dynamic spin-assisted layer-by-layer assembly (dSA-LbL). We
   observed that in contrast to traditional SA-LbL reported earlier fast
   solution removal during dropping of solution on constantly spinning
   substrates resulted in largely unfolded biomacromolecules with enhanced
   surface interactions and suppressed nanofibril formation. The resulting
   laminated nanocomposites possess outstanding mechanical properties,
   significantly exceeding those previously reported for conventional LbL
   films with similar composition. The tensile modulus reached extremely
   high values of 170 GPa, which have never been reported for graphene
   oxide-based nanocomposites, the ultimate strength was close to 300 MPa,
   and the toughness was above 3.4 MJ m(-3). The failure modes observed for
   these membranes suggested the self-reinforcing mechanism of adjacent
   graphene oxide sheets with strong 2 nm thick silk interphase composed
   mostly from individual backbones. This interphase reinforcement leads to
   the effective load transfer between the graphene oxide components in
   reinforced laminated nanocomposite materials with excellent mechanical
   strength that surpasses those known today for conventional flexible
   laminated carbon nanocomposites from graphene oxide and biopolymer
   components.}},

   Partial State Equipartitioning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{With the advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and neurochemistry
   there has been impressive progress in understanding the molecular
   properties of anesthetic agents. However, there has been little focus on
   how the molecular properties of anesthetic agents lead to the observed
   macroscopic property that defines the anesthetic state, that is, lack of
   responsiveness to noxious stimuli. In this paper, we use dynamical
   system theory to develop a mechanistic mean field model for neural
   activity to study the abrupt transition from consciousness to
   unconsciousness as the concentration of the anesthetic agent increases.
   The proposed synaptic drive firing-rate model predicts the
   conscious-unconscious transition as the applied anesthetic concentration
   increases, where excitatory neural activity is characterized by a
   Poincare-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation with the awake state transitioning to
   a stable limit cycle and then subsequently to an asymptotically stable
   unconscious equilibrium state. Furthermore, we address the more general
   question of synchronization and partial state equipartitioning of neural
   activity without mean field assumptions. This is done by focusing on a
   postulated subset of inhibitory neurons that are not themselves
   connected to other inhibitory neurons. Finally, several numerical
   experiments are presented to illustrate the different aspects of the
   proposed theory.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for sampling
   frequency offset (SFO) estimation in optical communication systems based
   on periodically inserted identical binary prefix. Different from
   conventional cyclic prefix, binary prefix provides not only high
   tolerance to chromatic dispersion in dispersive fiber transmission, but
   also the ability to estimate SFO by simple receiver-side digital signal
   processing. Moreover, this binary prefix based scheme is generally
   applicable to any advanced modulation formats. A proof-of-concept
   experiment is conducted to quantify the accuracy and tolerance of the
   scheme in estimating SFO. It is found that over a wide SFO range up to
   341 ppm, the estimation error is kept under 20 ppb and signals are
   recovered with the same quality as with zero-offset sampling. The
   experimental results also confirm that this method is tolerant to link
   signal-to-noise ratio loss and dispersion, showing no additional penalty
   after transmission over a 40-km standard single-mode fiber at 1550 nm.

Abstract = {{Star-like amphiphilic triblock copolymers were rationally designed and
   synthesized by combining two sequential atom-transfer radical
   polymerization reactions with a click reaction. Subsequently, a family
   of uniform magnetic/plasmonic core/shell nanoparticles was crafted by
   capitalizing on these triblock copolymers as nanoreactors. The diameter
   of the magnetic core and the thickness of the plasmonic shell could be
   independently and accurately controlled by varying the molecular weights
   (i.e., the chain lengths) of the inner and intermediate blocks of the
   star-like triblock copolymers, respectively. The surface plasmonic
   absorption of core/shell nanoparticles with different core diameters and
   shell thicknesses was systematically studied and theoretically modeled.
   This robust strategy provides easy access to a large variety of
   multifunctional nanoparticles with large lattice mismatches for use in
   optics, optoelectronics, catalysis, or bioimaging.}},

Abstract = {{Excitation of surface plasmons enables super-Planckian thermal radiation
   far beyond the blackbody limit. By patterning a single layer of graphene
   sheet into ribbons, the closed circular dispersion of graphene plasmons
   is opened to become hyperbolic, leading to broadband singularities of
   density of states. Extremely high-k evanescent waves can now couple with
   hyperbolic graphene plasmons. Consequently, a giant enhancement of the
   near-field radiative heat flux, by more than one order of magnitude, is
   demonstrated in this study using rigorous numerical simulations. The
   findings may open promising pathways for highly efficient thermal
   management, energy harvesting, and subwavelength thermal imaging. (C)

Abstract = {{Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry map the dynamics of electrons
   in a molecule to the dynamics of a coupled spin system. To reach
   chemical accuracy for interesting molecules, a large number of quantum
   gates must be applied which implies the need for quantum error
   correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Arbitrary
   fault-tolerant operations can be constructed from a small, universal set
   of fault-tolerant operations by gate compilation. Quantum chemistry
   algorithms are compiled by decomposing the dynamics of the coupled
   spin-system using a Trotter formula, synthesizing the decomposed
   dynamics using Clifford operations and single-qubit rotations, and
   finally approximating the single-qubit rotations by a sequence of
   fault-tolerant single-qubit gates. Certain fault-tolerant gates rely on
   the preparation of specific single-qubit states referred to as magic
   states. As a result, gate compilation and magic state distillation are
   critical for solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer.
   We review recent progress that has improved the efficiency of gate
   compilation and magic state distillation by orders of magnitude. (c)

Abstract = {{Uncertainty quantification plays a significant role in establishing
   reliability of mathematical models, while applying to process
   optimization or technology feasibility studies. Uncertainties, in
   general, could occur either in mathematical model or in model
   parameters. In this work, process of CO2 adsorption on amine sorbents,
   which are loaded in hollow fibers is studied to quantify the impact of
   uncertainties in the adsorption isotherm parameters on the model
   prediction. The process design variable that is most closely related to
   the process economics is the CO2 sorption capacity, whose uncertainty is
   investigated. We apply Bayesian analysis and determine a utility
   function surface corresponding to the value of information gained by the
   respective experimental design point. It is demonstrated that performing
   an experiment at a condition with a higher utility has a higher
   reduction of design variable prediction uncertainty compared to choosing
   a design point at a lower utility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Placing sensors in every station of a process or every element of a
   system to monistor its state or performance is usually too expensive or
   physically impossible. Therefore, a systematic method is needed to
   select important sensing variables. The method should not only be
   capable of identifying important sensors/signals among multistream
   signals from a distributed sensing system, but should also be able to
   extract a small set of interpretable features from the high-dimensional
   vector of a selected signal. For this purpose, we develop a new
   hierarchical regularization approach called hierarchical nonnegative
   garrote (NNG). At the first level of hierarchy, a group NNG is used to
   select important signals, and at the second level, the individual
   features within each signal are selected using a modified version of NNG
   that possesses good properties for the estimated coefficients.
   Performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other
   existing methods through Monte Carlo simulation. A case study is
   conducted to demonstrate the proposed methodology that can be applied to
   develop a predictive model for the assessment of vehicle design comfort
   based on the tested drivers' motion trajectory signals. This article has
   supplementary material online.}},

Abstract = {{Impedance-type kinesthetic haptic displays aim to render arbitrary
   desired dynamics to a human operator using force feedback. To render
   realistic virtual environments, the difference between desired and
   rendered dynamics must be small. In this paper, we analyze the
   closed-loop dynamics of haptic displays for three common virtual
   environments: a spring, a damper, and a spring-damper, including the
   effects of time delay and low-pass filtering. Using a linear model, we
   identify important parameters for the rendered dynamics in terms of
   effective impedances, a conceptual tool that decomposes the displays
   closed-loop impedance into components with physical analogs. Our results
   establish bandwidth limits for rendering effective stiffness and
   damping. The effective stiffness bandwidth is limited by the virtual
   stiffness and device mass, and the effective damping bandwidth is
   limited by the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter which filters
   the device velocity estimate. We show that a general system impedance
   can be characterized by a mass, damper, and spring optimally by the
   solution to a convex optimization problem, and we present a quantitative
   metric, the Average Distortion Error (ADE), to describe the fidelity of
   this model. Time delay has no significant effect on characterized
   stiffness, and reduces characterized damping by the product of virtual
   stiffness and total time delay. Reducing the low-pass filter cut-off
   frequency reduces the characterized damping. Experimental data gathered
   with a Phantom Premium 1.5 validates the theoretical analysis. We also
   conducted human user experiments to investigate the effects of time
   delay and low-pass filtering on perceived stiffness and damping. Similar
   to the characterized dynamics results, we observed no significant effect
   of time delay on perceived stiffness, and increasing time delay resulted
   in reduced perceived damping. Lower filter cut-off frequencies resulted
   in lower perceived damping. This work informs haptic display design by
   presenting how closed-loop behavior changes with key parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The skin is the largest organ of the human body and can sense pressure,
   temperature, and other complex environmental stimuli or conditions. The
   mimicry of human skin's sensory ability via electronics is a topic of
   innovative research that could find broad applications in robotics,
   artificial intelligence, and human-machine interfaces, all of which
   promote the development of electronic skin (e-skin). To imitate tactile
   sensing via e-skins, flexible and stretchable pressure sensor arrays are
   constructed based on different transduction mechanisms and structural
   designs. These arrays can map pressure with high resolution and rapid
   response beyond that of human perception. Multi-modal force sensing,
   temperature, and humidity detection, as well as self-healing abilities
   are also exploited for multi-functional e-skins. Other recent progress
   in this field includes the integration with high-density flexible
   circuits for signal processing, the combination with wireless technology
   for convenient sensing and energy/data transfer, and the development of
   self-powered e-skins. Future opportunities lie in the fabrication of
   highly intelligent e-skins that can sense and respond to variations in
   the external environment. The rapidly increasing innovations in this

Abstract = {{This article is at the intersection of and integrates two broad
   considerations in the space industry, namely, the emergence of the
   hosted payload paradigm and the increased emphasis for the acquisition
   of space systems to be value driven. Spacecraft, and hosted payloads,
   are value delivery artifacts; their value derives from the flow of
   service they provide to different stakeholders. Their design and
   acquisition should be value centric or at a minimum value informed. In
   this article, we first provide a value model and analysis for a
   spacecraft, which includes its life cycle cost, as well as its revenue
   model. The revenue model accounts for the services provided by the
   primary payload and their lease price, the loading dynamics, and
   provisions for its obsolescence. When integrated, these two models allow
   us to calculate the spacecraft net present value (NPV) and its return on
   investment. A sensitivity analysis helps us to identify the
   effectiveness of the different value levers of a spacecraft. Second,
   after a brief review of the hosted payload paradigm and developing a
   baseline spacecraft NPV model, we integrate considerations of the hosted
   payload into the value analysis, and in the process, we develop a
   pricing standard (and model) for hosted payloads. For the hosted payload
   business model to be sustainable, both main stakeholders in the
   transaction, the owner of the spacecraft (host) and that of the hosted
   payload (guest) have to see a net value in the hosting arrangement. We
   propose that the pricing of the hosted payload should be at a minimum
   Delta NPV neutral. This condition helps us calculate the lower bound for
   an upfront payment from the guest, an annuity or rentlike payment, or a
   combination of both. We developed the analytics for this condition and
   the three payment options, and we extended it beyond the Delta NPV
   neutral baseline to include an X\% incremental return on the hosted
   payload. We conclude with a general reflection on value considerations
   in space systems and a series of analytical questions raised in this
   article and left as fruitful venues for future work.}},

Abstract = {{Using the Schwartz-Christoffel conformal mapping method together with
   the complex variable techniques, we derive steady state analytical
   solutions for pumping in a rectangular aquifer with four different
   combinations of impermeable and constant-head boundaries. These four
   scenarios include: (1) one constant-head boundary and three impermeable
   boundaries, (2) two pairs of orthogonal impermeable and constant-head
   boundaries, (3) three constant-head boundaries and one impermeable
   boundary, and (4) four constant-head boundaries. For these scenarios,
   the impermeable and constant-head boundaries can be combined after
   applying the mapping functions, and hence only three image wells exist
   in the transformed plane, despite an infinite number of image wells in
   the real plane. The closed-form solutions reflect the advantage of the
   conformal mapping method, though the method is applicable for the aspect
   ratio of the rectangle between 1/10.9 and 10.9/1 due to the limitation
   in the numerical computation of the conformal transformation from a half
   plane onto an elongated region (i.e., so-called ``crowding''
   phenomenon). By contrast, for an additional scenario with two parallel
   constant-head boundaries and two parallel impermeable boundaries, an
   infinite series of image wells is necessary to express the solution,
   since it is impossible to combine these two kinds of boundaries through
   the conformal transformation. The usefulness of the results derived is
   demonstrated by an application to pumping in a finite coastal aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Hard-to-cut materials such as stainless steels and nickel-based super
   alloys are widely appliedin different critical areas, e.g., aerospace
   and automotive components and chemical plants. Complex parts used in
   these areas are machined by recently developed indexable copy face mills
   with round inserts. This work aims to apply such inserts for studying
   machinability and process cost optimization during face milling of
   several hard alloys including SS 403cb+ (a new grade of stainless
   steel), Inconel 718, and Inconel 625 with indexable copy face mills.
   Machining experiments on these alloys are performed at different cutting
   speed and feed rate combinations, and machinability is studied in terms
   of tool life and wear, material removal rate, cutting forces, and force
   coefficients. The extended Taylor's tool life model that includes both
   the cutting speed and feed rate are also used to determine the model
   coefficients. Using standard cost optimization model, process parameters
   are optimized considering the trade-off between material removal rate
   and tool life. The coefficients estimated for the extended Taylor's tool
   life model are also validated. Findings reveal that machinability of
   Inconel 625 is poorest among the three alloy materials considered. Also,
   machining cost is found to be about 5 and 6 folds for Inconel 718 and
   Inconel 625, respectively, as compared to that for SS 403cb+ when
   considering a fixed volume to be removed at the optimized speed and feed
   combinations of each material. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing

Title = {{Automatic thresholding for defect detection by background histogram mode
   extents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-92}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Automatic thresholding is a popular segmentation technique that is
   widely used for automated visual inspection of defects. Many methods
   have been proposed for appropriate selection of the threshold value.
   However, most of these methods perform well for images where defects and
   background have distinguishable histogram modes and select a threshold
   close to a valley between the two modes which is usually very hard to
   locate except for the clearly bi-modal histograms. Additionally, where
   defect detection requires bi-level segmentation, these methods require a
   prior knowledge of the number of thresholding levels. In this paper, a
   new approach for threshold selection is taken that aims to find the
   threshold value at the boundary of the intensity ranges of defects
   (object) and background by comparing the histogram modes of the
   background and defective regions. The proposed method automatically
   detects defective regions as well as defect-free regions or background.
   By study of the histogram of the background region, appropriate
   threshold values are automatically selected at the extents of the
   background histogram mode. The proposed method proved very effective on
   several standard images of surface defects. The significance of the
   method's efficiency is well seen in successfully segmenting defects in
   images with non-uniform background and with no visible bi- or
   multi-modal behavior. Another significance of the technique is
   segmentation of defects comprising of two intensity regions (such as
   bumps and pits) without specifying the number of threshold levels. (C)

Abstract = {{Tool wear experiments are necessary for tool life model development and
   cost optimization. However, tool wear experiments are costly and
   time-consuming, thereby limiting the number of tool life evaluations as
   a function of machining parameters. This paper describes an approach for
   experimental design for tool life testing and machining cost
   optimization in milling using surrogate modeling and the value of
   information method. The machining cost in milling was modeled using a
   kriging surrogate. The machining cost function was evaluated using
   experimental tool life results and was considered to be the ``true{''}
   function. The value of information, expressed as expected reduction in
   machining cost optimum after experiment, was used to identify optimal
   test parameters for tool life experiments. The procedure to calculate
   value of information is demonstrated using a one-dimensional cost
   function. Results show a convergence to the true optimum in two and
   three dimensions. The value of information criterion balances local
   search by exploiting where the cost function is minimum and global
   search by exploring where the prediction uncertainty is high. The method
   performs better than the traditional statistical design of experiments
   such as Taguchi orthogonal arrays, central composite design, and
   factorial designs, especially in three or more dimensions. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Information relaxation and duality in Markov decision processes have
   been studied recently by several researchers with the goal to derive
   dual bounds on the value function. In this paper we extend this dual
   formulation to controlled Markov diffusions: in a similar way we relax
   the constraint that the decision should be made based on the current
   information and impose a penalty to punish the access to the information
   in advance. We establish the weak duality, strong duality and
   complementary slackness results in a parallel way as those in Markov
   decision processes. We further explore the structure of the optimal
   penalties and expose the connection between the optimal penalties for
   Markov decision processes and controlled Markov diffusions. We
   demonstrate the use of this dual representation in a classic dynamic
   portfolio choice problem through a new class of penalties, which require
   little extra computation and produce small duality gap on the optimal
   value.}},

Title = {{Construction-specific spatial information reasoning in Building
   Information Models}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{1013-1027}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there have been significant advances in modeling
   technology for object-oriented building products. However, the building
   models are still lacking of providing construction-specific spatial
   information required for construction planning. Consequently,
   construction planners visually analyze building product models and
   derive geometric characteristics such as bounded spaces and exterior
   perimeter to develop detailed construction plans. Such a process
   presents fragmented information flows, from building product information
   to construction planning, that rely on subjective decisions of
   construction planners. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this
   research proposes a geometric reasoning system that analyzes geometric
   information in building designs, derives the construction-specific
   spatial information, and uses the information to assist in construction
   planning. The scope of presented work includes detecting work packages
   formed by faces during construction, such as large work faces and
   bounded spaces, and using information in the work packages directly to
   support planning of selected indoor construction activities. The main
   features of the proposed system named Construction Spatial Information
   Reasoner (CSIR) include a set of relationship acquisition algorithms,
   building component relationship data structure, and interpretation of
   the relationship to support detailed construction activity planning. The
   relationship acquisition algorithms identify adjacency between building
   components that is stored in the relational data structure. Then,
   acquired adjacency relationships are transformed into a set of graphs
   that represent work packages. To implement the proposed approach, CSIR
   utilized a commercially-available Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   platform and the algorithms were imbedded to the BIM platform. For
   validation, CSIR was tested on a real commercial building. For interior
   ceiling grid installation activities, CSIR successfully detected
   existing work packages and analyzed the spatial characteristics
   impacting construction productivity. The major contribution of the
   presented research would be to enable a realistic analysis of building
   geometric condition that is not possible in current BIM and a seamless
   information flow from building product information to construction
   process plans. These can potentially reduce current manual and
   error-prone construction planning processes. Limitations and future
   research suggestions are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{One of the challenges faced today in a variety of geophysical
   applications is the need to understand the changes of elastic properties
   due to time-variant chemomechanical processes. The objective of this
   work is to model carbonate rock elastic properties as functions of pore
   geometry changes that occur when the solid matrix is dissolved by carbon
   dioxide. We compared two carbonate microstructures: porous micrite
   (mudstone) and grain-supported carbonate (packstone). We formulated a
   mathematical model that distinguishes the effects of microporosity and
   macroporosity on stiffness changes. We used measures of mechanical and
   chemical porosity changes recorded during injection tests to compute
   elastic moduli and compare them to moduli obtained from wave velocity
   measurements. In mudstones, both experimental and numerical results
   indicate that bulk moduli change by less than 5\%. The evolution of
   elastic moduli is controlled by macropore enlargement. In packstones,
   model predictions underestimate changes of elastic moduli with total
   porosity by 10\% to 80\%. The total porosity variation is 60\% to 75\%
   smaller than the chemical porosity variation, which indicates that pore
   expansion due to dissolution is counterbalanced by pore shrinkage due to
   compaction. Packstone elastic properties are controlled by grain
   sliding. The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized to
   other chemomechanical processes studied in rocks, such as dislocations,
   glide, diffusive mass transfer, recrystallization, and precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the impacts of carsharing on travel behavior utilizing a San
   Francisco Area subsample of the 2010-2012 California Household Travel
   Survey. We control for self-selection bias due to differences in
   observed characteristics of the respondents using propensity-score based
   matching. We find that vehicle holdings of carsharing members are
   substantially and significantly lower than for non-members with similar
   characteristics in terms of individual and household demographics and
   built environment features of both residential and job location. These
   differences increase as the propensity to enroll in carsharing programs
   increases. A latent construct, which measures the propensity to own or
   utility from owning vehicles and rises with numbers of vehicles owned,
   is lower for members by 0.3-1.3 standard deviations relative to
   non-members. Members are also likely to walk, bike, and use transit more
   frequently than non-members. However, these differences are relatively
   minor and tend to be statistically non-significant. Future research
   should control for self-selection bias arising from differences in
   unobserved characteristics of respondents, as well as simultaneity bias
   whereby decisions concerning vehicle ownership both influence and are
   influenced by the decision to join carsharing programs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The measurement of ongoing ice-mass loss and associated melt water
   contribution to sea-level change from regions such as West Antarctica is
   dependent on a combination of remote sensing methods. A key method, the
   measurement of changes in Earth's gravity via the GRACE satellite
   mission, requires a potentially large correction to account for the
   isostatic response of the solid Earth to ice-load changes since the Last
   Glacial Maximum. In this study, we combine glacial isostatic adjustment
   modelling with a new GPS dataset of solid Earth deformation for the
   southern Antarctic Peninsula to test the current understanding of ice
   history in this region. A sufficiently complete history of past ice-load
   change is required for glacial isostatic adjustment models to accurately
   predict the spatial variation of ongoing solid Earth deformation, once
   the independently-constrained effects of present-day ice mass loss have
   been accounted for. Comparisons between the GPS data and glacial
   isostatic adjustment model predictions reveal a substantial misfit. The
   misfit is localized on the southwestern Weddell Sea, where current ice
   models under-predict uplift rates by approximately 2 mm yr(-1). This
   under-prediction suggests that either the retreat of the ice sheet
   grounding line in this region occurred significantly later in the
   Holocene than currently assumed, or that the region previously hosted
   more ice than currently assumed. This finding demonstrates the need for
   further fieldwork to obtain direct constraints on the timing of Holocene
   grounding line retreat in the southwestern Weddell Sea and that GRACE
   estimates of ice sheet mass balance will be unreliable in this region
   until this is resolved.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies have shown that certain emotional characteristics are
   best observed at different analysis-frame lengths. When features of
   multiple modalities are extracted, it is reasonable to believe that
   different temporal lengths would better model the underlying
   characteristics that result from different emotions. In this study, we
   examine the use of such differing timescales in constructing emotion
   classifiers. A novel fusion method is introduced that utilizes the
   outputs of individual classifiers that are trained using
   multi-dimensional inputs with multiple temporal lengths. We used the
   IEMOCAP database which contains audiovisual information of 10 subjects
   in dyadic interaction settings. The classification task was performed
   over three emotional dimensions: valence, activation, and dominance. The
   results demonstrate the utility of the multimodal-multitemporal
   approach. Statistically significant improvements in accuracy are seen
   for in all three dimensions when compared with unimodal-unitemporal
   classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting energy from ambient mechanical motions addresses limitations
   of traditional power supplies by providing a sustained electric power
   source. Here, a high-performance rotary triboelectric nanogenerator
   (r-TENG) is applied in a variety of circumstances to specifically
   harvest mechanical energy from human body motions. When rotating at 500
   r min(-1), it can produce an ac electric output that has a current
   amplitude of 0.75 mA and a voltage amplitude of 200 V at a frequency of
   750 Hz. Integrated with structural components that transfer mechanical
   motions and electric components that achieve power management, the
   r-TENG is demonstrated as a power source by harvesting energy from foot
   pedaling, arm swinging and foot pressure. The generated electricity can
   effectively charge consumer electronics such as a cellphone, which shows
   the promise of the r-TENG as a power source for portable, wearable and
   even implantable electronics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The p-phenylenediamine (PPD) modified graphene oxide (GO)/reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) composite materials were synthesized by a facile
   solution processing with two different routes: `Reaction first then
   Reduction' and `Reduction first then Reaction', which are referred to as
   GPPDH and GHPPD, respectively. The two composites were employed as
   active supercapacitor electrode materials, their electrochemical
   properties were studied, and the mechanism how PPD improves the
   electrochemical performance is investigated systematically. GPPDH with
   the PPD molecules incorporated between the graphene sheets demonstrated
   a loose and crumpled microstructure. However, for GHPPD, the graphene
   sheets were stacked and cross-linked through PPD molecules. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) also provided quantitative information about the
   newly formed chemical constituents in the synthesized materials. The
   specific capacitance values of GPPDH and GHPPD are 316.54 and 249.24 F
   g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1), respectively. The synthesized materials also
   exhibited an excellent cycling stability as 93.66\% (GPPDH) and 87.14\%
   (GHPPD) retentions after 4000 cycles at current density of 2 A g(-1).
   The results revealed the role of amine-based organic additives in
   graphene supercapacitor materials and validated the GPPDH as the
   electrodes of supercapacitor with an excellent electrochemical
   performance. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{A Survey of Soil Enzyme Activities along Major Roads in Beijing: The

Abstract = {{Soil quality is critical to the management of urban green space, in
   particular, along traffic corridors where traffic-related air pollution
   is significant. Soil quality can be evaluated by soil enzyme activities,
   which show quick responses to both natural and anthropogenic
   disturbances. In this study, we investigated three soil enzyme
   activities (i.e., dehydrogenase, catalase and urease) along the major
   roads in urban areas of Beijing. Results show the activities of
   dehydrogenase, catalase and urease in urban samples were 58.8\%, 68.2\%
   and 48.5\% less than the rural sample, respectively. The content of
   fluorescent amino acids as indicators of microbial activities was also
   consistently lower in urban samples than the rural. We observed two
   times greater exposure of particulate material along the roadsides in
   urban areas than rural areas. Although traffic air pollutants provide
   some nutrient sources to stimulate the URE activity, the exposure to
   traffic-related air pollution leads to the substantial decrease in
   enzyme activities. There were significant negative correlations for
   exposure to PM10 with DHA (r = -0.8267, p = 0.0017) and CAT (r = -0.89,
   p = 0.0002) activities. For the urban soils URE activity increased with
   the increasing of PM. We conclude that the degraded soil quality can
   negatively affect the target of developing plants and green spaces along
   the traffic corridors to mitigate the traffic impact. This study
   suggests the investigation of integrated strategies to restore the soil
   quality, reinforce the ecological service functions of green spaces
   along the traffic corridors and reduce the traffic pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Advancement of bone tissue engineering as an alternative for bone
   regeneration has attracted significant interest due to its potential in
   reducing the costs and surgical trauma affiliated with the effective
   treatment of bone defects. We have improved the conventional approach of
   producing polymeric nanoparticles, as one of the most promising choices
   for drug delivery systems, using a microfluidics platform, thus further
   improving our control over osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
   stem cells. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for
   theoretical understanding of our experiments in order to get a more
   detailed molecular-scale insight into the drug-carrier interactions. In
   this work, with the sustained intracellular delivery of dexamethasone
   from microfluidics-synthesized nanoparticles, we explored the effects of
   particle design on controlling stem cell fates. We believe that the
   insights learned from this work will lead to the discovery of new
   strategies to tune differentiation for in situ differentiation or stem
   cell therapeutics.
   From the Clinical Editor: The use of mesenchymal stem cells has been
   described by many researchers as a novel therapy for bone regeneration.
   One major hurdle in this approach is the control of osteogenic
   differentiation. In this article, the authors described elegantly their
   microfluidic system in which dexamethasone loaded nanoparticles were
   produced. This system would allow precise fabrication of nanoparticles
   and consequently higher efficiency in cellular differentiation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Modulated ionospheric heating experiments are performed with the High
   Frequency Active Auroral Research Program facility in Gakona, Alaska,
   for the purpose of generating extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low
   frequency (VLF) waves. Observations are made at three different azimuths
   from the heating facility and at distances from 37 km to 99 km. The
   polarization of the observed waves is analyzed in addition to amplitude
   as a function of modulation frequency and azimuth. Amplitude and
   eccentricity are observed to vary with both azimuth and distance from
   the heating facility. It is found that waves radiated at azimuths
   northwest of the facility are generated by a combination of modulated
   Hall and Pedersen currents, while waves observed at other azimuths are
   dominated by modulated Hall currents. We find no evidence for vertical
   currents contributing to ground observations of ELF/VLF waves. Observed
   amplitude peaks near multiples of 2 kHz are shown to result from
   vertical resonances in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, and variations of
   the frequency of these resonances can be used to determine the D region
   ionosphere electron density profile in the vicinity of the HF heater.}},

   overcome this difficulty, we propose a modification based on an

Abstract = {{The planning of emergency service facility location, especially for
   those expecting high demand and severe conditions, requires
   consideration of victims' en-route travel, in-facility service quality,
   and reliability of these service facilities themselves. This paper first
   presents a scenario-based stochastic mixed-integer non-linear program
   (MINLP) model that integrates facility disruption risks, en-route
   traffic congestion and in-facility queuing delay into an integrated
   facility location problem. We derive lower and upper bounds to this
   highly complex problem by approximating the expected total system costs
   across the normal and all probabilistic facility disruption scenarios.
   This allows us to develop a more tractable approximate MINLP formulation
   and a Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) based solution approach. The relaxed
   sub-problem for location and service allocation decisions is further
   reformulated into a second-order conic program. Numerical experiments
   show that the approximate model and LR solution approach are capable of
   overcoming the computational difficulties associated with the problem.
   Interesting findings and managerial insights are obtained from a series
   of sensitivity analyses, e.g., regarding the importance of considering
   in-facility queuing in location design, and the significance of resource
   pooling on the optimal facility deployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a silicon interposer platform using microfluidic cooling
   is proposed for high-performance computing systems. The key advantage of
   the the silicon interposer is its very fine-pitch wiring, which enables
   high-bandwidth off-chip signaling for the chips assembled on the silicon
   interposer. Compared with conventional air cooling, embedded microfuidic
   cooling is used for better cooling and thermal isolation of chips on the
   silicon interposer. A test vehicle consisting of a silicon interposer
   and a silicon dice with microfluidic I/Os and embedded microfluidic heat
   sinks is fabricated and assembled for thermal measurements. At a flow
   rate of 50 mL/min, the measured temperature is 55.9 degrees C for a
   power density of 97 W/cm(2), which represents a normalized thermal
   resistance of 0.24 K . cm(2)/W. The thermal simulations based on the
   measured thermal resistance show that 40.1\% reduction in the silicon
   interposer temperature is achieved with microfluidic cooling compared to
   air cooling. Moreover, thermal coupling between the dice on the silicon
   interposer is significantly reduced with microfluidic cooling, which
   significantly benefits the integration density and the signaling
   performance by integrating chips more closely and reducing interconnect
   length.}},

Abstract = {{Low power is widely considered as a key benefit of 3-D integrated
   circuits (ICs), yet there have been few thorough design studies on how
   to maximize power benefits in 3-D ICs. In this paper, we present design
   methodologies to reduce power consumption in 3-D ICs using a large-scale
   commercial-grade multicore microprocessor (OpenSPARC T2). To further
   improve power benefits in 3-D ICs on the top of the traditional 3-D
   floorplanning, we evaluate the impact of 3-D IC partitioning: block
   folding and bonding styles. In addition, the impact of block folding and
   bonding style on 3-D thermal is investigated. Last, we examine the power
   distribution network impact on 3-D power benefit. With aforementioned
   methods combined, our 3-D designs provide up to 21.7\% power reduction

Title = {{Effect of azimuthal flow fluctuations on flow and flame dynamics of
   axisymmetric swirling flames}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have clearly shown the important role of swirl
   fluctuations (or, more precisely, fluctuations in axial vorticity) in
   the response of premixed flames to flow oscillations. An important
   implication of this mechanism is that the axial location of the swirler
   plays a key role in the phase between the acoustic flow excitation
   source and the resulting axial vorticity fluctuation at the flame.
   Similar to the previously well recognized role of azimuthal vorticity
   fluctuations, these swirl fluctuations are vortical and convect at the
   mean flow velocity, unlike the acoustic flow fluctuations. However,
   there is a fundamental difference between axial and azimuthal vorticity
   disturbances in terms of the flow oscillations they induce on the flame.
   Specifically, azimuthal vorticity disturbances excite radial and axial
   flow disturbances, while axial vorticity oscillations, in general induce
   both radial and azimuthal flow fluctuations, but in the axisymmetric
   case, they only directly excite azimuthal flow fluctuations. The axial
   vorticity fluctuations do, however, indirectly excite axial and radial
   velocity fluctuations when the axial vortex tube is tilted off-axis,
   such as at locations of area expansion. This difference is significant
   because axisymmetric flames are disturbed only by the velocity component
   normal to it, which stem from axial and radial velocity components only.
   This implies that axisymmetric mean flames are not directly affected by
   azimuthal flow fluctuations, since they are tangential to it. Thus, it
   is the extent to which the axial vorticity is tilted and rotated that
   controls the strength of the flow oscillations normal to the flame and,
   in turn, lead to heat release oscillations. This coupling process is not
   easily amenable to analytical calculations and, as such, we report here
   a computational study of the role of these different flow fluctuations
   on the flame response in an axisymmetric framework. The results indicate
   that the swirl fluctuations can act as significant source of flame heat
   release disturbances, due to azimuthal and radial vortex tubes tilting
   in mixing passage boundary layers and at the expansion into the
   combustor. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Characteristics of backward and forward two-particle relative dispersion
   in turbulence at different Reynolds numbers}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A new algorithm based on post-processing of saved trajectories has been
   developed and applied to obtain well-sampled backward and forward
   relative dispersion statistics in stationary isotropic turbulence, over
   a range of initial separations ranging from Kolmogorov to
   energy-containing scales. Detailed results are obtained over a range of
   Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers, up to 1000, which is higher than in
   recent work in the literature. Backward dispersion is faster, especially
   at intermediate times after the ballistic range and before long-time
   diffusive behavior is reached. Richardson scaling has been demonstrated
   for the mean-squared separation, and forward and backward Richardson
   constants estimated to be g(f) = 0.55 and g(b) = 1.5, which are close to
   or comparable to other estimates. However, because of persistent
   dissipation sub-range effects no corresponding scaling was observed for
   higher order moments of the separation. Analysis of the separation
   probability density function showed only transitory agreement with the
   well-known Richardson prediction. The strong exponential growth of the
   separation on dissipation sub-range scales was analyzed in terms of a
   central limit theory approximation. The resulting predictions for the
   ratio of the growth rates of the third- and fourth-order moments are
   reasonably consistent with the theory. The backward growth rates,
   corresponding to the ratio of the magnitude of the smallest to largest
   Lyapunov exponents, are about 50\% greater than the forward growth
   rates, somewhat higher than other estimates. The predicted asymmetry
   between backward and forward relative displacements at early times,
   manifested in a t(3) variation of the difference in the backward and
   forward mean-square relative displacement, was confirmed numerically and
   explicitly traced to Eulerian properties at the small scales. However,
   this t(3) growth is not simply connected to the t(3) growth in the
   Richardson regime and the asymmetry manifested there by the difference
   in the backward and forward Richardson constants. Asymmetry in time for
   higher order moments was also explained using a Taylor-series analysis
   at early times. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient scavenging the kinetic energy from air-flow represents a
   promising approach for obtaining clean, sustainable electricity. Here,
   we report an elasto-aerodynamics-driven triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG) based on contact electrification. The reported TENG consists of a
   Kapton film with two Cu electrodes at each side, fixed on two ends in an
   acrylic fluid channel. The relationship between the TENG output power
   density and its fluid channel dimensions is systematically studied. TENG
   with a fluid channel size of 125 x 10 x 1.6 mm(3) delivers the maximum
   output power density of about 9 kW/m(3) under a loading resistance of
   2.3 M Omega. Aero-elastic flutter effect explains the air-flow induced
   vibration of Kapton film well. The output power scales nearly linearly
   with parallel wiring of multiple TENGs. Connecting 10 TENGs in parallel
   gives an output power of 25 mW, which allows direct powering of a globe
   light. The TENG is also utilized to scavenge human breath induced
   air-flow energy to sustainably power a human body temperature sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the non-centrosymmetric crystal structures, wurtzite family
   semiconducting materials possess piezoelectric properties and exhibit
   polarizations along certain directions upon straining. Utilizing
   strain-induced piezoelectric polarization charges to modulate the energy
   band structures and thus to tune/control the transport processes of
   charge carriers is referred to as the piezotronic effect. Distinct from
   the previous studies of c-axis GaN nanowires, here we systematically
   study the piezotronic-effect-induced modifications of energy band
   structures and the corresponding influence on electronic transport
   properties of a-axis GaN nanobelts. The physical mechanism is carefully
   illustrated and further confirmed by theoretical simulations via finite
   element analysis. The spatial distributions of local carrier
   concentration and the energy band diagrams of a-axis GaN under various
   straining conditions are calculated. This work provides a thorough
   understanding of strain-gated transport properties of a-axis GaN
   piezotronic transistors and its future applications in semiconductor
   devices.}},

Title = {{Metal-Enhanced Near-Infrared Fluorescence by Micropatterned Gold
   Nanocages}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{10047-10054}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF), the localized surface plasmon
   resonances of metallic nanostructures amplify the absorption of
   excitation light and assist in radiating the consequent fluorescence of
   nearby molecules to the far-field. This effect is at the base of various
   technologies that have strong impact on fields such as optics, medical
   diagnostics, and biotechnology. Among possible emission bands, those in
   the near-infrared (NIR) are particularly intriguing and widely used in
   proteomics and genomics due to its noninvasive character for
   biomolecules, living cells, and tissues, which greatly motivates the
   development of effective and, eventually, multifunctional NIR-MEF
   platforms. Here, we demonstrate NIR-MEF substrates based on Au nanocages
   micropatterned with a tight spatial control. The dependence of the
   fluorescence enhancement on the distance between the nanocage and the
   radiating dipoles is investigated experimentally and modeled by taking
   into account the local electric field enhancement and the modified
   radiation and absorption rates of the emitting molecules. At a distance
   around 80 nm, a maximum enhancement up to 2-7 times with respect to the
   emission from pristine dyes (in the region 660-740 nm) is estimated for
   films and electrospun nanofibers. Due to their chemical stability,
   finely tunable plasnnon resonances, and large light absorption cross
   sections, Au nanocages are ideal NIR-MEF agents. When these properties
   are integrated with the hollow interior and controllable surface
   porosity, it is feasible to develop a nanoscale system for targeted drug
   delivery with the diagnostic information encoded in the fluorophore.}},

Title = {{Facile Synthesis of Ag Nanorods with No Plasmon Resonance Peak in the
   Visible Region by Using Pd Decahedra of 16 nm in Size as Seeds}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{10523-10532}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a seed-mediated approach to the synthesis of Ag
   nanorods with thin diameters and tunable aspect ratios. The success of
   this method is built upon our recent progress in the synthesis of Pd
   decahedra as uniform samples, together with controllable sizes. When
   used as a seed, the Pd decahedron could direct the deposition of Ag
   atoms along the 5-fold axis to generate a nanorod, with its diameter
   being determined by the lateral dimension of the seed. We were able to
   generate Ag nanorods with uniform diameters down to 20 nm. Under the
   conditions we used for growth, symmetry breaking occurred as the Ag
   atoms were only deposited along one side of the Pd decahedral seed to
   generate a Ag nanorod with the Pd seed being positioned at one of its
   two ends. We also systematically investigated the localized surface
   plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties of the Ag nanorods. With the
   transverse mode kept below 400 nm, the longitudinal mode could be
   readily tuned from the visible to the near-infrared region by varying
   the aspect ratio. As an important demonstration, we obtained Ag nanorods
   with no LSPR peak in the visible spectrum (400-800 nm), which are
   attractive for applications related to the fabrication of touchscreen
   displays, solar films, and energy-saving smart windows.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional numerical simulations of a test section modeling a
   single module of the helium-cooled modular divertor with multiple jets
   (HEMJ) design were performed to complement experimental studies at
   nearly prototypical conditions as part of the joint US-Japan effort on
   plasma-facing components evaluation by tritium plasma, heat, and neutron
   irradiation experiments (PHENIX). The Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model
   gave numerical predictions of the cooled surface temperature that were
   in good agreement with experimental estimates from a new helium loop.
   The simulations showed that spatial variations in incident heat flux, at
   least in the form of a Gaussian function, had a negligible effect on
   cooled surface temperatures.
   Our initial results indicate that the numerical predictions of the
   thermal performance of a single HEMJ module are in reasonable agreement
   with the experimental studies. The simulations do, however, predict
   slightly higher heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) than the experimental
   studies, presumably because they do not account for thermal losses. The
   HTC appears to be essentially independent of incident heat flux,
   suggesting that the model can be used to investigate parameters that
   cannot be determined experimentally in many cases, such as the local HTC
   and temperature distributions within the divertor pressure boundary, at
   prototypical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The new Irradiated Material Target Station (IMTS) facility for fusion
   materials at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) uses an infrared
   plasma-arc lamp (PAL) to deliver incident heat fluxes as high as 27
   MW/rn(2). The facility is being used to test neutron irradiated
   plasma-facing component materials as part of the joint US-Japan PHENIX
   program. The irradiated samples are to be mounted on molybdenum sample
   holders attached to a water-cooled copper rod. Depending on the size and
   geometry of samples, several sample holders and copper rod
   configurations have been fabricated and tested.
   As a part of the effort to design sample holders compatible with the
   high heat flux (HHF) testing to be conducted at the IMTS facility,
   numerical simulations have been petformed for two different water-cooled
   sample holder designs using the ANSYS((TM)) FLUENT (R) 14.0 commercial
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package. The primary
   objective of this work is to evaluate the cooling capability of
   different sample holder designs, i.e. to estimate their maximum
   allowable incident heat flux values.
   2D axisymmetric numerical simulations are performed using the realizable
   k-epsilon turbulence model and the RPI nucleate boiling model within
   ANSYS (TM) FLUENT (R) 14.0. The results of the numerical model were
   compared against the experimental data for two sample holder designs
   tested in the IMTS facility. The model has been used to parametrically
   evaluate the effect of various operational parameters on the predicted
   temperature distributions. The results were used to identify the
   limiting parameter for safe operation of the two sample holders and the
   associated peak heat flux limits. The results of this investigation will
   help guide the development of new sample holder designs.}},

Abstract = {{Natural substrates like sand, soil, leaf litter and snow vary widely in
   penetration resistance. To search for principles of appendage design in
   robots and animals that permit high performance on such flowable ground,
   we developed a ground control technique by which the penetration
   resistance of a dry granular substrate could be widely and rapidly
   varied. The approach was embodied in a device consisting of an air
   fluidized bed trackway in which a gentle upward flow of air through the
   granular material resulted in a decreased penetration resistance. As the
   volumetric air flow, Q, increased to the fluidization transition, the
   penetration resistance decreased to zero. Using a bio-inspired hexapedal
   robot as a physical model, we systematically studied how locomotor
   performance ( average forward speed, v(x)) varied with ground
   penetration resistance and robot leg frequency. Average robot speed
   decreased with increasing Q, and decreased more rapidly for increasing
   leg frequency,omega. A universal scaling model revealed that the leg
   penetration ratio (foot pressure relative to penetration force per unit
   area per depth and leg length) determined vx for all ground penetration
   resistances and robot leg frequencies. To extend our result to include
   continuous variation of locomotor foot pressure, we used a resistive
   force theory based terradynamic approach to perform numerical
   simulations. The terradynamic model successfully predicted locomotor
   performance for low resistance granular states. Despite variation in
   morphology and gait, the performance of running lizards, geckos and
   crabs on flowable ground was also influenced by the leg penetration
   ratio. In summary, appendage designs which reduce foot pressure can
   passively maintain minimal leg penetration ratio as the ground weakens,
   and consequently permits maintenance of effective locomotion over a
   range of terradynamically challenging surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new template-free method for the insitu formation of a

   Torlon polymer dope in a core support layer. This new method can be
   integrated easily into current hollow-fiber composite fabrication
   processes. The hollow-fiber composites were then functionalized with
   3-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane (APS) and evaluated for their CO2-capture
   performance. The resulting APS-functionalized mesoporous silica
   nanoparticles/Torlon hollow fibers exhibited a high CO2 equilibrium
   capacity of 1.5 and 1.9mmolg(-1) at 35 and 60 degrees C, respectively,
   which is significantly higher than values for fiber sorbents without

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Oxide supports functionalized with amine moieties have been
   used for decades as catalysts and chromatographic media. Owing to the
   recognized impact of atmospheric CO2 on global climate change, the study
   of the use of amine-oxide hybrid materials as CO2 sorbents has exploded
   in the past decade. While the majority of the work has concerned
   separation of CO2 from dilute mixtures such as flue gas from coal-fired
   power plants, it has been recognized by us and others that such
   supported amine materials are also perhaps uniquely suited to extract
   CO2 from ultradilute gas mixtures, such as ambient air. As unique, low
   temperature chemisorbents, they can operate under ambient conditions,
   spontaneously extracting CO2 from ambient air, while being regenerated
   under mild conditions using heat or the combination of heat and vacuum.
   This Account describes the evolution of our activities on the design of
   amine-functionalized silica materials for catalysis to the design,
   characterization, and utilization of these materials in CO2 separations.
   New materials developed in our laboratory, such as hyperbranched
   aminosilica materials, and previously known amine-oxide hybrid
   compositions, have been extensively studied for CO2 extraction from
   simulated ambient air (400 ppm of CO2). The role of amine type and
   structure (molecular, polymeric), support type and structure, the
   stability of the various compositions under simulated operating
   conditions, and the nature of the adsorbed CO2 have been investigated in
   detail. The requirements for an effective, practical air capture process
   have been outlined and the ability of amine oxide hybrid materials to
   meet these needs has been discussed. Ultimately, the practicality of
   such a ``direct air capture{''} process is predicated not only on the
   physicochemical properties of the sorbent, but also how the sorbent
   operates in a practical process that offers a scalable gas solid
   contacting strategy. In this regard, the utility of low pressure drop
   monolith contactors is suggested to offer a practical mode of amine
   sorbent/air contacting for direct air capture.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{493-505}},
Month = {{OCT-NOV}},
Abstract = {{A global polynomial variable scheduling method for aircraft controller
   is proposed to achieve runtime benefits with no degradation of
   controller stability. The method is benchmarked against two conventional
   methods: nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation. An examination of
   conventional method constructs reveals recursive local approximation
   generation as the most expensive step, whereas discontinuities and lack
   of first derivative smoothness lead to poor approximations. The proposed
   method features a multivariate polynomial as the variable scheduling
   mechanism that addresses both drawbacks concurrently and achieves
   significant runtime improvements by virtue of its very simple functional
   form. The mathematical formulation of the proposed approach is discussed
   along with practical considerations for implementation. Numerical flight
   dynamics simulations are conducted with the three methods for four
   flight maneuvers and using four scheduling variable sets of increasing
   resolution. Results show the proposed method significantly reduces
   runtime relative to nearest neighbor, and even more so relative to
   bilinear interpolation. Results also indicate comparable controller
   stability in terms of deviation from margins of optimum solutions. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a nonlinear lumped model that predicts the electrical
   input-output behavior of an ultrasonic system using CMUTs with arbitrary
   array/membrane/electrode geometry in different transmit-receive
   configurations and drive signals. The receive-only operation, where the
   electrical output signal of the CMUT array in response to incident
   pressure field is calculated, is included by modifying the boundary
   element-based vibroacoustic formulation for a CMUT array in rigid
   baffle. Along with the accurate large signal transmit model, this
   formulation covers pitch-catch and pulse-echo operation when transmit
   and receive signals can be separated in time. In cases when this
   separation is not valid, such as CMUTs used in continuous wave
   transmit-receive mode, pulse-echo mode with a nearby hard or soft wall
   or in a bounded space such as in a microfluidic channel, an efficient
   formulation based on the method of images is used. Some of these
   particular applications and the overall modeling approach have been
   validated through comparison with finite element analysis on specific
   examples including CMUTs with multiple electrodes. To further
   demonstrate the capability of the model for imaging applications, the
   two-way response of a partial dual-ring intravascular ultrasound array
   is simulated using a parallel computing cluster, where the output
   currents of individual array elements are calculated for given input
   pulse and compared with experimental results. With its versatility, the
   presented model can be a useful tool for rapid iterative CMUT-based
   system design and simulation for a broad range of ultrasonic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Getting dirty is a fundamental problem, and one for which there are few
   solutions, especially across the enormous range of animal size. How do
   both a honeybee and a squirrel get clean? In this Review, we discuss two
   broad types of cleaning, considered from the viewpoint of energetics.
   Non-renewable cleaning strategies rely upon the organism as an energy
   source. Examples include grooming motions, wet-dog shaking or the
   secretion of chemicals. Renewable cleaning strategies depend on
   environmental sources of energy, such as the use of eyelashes to
   redirect incoming wind and so reduce deposition onto the eye. Both
   strategies take advantage of body hair to facilitate cleaning, and
   honeybees and squirrels, for example, each have around 3 million hairs.
   This hair mat increases the area on which particles can land by a factor
   of 100, but also suspends particles above the body, reducing their
   adhesion and facilitating removal. We hope that the strategies outlined
   here will inspire energy-efficient cleaning strategies in synthetic
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Local or small-area estimates to capture emerging trends across large
   geographic regions are critical in identifying and addressing
   community-level health interventions. However, they are often
   unavailable due to lack of analytic capabilities in compiling and
   integrating extensive datasets and complementing them with the knowledge
   about variations in state-level health policies. This study introduces a
   modeling approach for small-area estimation of spatial access to
   pediatric primary care that is data ``rich{''} and mathematically
   rigorous, integrating data and health policy in a systematic way. We
   illustrate the sensitivity of the model to policy decision making across
   large geographic regions by performing a systematic comparison of the
   estimates at the census tract and county levels for Georgia and
   California. Our results show the proposed approach is able to overcome
   limitations of other existing models by capturing patient and provider
   preferences and by incorporating possible changes in health policies.
   The primary finding is systematic underestimation of spatial access, and
   inaccurate estimates of disparities across population and across
   geography at the county level with respect to those at the census tract
   level with implications on where to focus and which type of
   interventions to consider.}},

   Young Adults in Singapore}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Elevated blood pressure (BP) during early life years is associated with
   future risk of hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
   This study aimed to determine the prevalence and lifestyle factors
   associated with prehypertension (systolic BP (SBP) 120-139 mm Hg and/or
   diastolic BP (DBP) 80-89 mm Hg) or hypertension (SBP >= 140 mm Hg and/or
   DBP >= 90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medications) among young adults
   at a Singapore university.
   METHODS
   A cross-sectional survey of 501 university-going young adults aged 18-40
   years in Singapore was conducted using convenience sampling. Data on BP,
   body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle factors (meals eaten away from
   home/week, physical activity) was collected, and their association with
   prehypertension or hypertension was determined.
   RESULTS
   Prehypertension was found in 27.4\% (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   = 24-32) of the population: 49\% (44-58) in men and 9\% (6-13) in women
   (P < 0.001). 2.2\% (1.2-3.9) had hypertension. In a multivariable model,
   those with prehypertension or hypertension tended to eat more meals away
   from home per week (per meal/week odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95\% CI =
   1.01-1.09), have higher BMI (per kg/m(2) OR = 1.15, 95\% CI =
   1.02-1.30), and low physical activity (low vs. moderate/high activity OR
   = 2.14, 95\% CI = 1.20-3.82). Other associates were male gender (OR =
   7.01, 95\% CI = 3.97-12.4) and older age (per year OR = 1.06, 95\% CI =
   1.01-1.11).
   CONCLUSION
   Prehypertension may be common among university-going young adults in
   Singapore and is associated with potentially preventable lifestyle
   factors. Our findings call for large-scale population-based studies,
   including lifestyle modification trials for prevention of hypertension
   among young adults in Singapore.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional particle tracking is important to accurately
   understand the motion of particles within complex flow fields. We show
   that three-dimensional trajectories of particles within microfluidic
   flow can be extracted from two-dimensional bright field video
   microscopy. The method utilizes the defocusing that occurs as particles
   move out of the objective focal plane when viewed through a high
   numerical aperture objective lens. A fast and simple algorithm based on
   cross correlation to a set of reference images taken at prescribed
   amounts of defocus is used to extract out-of-plane particle position.
   In-plane particle position is determined through center point detection
   and therefore the particle position in all three dimensions can be
   constructed at each time point. Particle trajectories at high flow
   velocity of greater than 2 mm/s can be tracked by utilizing a high speed
   camera to obtain unblurred images. Three dimensional computational fluid
   simulations are used to validate the particle tracking methods. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Protonated titanate nanotube (PTNT) with large pore size and high pore
   volume synthesized by a hydrothermal method was modified with different
   amounts of tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) through wet impregnation for
   CO2 adsorption. The as-synthesized adsorbents were characterized by
   different techniques such as nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron
   microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis.
   CO2 capture performances of the sorbents were tested by a fixed-bed
   reactor equipped with anon-line gas chromatograph. The CO2 capacity of
   PTNT with 60 wt.\% TEPA loading was as high as 4.13 mmol/g under the
   conditions of 10.0\% (v/v) CO2 in N-2 at 75 degrees C, which is higher
   than those achieved with analogue TEPA impregnated SBA-15 and many other
   previously reported TEPA-impregnated materials. The high CO2 uptake is
   probably due to the large pore size and high pore volume of PTNT support
   combined with its special surface characteristics. Cyclic CO2
   adsorption-desorption tests demonstrated the excellent regenerability
   and stability of the PTNT-based sorbent The high CO2 uptake, positive
   effect of moisture and good recyclability of TEPA modified PTNT
   demonstrate its great potential in capture of CO2 from flue gas. (C)

Abstract = {{A new helium (He) loop was used to study the helium-cooled modular
   divertor with multiple jets (HEMJ) at incident heat fluxes q{''} <= 6.6
   MW/m(2) as part of the joint US-Japan effort on plasma-facing components
   evaluation by tritium plasma, heat, and neutron irradiation experiments
   (PHENIX). These studies were performed at prototypical pressures of 10
   MPa and inlet temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 300 degrees C.
   The effect of varying the distance between the inner jets cartridge and
   the outer shell from 0.44 to 0.9 mm was also investigated.
   The Nusselt number (Nu) over bar results for two different
   tungsten-alloy test sections were in good agreement for q{''} = 1.5-6.6
   MW/m(2). The experiments also suggest that the loss coefficient K-L, is
   essentially constant. These (Nu) over bar and K-L/n, results were used
   to estimate the maximum heat flux q{''}max that can be accommodated by
   the divertor under prototypical conditions and the coolant pumping power
   as a fraction of the incident thermal power beta. The agreement over the
   broad range of experimental parameters studied suggests that these
   results at near-prototypical conditions can be extrapolated with
   reasonable confidence to the operating conditions expected for the HEMJ
   design.}},

Abstract = {{New cloud services are being developed to support a wide variety of
   real-life applications. In this paper, we introduce a new cloud service:
   industrial automation, which includes different functionalities from
   feedback control and telemetry to plant optimization and enterprise
   management. We focus our study on the feedback control layer as the most
   time-critical and demanding functionality. Today's large-scale
   industrial automation projects are expensive and time-consuming. Hence,
   we propose a new cloud-based automation architecture, and we analyze
   cost and time savings under the proposed architecture. We show that
   significant cost and time savings can be achieved, mainly due to the
   virtualization of controllers and the reduction of hardware cost and
   associated labor. However, the major difficulties in providing
   cloud-based industrial automation systems are timeliness and
   reliability. Offering automation functionalities from the cloud over the
   Internet puts the controlled processes at risk due to varying
   communication delays and potential failure of virtual machines and/or
   links. Thus, we design an adaptive delay compensator and a distributed
   fault tolerance algorithm to mitigate delays and failures, respectively.
   We theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed architecture
   when compared to the traditional systems and prove zero or negligible
   change in performance. To experimentally evaluate our approach, we
   implement our controllers on commercial clouds and use them to control:
   (i) a physical model of a solar power plant, where we show that the
   fault-tolerance algorithm effectively makes the system unaware of
   faults, and (ii) industry-standard emulation with large injected delays
   and disturbances, where we show that the proposed cloud-based
   controllers perform indistinguishably from the best-known counterparts:
   local controllers.}},

Abstract = {{The vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism enables the bottom-up, or

   reverse process, whereby catalyst atoms are selectively removed from the

   dicarbonyl precursor 2,3-butanedione, results in axial nanowire etching.
   Experiments as a function of substrate temperature, etchant flow rate,
   and nanowire diameter support a solid-liquid-vapor (SLV) mechanism. An
   etch model with reaction at the liquid-vapor interface as the
   rate-limiting step is consistent with our experiments. These results
   identify a new mechanism to in situ tune the concentration of
   semiconductor atoms in the catalyst droplet.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody aggregation is frequently mediated by the complementarity
   determining regions within the variable domains and can significantly
   decrease purification yields, shorten shelf-life and increase the risk
   of anti-drug immune responses. Aggregation-resistant antibodies could
   offset these risks; accordingly, we have developed a directed evolution
   strategy to improve Fab stability. A Fab-phage display vector was
   constructed and the V-H domain targeted for mutagenesis by error-prone
   PCR. To enrich for thermoresistant clones, the resulting phage library
   was transiently heated, followed by selection for binding to an
   anti-light chain constant domain antibody. Five unique variants were
   identified, each possessing one to three amino acid substitutions. Each
   engineered Fab possessed higher, Escherichia coli expression yield, a
   2-3A degrees C increase in apparent melting temperature and improved
   aggregation resistance upon heating at high concentration. Select
   mutations were combined and shown to confer additive improvements to
   these biophysical characteristics. Finally, the wild-type and most
   stable triple variant Fab variant were converted into a human IgG1 and
   expressed in mammalian cells. Both expression level and aggregation
   resistance were similarly improved in the engineered IgG1. Analysis of
   the wild-type Fab crystal structure provided a structural rationale for
   the selected residues changes. This approach can help guide future Fab
   stabilization efforts.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{19}},

Abstract = {{A sequential extraction approach was used to evaluate the effects of
   various combinations of passivators (sepiolite, phosphate rock, and coal
   fly ash) on the concentration and speciation of Cu in swine manure
   aerobic compost along with soil to which the compost had been applied.
   The results indicate that the various passivators altered the bound
   forms of Cu in pig manure and soil; the concentrations of exchangeable
   and Fe-Mn-bound Cu decreased, whereas the residual Cu concentration
   increased, indicating that Cu transformed to low-availability forms
   after the passivator treatments. The concentrations of the
   carbonate-bound and organic-bound Cu varied widely. Among all
   treatments, the treatment of the control + straw + sepiolite + coal fly
   ash (2.5 \%) + phosphate rock (5.0 \%) resulted in the most efficient
   passivation of Cu; the percentage of residual Cu reached 3.91-21.14 \%,
   obviously surpassing the percentage for the control without passivation.
   The treatment of the control + straw + sepiolite + phosphate rock (2.5
   \%) resulted in the lowest residual Cu fraction (0.85 \%) among
   passivator treatments. These results show that the addition of suitable
   combinations of passivators to the composting process reduced the
   availability of Cu and the risk of Cu pollution during the application
   of composted pig manure to soil. Passivation also decreased the Cu
   content of Apium graveolens.}},

Abstract = {{Synopsis This study examined the behavioral response of two marine
   copepods, Acartia tonsa and Temora longicornis, to a Burgers' vortex
   intended to mimic the characteristics of a turbulent vortex that a
   copepod is likely to encounter in the coastal or near-surface zone.
   Behavioral assays of copepods were conducted for two vortices that
   correspond to turbulent conditions with mean dissipation rates of
   turbulence of 0.009 and 0.096 cm(2) s(-3) (denoted turbulence level 2
   and level 3, respectively). In particular, the Burgers' vortex
   parameters (i.e., circulation and rate of axial strain rate) were
   specified to match a vortex corresponding to the median rate of
   dissipation due to viscosity for each target level of turbulence.
   Three-dimensional trajectories were quantified for analysis of swimming
   kinematics and response to hydrodynamic cues. Acartia tonsa did not
   significantly respond to the vortex corresponding to turbulence level 2.
   In contrast, A. tonsa significantly altered their swimming behavior in
   the turbulence-level-3 vortex, including increased relative speed of
   swimming, angle of alignment of the trajectory with the axis of the
   vortex, ratio of net-to-gross displacement, and acceleration during
   escape, along with decreased turn frequency (relative to stagnant
   control conditions). Further, the location of A. tonsa escapes was
   preferentially in the core of the stronger vortex, indicating that the
   hydrodynamic cue triggering the distinctive escape behavior was
   vorticity. In contrast, T. longicornis did not reveal a behavioral
   response to either the turbulence level 2 or the level 3 vortex.}},

Abstract = {{This paper continues the study of the effective adhesion of thin films
   on rigid substrates in the presence of spatial heterogeneities started
   in Xia et al. (2013). In this paper, we focus on thin adhesive tape with
   spatial heterogeneity in the adhesive strength. This heterogeneity leads
   to a wavy peel front and consequently a complex corrugated shape in the
   tape. We develop a theory for the evolution of the peel front that
   accounts for this complex interaction, and an experimental method that
   is able to examine this in detail. We show through theory and
   experimentation that spatial patterning of the adhesive strength can
   lead to a very rich range of behaviors in the effective adhesive
   strength. In particular we show that adhesive heterogeneity can be used
   to create asymmetry in that the force required to peel the tape in one
   direction can be different from that in the other. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In recent years, triboelectric nanogenerators have attracted much
   attention because of their unique potential in self-powered nanosensors
   and nanosystems. In this paper, we report a cylindrical spiral
   triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG), which not only can produce high
   electric output to power display devices, but also can be used as a
   self-powered displacement sensor integrated on a measurement ruler. At a
   sliding speed of 2.5 m/s, S-TENG can generate a short-circuit current (I
   (SC)) of 30 A mu A and an open-circuit voltage (V (OC)) of 40 V. As the
   power source, we fabricate a transparent and flexible hand-driven
   S-TENG. Furthermore, we demonstrate a self-powered S-TENG-based
   measuring tapeline that can accurately measure and display the
   pulled-out distance without the need for an extra battery. The results
   obtained indicate that TENG-based devices have good potential for
   application in self-powered measurement systems.}},

Abstract = {{Solder bump technology has been widely used in electronic packaging.
   With the development of solder bumps towards higher density and finer
   pitch, it is more difficult to inspect the defects of solder bumps as
   they are hidden in the package. A nondestructive method using the
   transient active thermography has been proposed to inspect the defects
   of a solder bump, and we aim at developing an intelligent diagnosis
   system to eliminate the influence of emissivity unevenness and
   non-uniform heating on defects recognition in active infrared testing.
   An improved fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm based on the entropy weights
   is investigated in this paper. The captured thermograms are preprocessed
   to enhance the thermal contrast between the defective and good bumps.
   Hot spots corresponding to 16 solder bumps are segmented from the
   thermal images. The statistical features are calculated and selected
   appropriately to characterize the status of solder bumps in FCM
   clustering. The missing bump is identified in the FCM result, which is
   also validated by the principle component analysis. The intelligent
   diagnosis system using FCM algorithm with the entropy weights is
   effective for defects recognition in electronic packages.}},

Title = {{Home-based telecommuting and intra-household interactions in work and

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Although telecommuting has become a popular option as a new mode of
   working, no theoretical or empirical consensus has been reached on its
   potential for substituting or generating travel. This study aims to
   evaluate the impact of a household head's telecommuting on household
   travel while controlling for the interdependence within a household and
   across travel purposes, by applying seemingly unrelated censored
   regression models to data from the 2006 Household Travel Survey in the
   Seoul Metropolitan Area. In terms of vehicle kilometers traveled, the
   analysis shows that telecommuters' non-commute and non-work trips as
   well as his/her household members' non-work trips are greater than those
   of non-telecommuters and their household members', whereas telecommuting
   partially reduces commuting trips. However, an analysis stratified by
   household type reveals that the difference for household members is
   significant only in households with less than one vehicle per employed
   member: in such households (with insufficient vehicles available), the
   vehicle otherwise used for mandatory travel, such as for the household
   head's commute, can be used for non-commute purposes or by other
   household members if the household head does not use it for commuting.
   This implies that, when vehicle travel budgets of a given household are
   limited, this compensatory travel mechanism can make optimum use of
   limited resources (i.e., vehicles), but offsets the travel-substituting
   effect of telecommuting. Accordingly, to more precisely estimate the
   impact of telecommuting-promotion policies and apply them as part of
   travel demand management strategies, their counteracting effects among
   household members should be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{One of the significant challenges in bone tissue engineering is the
   integration of biomaterials designed to facilitate and stimulate
   mineralization with a simultaneously rapid rate of angiogenesis and
   vascularization of the tissue construct, a challenge complicated by our
   lack of knowledge of the interactions among key cell types and scaffold
   properties.
   This study compared functional activity of human bone marrow-derived
   stromal cells (hMSC) seeded onto a porous salt-leached poly(D,L-lactic
   acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds, with and without the incorporation of silk
   fibroin fibers and then further investigated their co-culture with human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cell viability,
   proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured for a
   range of time points in culture, with osteogenic and angiogenic marker
   immunolocalization and gene expression at selected stages.
   Our findings suggest that, despite similar porosity and pore size
   distribution exhibited by the PDLLA and PDLLA plus silk fibroin
   scaffolds, there were marked differences in cell distribution and
   function. In the absence of fibers, a highly osteogenic response was
   observed in hMSCs in the scaffolds co-cultured with endothelial cells,
   greater than that observed with hMSCs alone or in either of the
   scaffolds with fibers added. However, fiber presence clearly better
   supported endothelial cell cultures, as determined by greater levels of
   endothelial marker expression at both the gene and protein level after 3
   weeks of culture. The design of composite scaffolds integrating
   beneficial components of differing structures and materials to
   facilitate appropriate biological responses appears a promising yet
   challenging avenue of research.
   Statement of Significance
   A significant challenge in bone tissue engineering is to promote a rapid
   vascularization of the tissue construct in parallel to the extracellular
   matrix mineralization. The design of composite scaffolds integrating
   beneficial components of differing structures and materials to
   facilitate appropriate biological responses appears a promising yet
   challenging avenue of research. Here we investigated cultures of hMSCs
   and HUVECs on a silk fibroin enhanced PDLLA scaffold, showing that the
   final output of this in vitro system is not the linear sum of the
   effects of the single variables. These results are of interest as they
   demonstrate how the addition of endothelial cells can affect hMSC
   phenotype and that the output can be further modulated by the
   introduction of silk fibroin fibers. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Although the field of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has wide-ranging
   biomedical applicability, many QPI methods are not well-suited for such
   applications due to their reliance on coherent illumination and
   specialized hardware. By contrast, methods utilizing partially coherent
   illumination have the potential to promote the widespread adoption of
   QPI due to their compatibility with microscopy, which is ubiquitous in
   the biomedical community. Described herein is a new defocus-based
   reconstruction method that utilizes a small number of efficiently
   sampled micrographs to optimally invert the partially coherent phase
   optical transfer function under assumptions of weak absorption and
   slowly varying phase. Simulation results are provided that compare the
   performance of this method with similar algorithms and demonstrate
   compatibility with large phase objects. The accuracy of the method is
   validated experimentally using a microlens array as a test phase object.
   Lastly, time-lapse images of live adherent cells are obtained with an
   off-the-shelf microscope, thus demonstrating the new method's potential
   for extending QPI capability widely in the biomedical community. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of ozone (O-3) addition on laminar flame speeds (S-L) across
   a wide pressure range was investigated experimentally and numerically
   using three fuels, CH4, C2H4 and C3H8. Enhancement of S-L due to O-3
   addition was consistently observed for CH4 and C3H8 mixtures over a
   range of lean to rich equivalence ratios, based on comparisons of S-L
   measured with and without O-3 addition. For both fuels, simulation
   results agree with experimental results, with the best predictions at
   near stoichiometric conditions and the largest discrepancies for
   fuel-rich cases. A significant increase in the S-L enhancement was
   observed at elevated pressures: the enhancement in the measured S-L for
   a stoichiometric CH4/air mixture with 6334 parts per million (ppm) O-3
   addition increased from 7.7\% at atmospheric pressure to 11\% at 2.5
   atm. Elevated pressure both promotes O-3 decomposition, which provides O
   atoms, and suppresses diffusion of H, which reduces the influence of the
   O-3+H=OH+O-2 reaction. Together, these lead to the increased S-L
   enhancement with pressure. In contrast to the results for the two
   saturated hydrocarbons, both detrimental and beneficial effects due to
   O-3 addition were observed for the unsaturated hydrocarbon fuel, C2H4 in
   this study. With O-3 addition, C2H4/air S-L decreased at room
   temperature and pressure, owing to the heat loss induced by the
   exothermic ozonolysis reaction between O-3 and C2H4 in the mixing
   process, but increased as the ozonolysis reactions were minimized when
   reactants were cooled to 200 K or pressure was decreased below 0.66 atm.
   These experimental results were successfully explained by a numerical
   model that includes a new ozonolysis sub-mechanism. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{This experimental investigation quantified the shear wave velocity of
   granular packs composed of large grains mixed with small quantities of
   finer grains, up to the critical fines content (). Bender element tests
   were performed on 112 mixtures to quantify the variation of with fines
   content (FC), particle size ratio, and void ratio. When FC was less than
   , the shear wave velocity decreased with increasing FC, due to the
   reduction in interparticle contacts between large grains. In addition,
   the observed reduction in packing stiffness was more apparent as the
   size difference between the two particles increased. Most notably, the
   results of this study demonstrated that of granular mixtures of two
   different silica particles with was best expressed in terms of
   intergranular void ratio when finer particles were treated as void
   space, as opposed to the global void ratio.}},

Abstract = {{A low-leakage body-guarded analog switch (BG-switch) for slow
   switched-capacitor (SC) circuits is presented. The improvement of
   accuracy in SC circuits employing BG-switches is demonstrated by
   comparing their performance with counterparts employing conventionally
   biased CMOS switches in three applications: sample-and-hold (S/H)
   amplifier, SC amplifier, and high-voltage drain-extendedMOSFET (DEMOS).
   The leakage currents of BG-switch-enabled circuits are characterized
   across process variations and different operation voltages in all
   demonstrated applications. With nominal output voltages at room
   temperature, the average absolute leakage current of BG-switch-enabled
   S/H amplifier (12.02 aA), SC amplifier (54.52 aA), and DEMOS (53.71 fA)
   show leakage current improvement of 21, 28, and 17 dB, respectively,
   compared with equivalent circuits utilizing transmission gates (TGs).
   BG-switch-enabled S/H circuits and SC amplifiers with average
   performance exhibit lower leakage currents up to 100 degrees C compared
   with TG-enabled circuits. The demonstrated applications utilizing
   BG-switches were fabricated in a standard 0.35-mu m BiCMOS process.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most
   promising candidates for medium-/high-power applications, specifically
   for high-voltage direct current transmission systems. This paper
   proposes a control strategy for the MMC based on the sum-of-squares
   decomposition method. A bilinear mathematical discrete model of the MMC
   is derived in the rotating reference frame by including the dynamics of
   ac-side currents, circulating currents, dc-side current, and stored
   energy of the converter. The coordinates of the developed model are
   transformed to the origin, and the steady-state operating point of the
   MMC is calculated based on the desired reference values of the states. A
   quadratic Lyapunov function is defined and by converting the Lyapunov
   difference inequality to an SOS problem, a stabilizing controller is
   designed. The designed controller not only guarantees the Lyapunov
   stability of the states, but also controls the external and internal
   dynamics of the MMC with only one controller, instead of using several
   proportional-integral controllers. To improve the region of stability of
   the MMC, an optimization problem is formulated and solved, so the
   controller can stabilize the MMC from an initial operating point far
   from the steady-state operating point. The performance of the proposed
   strategy for a 20-level MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain
   simulation studies and is compared with the existing control methods.}},

Title = {{Cellular enrichment through microfluidic fractionation based on cell
   biomechanical properties}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{987-993}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The biomechanical properties of populations of diseased cells are shown
   to have differences from healthy populations of cells, yet the overlap
   of these biomechanical properties can limit their use in disease cell
   enrichment and detection. We report a new microfluidic cell enrichment
   technology that continuously fractionates cells through differences in
   biomechanical properties, resulting in highly pure cellular
   subpopulations. Cell fractionation is achieved in a microfluidic channel
   with an array of diagonal ridges that are designed to segregate
   biomechanically distinct cells to different locations in the channel.
   Due to the imposition of elastic and viscous forces during cellular
   compression, which are a function of cell biomechanical properties
   including size and viscoelasticity, larger, stiffer and less viscous
   cells migrate parallel to the diagonal ridges and exhibit positive
   lateral displacement. On the other hand, smaller, softer and more
   viscous cells migrate perpendicular to the diagonal ridges due to
   circulatory flow induced by the ridges and result in negative lateral
   displacement. Multiple outlets are then utilized to collect cells with
   finer gradation of differences in cell biomechanical properties. The
   result is that cell fractionation dramatically improves cell separation
   efficiency compared to binary outputs and enables the measurement of
   subtle biomechanical differences within a single cell type. As a
   proof-of-concept demonstration, we mix two different leukemia cell lines
   (K562 and HL60) and utilize cell fractionation to achieve over 45-fold
   enhancement of cell populations, with high-purity cellular enrichment
   (90-99 \%) of each cell line. In addition, we demonstrate cell
   fractionation of a single cell type (K562 cells) into subpopulations and
   characterize the variations of biomechanical properties of the separated
   cells with atomic force microscopy. These results will be beneficial to
   obtaining label-free separation of cellular mixtures or to better
   investigate the origins of biomechanical differences in a single cell
   type.}},

   number of samples and Rayleigh single input-single (SISO) and multiple
   input-multiple output (MIMO) channels with infinite samples when an
   eavesdropper employs a radiometer detector and has uncertainty about his
   noise variance. Leveraging recent results on the phenomenon of a
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) wall when there is eavesdropper noise power
   measurement uncertainty, we show that a nonzero privacy rate is
   possible. We also show that in this scenario, the detector should not

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation
   algorithm, which exploits the collected historic user ratings to predict
   unknown ratings. However, traditional recommender systems run at the
   central servers, and thus users have to disclose their personal rating
   data to other parties. This raises the privacy issue, as user ratings
   can be used to reveal sensitive personal information. In this paper, we
   propose a semi-distributed belief propagation (BP) approach to
   privacy-preserving item-based CF recommender systems. Firstly, we
   formulate the item similarity computation as a probabilistic inference
   problem on the factor graph, which can be efficiently solved by applying
   the BP algorithm. To avoid disclosing user ratings to the server or
   other user peers, we then introduce a semi-distributed architecture for
   the BP algorithm. We further propose a cascaded BP scheme to address the
   practical issue that only a subset of users participate in BP during one
   time slot. We analyze the privacy of the semi-distributed BP from a
   information-theoretic perspective. We also propose a method that reduces
   the computational complexity at the user side. Through experiments on
   the MovieLens dataset, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves
   superior accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous network (HetNet) integrated with multiple radio access
   technologies (RATs) is a promising technique for satisfying the
   exponentially increasing traffic demand of future cellular systems. In
   this paper, we investigate energy-efficient resource allocation in a
   multi-RAT HetNet, aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) for
   each individual user while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS)
   requirement. Since the EE cannot be simultaneously maximized for every
   user, a multiple-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated. To
   find its Pareto optimal solution, we first introduce the concept of
   Utopia EE, defined as the maximum achievable EE, for each user. Then,
   using the weighted Tchebycheff method, a single-objective optimization
   problem (SOOP) is formulated, which can achieve Pareto optimal solution
   of the original MOOP. The SOOP is a generalized fractional programming
   problem that aims to minimize the maximum of several quasiconvex
   fractional functions. We further transform the problem into an
   equivalent but better tractable one, and develop an iterative algorithm
   to effectively solve it. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm yields fast convergence, high system EE, and flexible EE
   tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{Targeted drug delivery systems (TDDSs) are therapeutic methods based on
   the injection and delivery of drug-loaded particles. The engineering of
   TDDSs must take into account both the therapeutic effects of the drug at
   the target delivery location and the toxicity of the drug while it
   accumulates in other regions of the body. These characteristics are
   directly related to how the drug-loaded particles distribute within the
   body, i.e., biodistribution, as a consequence of the processes involved
   in the particle propagation, i.e., pharmacokinetics. In this paper, the
   pharmacokinetics of TDDSs is analytically modeled through the
   abstraction of molecular communication, a novel paradigm in
   communication theory. Not only is the particle advection and diffusion,
   considered in our previous study, included in this model, but also are
   other physicochemical processes in the particle propagation, such as
   absorption, reaction, and adhesion. In addition, the proposed model
   includes the impact of cardiovascular diseases, such as arteriosclerosis
   and tumor-induced blood vessel leakage. Based on this model, the
   biodistribution at the delivery location is estimated through
   communication engineering metrics, such as channel delay and path loss,
   together with the drug accumulation in the rest of the body. The
   proposed pharmacokinetic model is validated against multiphysics
   finite-element simulations, and numerical results are provided for the
   biodistribution estimation in different scenarios. Finally, based on the
   proposed model, a procedure to optimize the drug injection rate is
   proposed to achieve a desired drug delivery rate. The outcome of this
   study is a multiscale physics-based analytical pharmacokinetic model.}},

Abstract = {{For sub-7-nm technology nodes, the gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire-based
   device structure is a strong candidate to sustain scaling according to
   Moore's Law. For the first time, the performance of two GAA device
   options-lateral FET (LFET) and vertical FET (VFET)-is benchmarked and
   analyzed at the system level using an ARM core processor, based on
   realistic compact device models at the 5-nm technology node. Tradeoffs
   among energy, frequency, leakage, and area are evaluated by a multi-Vth
   optimization flow. A variety of relevant device configurations,
   including various number of fins, nanowires, and nanowire stacks, are
   explored. The results demonstrate that an LFET GAA core has a larger
   maximum frequency than its VFET counterpart because the channel stress
   that can be created in the LFETs results in a larger ON current. For
   fast timing targets, the LFET cores are therefore superior. However, for
   slow timing targets (e.g., 5 ns), the VFET cores with three nanowires
   offer a 7\% area reduction and a 20\% energy saving compared with the
   LFET cores with 2fin/2stack at the same leakage power.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel short-term wind power forecasting approach
   bymining the bad data of numerical weather prediction (NWP). Today's
   short-term wind power forecast (WPF) highly depends on the NWP, which
   contributes the most in the WPF error. This paper first introduces a bad
   data analyzer to fully study the relationship between the WPF error with
   several new extracted features from the raw NWP. Second, a hierarchical
   structure is proposed, which is composed of a K-means clustering-based
   bad data detection module and a neural network (NN)-based forecasting
   module. In the NN module, the WPF is fully adjusted based on the output
   of the bad data analyzer. Simulations are performed comparing with two
   other different methods. It proves that the proposed approach can
   improve the short-term wind power forecasting by effectively identifying
   and adjusting the errors from NWP.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY \& CELL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Currently in the field of vascular biology, the role of epigenetics in
   endothelial cell biology and vascular disease has attracted more
   in-depth study. Using both in vitro and in vivo models of blood flow,
   investigators have recently begun to reveal the underlying epigenetic
   regulation of endothelial gene expression. Recently, our group, along
   with two other independent groups, have demonstrated that blood flow
   controls endothelial gene expression by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1
   and 3A). Disturbed flow (d-flow), characterized by low and oscillating
   shear stress (OS), is pro-atherogenic and induces expression of DNMT1
   both in vivo and in vitro. D-flow regulates genome-wide DNA methylation
   patterns in a DNMT-dependent manner. The DNMT inhibitor
   5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine (5Aza) or DNMT1 siRNA reduces OS-induced
   endothelial inflammation. Moreover, 5Aza inhibits the development of
   atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice. Through a systems biological analysis
   of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and gene expression data, we
   found 11 mechanosensitive genes which were suppressed by d-flow in vivo,
   experienced hypermethylation in their promoter region in response to
   d-flow, and were rescued by 5Aza treatment. Interestingly, among these
   mechanosensitive genes, the two transcription factors HoxA5 and 1(113
   contain cAMP-response-elements (CRE), which may indicate that
   methylation of CRE sites could serve as a mechanosensitive master switch
   in gene expression. These findings provide new insight into the
   mechanism by which flow controls epigenetic DNA methylation patterns,
   which in turn alters endothelial gene expression, regulates vascular
   biology, and induces atherosclerosis. These novel findings have broad
   implications for understanding the biochemical mechanisms of
   atherogenesis and provide a basis for identifying potential therapeutic
   targets for atherosclerosis.

Abstract = {{Numerous methods have been developed for immunogold labeling of thick,
   cryo-preserved biological specimens. However, most of the methods are
   permutations of chemical fixation and sample sectioning, which select
   and isolate the immunolabeled region of interest. We describe a method
   for combining immunogold labeling with cryo-electron microscopy
   (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of the surface proteins
   of intact mammalian cells or the surface glycoproteins of assembling and
   budding viruses in the context of virus-infected mammalian cells
   cultured on EM grids. In this method, the cells were maintained in
   culture media at physiologically relevant temperatures while
   sequentially incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies.
   Subsequently, the immunogold-labeled specimens were vitrified and
   observed under cryo-conditions in the transmission electron microscope.
   Cryo-EM and cryo-ET examination of the immunogold-labeled cells revealed
   the association of immunogold particles with the target antigens.
   Additionally, the cellular structure was unaltered by pre-immunolabeling
   chemical fixation and retained well-preserved plasma membranes,
   cytoskeletal elements, and macromolecular complexes. We think this
   technique will be of interest to cell biologists for cryo-EM and
   conventional studies of native cells and pathogen-infected cells.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Although multiple clinical trials are currently testing
   different stem cell therapies as treatment alternatives for many
   neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injury, the optimal injection
   parameters have not yet been defined.OBJECTIVE:To test the spinal cord's
   tolerance to increasing volumes and numbers of stem cell injections in
   the pig.METHODS:Twenty-seven female Gottingen minipigs received human
   neural progenitor cell injections using a stereotactic platform device.
   Cell transplantation in groups 1 to 5 (5-7 pigs in each) was undertaken
   with the intent of assessing the safety of an injection volume
   escalation (10, 25, and 50 mu L) and an injection number escalation (20,
   30, and 40 injections). Motor function and general morbidity were
   assessed for 21 days. Full necropsy was performed; spinal cords were
   analyzed for graft survival and microscopic tissue damage.RESULTS:No
   mortality or permanent surgical complications were observed during the
   21-day study period. All animals returned to preoperative baseline
   within 14 days, showing complete motor function recovery. The
   histological analysis showed that there was no significant decrease in
   neuronal density between groups, and cell engraftment ranged from 12\%
   to 31\% depending on the injection paradigm. However, tissue damage was
   identified when injecting large volumes into the spinal cord (50
   L).CONCLUSION:This series supports the functional safety of various
   injection volumes and numbers in the spinal cord and gives critical
   insight into important safety thresholds. These results are relevant to
   all translational programs delivering cell therapeutics to the spinal
   cord.ABBREVIATIONS:hNPC, human fetal cortex-derived neural progenitor

Abstract = {{The renewed interest for physical-layer security techniques has put
   forward a new role for error-control codes. In addition to ensuring
   reliability, carefully designed codes have been shown to provide a level
   of information-theoretic secrecy, by which the amount of information
   leaked to an adversary may be controlled. The ability to achieve
   informationtheoretic secrecy relies on the study of alternative coding
   mechanisms, such as channel resolvability and privacy amplification, in
   which error-control codes are exploited as a means to shape the
   distribution of stochastic processes. This use of error-control codes,
   which goes much beyond that of correcting errors, creates numerous new
   design challenges. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, the
   paper aims at providing system engineers with explicit tools to build
   simple secrecy codes in order to stimulate interest and foster their
   integration in communication system prototypes. Second, it aims at
   providing coding and information theorists with a synthetic overview of
   the theoretical concepts and techniques for secrecy. Finally, it aims at
   highlighting the open challenges and opportunities faced for the
   integration of these codes in practical systems.}},

Abstract = {{The extended high-order sandwich panel theory was formulated in its
   one-dimensional version for orthotropic elastic sandwich beams. This
   theory includes the in-plane rigidity of the core, and the
   compressibility of the soft core in the transverse direction is also
   considered. The novelty of this theory is that it allows for three
   generalized coordinates in the core (the axial and transverse
   displacements at the centroid of the core, and the rotation at the
   centroid of the core) instead of just one (midpoint transverse
   displacement) commonly adopted in other available theories. The theory
   was derived so that all core/face displacement continuity conditions are
   fulfilled. It is proven, by comparison to the elasticity solution, that
   this approach results in superior accuracy, especially for the cases of
   stiffer cores, for which cases of the other available sandwich
   computational models cannot correctly predict the stress fields
   involved. In this paper, a linear finite element is formulated based on
   the extended high-order sandwich panel theory. The element equations are
   outlined, and numerical results for the simply supported case of
   transverse distributed loading are produced for several typical sandwich
   configurations. These results are compared with the corresponding ones
   from the elasticity solution. The comparison among these numerical
   results shows that, with a relatively small number of elements, the
   results are very close to the elasticity ones in terms of both the
   displacements and stress or strains. Thus, the finite element version of
   the extended high-order sandwich panel theory constitutes a very
   powerful analytical tool for sandwich panels.}},

Abstract = {{Phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) is an important organic acid that has a wide
   range of applications. In this study, the membrane-bound l-amino acid
   deaminase (l-AAD) gene from Proteus mirabilis KCTC 2566 was expressed in
   Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and then the l-AAD was purified. After that,
   we used the purified enzyme and the recombinant E. coli whole-cell
   biocatalyst to produce PPA via a one-step biotransformation from
   l-phenylalanine. l-AAD was solubilized from the membrane and purified
   52-fold with an overall yield of 13 \%, which corresponded to a specific
   activity of 0.94 +/- 0.01 mu mol PPA min(-1)center dot mg(-1). Then, the
   biotransformation conditions for the pure enzyme and the whole-cell
   biocatalyst were optimized. The maximal production was 2.6 A +/- 0.1 g
   center dot L-1 (specific activity of 1.02 A +/- 0.02 mu mol PPA
   min(-1)center dot mg(-1) protein, 86.7 A +/- 5 \% mass conversion rate,
   and 1.04 g center dot L-1 center dot h(-1) productivity) and 3.3 A +/-
   0.2 g L-1 (specific activity of 0.013 A +/- 0.003 mu mol PPA
   min(-1)center dot mg(-1) protein, 82.5 A +/- 4 \% mass conversion rate,
   and 0.55 g center dot L-1 center dot h(-1) productivity) for the pure
   enzyme and whole-cell biocatalyst, respectively. Comparative studies of
   the enzymatic and whole-cell biotransformation were performed in terms
   of specific activity, production, conversion, productivity, stability,
   need of external cofactors, and recycling. We have developed two
   eco-friendly and efficient approaches for PPA production. The strategy
   described herein may aid the biotransformational synthesis of other
   alpha-keto acids from their corresponding amino acids.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Rothvo beta established that every linear program (LP)
   expressing the matching polytope has an exponential number of
   inequalities (formally, the matching polytope has exponential extension
   complexity). We generalize this result by deriving strong bounds on the
   LP inapproximability of the matching problem: for fixed 0 < epsilon < 1,
   every (1 -epsilon/n)-approximating LP requires an exponential number of
   inequalities, where n is the number of vertices. This is sharp, given
   the well-known rho-approximation of size O((n)(1/(1-rho))) provided by
   the odd-sets of size up to 1/(1-rho). Thus, matching is the first
   problem in P, which does not admit a fully polynomialsize LP relaxation
   scheme (the LP equivalent of an Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation
   Scheme), which provides a sharp separation from the polynomial-size LP
   relaxation scheme obtained, e.g., through constant-sized odd-sets
   mentioned above. Analyzing the size of LP formulations is equivalent to
   examining the nonnegative rank of matrices. We study the nonnegative
   rank through an information-theoretic approach; while it reuses key
   ideas from Rothvo beta, the main lower bounding technique is different:
   we employ the information-theoretic notion of Wyner's common information
   used for studying LP formulations. This allows us to analyze the
   nonnegative rank of perturbations of slack matrices, e.g., the
   approximations of the matching polytope. It turns out that the high
   extension complexity for the matching problem stems from the same source
   of hardness as in the case of the correlation polytope: a direct sum
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their high intrinsic axial thermal conductivity, carbon nanotube
   (CNT) arrays have generated much interest as next generation thermal
   interface materials. A significant barrier in their future use is
   CNT-substrate thermal boundary resistance. For this reason much research
   has been done in examining improved array adhesion methods. This paper
   models the thermal resistance of a novel interface structure which shows
   promise in achieving low thermal resistance and high mechanical
   compliance. Through the use of a thermal conductive adhesive attachment,
   overall thermal resistances below 1 mm(2) KW-1 can potentially be
   achieved using a vertically aligned CNT array, which will enable
   development of future high performance electronic packages. (C) 2015

Title = {{Micromechanical Model and Associated Validation for Dynamic Failure of
   Brittle Materials Containing Pores and Slit-Like Flaws}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing dynamic failure is critically important to a number of
   applications, among others including armor, material fragmentation, and
   structural blast. In brittle materials, this failure is driven by crack
   growth from pre-existing flaws in the material microstructure.
   Structural scale models that explicitly address the cracks associated
   with each individual flaw are computationally infeasible; therefore, a
   model that accurately links flaw population to dynamic failure strength
   provides a much-needed connection between the micro-scale and
   macroscale. The current paper introduces a micromechanical model that
   addresses the effects of both air-entrained pores and slit-like flaws on
   the strain-rate dependent uniaxial compressive strength of the material.
   In particular, four variants of the model are addressed: a
   two-dimensional (2D) model with only pore flaws, a 2D model with both
   pores and slit-like flaws, a pseudo-three-dimensional (3D) model with
   only pore flaws, and a pseudo-3D model with both pores and slit-like
   flaws. To demonstrate the relative success of each of these approaches,
   the model is based on microstructural characterization and subsequent
   Kolsky bar tests on air-entrained mortar. Air-entrained mortar provides
   an excellent model material for this study, since the pore population
   introduced by air-entrainment is characterized relatively easily and the
   slit-like flaw population is deduced from the sand gradation.
   Furthermore, the sample sizes used in the Kolsky bar set-up are larger
   than the length scale of the microstructure of mortar, so that the
   samples are reasonably representative and provide a good basis of
   comparison with the micromechanics model. The micromechanics model is
   shown to provide reasonable agreement with experimentally obtained
   uniaxial compressive dynamic strength of air-entrained mortar. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In Rothvo (Math Program 142(1-2):255-268, 2013) it was shown that there
   exists a 0/1 polytope (a polytope whose vertices are in ) such that any
   higher-dimensional polytope projecting to it must have facets, i.e., its
   linear extension complexity is exponential. The question whether there
   exists a 0/1 polytope with high positive semidefinite extension
   complexity was left open. We answer this question in the affirmative by
   showing that there is a 0/1 polytope such that any spectrahedron
   projecting to it must be the intersection of a semidefinite cone of
   dimension and an affine space. Our proof relies on a new technique to
   rescale semidefinite factorizations.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-agent networks are often modeled as interaction graphs, where the
   nodes represent the agents and the edges denote some direct
   interactions. The robustness of a multi-agent network to perturbations
   such as failures, noise, or malicious attacks largely depends on the
   corresponding graph. In many applications, networks are desired to have
   well-connected interaction graphs with relatively small number of links.
   One family of such graphs is the random regular graphs. In this paper,
   we present a decentralized scheme for transforming any connected
   interaction graph with a possibly non-integer average degree of k into a
   connected random m-regular graph for some m is an element of {[}k; k +
   2]. Accordingly, the agents improve the robustness of the network while
   maintaining a similar number of links as the initial configuration by
   locally adding or removing some edges.}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Nanotwinned Cu exhibits an unusual combination of ultra-high strength
   and high tensile ductility. However, its fracture behavior and
   associated microscopic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we
   study the fracture in a free-standing thin film of nanotwinned Cu using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For a pre-crack inclined to the
   twin boundary, MD simulations show a characteristic fracture mode of
   zigzag cracking, which arises due to periodic deflections of the crack
   path by twin boundaries. The mechanism of fracture involves the screw
   dislocation-mediated local thinning ahead of the crack, instead of
   cleavage fracture. Importantly, MD simulations show a unique fracture
   footprint of < 1 1 0 >-oriented crack edges, consistent with the
   previous experimental observation from in situ transmission electron
   microscopy. Our results reveal the toughening mechanisms by nanotwins
   and also have broader implications for understanding the mechanical
   failure of metallic thin films. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generalized source modeling method, referred here
   as distributed multilevel current (DMC) models, utilizing equivalent
   magnetizing currents as local point sources to describe material effects
   of commonly used magnetic components. Unlike existing numerical methods,
   which solve for the magnetic fields from Maxwell's equations and
   boundary conditions, the DMC-based method develops closed-form solutions
   to the magnetic field and force problems, while allowing tradeoffs
   between computational speed and accuracy using a multilevel structure to
   discretize geometry and minimize modeling errors in the neighborhood
   around the point sources. Typical DMC models for volume and surface
   current elements, permanent magnets, electromagnets, iron plate, and
   induced eddy currents are derived and validated by comparing their
   magnetic fields and forces with known (analytical, numerical, and/or
   experimental) solutions. Results of benchmark comparison demonstrate
   that the DMC methods reduce the computation time of magnetic fields and
   forces by several orders as compared to exact solutions numerically
   integrated from the Biot-Savart law and Lorentz force equation and
   finite-element analysis. The DMC models were experimentally applied to
   identify the EM coil position and PM magnetization of a commercial PM
   linear synchronous motor validating their effects on its torque ripple.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Stanford type B dissection of the descending aorta is a
   potentially fatal condition that is poorly understood. Limited
   scientific understanding of the role of current interventional
   techniques, as well as heterogeneity in the condition, contributes to
   lack of consensus as to the most effective treatment strategy. This
   study introduces an anatomically accurate model for investigating aortic
   dissection in a laboratory setting.
   Materials and methods: A silicone model was fabricated and filled with
   fluid to mimic human blood. Flow was established, and the model was
   scanned using a four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging
   protocol. On analysis, luminal flow rates were quantified by multiplying
   local velocity by included area.
   Results: The upstream total flow was compared with the sum of the flow
   in the true and false lumens. The two values were within the margin of
   error. Furthermore, flow rates matched with the relative areas of each

Abstract = {{The influence of temperature and water vapor on the high temperature
   oxidation of alloy 282 was investigated. The corrosion products were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and

   composed of TiO2 and Cr2O3, while the corrosion product for the internal
   oxide consisted of TiO2, Cr2O3 and Al2O3. Both temperature and water
   vapor can accelerate the oxidation rate. The coupling effect of the

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo examine the accuracy of computer-guided implantation using
   a human cadaver model with reduced experimental variability.
   Materials and methodsTwenty-eight (28) dental implants representing 12
   clinical cases were placed in four cadaver heads using a static guided
   implantation template. All planning and surgeries were performed by one
   clinician. All radiographs and measurements were performed by two
   examiners. The distance of the implants from buccal and lingual bone and
   mesial implant or tooth was analyzed at the apical and coronal levels,
   and measurements were compared to the planned values.
   ResultsNo significant differences were seen between planned and
   implanted measurements. Average deviation of an implant from its
   planning radiograph was 0.8mm, which is within the range of variability
   expected from CT analysis.
   ConclusionsGuided implantation can be used safely with a margin of error
   of 1mm.}},

Abstract = {{We present Mantis, a framework for predicting the computational resource
   consumption (CRC) of Android applications on given inputs accurately,
   and efficiently. A key insight underlying Mantis is that program codes
   often contain features that correlate with performance and these
   features can be automatically computed efficiently. Mantis
   synergistically combines techniques from program analysis and machine
   learning. It constructs concise CRC models by choosing from many program
   execution features only a handful that are most correlated with the
   program's CRC metric yet can be evaluated efficiently from the program's
   input. We apply program slicing to reduce evaluation time of a feature
   and automatically generate executable code snippets for efficiently
   evaluating features. Our evaluation shows that Mantis predicts four CRC
   metrics of seven Android apps with estimation error in the range of
   0-11.1 percent by executing predictor code spending at most 1.3 percent
   of their execution time on Galaxy Nexus.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents unsupervised algorithms for discovering previously
   unknown subspace trends in high-dimensional data sets without the
   benefit of prior information. A subspace trend is a sustained pattern of
   gradual/progressive changes within an unknown subset of feature
   dimensions. A fundamental challenge to subspace trend discovery is the
   presence of irrelevant data dimensions, noise, outliers, and confusion
   from multiple subspace trends driven by independent factors that are
   mixed in with each other. These factors can obscure the trends in
   conventional dimension reduction \& projection based data
   visualizations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
   graph-theoretic neighborhood similarity measure for detecting concordant
   progressive changes across data dimensions. Using this measure, we
   present an unsupervised algorithm for trend-relevant feature selection,
   subspace trend discovery, quantification of trend strength, and
   validation. Our method successfully identified verifiable subspace
   trends in diverse synthetic and real-world biomedical datasets.
   Visualizations derived from the selected trend-relevant features
   revealed biologically meaningful hidden subspace trend(s) that were
   obscured by irrelevant features and noise. Although our examples are
   drawn from the biological domain, the proposed algorithm is broadly
   applicable to exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data including
   visualization, hypothesis generation, knowledge discovery, and
   prediction in diverse other applications.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-polymer composites were investigated for their microwave
   properties in the frequency range of 30-1000 MHz to assess their
   application as inductor cores and electromagnetic isolation shield
   structures. NiFe and Fe nanoparticles were dispersed in epoxy as
   nanocomposites, in different volume fractions. The permittivity,
   permeability, and loss tangents of the composites were measured with an
   impedance analyzer and correlated with the magnetic properties of the
   particle such as saturation magnetization and field anisotropy. Fe-epoxy
   showed lower magnetic permeability but improved frequency stability,
   compared to the NiFe-epoxy composites of the same volume loading. This
   is attributed to the differences in nanoparticle's structure such as
   effective metal core size and particle-porosity distribution in the
   polymer matrix. The dielectric properties of the nanocomposites were
   also characterized from 30 MHz to 1000 MHz. The instabilities in the
   dielectric constant and loss tangent were related to the interfacial
   polarization relaxation of the particles and the dielectric relaxation

Abstract = {{A single parameter, the pressure-viscosity coefficient, , quantifies the

   measurements of viscosity as a function of pressure. Rather, these
   effective pressure-viscosity coefficients have been derived from the
   measurement of the EHL film thickness, a more difficult procedure. In
   this article, five well-characterized liquids that should be Newtonian
   in the EHL inlet are identified for which film-derived coefficients have
   been reported. These coefficients are compared with coefficients derived
   from published viscosity correlations and new viscosity measurements.
   The film-derived coefficients are found to not be an accurate
   representation of the piezoviscous response. The procedure of deriving a
   pressure-viscosity coefficient from a film thickness measurement does
   not offer an alternative to the simpler and easier viscometer
   measurement. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Propionic acid (PA) is an important platform chemical used in the
   agriculture, food, and pharmaceutical industries. The biosynthesis of PA
   by propionibacteria has become an attractive alternative to traditional
   petrochemical processes owing to the environmentally friendly features
   of biorefinery. In a previous study, we significantly increased PA
   production in Propionibacterium acidipropionici by improving acid
   tolerance via genome shuffling. In this study, we undertook metabolomics
   analysis of parental P. acidipropionici and its genome-shuffled mutant
   to find the key metabolic nodes influencing PA production. In total, 142
   intracellular metabolites were identified, of which those produced in
   amounts of greater than twofold difference between the two strains were
   further investigated with principal components analysis. The regulatory
   functions of key metabolites involved in the PA biosynthetic pathway
   were also forecast and analyzed according to their potential impact on
   metabolism. The results indicated that the amounts of metabolic
   intermediates of glycolysis, the Wood-Werkman cycle, and amino acid
   metabolism differed markedly between parental P. acidipropionici and its
   mutants. Based on the results of comparative metabolomics analysis,
   exogenous addition of key metabolites (precursors and amino acids) was
   performed to improve PA production. Under optimized conditions, 105 mM
   lactate, 20 mM fumarate, and 30 mM succinate were added to the culture
   of P. acidipropionici CGMCC 1.2230 in a 3-L anaerobic fermenter, and the
   PA titer increased from 23.1 +/- A 12 to 35.8 +/- A 1.0 g/L. This study
   revealed the key metabolic nodes of PA synthesis in P. acidipropionici
   through comparative metabolomics analysis, which may be helpful for the
   metabolic engineering of P. acidipropionici for improved PA production.}},

Abstract = {{The ignition behavior of aluminized HMX/Estane PBX under impact loading
   is analyzed through meso-scale simulations which account for constituent
   elasticity, viscoelasticity, elasto-viscoplasticity, fracture, internal
   contact, frictional heating, and heat conduction. The analyses involve
   explicit tracking of hotspot development and focuses on the probability
   of ignition, accounting for stochastic variations in microstructures
   which have HMX grain sizes ranging from 50 to 400 mu m, binder-grain
   bonding strength of 35 MPa, and binder-grain interface bonding energy on
   the order of 81 J/m(2). For the microstructure configuration studied, it
   is found that aluminization with particles 50 mu m in diameter delays
   the initiation of chemical reaction in the material. The mean time to
   ignition (t (50)) for cases with 6 to 18 pct Al by volume is 1 to 1.7 mu
   s longer (24 to 60 pct delay) as compared to that for the corresponding
   unaluminized PBX. To understand the mechanisms leading to the ignition
   delay, the differences in overall internal stresses, dissipations due to
   fracture and inelasticity, and hotspot field characteristics are
   quantified.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the influence of cooling rates on the
   thermal conduction behavior of nano-enhanced PCMs for thermal energy
   storage. 2-dimensional graphite nanosheets of different sizes have been
   applied to prepare the eicosane-based composite PCMs. Comprehensive
   measurements on the thermal storage properties of the prepared composite
   PCMs were also performed considering the factors including particle size
   as well as loading level. Results strongly revealed the tunable thermal
   conduction behavior of the solid-state composite PCMs versus cooling
   rate. As the cooling rate was ascended from 2.03 to 30.94 degrees C/min,
   more than 25\% drop of the solid-state thermal conductivity was observed
   for the samples containing graphite nanosheets. Besides a percolation
   threshold around 1 wt.\%, measured thermal conductivities increased
   linearly with the particle concentration, achieving the highest value of
   1.57 W/m K by GNS-30 at 5 wt.\%. Moreover, the graphite nanosheets with
   a larger size were found to cause higher improvement in thermal
   conductivity, and also the relatively higher viscosity of PCM
   suspensions. DSC results indicated the decrease in latent heat capacity
   of samples is negligible after the incorporation of graphite nanosheets.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{107-123}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The vertical upward Taylor flow regime has been extensively studied at
   the capillary and large channel scale limits. However, flow behavior at
   the intermediate scale (5 less than or similar to Bo less than or
   similar to 40, or 6 mm less than or similar to D less than or similar to
   17 mm for ambient gas-water flows) is comparatively poorly
   characterized. This regime is fundamentally different because classes of
   forces conventionally associated with either small or large Bond number
   flows are all relevant. In this investigation, air-water Taylor-flow
   experiments are conducted in 6.0, 8.0, and 9.5 mm diameter tubes.
   High-speed video data are collected, and automated image analysis
   algorithms are developed to measure flow parameters including: bubble
   rise velocity, liquid film thickness, void fraction, and Taylor bubble
   and liquid slug lengths. New correlations and flow models are developed
   to predict these parameters at the intermediate scale. Results from this
   study enable kinematic closure of intermediate scale Taylor flows. (C)

Title = {{Investigation of precipitate refinement in Mg alloys by an analytical
   composite failure model}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{59-71}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An analytical model is developed to simulate precipitate refinement in
   second phase strengthened magnesium alloys. The model is developed based
   on determination of the stress fields inside elliptical precipitates
   embedded in a rate dependent inelastic matrix. The stress fields are
   utilized to determine the failure mode that governs the refinement
   behavior. Using an AZ31 Mg alloy as an example, the effects the applied
   load, aspect ratio and orientation of the particle is studied on the
   macroscopic failure of a single alpha-Mg17Al12 precipitate.
   Additionally, a temperature dependent version of the corresponding
   constitutive law is used to incorporate the effects of temperature. In
   plane strain compression, an extensional failure mode always fragments
   the precipitates. The critical strain rate at which the precipitates
   start to fail strongly depends on the orientation of the precipitate
   with respect to loading direction. The results show that the higher the
   aspect ratio is, the easier the precipitate fractures. Precipitate shape
   is another factor influencing the failure response. In contrast to
   elliptical precipitates with high aspect ratio, spherical precipitates
   are strongly resistant to sectioning. In pure shear loading, in addition
   to the extensional mode of precipitate failure, a shearing mode may get
   activated depending on orientation and aspect ratio of the precipitate.
   The effect of temperature in relation to strain rate was also verified
   for plane strain compression and pure shear loading cases. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Network resources in mobile ad hoc wireless networks (MANETs) are
   constrained due to their dynamic topology and lack of centralized
   control. Mobile nodes in MANETs tend to broadcast packets to exchange
   information and consume lots of network resources such as network
   bandwidth and battery power of each node during forwarding their
   packets. Hence, the conserving network resource is crucial to maintain
   the quality of network services without interruptions. In order to
   discover an ideal routing algorithm that should use minimum network
   resources and improve network performance, we propose an
   adaptive-gossiping routing algorithm that saves network bandwidth and
   energy consumption at each node by reducing the duplicated routing
   messages. Our new analytical model of adaptive-gossiping probability
   provides a less routing overhead which results in conserving network
   resources and reducing the end-to-end delay. The both analytical and
   experimental results of our proposed method confirm its advantages over
   flooding and static-gossiping based routing protocols in large-scale
   networks.}},

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{Statistical energy modelling \& analysis of building stock is becoming
   mainstream in the context of city or district scale analysis of energy
   saving measures. A common aspect in such analyses is that there is
   generally a set of key explanatory variables or the main inputs that are
   statistically related to a quantity of interest (end-use energy or CO2).
   In the context of energy use in buildings, it is not uncommon that the
   explanatory variables may be correlated. However, there has been little
   discussion about the correlated variables in building stock research.
   This paper uses a set of campus buildings as a demonstrative case study
   to investigate the application of variable importance and meta-model
   construction in the case of correlated inputs when quantifying energy
   demand of a building stock. The variable importance analysis can
   identify key factors that explain energy consumption of a building
   stock. To this end, it is necessary to apply methods suitable for
   correlated inputs because the observational data (inputs) of buildings
   are usually correlated. For constructing statistical energy meta-models,
   two types of regression models are used: linear and non-parametric
   models. The results indicate that the linear models perform well
   compared to the complicated non-parametric models in this case. In
   addition, a simple transformation of the response, commonly used in
   linear regression, can improve predictive performance of both the linear
   and non-parametric models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since only the boundary of the domain requires discretization, the
   boundary element method (BEM) is very efficient for the semi-infinite or
   infinite rock-related engineering problems, e.g., hydraulic fracturing
   in reservoir stimulation and rock cutting during excavation. A real
   fracture in the solid is usually of an arbitrary geometry in three
   dimensions, which usually requires a three-dimensional displacement
   discontinuity method (3D DDM) to determine the deformation and stress
   field in order to achieve reliable results. However, the use of 3D DDM
   with triangular elements is limited by the singularities of the integral
   either within or nearby the domain. In this paper, a novel linear
   triangular element with three nodes on its vertices is proposed. The
   analytical integral expressions of this linear triangular element are
   also theoretically derived. A solution procedure is also described which
   can be applied to determine the displacement and stress field around a
   three-dimensional fracture inside the infinite solid. The accuracy of
   these results are compared with the analytical solutions of the
   displacements and stresses induced by a pressurized penny-shaped. This
   procedure takes a shorter time and requires less elements than the usual
   constant DDM when achieving the same accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Semiconducting conjugated polymers have drawn a great deal of attention
   over the past decade due to their solution processability and potential

   resultant morphology and device performance are investigated for devices
   processed from solvents with varied vapor pressure and a mixed solvent.
   We report that the use of a mixed solvent system is advantageous for
   controlling the initial vapor pressure of the processing solution,
   thereby controlling the phase separated morphology between P3HT and PCBM

Abstract = {{Green electrophosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with
   inverted top-emitting structures are demonstrated on bio-compatible
   shape memory polymer (SMP) substrates for wearable electronic
   applications. The combination of the unique properties of SMP substrates
   with the light-emitting properties of OLEDs pave to the way for new
   applications, including conformable smart skin devices, minimally
   invasive biomedical devices, and flexible lighting/display technologies.
   In this work, SMPs were designed to exhibit a considerable drop in
   modulus when a thermal stimulus is applied, allowing the devices to bend
   and conform to new shapes when its glass transition temperature is
   reached. These SMP substrates were synthesized using
   1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (TATATO),
   trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate) (TMTMP), and
   tricyclo{[}5.2.1.0(2,6)] decanedimethanol diacrylate (TCMDA), and show a
   low glass transition temperature of 43 degrees C, as measured using
   dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The OLEDs fabricated on these
   substrates exhibit high performance with a maximum efficacy of 33 cd/A
   measured at a luminance of 1000 cd/m(2), and a peak luminance of over
   30,000 cd/m(2). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Joint optimization for coordinated configuration of product families and
   supply chains by a leader-follower Stackelberg game}},

Abstract = {{Product family design by module configuration is conducive to
   accommodating product variety while maintaining mass production
   efficiency. Effective fulfillment of product families necessitates joint
   decision making of product family configuration (PFC) and downstream
   supply chain configuration (SCC), due to nowadays manufacturers' moving
   towards assembly-to-order production throughout a distributed supply
   chain network. Existing decision models for joint optimization of
   product family and supply chain configuration are originated from an
   ``all-in-one{''} approach that assumes both PFC and SCC decisions can be
   integrated into one optimization problem by aggregating two different
   types of objectives into a single objective function. Such an assumption
   neglects the complex tradeoffs underlying two different decision making
   problems and fails to reveal the inherent coupling of PFC and SCC.
   This paper formulates joint configuration of a product family and its
   supply chain as a leader-follower Stackelberg game that is enacted
   through a bi-level hierarchical optimization mechanism to model the
   coordination between two self-interested decision makers for PFC and
   SCC. The PFC decisions are modeled as an upper-level optimization
   problem (called leader) for optimal selection of modules, module
   instances, and product variants. The SCC decisions are modeled as a
   lower-level optimization problem (called follower), which responds to
   decisions of the upper level in order to determine an optimal supply
   chain configuration and inventory policies. A nonlinear, mixed integer
   programming model is formulated for the bi-level joint decision in the
   leader-follower game. To solve the nonlinear optimization model, a
   bi-level, nested genetic algorithm with constraint reasoning is
   developed and implemented. A case study of a power transformer product
   family and supply chain configuration is reported to demonstrate the
   feasibility and potential of the proposed leader-follower game-theoretic
   method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational

Title = {{A formalism for calculating the modal contributions to thermal interface
   conductance}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{A formalism termed the interface conductance modal analysis (ICMA)
   method is presented, which allows for calculations of the modal
   contributions to thermal interface conductance within the context of
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which inherently include
   anharmonicity to full order. The eigen modes of vibration in this study
   are calculated from harmonic lattice dynamics (LD) calculations, however
   the generality of ICMA formalism also allows for incorporation of
   anharmonic LD results into the calculations. ICMA can be implemented in
   both equilibrium MD (EMD) and non-equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations and
   both methods show qualitative agreement as validated through study of a
   simple system of Lennard-Jones solids. The formalism itself is based on
   a modal decomposition of the heat flow across an interface, which is
   then substituted into expressions for the conductance either based on
   EMD or NEMD. As a MD based method, it not only includes anharmonicity,
   but also naturally includes the atomic level details of the interface
   quality. The ICMA method now enables more in-depth study of various
   effects such as temperature, anharmonicity, interdiffusion, roughness,
   imperfections, dislocations, stress, changes in crystal structure
   through a single unified model, as it can essentially treat any material
   or object where the atoms vibrate around equilibrium sites (e.g.,
   ordered or disordered solids and molecules). This formalism therefore
   serves as an important step forward toward better understanding of heat
   flow at interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Low-cost microfluidic devices are desirable for many chemical processes;
   however, access to robust, inert, and appropriately structured materials
   for the inner channel wall is severely limited. Here, the shear force
   within confined microchannels was tuned through control of reactant
   solution fluid-flow and shown to dramatically impact nano- through
   microstructure growth. Combined use of experimental results and
   simulations allowed controlled growth of 3D networked Zn(OH)F
   nanostructures with uniform pore distributions and large fluid contact
   areas on inner microchannel walls. These attributes facilitated
   subsequent preparation of uniformly distributed Pd and PdPt networks
   with high structural and chemical stability using a facile, in situ
   conversion method. The advantageous properties of the microchannel based
   catalytic system were demonstrated using microwave-assisted
   continuous-flow coupling as a representative reaction. High conversion
   rates and good recyclability were obtained. Controlling materials
   nanostructure via fluid-flow-enhanced growth affords a general strategy
   to optimize the structure of an inner microchannel wall for desired
   attributes. The approach provides a promising pathway toward versatile,
   high-performance, and low-cost microfluidic devices for continuous-flow

Abstract = {{Unintentional incorporation of gallium (Ga) in InAlN layers grown with
   different molar flow rates of Group-III precursors by metalorganic
   chemical vapor deposition has been experimentally investigated. The Ga
   mole fraction in the InAl(Ga)N layer was increased significantly with
   the trimethylindium (TMIn) flow rate, while the trimethylaluminum flow
   rate controls the Al mole fraction. The evaporation of metallic Ga from
   the liquid phase eutectic system between the pyrolized In from injected
   TMIn and pre-deposited metallic Ga was responsible for the Ga
   auto-incorporation into the InAl(Ga) N layer. The theoretical
   calculation on the equilibrium vapor pressure of liquid phase Ga and the
   effective partial pressure of Group-III precursors based on growth
   parameters used in this study confirms the influence of Group-III
   precursors on Ga auto-incorporation. More Ga atoms can be evaporated
   from the liquid phase Ga on the surrounding surfaces in the growth
   chamber and then significant Ga auto-incorporation can occur due to the
   high equilibrium vapor pressure of Ga comparable to effective partial
   pressure of input Group-III precursors during the growth of InAl(Ga) N
   layer. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We show that in the context of the Iyer et al. (IMW) 67-variable cardiac
   myocycte model, it is possible to replace the detailed 13-state
   probabilistic subsystem of the sodium channel dynamics with a much
   simpler Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)-like two-state abstraction, while only
   incurring a bounded approximation error. We then extend our technique to
   the 10-state subsystem of the fast-recovering calcium-independent
   potassium channel. The basis of our results is the construction of an
   approximate bisimulation between the HH-type abstraction and the
   corresponding detailed ion channel model, both of which are
   input-controlled (voltage in this case) CTMCs.
   The construction of the appropriate approximate bisimulation, as well as
   the overall result regarding the behavior of this modified IMW model,
   involves: (1) Identification of the voltage-dependent parameters of the
   m and h gates in the HH-type models via a two-step fitting process,
   carried out over more than 20,000 representative observational traces of
   the detailed sodium and potassium ion channel models. (2) Proving that
   the distance between observations of the detailed models and their
   respective abstraction is bounded. (3) Exploring the sensitivity of the
   overall IMW model to the HH-type approximations. Our extensive
   simulation results experimentally validate our findings, for varying
   IMW-type input stimuli. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation focused on developing an environmentally benign

   temperature range, with increased temperature stability. The resulting
   catalysts were characterized for catalytic activity, optimal reaction
   temperature, specific surface area, crystalline structure, surface
   composition and the influence of sodium in support raw material. The new
   method generated active catalysts with improved thermal stability linked
   to better dimension control and more Cu2O content, together with
   improved morphology of the supported copper particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large-area freestanding graphene films are facilely fabricated by
   reducing graphene oxide films on recyclable Cu foils in H-2-containing

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{A coarse-grained molecular dynamics model was used to study the thin
   film self-assembly and resulting pattern properties of block copolymer
   (BCP) systems with various molar mass dispersities. Diblock copolymers
   (i.e. A-b-B type) were simulated in an aligned lamellar state, which is
   one of the most common patterns of potential use for integrated circuit
   fabrication via directed self-assembly of BCPs. Effects of the molar
   mass dispersity (D) on feature pitch and interfacial roughness, which
   are critical lithographic parameters that have a direct impact on
   integrated circuit performance, were simulated. It was found that for a
   realistic distribution of polymer molecular weights, modeled by a
   Wesslau distribution, both line edge roughness (LER) and line width
   roughness (LWR) increase approximately linearly with increasing D, up to
   similar to 45\% of the monodisperse value at D = 1.5. Mechanisms of
   compensation for increased A-A and B-B roughness were considered. It was
   found that long and short chain positions were not correlated, and that
   long chains were significantly deformed in shape. The increase in LWR
   was due to the increase in LER and a constant correlation between the
   line edges. Unaligned systems show a correlation between domain width
   and local molecular weight, while systems aligned on an alternating
   pattern of A and B lines did not show any correlation. When the volume
   fraction of individual chains was allowed to vary, similar results were
   found when considering the D of the block as opposed to the D of the
   entire system.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of carbonaceous materials for hybrid semiconductor
   photocatalysts has been rapidly increasing in recent years due to the
   synergetic effect via interfacial charge transfer reactions. In this
   study, we prepared a novel graphdiyne-ZnO nanohybrid by the hydrothermal
   method and examined its photocatalytic properties on the degradation of
   two azo dyes (methylene blue and rhodamine B). Interestingly, the
   graphdiyne-ZnO nanohybrids showed superior photocatalytic properties
   than that of the bare ZnO nanopartides as evidenced by the absorption
   spectra and total organic carbon analyses. Moreover, the rate constant
   of graphdiyne-ZnO nanohybrids is nearly 2-fold higher compared to that
   of the bare ZnO nanoparticles on the photodegradation of both azo dyes.
   Further, a plausible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic
   properties of the graphdiyne-ZnO nanohybrids has been discussed. This
   work on the development of graphdiyne-based semiconductor photocatalysis
   can provide new insights into the design of novel hybrid photocatalysts
   for potential applications in the environmental remediation sectors.}},

   versatile, scalable, and hardware-independent optogenetic inhibition}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Optogenetic techniques provide an unprecedented ability to precisely
   manipulate neural activity in the context of complex neural circuitry.
   Although the toolbox of optogenetic probes continues to expand at a
   rapid pace with more efficient and responsive reagents, hardware-based
   light delivery is still a major hurdle that limits its practical use in
   vivo. We have bypassed the challenges of external light delivery by
   directly coupling a bioluminescent light source (a genetically encoded
   luciferase) to an inhibitory opsin, which we term an inhibitory
   luminopsin (iLMO). iLMO was shown to suppress action potential firing
   and synchronous bursting activity in vitro in response to both external
   light and luciferase substrate. iLMO was further shown to suppress
   single-unit firing rate and local field potentials in the hippocampus of
   anesthetized rats. Finally, expression of iLMO was scaled up to multiple
   structures of the basal ganglia to modulate rotational behavior of
   freely moving animals in a hardware-independent fashion. This novel
   class of optogenetic probes demonstrates how non-invasive inhibition of
   neural activity can be achieved, which adds to the versatility,
   scalability, and practicality of optogenetic applications in freely
   behaving animals.}},

   coupled piezoelectric and semiconducting properties of ZnO, the
   processed Kevlar fibers covered with ZnO NWs are utilized to fabricate a
   2D nanogenerator (2DNG). The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit
   current of the 2DNG are 1.8 mV and 4.8 pA, respectively. Furthermore,
   the 2DNG is successfully employed to quantitatively detect UV intensity
   from 0.2 to 1 mW cm(-2) as a self-powered system.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) represent one of the cleanest and most
   efficient options for the direct conversion of a wide variety of fuels
   to electricity. For example, SOFCs powered by natural gas are ideally
   suited for distributed power generation. However, the commercialization
   of SOFC technologies hinges on breakthroughs in materials development to
   dramatically reduce the cost while enhancing performance and durability.
   One of the critical obstacles to achieving high-performance SOFC systems
   is the cathodes for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which perform
   poorly at low temperatures and degrade over time under operating
   conditions. Here a comprehensive review of the latest advances in the
   development of SOFC cathodes is presented: complex oxides without
   alkaline earth metal elements (because these elements could be
   vulnerable to phase segregation and contaminant poisoning). Various
   strategies are discussed for enhancing ORR activity while minimizing the
   effect of contaminant on electrode durability. Furthermore, some of the
   critical challenges are briefly highlighted and the prospects for
   future-generation SOFC cathodes are discussed. A good understanding of
   the latest advances and remaining challenges in searching for highly
   active SOFC cathodes with robust tolerance to contaminants may provide
   useful guidance for the rational design of new materials and structures
   for commercially viable SOFC technologies.}},

   the two droplets. In addition to the well-known linear inertial growth
   of the liquid bridge at the initial contact of the two drops, we observe
   a new subsequent slower linear expansion of the liquid bridge and
   provide a linear scaling law with a measured prefactor to quantitatively
   represent it. This new growth is found to be due to the transition of
   the capillary force produced by a change in the azimuthal surface

Abstract = {{Optimized microstructure through control of both intra- and
   intermolecular interactions in organic semiconductors is critical for
   enhancing and optimizing charge transport for the realization of
   next-generation low-cost, mechanically flexible, and easy to process
   high performance, organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Herein, we
   report donor acceptor alternating copolymers of dithienogermole (DTG)
   with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) and probe the importance of end groups
   on the control of molecular order and microstructure as it relates to
   the enhancement of charge carrier transport. Partial end-capping
   reactions, confirmed by 11-1 NMR and matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analyses, on the
   DTG-BTD copolymer provided significant improvement in grazing incidence
   wide angle X-Ray scattering (GIWAXS) determined polymer ordering in thin
   films. Consequently, OFETs exhibited charge-carrier mobilities up to
   0.60 cm(2)/(Vs) for the end-capped copolymer, which are an order of
   magnitude higher in comparison to the non-end-capped analogue, which
   displayed a mobility of 0.077 cm(2)/(Vs). We emphasize that a simple
   synthetic approach, the introduction of end-capping groups which remove
   reactive functionalities, can be effective in the development of
   next-generation OFET and solar materials by promising better control of
   the polymer organization.}},

Abstract = {{A graphics processor units(GPU)-based computational framework is
   presented to deal with dynamic failure events simulated by means of
   cohesive zone elements. The work is divided into two parts. In the first
   part, we deal with pre-processing of the information and verify the
   effectiveness of dynamic insertion of cohesive elements in large meshes
   in parallel. To this effect, we employ a novel and simplified
   topological data structure specialized for meshes with triangles,
   designed to run efficiently and minimize memory occupancy on the GPU. In
   the second part, we present a parallel explicit dynamics code that
   implements an extrinsic cohesive zone formulation where the elements are
   inserted on-the-fly', when needed and where needed. The main challenge
   for implementing a GPU-based computational framework using an extrinsic
   cohesive zone formulation resides on being able to dynamically adapt the
   mesh, in a consistent way, by inserting cohesive elements on fractured
   facets. In order to handle that, we extend the conventional data
   structure used in the finite element method (based on element incidence)
   and store, for each element, references to the adjacent elements. This
   additional information suffices to consistently insert cohesive elements
   by duplicating nodes when needed. Currently, our data structure is
   specialized for triangular meshes, but an extension to tetrahedral
   meshes is feasible. The data structure is effective when used in
   conjunction with algorithms to traverse nodes and elements. Results from
   parallel simulations show an increase in performance when adopting
   strategies such as distributing different jobs among threads for the
   same element and launching many threads per element. To avoid
   concurrency on accessing shared entities, we employ graph coloring. In a
   pre-processing phase, each node of the dual graph (bulk elements of the
   mesh as graph nodes) is assigned a color different from the colors
   assigned to adjacent nodes. In that fashion, elements of the same color
   can be processed in parallel without concurrency. All the procedures
   needed for the insertion of cohesive elements along fracture facets and
   for computing nodal properties are performed by threads assigned to
   triangles, invoking one kernel per color. Computations on existing
   cohesive elements are also performed based on adjacent bulk elements.
   Experiments show that GPU speedup increases with the number of nodes and
   bulk elements. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively high open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.047V at 600 degrees C
   was reported recently for a cell based on a
   BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta(BZCYYb)-NiO anode-supported thin SDC
   electrolyte, demonstrating a peak power density of 0.50W/cm(2). In this
   study, an equivalent circuit model was developed for interpreting the
   behavior of this SDC-based SOFC. The mechanism behind the high OCV and
   the corresponding high peak power density were elucidated via separating
   the polarization processes and the corresponding characteristic
   frequencies, especially those for oxygen ion diffusion through the
   interlayer at the anode/electrolyte interface. Theoretical analysis and
   data fitting based on the presented circuit model indicate that the
   inter-diffusion layer between Ni-BZCYYb and SDC effectively suppresses
   electronic conduction while maintaining the catalytic activity and ionic
   conductivity. More importantly, careful analysis of the characteristic
   frequencies offers a powerful approach to assigning a specific part of
   the impedance data (e.g., an impedance arc or loop) to the corresponding
   physicochemical process. Further, any sharp change in the characteristic
   frequency for a physicochemical process also reflects a change in the
   inherent nature of that process under the testing conditions. Once
   validated by more experimental results under a broader range of testing
   conditions, the presented equivalent circuit model, in turn, may be used
   to predict fuel cell performances and optimize the operating conditions.

Abstract = {{Four chiral poly Schiff bases were synthesized via polycondensation
   between l-lysine and p-benzoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, dibenzoyl, and
   2,3-butanedione, respectively. Subsequently, the silver coordination
   polymers of the chiral poly Schiff base were prepared upon silver ions
   coordinating with the chiral poly Schiff bases. The structures of the
   polymers were characterized with IR, UV-vis, GPC, elemental analysis,
   and optical activity analysis. The properties of polymers were studied
   through conductivity testing and electromagnetic parameter testing. The
   results show that they own good electrical conductvities, and the
   electrical conductivity of chiral poly-(l-lysine(2,3-butanedione))
   Schiff base silver complex can reach 3.7 x 10(2) S/cm. The
   electromagnetic wave absorption properties of four silver complexes were
   calculated using transmission line theory, the maximum reflection loss
   of chiral poly-(l-lysine(p-benzoquinone)) Schiff base silver complex can
   reach -45.9 dB at a thickness of 5 mm, while that of achiral
   poly-(dl-lysine(p-benzoquinone)) Schiff base silver complex is -20.1 dB
   at a thickness of 5 mm. The enhanced microwave absorbing properties were
   attributed to the chiral feature. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Abstract = {{Although it is possible to produce the same movement using an infinite
   number of different muscle activation patterns owing to musculoskeletal
   redundancy, the degree to which observed variations in muscle activity
   can deviate from optimal solutions computed from biomechanical models is
   not known. Here, we examined the range of biomechanically permitted
   activation levels in individual muscles during human walking using a
   detailed musculoskeletal model and experimentally-measured kinetics and
   kinematics. Feasible muscle activation ranges define the minimum and
   maximum possible level of each muscle's activation that satisfy inverse
   dynamics joint torques assuming that all other muscles can vary their
   activation as needed. During walking, 73\% of the muscles had feasible
   muscle activation ranges that were greater than 95\% of the total muscle
   activation range over more than 95\% of the gait cycle, indicating that,
   individually, most muscles could be fully active or fully inactive while
   still satisfying inverse dynamics joint torques. Moreover, the shapes of
   the feasible muscle activation ranges did not resemble
   previously-reported muscle activation patterns nor optimal solutions,
   i.e. static optimization and computed muscle control, that are based on
   the same biomechanical constraints. Our results demonstrate that joint
   torque requirements from standard inverse dynamics calculations are
   insufficient to define the activation of individual muscles during
   walking in healthy individuals. Identifying feasible muscle activation
   ranges may be an effective way to evaluate the impact of additional
   biomechanical and/or neural constraints on possible versus actual muscle
   activity in both normal and impaired movements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{48}},

Pages = {{3026-3034}},

Abstract = {{Transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) intervention is now the
   standard-of-care treatment for inoperable patients and a viable
   alternative treatment option for high-risk patients with symptomatic
   aortic stenosis. While the procedure is associated with lower operative
   risk and shorter recovery times than traditional surgical aortic valve
   (SAV) replacement, TAV intervention is still not considered for
   lower-risk patients due in part to concerns about device durability. It
   is well known that bioprosthetic SAVs have limited durability, and TAVs
   are generally assumed to have even worse durability, yet there is little
   long-term data to confirm this suspicion. In this study, TAV and SAV
   leaflet fatigue due to cyclic loading was investigated through finite
   element analysis by implementing a computational soft tissue fatigue
   damage model to describe the behavior of the pericardial leaflets. Under
   identical loading conditions and with identical leaflet tissue
   properties, the TAV leaflets sustained higher stresses, strains, and
   fatigue damage compared to the SAV leaflets. The simulation results
   suggest that the durability of TAVs may be significantly reduced
   compared to SAVs to about 7.8 years. The developed computational
   framework may be useful in optimizing TAV design parameters to improve
   leaflet durability, and assessing the effects of underexpanded,
   elliptical, or non-uniformly expanded stent deployment on TAV
   durability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Computational inference of the structure and regulation of the lignin
   pathway in Panicum virgatum}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Switchgrass is a prime target for biofuel production from
   inedible plant parts and has been the subject of numerous investigations
   in recent years. Yet, one of the main obstacles to effective biofuel
   production remains to be the major problem of recalcitrance.
   Recalcitrance emerges in part from the 3-D structure of lignin as a
   polymer in the secondary cell wall. Lignin limits accessibility of the
   sugars in the cellulose and hemicellulose polymers to enzymes and
   ultimately decreases ethanol yield. Monolignols, the building blocks of
   lignin polymers, are synthesized in the cytosol and translocated to the
   plant cell wall, where they undergo polymerization. The biosynthetic
   pathway leading to monolignols in switchgrass is not completely known,
   and difficulties associated with in vivo measurements of these
   intermediates pose a challenge for a true understanding of the
   functioning of the pathway.
   Results: In this study, a systems biological modeling approach is used
   to address this challenge and to elucidate the structure and regulation
   of the lignin pathway through a computational characterization of
   alternate candidate topologies. The analysis is based on experimental
   data characterizing stem and tiller tissue of four transgenic lines
   (knockdowns of genes coding for key enzymes in the pathway) as well as
   wild-type switchgrass plants. These data consist of the observed content
   and composition of monolignols. The possibility of a G-lignin specific
   metabolic channel associated with the production and degradation of
   coniferaldehyde is examined, and the results support previous findings
   from another plant species. The computational analysis suggests
   regulatory mechanisms of product inhibition and enzyme competition,
   which are well known in biochemistry, but so far had not been reported
   in switchgrass. By including these mechanisms, the pathway model is able
   to represent all observations.
   Conclusions: The results show that the presence of the coniferaldehyde
   channel is necessary and that product inhibition and competition over
   cinnamoyl-CoA-reductase (CCR1) are essential for matching the model to
   observed increases in H-lignin levels in 4-coumarate:CoA-ligase (4CL)
   knockdowns. Moreover, competition for 4-coumarate: CoA-ligase (4CL) is
   essential for matching the model to observed increases in the pathway
   metabolites in caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) knockdowns. As
   far as possible, the model was validated with independent data.}},

Title = {{Analyzing radio interferometric positioning systems with undersampling
   receivers}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Radio interferometric positioning systems are developed for localization
   in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and they have the potential to yield
   highly accurate location information at low computational cost and
   implementation complexity. In the radio interferometric positioning
   system (RIPS), two transmitters transmit sinusoidal signals at slightly
   different frequencies, and two receivers pass the received signals
   through square-law devices to produce low-frequency differential
   signals. However, a squaring operation increases the noise power,
   leading to performance loss. To avoid this problem, a receiver for the
   RIPS using undersampling techniques (RIPS-u) has been proposed. In this
   paper, we investigate the performance of the RIPS with a square-law
   device (RIPS-sq) and the performance of the RIPS-u through theoretical
   and experimental analyses. Specifically, we compute Cramer-Rao lower
   bounds (CRLBs) of the range and location estimates in both systems and
   show that the RIPS-u has lower CRLBs than the RIPS-sq. Furthermore, we
   have carried out experimental tests by implementing both systems on
   National Instruments (NI) Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs).
   From both the theoretical and experimental results, the effectiveness of
   the RIPS-u over the RIPS-sq is confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Tribotronics is a new field about the devices fabricated using the
   electrostatic potential created by contact electrification as a
   ``gate{''} voltage to tune/control charge carrier transport in
   semiconductors. In this paper, an organic tribotronic transistor is
   proposed by coupling an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) and a
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) in vertical contact-separation mode.
   Instead of using the traditional gate voltage for controlling, the
   charge carrier transportation in the OTFT can be modulated by the
   contact-induced electrostatic potential of the TENG. By further coupling
   with an organic light-emitting diode, a contact-electrification-gated
   light-emitting diode (CG-LED) is fabricated, in which the operating
   current and light-emission intensity can be tuned/controlled by an
   external force-induced contact electrification. Two different modes of
   the CG-LED have been demonstrated and the brightness can be decreased
   and increased by the applied physical contact, respectively. Different
   from the conventional organic light-emitting transistor controlled by an
   electrical signal, the CG-LED has realized the direct interaction
   between the external environment/stimuli and the electroluminescence
   device. By introducing optoelectronics into tribotronics, the CG-LED has
   open up a new field of tribophototronics with many potential
   applications in interactive display, mechanical imaging,
   micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems, and flexible/touch
   optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Excellent triboelectric and mechanical properties are achieved on the
   same material for the first time by developing an effective, general,
   straightforward, and area-scalable approach to surface modification of a
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film via inductive-coupled plasma
   etching. The modification enables gigantic enhancement of triboelectric
   charge density on the PET surface. Based on the modified PET as a
   contact material, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) exhibits
   significantly promoted electric output compared to the one without the
   modification. The obtained electric output is even superior to a TENG
   made of conventional polytetrafluoroethylene that is known for its
   strongest ability of being charged by triboelectrification among all
   engineering plastics. Detailed characterizations reveal that the
   enhancement of triboelectric charge density on the PET is attributed to
   both chemical modification of fluorination and physical modification of
   roughened morphology in nanoscale. Therefore, this work proposes a new
   route to obtaining high-performance TENGs by manipulating and modifying
   surface properties of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and mesoporous silica are
   effective, reversible adsorbents for CO2, both from flue gas and in
   direct air-capture applications. The morphology of the PEI within the
   silica can strongly impact the overall carbon capture efficiency and
   rate of saturation. Here, we directly probe the spatial distribution of
   the supported polymer through small-angle neutron scattering (SANS).
   Combined with textural characterization from physisorption analysis, the
   data indicate that PEI first forms a thin conformal coating on the pore
   walls, but all additional polymer aggregates into plug(s) that grow
   along the pore axis. This model is consistent with observed trends in
   amine-efficiency (CO2/N binding ratio) and pore size distributions, and
   points to a trade-off between achieving high chemical accessibility of
   the amine binding sites, which are inaccessible when they strongly
   interact with the silica, and high accessibility for mass transport,
   which can be hampered by diffusion through PEI plugs. We illustrate this
   design principle by demonstrating higher CO2 capacity and uptake rate
   for PEI supported in a hydrophobically modified silica, which exhibits
   repulsive interactions with the PEI, freeing up binding sites.}},

   Nanocrystals in Direct and Permanent Contact with Ferroelectric Polymers}},

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic nanocomposites composed of polymers and nanoparticles
   offer a vast design space of potential material properties, depending
   heavily on the properties of these two constituents and their spatial
   arrangement. The ability to place polymers in direct contact with
   functional nanoparticles via strong bonding, that is, stable chemical
   interaction without the dissociation of surface capping polymers,
   provides a means of preventing nanopartides from aggregation and
   increasing their dispersibility in nanocomposites, and promises
   opportunities to explore new properties and construction of miniaturized
   devices. However, this is still a challenging issue and has not yet been
   largely explored. Here, we report an unconventional strategy to create
   in situ organic inorganic nanocomposites comprising monodisperse
   ferroelectric nanopartides directly and permanently tethered with
   ferroelectric polymers by capitalizing on rationally designed
   amphiphilic star-like diblock copolymer as nanoreactors. The diameter of
   ferroelectric nanopartides and the chain length of ferroelectric
   polymers can be precisely tuned. The dielectric and ferroelectric
   properties of nanocomposites containing different sizes of ferroelectric
   nanopartides were scrutinized. Such bottom-up crafting of intimate
   organic inorganic nanocomposites offers new levels of tailorability to
   nanostructured materials and promises new opportunities for achieving
   exquisite control over the surface chemistry and properties of
   nanocomposites with engineered functionality for diverse applications in
   energy conversion and storage, catalysis, electronics, nanotechnology,
   and biotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium oxide (ZrO2)-carbon nanofibers (ZCN) were fabricated and batch
   experiments were used to determine antimonite (Sb(III)) and antimonate
   (Sb(V)) adsorption isotherms and kinetics. ZCN have a maximum Sb(III)
   and Sb(V) adsorption capacity of 70.83 and 57.17 mg/g, respectively. The
   adsorption process between ZCN and Sb was identified to be an exothermic
   and follows an ion-exchange reaction. The application of ZCN was
   demonstrated using tap water spiked with Sb (200 mu g/L). We found that
   the concentration of Sb was well below the maximum contaminant level for
   drinking water with ZCN dosages of 2 g/L. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that an ionic bond of Zr-O was formed with
   Sb(III) and Sb(V). Based on the density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations, Sb(III) formed Sb-O and O-Zr bonds on the surface of the
   tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) (111) plane and monoclinic ZrO2 planes (m-ZrO2)
   (111) plane when it adsorbs. Only an O-Zr bond was formed on the surface
   of t-ZrO2 (111) plane and m-ZrO2, (111) plane for Sb(V) adsorption. The

Title = {{Assessment of alternative fuel and powertrain transit bus options using
   real-world operations data: Life-cycle fuel and emissions modeling}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{143-159}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid and electric powertrains and alternative fuels (e.g., compressed
   natural gas (CNG), biodiesel, or hydrogen) can often reduce energy
   consumption and emissions from transit bus operations relative to
   conventional diesel. However, the magnitude of these energy and
   emissions savings can vary significantly, due to local conditions and
   transit operating characteristics. This paper introduces the transit
   Fuel and Emissions Calculator (FEC), a mode-based life-cycle emissions
   modeling tool for transit bus and rail technologies that compares the
   performance of multiple alternative fuels and powertrains across a range
   of operational characteristics and conditions. The purpose of the FEC is
   to provide a practical, yet technically sophisticated tool for
   regulatory agencies and policy analysts in assessing transit fleet
   options. The FEC's modal modeling approach estimates emissions as a
   function of engine load, which in turn is a function of transit service
   parameters, including duty cycle (idling and speed-acceleration
   profile), road grade, and passenger loading. This approach allows for
   customized assessments that account for local conditions. Direct
   emissions estimates are derived from the scaled tractive power (STP)
   operating mode bins and emissions factors employed in the U.S. EPA's
   MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) model. Life-cycle emissions
   estimates are calculated using emissions factors from the GREET
   (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in
   Transportation) model. The case study presented in this paper applies
   the FEC to second-by-second GPS position data collected from buses
   operating in metropolitan Atlanta, GA. These operations, from two
   different transit agencies, feature distinctly different transit service
   types: local transit bus operations and longer-distance express bus
   operations. The results illustrate that the decision as to which bus
   technology-fuel combination produces the least greenhouse gas emissions
   is a function of location and route characteristics. For the express bus
   operations monitored, the case study shows that CNG vehicles offer
   greater emissions reductions than Biodiesel (B20). For local bus
   services, battery electric buses show the greatest emissions savings in
   the fuel cycle, as long as range limitations can be met for the specific
   routes. The amount of these emissions savings is, however, highly
   dependent on the power generation mix. Among CNG, B20, parallel hybrid,
   series hybrid, and fuel cell buses, the least emitting option varies by
   location, due to complex interactions of factors such as duty cycle,
   meteorology, and terrain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the quickest change detection problem is studied in
   two-state hidden Markov models (HMM), where the vector parameter of the
   HMM changes from to at some unknown time, and one wants to detect the
   true change as quickly as possible while controlling the false alarm
   rate. It turns out that the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) scheme,
   while theoretically straightforward, is generally computationally
   infeasible for the HMM. To develop efficient but computationally simple
   schemes for the HMM, we first discuss a subtlety in the recursive form
   of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) scheme for the HMM. Then we
   show that the recursive CUSUM scheme proposed in Fuh (Ann. Statist.,
   2003) can be regarded as a quasi-GLR scheme for pseudo post-change
   hypotheses with certain dependence structure between pre- and postchange
   observations. Next, we extend the quasi-GLR idea to propose recursive
   score schemes in the scenario when the postchange parameter of the HMM
   involves a real-valued nuisance parameter. Finally, the Kullback-Leibler
   (KL) divergence plays an essential role in the quickest change detection
   problem and many other fields, however it is rather challenging to
   numerically compute it in HMMs. Here we develop a non-Monte Carlo method
   that computes the KL divergence of two-state HMMs via the underlying
   invariant probability measure, which is characterized by the Fredholm
   integral equation. Numerical study demonstrates an unusual property of
   the KL divergence for HMM that implies the severe effects of
   misspecifying the postchange parameter for the HMM.}},

   compared with a critical stored elastic energy value for damage to
   determine if a ply would fracture after the increment. If fracture is
   predicted, variational analysis is used to determine the perturbation in

Abstract = {{Glass fiber-reinforced composite laminates in polyetherimide resin have
   been studied via terahertz imaging and ultrasonic C-scans. The forced
   delamination is created by inserting Teflon film between various layers
   inside the samples prior to consolidating the laminates. Using
   reflective pulsed terahertz imaging, we find high-resolution,
   low-artifact terahertz C-scan and B-scan images locating and sizing the
   delamination in three dimensions. Furthermore, terahertz imaging enables
   us to determine the thicknesses of the delamination and of the layers
   constituting the laminate. Ultrasonic C-scan images are also
   successfully obtained; however, in our samples with small
   thickness-to-wavelength ratio, detailed ultrasonic B-scan images
   providing quantitative information in depth cannot be obtained by 5 MHz
   or 10 MHz focused transducers. Comparative analysis between terahertz
   imaging and ultrasonic C-scans with regard to spatial resolution is
   carried out demonstrating that terahertz imaging provides higher spatial
   resolution for imaging, and can be regarded as an alternative or
   complementary modality to ultrasonic C-scans for this class of glass

Abstract = {{This paper examined the carbon market literature from 1992 to 2011 using
   bibliometric techniques based on the database of Science Citation Index
   (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). Of 5809 publications,
   82\% were journal articles. Our analysis documents that carbon market
   publications are expanding rapidly. Based on the contribution of
   countries and their h-index, the US has published most and been most
   influential in this area, followed by the UK, Canada, Germany and China.
   The Chinese Academy of Sciences (120), US Forestry Service (70) and
   University of Maryland (68) were the most productive research
   institutes. The most common subject category, Environment Sciences
   (1551), experienced an exponential increase with an average growth rate
   of about 50\%, and the most productive journal was Energy Policy (469).
   According to the analysis of keywords, the hotspots related to carbon
   markets were ``global warming{''} and ``carbon tax{''} in the 1990's,
   but ``climate change{''} and the ``clean development mechanism{''}
   superceded them in the most recent decade. The most cited article
   published in Science in carbon market research is presented. This
   analysis is not only helpful for policymakers and others to understand
   trends in the field, but may also influence researchers selection of

Abstract = {{Land in the southeastern U.S. is expected to change, e.g., given the
   potential demand to develop forest-to-fuel technologies or, conversely,
   cropification of current forests to increase food production. Possible
   future PM2.5 and O-3 air quality for two land use/land cover change
   (LULCC) scenarios, reforestation and cropland conversion, are compared
   to a reference case scenario for the year 2050 using the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multi-scale Air Quality
   (CMAQ) models. Changes in air quality driven by changes in climate,
   deposition and emissions relating to the LULCC are investigated.
   Reforestation in the Southeast tends to decrease the ambient O-3 mixing
   ratio while slightly increasing summertime PM2.5 in the Southeastern
   U.S. Results of a climate and deposition (CD) sensitivity simulation are
   provided for the two alternative LULCC scenarios to isolate the impact
   of changing climate and deposition on PM2.5 and O-3 air quality. The
   sensitivity results indicate that deposition and emissions changes
   associated with reforestation impact O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations as
   much as, and in most cases more than, changes in meteorology. Conversion
   of forest to cropland in the Southeast, on the other hand, tends to
   increase O-3 and increase PM2.5 year-round. Cropland conversion leads to
   increased NOx emissions and increases in the 4th highest maximum daily
   8-h O-3 (MDA8) of the year by up to 10 ppb despite the tendency for
   increased deposition and decreased temperature to reduce the MDA8 mixing
   ratio. The results of this study show that O-3 and aerosol
   concentrations are sensitive to reforestation and cropland conversion in
   the Southeast and these land use changes should be considered in air
   quality management plans. Further, they show the sensitivity of such
   calculations to land cover properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at the compressive
   properties of three-dimensional (3D) braided composites subjected to
   quasi-static and high strain rate loadings using finite element method
   from fiber/matrix scale to composite scale. It focuses on a
   computationally efficient multi-scale methodology for prediction of the
   effective elastic properties and the failure strength of 3D braided
   composites. First, finite element models with strain rate sensitive
   elasto-plastic constitutive relationship and ductile and shear failure
   criterion were established to investigate the mechanical properties and
   failure mechanism. Second, the failure mechanism in micro-scale
   fiber/matrix was investigated. The mechanical properties of the interior
   unit cell, surface unit cell and corner unit cell were predicted and
   compared, which shows that the surface and corner region of braided
   preform play an important role during both quasi-static and high strain
   rate loading. The results obtained from the whole structure
   heterogeneous composite model and the homogeneous composite model were
   also analyzed and compared. Finally, the numerical results were verified
   by the experimental data and the results are encouraging. This method
   can provide an important guidance for evaluating the mechanical
   properties and selecting structural parameters for braided composites.

Abstract = {{GaN, with its wide bandgap of 3.4 eV, has emerged as an efficient
   material for designing high-efficiency betavoltaic batteries. An

Abstract = {{Using first principle calculations, we uncover the underlying mechanisms
   explaining the brittle-to-ductile transition of LixSi electrodes in
   lithium ion batteries with increasing Li content. We show that
   plasticity initiates at x = similar to 0.5 with the formation of a
   craze-like network of nanopores separated by Si-Si bonds, while
   subsequent failure is still brittle-like with the breaking of Si-Si
   bonds. Transition to ductile behavior occurs at x >= 1 due to the
   increased density of highly stretchable Li-Li bonds, which delays
   nanopore formation and stabilizes nanopore growth. Collapse of the
   nanopores during unloading of the LixSi alloys leads to significant

Abstract = {{The influence of planar organic linkers on thermal boundary conductance
   across hybrid interfaces has focused on the organic/inorganic
   interaction energy rather than on vibrational mechanisms in the
   molecule. As a result, research into interfacial transport at planar
   organic monolayer junctions has treated molecular systems as thermally
   ballistic. We show that thermal conductance in phosphonic acid (PA)
   molecules is ballistic, and the thermal boundary conductance across
   metal/PA/sapphire interfaces is driven by the same phononic processes as
   those across metal/sapphire interfaces without PAs, with one exception.
   We find a more than 40\% reduction in conductance across
   henicosafluorododecyl-phosphonic acid (F21PA) interfaces, independent of
   metal contact, despite similarities in structure, composition, and
   terminal group to the variety of other PAs studied. Our results suggest
   diffusive scattering of thermal vibrations in F21PA, demonstrating a
   clear path toward modification of interfacial thermal transport based on
   knowledge of ballistic and diffusive scattering in single monolayer
   molecular interfacial films.}},

Abstract = {{Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) sub-microspheres @ reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
   nanosheets core-shell composites with 3D architecture are successfully
   fabricated by a one-step method through co-reduction of irregular cupric
   citrate and graphene oxide nanosheets at room temperature. Comparing to
   the bare Cu2O sub-microspheres and the simple physical mixture of Cu2O
   and rGO (Cu2O-rGO-M), the Cu2O@rGO electrodes demonstrate dramatically
   improved capacity, cyclic stability and rate capability as anode
   materials for lithium ion batteries. At a low current density of 100
   mA.g(-1), Cu2O@rGO electrodes deliver a discharge capacity of 534
   mAh.g(-1) after 50 cycles, retaining 94\% of the initial capacity. Under
   a higher current density of 1000 mA.g(-1), Cu2O@rGO electrodes exhibit a
   discharge capacity of 181 mAh.g(-1) after 200 cycles, approximately 4
   times larger than that of bare Cu2O sub-microsphere electrodes. The rate
   capacity retention of Cu2O@rGO electrode is 74\% at 200 mA.g(-1) and
   38\% at 1000 mA.g(-1) relative to 100 mA.g(-1), much better than that
   for Cu2O-rGO-M (52\% and 34\%) and bare Cu2O electrodes (13\% and 3\%,).
   The enhanced electrochemical performance for Cu2O@rGO might be ascribed
   to the rGO coating and 3D architecture. The outer coated rGO nanosheets
   could provide additional 3D conductive networks as well as serve as the
   buffer layers for accommodating the large volume change of the inner
   Cu2O submicrospheres during the charge-discharge cycling. (C) 2015

   personalized, predictive metric to score metastatic risk}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{Patient-to-patient variability in breast cancer progression complicates
   clinical treatment decisions. Of women undergoing prophylactic
   mastectomies, many may not have progressed to indolent forms of disease
   and could have benefited from milder, localized therapy. Tumor
   associated macrophages contribute significantly to tumor invasion and
   metastasis, with cysteine cathepsin proteases as important contributors.
   Here, a method is demonstrated by which variability in macrophage
   expression of cysteine cathepsins, their inhibitor cystatin C, and
   kinase activation can be used to train a multivariate model and score
   patients for invasion risk. These enzymatic profiles were used to
   predict macrophage-assisted MCF-7 breast cancer cell invasion in the
   trained computational model. To test these predictions, a priori,
   signals from monocytes isolated from women undergoing mastectomies were
   input to score their cancer invasion potential in a patient-specific
   manner, and successfully predicted that patient monocytes with highest
   predicted invasion indices matched those with more invasive initial
   diagnoses of the nine patients tested. Together this establishes
   proof-of-principle that personalized information acquired from minimally
   invasive blood draws may provide useful information to inform
   oncologists and patients of invasive/metastatic risk, helping to make
   decisions regarding radical mastectomy or milder, conservative
   treatments to save patients from hardship and surgical recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Skin has gained substantial attention as a vaccine target organ due to
   its immunological properties, which include a high density of
   professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). Previous studies have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of this vaccination route not only in
   animal models but also in adults. Young children represent a population
   group that is at high risk from influenza infection. As a result, this
   group could benefit significantly from influenza vaccine delivery
   approaches through the skin and the improved immune response it can
   induce. In this study, we compared the immune responses in young BALB/c
   mice upon skin delivery of influenza vaccine with vaccination by the
   conventional intramuscular route. Young mice that received 5 mu g of
   H1N1 A/Ca/07/09 influenza subunit vaccine using MN demonstrated an
   improved serum antibody response (IgG1 and IgG2a) when compared to the
   young IM group, accompanied by higher numbers of influenza-specific
   antibody secreting cells (ASCs) in the bone marrow. In addition, we
   observed increased activation of follicular helper T cells and formation
   of germinal centers in the regional lymph nodes in the MN immunized
   group, rapid clearance of the virus from their lungs as well as complete
   survival, compared with partial protection observed in the IM-vaccinated
   group. Our results support the hypothesis that influenza vaccine
   delivery through the skin would be beneficial for protecting the
   high-risk young population from influenza infection. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{The phased replacement of oral polio vaccine (OPV) with inactivated
   polio vaccine (IPV) is expected to significantly complicate mass
   vaccination campaigns, which are an important component of the global
   polio eradication endgame strategy. To simplify mass vaccination with
   IPV, we developed microneedle patches that are easy to administer, have
   a small package size, generate no sharps waste and are inexpensive to
   manufacture. When administered to rhesus macaques, neutralizing antibody
   titers were equivalent among monkeys vaccinated using microneedle
   patches and conventional intramuscular injection for IPV types 1 and 2.
   Serologic response to IPV type 3 vaccination was weaker after
   microneedle patch vaccination compared to intramuscular injection;
   however, we suspect the administered type 3 dose was lower due to a
   flawed pre-production IPV type 3 analytical method. IPV vaccination
   using microneedle patches was well tolerated by the monkeys. We conclude
   that IPV vaccination using a microneedle patch is immunogenic in rhesus
   macaques and may offer a simpler method of IPV vaccination of people to
   facilitate polio eradication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Very high vaccination coverage is required to eliminate measles, but
   achieving high coverage can be constrained by the logistical challenges
   associated with subcutaneous injection. To simplify the logistics of
   vaccine delivery, a patch containing micron-scale polymeric needles was
   formulated to encapsulate the standard dose of measles vaccine (1000
   TCID50) and the immunogenicity of the microneedle patch was compared
   with subcutaneous injection in rhesus macaques. The microneedle patch
   was administered without reconstitution with diluent, dissolved in skin
   within 10 min, and caused only mild, transient skin erythema. Both
   groups of rhesus macaques generated neutralizing antibody responses to
   measles that were consistent with protection and the neutralizing
   antibody titers were equivalent. In addition, the microneedle patches
   maintained an acceptable level of potency after storage at elevated
   temperature suggesting improved thermostability compared to standard
   lyophilized vaccine. In conclusion, a measles microneedle patch vaccine
   was immunogenic in non-human primates, and this approach offers a
   promising delivery method that could help increase vaccination coverage.

Title = {{An economic model assessing the value of microneedle patch delivery of
   the seasonal influenza vaccine}},
Journal = {{VACCINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{37, SI}},
Pages = {{4727-4736}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: New vaccine technologies may improve the acceptability,
   delivery (potentially enabling self-administration), and product
   efficacy of influenza vaccines. One such technology is the microneedle
   patch (MNP), a skin delivery technology currently in development.
   Although MNPs hold promise in preclinical studies, their potential
   economic and epidemiologic impacts have not yet been evaluated.
   Methods: We utilized a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)
   transmission model linked to an economic influenza outcomes model to
   assess the economic value of introducing the MNP into the current
   influenza vaccine market in the United States from the third-party payer
   and societal perspectives. We also explored the impact of different
   vaccination settings, self-administration, the MNP price, vaccine
   efficacy, compliance, and MNP market share. Outcomes included costs,
   quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cases, and incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; cost/QALY).
   Results: With healthcare provider administration, MNP introduction would
   be cost-effective (ICERs <=\$23,347/QALY) at all MNP price points
   (\$9.50-\$30) and market shares (10-60\%) assessed, except when
   compliance and efficacy were assumed to be the same as existing vaccines
   and the MNP occupied a 10\% market share. If MNP self-administration
   were available (assuming the same efficacy as current technologies), MNP
   compliance or its efficacy would need to increase by >3\% in order to be
   cost-effective (ICERs <\$1401/QALY), assuming a 2\% reduction in
   administration success with unsupervised self-administration. Under
   these conditions, MNP introduction would be cost-effective for all price
   points and market shares assessed.
   Conclusions: When healthcare providers administered the MNP, its
   introduction would be cost-effective or dominant (i.e., less costly and
   more effective) in the majority of scenarios assessed. If
   self-administration were available, MNP introduction would be
   cost-effective if it increased compliance enough to overcome any
   decrease in self-administration success or if the MNP presentation
   afforded an increase in efficacy over current delivery methods for
   influenza vaccines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   magnetite, Fe3O4 (111), a major iron oxide that also has a number of
   applications in electronics and spintronics. We compare the
   thermodynamic stability and electronic structure among the different
   surfaces terminations. Interestingly, we find that surfaces modified
   with point defects and adatoms are close in surface energy and that they
   can be more stable than bulk-like terminations in the oxygen-rich and
   -poor regimes. These surfaces show different surface chemistry and
   electronic structures as well as distinctive spin polarization features
   near the Fermi level with regard to those previously considered in the
   literature. Our studies provide an atomic level insight for magnetite
   surfaces, which is a necessary step to understanding their interfaces

Title = {{Sequential Self-Folding Structures by 3D Printed Digital Shape Memory
   Polymers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Folding is ubiquitous in nature with examples ranging from the formation
   of cellular components to winged insects. It finds technological
   applications including packaging of solar cells and space structures,
   deployable biomedical devices, and self-assembling robots and airbags.
   Here we demonstrate sequential self-folding structures realized by
   thermal activation of spatially-variable patterns that are 3D printed
   with digital shape memory polymers, which are digital materials with
   different shape memory behaviors. The time-dependent behavior of each
   polymer allows the temporal sequencing of activation when the structure
   is subjected to a uniform temperature. This is demonstrated via a series
   of 3D printed structures that respond rapidly to a thermal stimulus, and
   self-fold to specified shapes in controlled shape changing sequences.
   Measurements of the spatial and temporal nature of self-folding
   structures are in good agreement with the companion finite element
   simulations. A simplified reduced-order model is also developed to
   rapidly and accurately describe the self-folding physics. An important
   aspect of self-folding is the management of self-collisions, where
   different portions of the folding structure contact and then block
   further folding. A metric is developed to predict collisions and is used
   together with the reduced-order model to design self-folding structures
   that lock themselves into stable desired configurations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple radio-over-fiber (RoF) link architecture for
   millimeter-wave orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   transmission using only one Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and precoding
   technique. In the transmission system, the amplitudes and the phase of
   the driving radio-frequency (RF) OFDM signal on each sub-carrier are
   precoded, to ensure that the OFDM signal after photodetector (PD) can be
   restored to original OFDM signal. The experimental results show that the
   bit-error ratios (BERs) of the transmission system are less than the
   forward-error-correction (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3), which
   demonstrates that the generation of OFDM vector signal based on our
   proposed scheme can be employed in our system architecture. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The effects of heteroatom substitution on the cooperative catalytic
   activity of a series of bifunctional acid-base aminosilica catalysts are
   probed in aldol and nitroaldol condensations. Three M3+ (B, Al, and Ga)
   and three M4+ (Ti, Zr, and Ce) heteroatoms are incorporated into
   different samples of SBA-15 silica and then grafted with aminosilanes to
   produce bifunctional acid-base catalysts. The catalytic activity of each
   material is measured in the aldol condensation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
   with acetone at 50 degrees C and the nitroaldol condensation of
   4-nitrobenzaldehyde with nitromethane at 40 degrees C and compared to
   the catalytic activity of a heteroatom-free aminosilica catalyst. The
   heteroatom substitutions produce catalysts with larger amounts of strong
   Lewis acid sites compared to the heteroatom-free aminosilica catalyst.
   We rationalize these results in the context of the physical (e.g.
   surface area, pore diameter, particle size) and chemical properties
   (e.g. total number and strength of acid sites) of each material and the
   proposed catalytic mechanisms of the two reactions. The increase in the
   number of strong Lewis acid sites of each heteroatom material decreased
   its activity in the aldol condensation, though four heteroatom
   substitutions (B, Al, Ga, and Ti) increased the catalytic activity of
   the aminosilica catalyst in the nitroaldol condensation. The results
   suggest that inclusion of a small amount of Lewis acid sites in
   aminosilica materials can increase the cooperative catalytic activity of
   the materials in the nitroaldol condensation. The results also suggest
   that inclusion of Lewis acid sites in aminosilica materials decreases
   the cooperative catalytic activity of the materials in the aldol
   condensation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Driven by Triboelectric Generator}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Self-powered system that is interface-free is greatly desired for
   area-scalable application. Here we report a self-powered
   electroluminescent system that consists of a triboelectric generator
   (TEG) and a thin-film electroluminescent (TFEL) lamp. The TEG provides
   high-voltage alternating electric output, which fits in well with the
   needs of the TFEL lamp. Induced charges pumped onto the lamp by the TEG
   generate an electric field that is sufficient to excite luminescence
   without an electrical interface circuit. Through rational serial
   connection of multiple TFEL lamps, effective and area-scalable
   luminescence is realized. It is demonstrated that multiple types of TEGs
   are applicable to the self-powered system, indicating that the system
   can make use of diverse mechanical sources and thus has potentially
   broad applications in illumination, display, entertainment, indication,
   surveillance and many others.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are nanoporous materials whose
   crystalline character has made them attractive targets for synthesis of
   new materials and potential use in a diverse set of applications. The
   vast majority of studies of MOFs envision these materials as having
   ideal crystal structures. This Perspective gives an overview of the
   current understanding of defects in MOFs. Compared to related materials
   such as zeolites, the ability to detect and control defects in MOFs is
   nascent. Nevertheless, it is likely that defects will play a vital role
   in a number of contexts where MOFs are of widespread interest, so
   advancing our understanding of these structural features will be
   important in coming years. Potential origins of point defects, plane
   defects, and surface defects are discussed. The difficulty of defect
   detection in metal organic frameworks is discussed and useful paths for
   future work are provided.}},

Abstract = {{A simple ice-templated self-assembly process is used to prepare a

   current density of 0.5 A g(-1), compared with similar to 247 F g(-1) of
   simple 3D VOPO4, with solid cycling stability. The enhanced
   pseudocapacitive behavior mainly originates from vertically porous
   structures from directionally grown ice crystals and simultaneously
   inducing radial segregation and forming inter-stacked structures of
   VOPO4-graphene nanosheets. This VOPO4-graphene nanocomposite electrode
   exhibits high surface area, vertically porous structure to the
   separator, structural stability from interstacked structure and high
   electrical conductivity, which would provide the short diffusion paths
   of electrolyte ions and fast transportation of charges within the

Abstract = {{A novel self-powered acceleration sensor based on triboelectric
   nanogenerator is proposed, which consists of an outer transparent shell
   and an inner mass-spring-damper mechanical system. The PTFE films on the
   mass surfaces can slide between two aluminum electrodes on an inner wall
   owing to the acceleration in the axis direction. On the basis of the
   coupling of triboelectric and electrostatic effects, the potential
   difference between the two aluminum electrodes is generated in
   proportion to the mass displacement, which can be used to characterize
   the acceleration in the axis direction with a detection range from about
   13.0 to 40.0 m/s(2) at a sensitivity of 0.289 Vs(2)/m. With the
   integration of acceleration sensors in three axes, a self-powered 3D
   acceleration sensor is developed for vector acceleration measurement in
   any direction. The self-powered 3D acceleration sensor has excellent
   performance in the stability test, and the output voltages have a little
   decrease of similar to 6\% after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the self-powered
   acceleration sensor can be used to measure high collision acceleration,
   which has potential practicability in automobile security systems.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the stringent requirements of distributed hydrogen production,
   combined reaction separation approaches to the endothermic steam methane
   reforming process have been investigated widely as a potential means to
   reduce the required reaction temperature, ratio of steam to methane in
   the fuel (or steam to carbon ratio), and number of sequential unit
   operation steps. CHAMP-SORB (CO2/H-2 active membrane piston reactor in
   combination with in situ CO2 adsorption) is a new reactor technology for
   distributed hydrogen production from methane that incorporates both a
   hydrogen-selective membrane and CO2 adsorption into a variable volume
   batch operation using a four-stroke cycle. Active control of the reactor
   volume, and hence pressure, in combination with continuous removal of
   both reaction products allows CHAMP-SORB to circumvent the equilibrium
   limitations of the steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction, which
   otherwise limit fuel conversion, especially at temperatures below 500
   degrees C with a stoichiometric fuel mixture. In this work, we present
   the first demonstration of an operating CHAMP-SORB reactor,
   achieving,SMR at temperatures as low as 400 degrees C and at a
   steam-to-carbon ratio of 2:1. A kinetic model of the CHAMP-SORB process
   is developed; verified for agreement with detailed experimental
   measurements; and used to investigate the interactions between the
   reaction, permeation, and adsorption processes. Time scale analysis is
   introduced to explore the relationship between reactor component design
   characteristics and the rate-limiting steps of the CHAMP-SORB process.
   Supported by the results of kinetic simulations, the scaling analysis
   provides a powerful tool for rapid exploration of the operating space,
   including operating temperatures and hydrogen collection and utilization
   pressures.}},

   Subsequently, CdS-Te composites were exploited as a self-sacrificial
   template to craft various CdS-Te@(Pt, Pd) multi-heterostructures. Highly
   uniform dispersion and intimate interactions between CdS and
   multicomponent cocatalysts, together with improved separation of
   photogenerated carriers due to the presence of Te nanotubes (NTs) and

   greatly enhanced efficiency and stability in the photocatalytic
   production of H-2. Thorough morphological growth of metal sulfide/Te

Abstract = {{The piezophototronic effect is known as a three-way coupling between
   piezoelectric polarization, semiconductor property, and optical
   excitation in piezoelectric semiconductor materials to modify their
   energy band structures by strain-induced piezoelectric polarization
   charges, and thus to tune/control their optoelectronic processes of
   charge carrier generation, separation, recombination, and transport. In
   this work, the temperature dependence of the piezophototronic effect in
   wurtzite-structured CdS nanowires is investigated from 77 to 300 K. The
   piezophototronic effect is enhanced by over 550\% under lower
   temperature due to the increased effective piezoelectric polarization
   surface/interface charges resulting from the reduced screening effect by
   decreased mobile charge carriers in CdS nanowires. Optoelectronic
   performances of CdS nanowires are systematically investigated under
   various light illuminations, strains, and temperatures. By analyzing the
   corresponding band diagrams, the piezophototronic effect is found to
   dominate the transport and separation processes of charge carriers. This
   study presents in-depth fundamental understanding about the
   piezophototronic effect and provides guidance for its future
   applications in optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In the beginning of sequential experimentation, space-filling designs
   are more appropriate for exploring process behaviour since they do not
   require any assumptions about the underlying model. In the latter stages
   of sequential experimentation, however, when data are collected and more
   knowledge about the process behaviour is gathered, model-based optimal
   designs may be more appropriate. This article proposes an adaptive
   combined design (ACD) balancing the characteristics of both design
   criteria at different stages of the sequential experiments. The tuning
   parameter associated with the ACD adaptively gauges the amount of
   process knowledge gain, which is used to improve the estimation of model
   parameters while still allowing for the exploration of model
   uncertainties. Rather than employing the weighted-sum method, an
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -constraint method is proposed to balance the two design criteria.
   Property investigation shows that the ACD provides better estimation of
   parameters over the space-filling design, and yet is more robust against
   model misspecification when compared to optimal designs. Simulated and
   real-life nanofabrication examples illustrate the needs of the ACD and
   the interesting features of the tuning parameter in searching for the

Abstract = {{Based on the highly successful quaternion multiplicative extended Kalman
   filter for spacecraft attitude estimation using unit quaternions, this
   paper proposes a dual quaternion multiplicative extended Kalman filter
   for spacecraft pose (i.e., attitude and position) and linear and angular
   velocity estimation using unit dual quaternions. By using the concept of
   error unit dual quaternion, defined analogously to the concept of error
   unit quaternion in the quaternion multiplicative extended Kalman filter,
   this paper proposes, as far as the authors know, the first
   multiplicative extended Kalman filter for pose estimation. The state
   estimate of the dual quaternion multiplicative extended Kalman filter
   can directly be used by recently proposed pose controllers based on dual
   quaternions, without any additional conversions, thus providing an
   elegant solution to the output dynamic compensation problem of the full
   six degree-of-freedom motion of a rigid body. Three formulations of the
   dual quaternion multiplicative extended Kalman filter are presented. The
   first takes continuous-time linear and angular velocity measurements
   with noise and bias and discrete-time pose measurements with noise. The
   second takes only discrete-time pose measurements with noise and hence
   is suitable for satellite proximity operation scenarios where the chaser
   satellite has only access to measurements of the relative pose, but
   requires the relative linear and angular velocities for control. The
   third formulation takes continuous-time angular velocity and linear
   acceleration measurements with noise and bias and discrete-time pose
   measurements with noise. The proposed dual quaternion multiplicative
   extended Kalman filter is compared with two alternative extended Kalman
   filter formulations on a five degree-of-freedom air-bearing platform and
   through extensive MonteCarlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Admissible region methods for initial orbit determination are generally
   implemented without considering the contributions of uncertainty in
   observations or observer state when computing the admissible region. In
   this paper, a generalization of the admissible region approach is
   introduced that more accurately accounts for uncertainty in the
   constraint hypothesis parameters used to generate the admissible region.
   Considering the uncertainty to have Gaussian distributions, the proposed
   relationship between provided information uncertainty and admissible
   region uncertainty results directly in an analytical probability

Abstract = {{Future robotic and human missions to Mars require improved landed
   precision and increased payload mass. Low ballistic coefficient entry
   vehicles decelerate high in the thin Mars atmosphere and may be used to
   deliver higher-mass payloads to the surface. A high-altitude supersonic
   propulsive divert maneuver is proposed as a means of precision landing
   for low ballistic coefficient entry vehicles that decelerate to
   supersonic speeds at altitudes of 20-60km. This divert maneuver compares
   favorably to traditional precision landing architectures with up to
   100\% improvement in range capability while saving over 30\% in
   propellant mass. Through Monte Carlo simulations, it was found that
   architectures that use hypersonic vehicles with ballistic coefficients
   of 10kg/m2 can potentially land within 500m of a target with this
   maneuver alone. This high-altitude divert range capability is sensitive
   to altitude and flight-path angle variations at maneuver initiation, and
   it is relatively insensitive to velocity at initiation. The propellant
   mass fraction is relatively invariant to the initial conditions and
   correlates directly with the divert distance.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous underwater gliders fitted with vector sensors can be used as
   a spatially distributed sensor array to passively locate underwater
   sources. However, to date, the positional accuracy required for robust
   array processing (especially coherent processing) is not achievable

   accuracy, the gliders can be temporarily surfaced to allow for global
   positioning system contact, but the acoustically active sea surface
   introduces locally additional sensor noise. This letter demonstrates
   that cross-coherent array processing, which inherently mitigates the
   effects of local noise, outperforms traditional incoherent processing

Title = {{Dynamics of harmonically excited, reacting bluff body wakes near the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{779}},
Pages = {{716-750}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes linear and nonlinear interactions between forced
   axial acoustic oscillations and the global mode of the reacting wake.
   This work is motivated by the problem of combustion instabilities, where
   acoustic oscillations associated with natural combustor modes excite
   hydrodynamic instabilities of the flow that, in turn, induce heat
   release oscillations. Wake flows with density stratification can be
   globally stable or unstable at high Reynolds numbers, and so the density
   change across the flame has significant influence on the natural flame
   and flow dynamics. Measurements were obtained in a facility in which
   flame density ratio, lip velocity and forcing frequency are
   independently varied using 5 kHz particle image velocimetry and Mie
   scattering measurements. By Varying the density ratio, the hydrodynamic
   global mode growth rate can be systematically varied. In addition,
   measurements and analyses were performed Where the forcing frequency is
   varied relative to the global mode frequency. While axial forcing
   excites a varicose response of the shear layers, the sinuous mode is the
   most rapidly growing. As expected, forcing at a frequency near the
   wake's global mode frequency leads to rapid growth in vertical
   disturbance amplitude, and the symmetric vortices quickly stagger as
   they convect downstream leading to a large scale, sinuous flapping of
   the wake and flame. A linear, local stability analysis, together with a
   nonlinear analysis, help elucidate the physics that govern the vortex
   staggering. The study concludes with an analysis of the heat release
   dynamics Significantly, the study ShOWs that the heat release exhibits
   quite different sensitivities than the fluid dynamics; e.g. axial
   forcing of the flow near its global mode frequency leads to a reduction
   in heat release oscillations. `f his is true even though this forcing
   frequency maximizes the local degree of vertically induced flame
   flapping. Thus, the results of this study show some phenomena that
   contradict conventional notions, namely that conditions which align the
   frequency of a hydrodynamic global mode with that of an acoustic mode
   may lead to diminished forced heat release oscillations in bluff body
   combustors.}},

   characteristics immediately downstream of the splitter plate and in the
   shock-wave/shear-layer interaction regions. Three different
   splitter-plate thicknesses, 2, 4, and 8 mm, are considered, to identify
   the significance of the geometric parameters. The analysis is based on
   the Favre-averaged conservation equations for compressible chemically
   reacting flows. Turbulence closure is achieved using Menter's
   shear-stress transport model with a detached-eddy-simulation extension.
   Chemical reactions are modeled using a nine-species, ten-step laminar
   chemistry model with sufficient numerical resolution. Various mechanisms
   dictating the flame anchoring and spreading properties are examined. The
   hot stream from the ethylene preoxidization in the gas generator is
   found to behave like an underexpanded supersonic jet. Its subsequent
   expansion in the present wall-confined environment has a strong
   influence on the near-field mixing and combustion. Depending on the
   splitter-plate thickness, the wake region behind the splitter plate
   changes in size, and the autoignited flame can be either attached to or
   detached from the rim. The majority of chemical reactions take place in
   the mixing layer farther downstream, and the combustion efficiency
   varies in accordance with the near-field phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) adopts a closed conformation
   that shields the platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb alpha) binding
   site in the VWF-A1 domain. Immobilized at sites of vascular injury, VWF
   is activated by its interaction with collagen and the exertion of
   increased hemodynamic forces. Studies on native VWF strings and isolated
   A1 domains suggest the existence of multiple A1 binding states in
   different biophysical contexts. In this single-molecule study, we have
   used a biomembrane force probe (BFP) and a flow chamber to identify and
   characterize a collagen binding induced conformation with a higher
   affinity to platelet GPIb alpha. As force increases, our results show
   that collagen binding increases the stability of GPIb alpha bond with
   both VWF and isolated A1 domain. However, the collagen 2D binding
   affinity for VWF-A3 domain is 10 times of that for A1 domain, suggesting
   the initial VWF capture is mediated by A3-collagen interaction while
   A1-collagen regulates the subsequent VWF activation. Our results reveal
   the molecular mechanism of collagen-regulated, A1-mediated platelet
   adhesion enhancement. Characterization of different A1 states provides
   insights into binding heterogeneity of VWF in different scenarios of
   inflammation and thrombosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Alum and Rainfall Effects on Ionophores in Runoff from Surface-Applied
   Broiler Litter}},

Abstract = {{Polyether ionophores, monensin, and salinomycin are commonly used as
   antiparasitic drugs in broiler production and may be present in broiler
   litter (bird excreta plus bedding material). Long-term application of
   broiler litter to pastures may lead to ionophore contamination of
   surface waters. Because polyether ionophores break down at low pH, we
   hypothesized that decreasing litter pH with an acidic material such as
   aluminum sulfate (alum) would reduce ionophore losses to runoff (i.e.,
   monensin and salinomycin concentrations, loads, or amounts lost). We
   quantified ionophore loss to runoff in response to (i) addition of alum
   to broiler litter and (ii) length of time between litter application and
   the first simulated rainfall event. The factorial experiment consisted
   of unamended (similar to pH 9) vs. alum-amended litters (similar to pH
   6), each combined with simulated rainfall at 0, 2, or 4 wk after litter
   application. Runoff from alum-amended broiler litter had 33\% lower
   monensin concentration (p < 0.01), 57\% lower monensin load (p < 0.01),
   48\% lower salinomycin concentration (p < 0.01), and 66\% lower
   salinomycin load (p < 0.01) than runoff from unamended broiler litter
   when averaged across all events of rainfall. Ionophore losses to runoff
   were also less when rainfall was delayed for 2 or 4 wk after litter
   application relative to applying rainfall immediately after litter
   application. While the weather is difficult to predict, our data suggest
   that ionophore losses in runoff can be reduced if broiler litter
   applications are made to maximize dry time after application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce GTID, a technique that can actively and
   passively fingerprint wireless devices and their types using wire-side
   observations in a local network. GTID exploits information that is
   leaked as a result of heterogeneity in devices, which is a function of
   different device hardware compositions and variations in devices' clock
   skew. We apply statistical techniques on network traffic to create
   unique, reproducible device and device type signatures, and use
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) for classification. We demonstrate the
   efficacy of our technique on both an isolated testbed and a live campus
   network (during peak hours) using a corpus of 37 devices representing a
   wide range of device classes (e.g., iPads, iPhones, Google Phones, etc.)
   and traffic types (e.g., Skype, SCP, ICMP, etc.). Our experiments
   provided more than 300 GB of traffic captures which we used for ANN
   training and performance evaluation. In order for any fingerprinting
   technique to be practical, it must be able to detect previously unseen
   devices (i.e., devices for which no stored signature is available) and
   must be able to withstand various attacks. GTID is a fingerprinting
   technique to detect previously unseen devices and to illustrate its
   resilience under various attacker models. We measure the performance of
   GTID by considering accuracy, recall, and processing time and also
   illustrate how it can be used to complement existing security mechanisms
   (e.g., authentication systems) and to detect counterfeit devices.}},

   algae ponds, thereby protecting the algae crop. Differential toxicity
   tests were conducted to compare the copper sensitivity of a model
   rotiferB. calyciflorus and an alga, C. kessleri. The rotifer LC50 was
   <0.1 ppm while the alga was not affected up to 5 ppm Cu(II). The low pH
   of the rotifer stomach may make it more sensitive to copper. However,
   when these cultures were combined, a copper concentration of 1.5 ppm was
   needed to inhibit the rotifer as the alga bound the copper, decreasing
   its bioavailability. Copper (X ppm) had no effect on downstream fatty
   acid methyl ester extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Gas sensing is an important technology that is widely used in life
   science, security and environmental protection. In this work, we
   introduced a fundamentally new working principle in the gas sensing
   field by fabricating a blow-driven triboelectric nanogenerator
   (BD-TENG). By using the electricity generated via mouth blowing, the
   induced voltage across the sensor holds a proportional relationship with
   the breathed-out alcohol concentration regardless the blow speed and
   quality air-flow. The as-developed BD-TENG, acting as an active alcohol
   breath analyzer, is featured as high detection gas response of 34 under
   an optimized sensor working temperature, fast response time of 11 s as
   well as a fast recovery of 20 s. Moreover, the device shows outstanding
   capability of selectivity anti-interference for alcohol detection. In
   addition, fabricated of common polymer materials, the reported breath
   analyzer is still light-weight and cost-effective. The BD-TENG based
   alcohol detector not only presents a new principle in the field of gas
   sensing, but also greatly advances the applicability of TENGs as
   self-powered active sensors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A facile hydrothermal method is utilized to produce nanostructured
   NiCo2S4 arrays on carbon fiber paper with controlled morphologies to
   study the effect of morphology on their electrochemical performance in
   supercapacitors. Specifically, NiCo2S4 solid nanofiber, nanotube, and
   hollow nanoneedle of the same crystalline structure are synthesized by
   controlling the conditions of the hydrothermal synthesis. Among the
   three different morphologies studied, the hollow nanoneedle of NiCo2S4
   shows the highest capacity and the longest cycling life, demonstrating a
   specific capacitance of similar to 1154 F g(-1) at a charge-discharge
   current density of 1 A g(-)(1) and negligible capacity loss after 8000
   cycles (at a rate of 10 A g(-1)). This high performance is attributed to
   the unique nanostructure of the hollow nanoneedle, suggesting that the
   morphology of NiCo2S4 plays a vital role in determining the
   electrochemical performance. Further, an asymmetric capacitor consisting
   of NiCo2S4 hollow nanoneedle electrode and a tape-cast activated carbon
   film electrode achieves an energy density of 17.3 Wh kg(-1) at 1 A g(-1)
   and a power density of 0.2 kW kg(-1) at 20 A g(-1) in a voltage range of
   0-1.5 V, implying that it has a great potential for a wide variety of
   practical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight and mechanically compliant energy storage devices have
   attracted tremendous interest due to the increasing demand for flexible
   and miniaturized electronics. Recently, microsupercapacitors (MSCs) have
   advanced rapidly as potential micro-sized power sources, but it is still
   challenging to build the micro-device using cost-effective technologies
   for large-scale manufacture. Here, we developed a simple
   solution-processible method to fabricate microelectrode patterns using a
   water-dispersible graphene/sulfonated polyaniline (rG/SP) as the active
   MSC material. The highly stabilized rG/SP dispersion in aqueous solution
   enables the direct thin-film deposition on flexible substrates and the
   formation of interdigital patterns by plasma etching. The as-fabricated
   solid-state MSC delivers an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 3.31 mF/cm(2)
   and volumetric stack capacitance of 16.55 F/cm(3) with excellent rate
   and cycling performance. Furthermore, the rG/SP based MSC demonstrates a
   superior energy density of 1.51 mW h/cm(3) while maintaining high power
   density. The micro-device also shows superior mechanical stability with
   96.5\% of capacitance retained under different bending and twisting
   conditions, which makes it suitable specifically for portable and
   wearable electronic applications. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In many settings in which Monte Carlo methods are applied, there may be
   no known algorithm for exactly generating the random object for which an

   arbitrarily close approximations to the random object. We introduce a
   simple randomization idea for creating unbiased estimators in such a
   setting based on a sequence of approximations. Applying this idea to
   computing expectations of path functionals associated with stochastic
   differential equations (SDEs), we construct finite variance unbiased
   estimators with a ``square root convergence rate{''} for a general class
   of multidimensional SDEs. We then identify the optimal randomization
   distribution. Numerical experiments with various path functionals of
   continuous-time processes that often arise in finance illustrate the
   effectiveness of our new approach.}},

Title = {{Penalty Function with Memory for Discrete Optimization via Simulation

Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1195-1212}},

Abstract = {{We consider a discrete optimization via simulation (DOvS) problem with
   stochastic constraints on secondary performance measures in which both
   objective and secondary performance measures need to be estimated by
   stochastic simulation. To solve the problem, we develop a new method
   called the Penalty Function with Memory (PFM). It is similar to an
   existing penalty-type method-which consists of a penalty parameter and a
   measure of violation of constraints-in a sense that it converts a DOvS
   problem with constraints into a series of unconstrained problems.
   However, PFM uses a different penalty parameter, called a penalty
   sequence, determined by the past history of feasibility checks on a
   solution. Specifically, assuming a minimization problem, a penalty
   sequence diverges to infinity for any infeasible solution but converges
   to zero for any feasible solution under certain conditions. As a result,
   a DOvS algorithm combined with PFM performs well even when an optimal
   feasible solution is a boundary solution with one or more active
   constraints. We prove convergence properties and discuss parameter
   selection for the implementation of PFM. Experimental results on a
   number of numerical examples show that a DOvS algorithm combined with
   PFM works well.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction and removal of protecting groups is ubiquitous in
   multi-step synthetic schemes. From a green chemistry standpoint,
   however, alternative strategies that employ in situ and reversible
   protection and deprotection sequences would be attractive. The
   reversible reactions of CO2 with amines could provide a possible vehicle
   for realizing this strategy. Herein, we present (1) the products of
   reaction of benzylamines with CO2 in a variety of solvents with and
   without the presence of basic additives; (2) new adducts associated with
   CO2 protected benzylamine in acetonitrile containing
   1,8-diazabicyclo{[}5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU); and (3) the intermolecular
   competitive acylation of benzylamine and benzyl alcohol and the

Abstract = {{In this work, we tested the hypothesis that particles injected into the
   suprachoroidal space can be localized at the site of injection or
   broadly distributed throughout the suprachoroidal space by controlling
   polymeric formulation properties. Single hollow microneedles were
   inserted into the sclera of New Zealand White rabbits and injected
   non-biodegradable fluorescently tagged nanoparticles and microparticles
   suspended in polymeric formulations into the suprachoroidal space of the
   eye. When formulated in saline, the particles were distributed over
   29-42\% of the suprachoroidal space immediately after injection. To
   spread particles over larger areas of the choroidal surface, addition of
   hyaluronic acid to make moderately non-Newtonian solutions increased
   particle spread to up to 100\% of the suprachoroidal space. To localize
   particles at the site of injection adjacent to the ciliary body,
   strongly non-Newtonian polymer solutions localized particles to 8.3-20\%
   of the suprachoroidal space, which exhibited a small increase in area
   over the course of two months. This study demonstrates targeted particle
   delivery within the suprachoroidal space using polymer formulations that
   spread particles over the whole choroidal surface or localized them
   adjacent to the ciliary body after injection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{SOx/NOx Removal from Flue Gas Streams by Solid Adsorbents: A Review of
   Current Challenges and Future Directions}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in the power and chemical industries is to
   remove generated toxic or environmentally harmful gases before
   atmospheric emission. To comply with stringent environmental and
   pollutant emissions control regulations, coal-fired power plants must be
   equipped with new technologies that are efficient and less
   energy-intensive than status quo technologies for flue gas cleanup.
   While conventional sulfur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) removal
   technologies benefit from their large-scale implementation and maturity,
   they are quite energy-intensive. In view of this, the development of
   lower-cost, less energy-intensive technologies could offer an advantage.
   Significant energy and cost savings can potentially be realized by using
   advanced adsorbent materials. One of the major barriers to the
   development of such technologies remains the development of materials
   that are efficient and productive in removing flue gas contaminants. In
   this review, adsorption-based removal of SOx/NOx impurities from flue
   gas is discussed, with a focus on important attributes of the solid
   adsorbent materials as well as implementation of the materials in
   conventional and emerging acid gas removal technologies. The
   requirements for effective adsorbents are noted with respect to their
   performance, key limitations, and suggested future research directions.
   The final section includes some key areas for future research and
   provides a possible roadmap for the development of technologies for the
   removal of flue gas impurities that are more efficient and
   cost-effective than status quo approaches.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{5251-5259}},

Abstract = {{To perform spectrum handoff, cognitive radio (CR) nodes communicating
   with each other need to exchange licensed user detection information,
   i.e., perform spectrum coordination, over a common control channel. The
   spectrum coordination can be fulfilled either via existing cognitive
   radio interface with time division or via a separate dedicated radio,
   i.e., a common control interface (CCI), continuously. CR nodes with CCI
   can instantly exchange licensed user detection information and cease
   frame transmission, while spectrum coordination can only be performed
   after the frame transmission period without CCI. Nevertheless, the
   impact of CCI incorporation into CR nodes in terms of common performance
   metrics must be thoroughly assessed to evaluate the worthiness of
   additional radio cost. In this paper, an analytical framework is
   presented to assess the impact of CCI incorporation into CR nodes for
   spectrum handoff. The developed framework enables analyzing potential
   benefits and disadvantages of employing CCI for spectrum handoff, in
   terms of achievable delay, energy consumption, spectrum utilization and
   event estimation performance. Extensive performance evaluations are
   presented to illustrate the impact of CCI utilization on efficiency of
   spectrum handoff. The network and communication regimes that would yield
   having CCI favorable are characterized in terms of spectrum conditions
   and CR parameters.}},

   particles in UK winter}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) and light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC)
   play key roles in warming the atmosphere, but the magnitude of their
   effects remains highly uncertain. Theoretical modelling and laboratory
   experiments demonstrate that coatings on BC can enhance BC's light
   absorption, therefore many climate models simply assume enhanced BC
   absorption by a factor of similar to 1.5. However, recent field
   observations show negligible absorption enhancement, implying models may
   overestimate BC's warming. Here we report direct evidence of substantial
   field-measured BC absorption enhancement, with the magnitude strongly
   depending on BC coating amount. Increases in BC coating result from a
   combination of changing sources and photochemical aging processes. When
   the influence of BrC is accounted for, observationally constrained model
   calculations of the BC absorption enhancement can be reconciled with the
   observations. We conclude that the influence of coatings on BC
   absorption should be treated as a source and regionally specific
   parameter in climate models.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical degradation and resultant capacity fade in high-capacity
   electrode materials critically hinder their use in high-performance
   rechargeable batteries. Despite tremendous efforts devoted to the study
   of the electro-chemo-mechanical behaviours of high-capacity electrode
   materials, their fracture properties and mechanisms remain largely
   unknown. Here we report a nanomechanical study on the damage tolerance
   of electrochemically lithiated silicon. Our in situ transmission
   electron microscopy experiments reveal a striking contrast of brittle
   fracture in pristine silicon versus ductile tensile deformation in fully
   lithiated silicon. Quantitative fracture toughness measurements by
   nanoindentation show a rapid brittle-to-ductile transition of fracture
   as the lithium-to-silicon molar ratio is increased to above 1.5.
   Molecular dynamics simulations elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings
   of the brittle-to-ductile transition governed by atomic bonding and
   lithiation-induced toughening. Our results reveal the high damage
   tolerance in amorphous lithium-rich silicon alloys and have important
   implications for the development of durable rechargeable batteries.}},

Title = {{Light-induced pyroelectric effect as an effective approach for ultrafast
   ultraviolet nanosensing}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Zinc oxide is potentially a useful material for ultraviolet detectors;
   however, a relatively long response time hinders practical
   implementation. Here by designing and fabricating a self-powered
   ZnO/perovskite-heterostructured ultraviolet photodetector, the
   pyroelectric effect, induced in wurtzite ZnO nanowires on ultraviolet
   illumination, has been utilized as an effective approach for
   high-performance photon sensing. The response time is improved from 5.4
   s to 53 ms at the rising edge, and 8.9 s to 63 ms at the falling edge,
   with an enhancement of five orders in magnitudes. The specific
   detectivity and the responsivity are both enhanced by 322\%. This work
   provides a novel design to achieve ultrafast ultraviolet sensing at room
   temperature via light-self-induced pyroelectric effect. The newly
   designed ultrafast self-powered ultraviolet nanosensors may find
   promising applications in ultrafast optics, nonlinear optics,
   optothermal detections, computational memories and biocompatible
   optoelectronic probes.}},

Title = {{Theory of Tribotronics}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{As a potential next generation mechanical-to-electricity power
   generator, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has drawn considerable
   attention in recent years. Its mechanical-to-electrical signal control
   properties also gave rise to the original idea of ``tribotronics{''},
   which utilize triboelectric output to drive/control electronic devices.
   Using a TENG as input for gate voltage for a field effect transistor, a
   tribotronic device has potential application in mainly two areas (i)
   mechanically controlled electronics and (ii) motion/displacement
   sensing. An experimental study has already been recently reported and
   therefore a theoretical study is strongly desired as the theoretical
   basis and optimization strategy for designing such circuits. Here, both
   analytical calculations and numerical simulations are used to study the
   tribotronic device, both on the logic operation and on mechanical
   sensing. The static charge and inherent capacitance of TENG are
   determined by the structure design of the TENG and have strong coupling
   with the field effect transistor. Such coupling effect is taken into
   consideration, thus developing a methodology to effectively optimize the
   tribotronic device design according to such a coupling effect.}},

Abstract = {{Construction of whole-genome networks from large-scale gene expression
   data is an important problem in systems biology. While several
   techniques have been developed, most cannot handle network
   reconstruction at the whole-genome scale, and the few that can, require
   large clusters. In this paper, we present a solution on the Intel Xeon
   Phi coprocessor, taking advantage of its multi-level parallelism
   including many x86-based cores, multiple threads per core, and vector
   processing units. We also present a solution on the Intel (R) Xeon (R)
   processor. Our solution is based on TINGe, a fast parallel network
   reconstruction technique that uses mutual information and permutation
   testing for assessing statistical significance. We demonstrate the first
   ever inference of a plant whole genome regulatory network on a single
   chip by constructing a 15,575 gene network of the plant Arabidopsis
   thaliana from 3,137 microarray experiments in only 22 minutes. In
   addition, our optimization for parallelizing mutual information
   computation on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor holds out lessons that are
   applicable to other domains.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In van der Waals bonded or rotationally disordered multilayer stacks of
   two-dimensional (2D) materials, the electronic states remain tightly
   confined within individual 2D layers. As a result, electron-phonon
   interactions occur primarily within layers and interlayer electrical
   conductivities are low. In addition, strong covalent in-plane intralayer
   bonding combined with weak van der Waals interlayer bonding results in
   weak phonon-mediated thermal coupling between the layers. We demonstrate
   here, however, that Coulomb interactions between electrons in different
   layers of multilayer epitaxial graphene provide an important mechanism
   for interlayer thermal transport, even though all electronic states are
   strongly confined within individual 2D layers. This effect is manifested
   in the relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in ultrafast time-resolved
   terahertz spectroscopy. We develop a theory of interlayer Coulomb
   coupling containing no free parameters that accounts for the
   experimentally observed trends in hot-carrier dynamics as temperature
   and the number of layers is varied.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fractal metallic dendrites have been drawing more attentions recently,
   yet they have rarely been explored in electronic printing or packaging
   applications because of the great challenges in large-scale synthesis
   and limited understanding in such applications. Here we demonstrate a
   controllable synthesis of fractal Ag micro-dendrites at the hundred-gram
   scale. When used as the fillers for isotropically electrically
   conductive composites (ECCs), the unique three-dimensional fractal
   geometrical configuration and low-temperature sintering characteristic
   render the Ag micro dendrites with an ultra-low electrical percolation
   threshold of 0.97 vol\% (8 wt\%). The ultra-low percolation threshold
   and self-limited fusing ability may address some critical challenges in
   current interconnect technology for microelectronics. For example, only
   half of the laser-scribe energy is needed to pattern fine circuit lines
   printed using the present ECCs, showing great potential for wiring
   ultrathin circuits for high performance flexible electronics.}},

   triboelectric nanogenerators}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerators have been invented as a highly efficient,
   cost-effective and easy scalable energy-harvesting technology for
   converting ambient mechanical energy into electricity. Four basic
   working modes have been demonstrated, each of which has different
   designs to accommodate the corresponding mechanical triggering
   conditions. A common standard is thus required to quantify the
   performance of the triboelectric nanogenerators so that their outputs
   can be compared and evaluated. Here we report figure-of-merits for
   defining the performance of a triboelectric nanogenerator, which is
   composed of a structural figure-of-merit related to the structure and a
   material figure of merit that is the square of the surface charge
   density. The structural figure-of-merit is derived and simulated to
   compare the triboelectric nanogenerators with different configurations.
   A standard method is introduced to quantify the material figure-of-merit
   for a general surface. This study is likely to establish the standards
   for developing TENGs towards practical applications and
   industrialization.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{233}},

Abstract = {{The 3-Omega measurement technique was applied to a microbridge heater
   for the purpose of low power gas sensing. The sensor performance was
   evaluated for mixtures of CO2, Ar, He and CH4 in N-2 in an isothermal
   chamber where concentrations were precisely controlled by mass flow
   controllers. A custom 3-Omega conditioning circuit controls the AC
   heating current and detection of the 3-Omega voltage signal. The
   amplitude and phase lag, and the in-phase and out-of-phase components of
   the 3-Omega signal are presented for each case and are related directly
   to gas concentrations. Advantageously, the phase lag can determine the
   gas concentration without calibration of an individual gas sensor. Using
   this technique and our current microbridge thermal conductivity detector
   (TCD), it is possible to resolve gas concentrations down to 0.07\%. The
   frequency behavior of the 3-Omega signal as it pertains to the thermal
   environment and sensor sensitivity is discussed. The 3-Omega technique
   combined with the microbridge is capable of operating with power
   consumptions that are <10\% of the power consumed by conventional
   Wheatstone bridge measurements at room temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   experimental data in an externally heated diamond anvil cell. Bulk
   modulus, thermal expansion and internal pressure are obtained for
   isothermal compression. Other thermodynamic properties are also

Title = {{Biomimetic and synthetic interfaces to tune immune responses}},
Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Organisms depend upon complex intercellular communication to initiate,
   maintain, or suppress immune responses during infection or disease.
   Communication occurs not only between different types of immune cells,
   but also between immune cells and nonimmune cells or pathogenic
   entities. It can occur directly at the cell-cell contact interface, or
   indirectly through secreted signals that bind cell surface molecules.
   Though secreted signals can be soluble, they can also be particulate in
   nature and direct communication at the cell-particle interface. Secreted
   extracellular vesicles are an example of native particulate
   communication, while viruses are examples of foreign particulates.
   Inspired by communication at natural immunological interfaces,
   biomimetic materials and designer molecules have been developed to mimic
   and direct the type of immune response. This review describes the ways
   in which native, biomimetic, and designer materials can mediate immune
   responses. Examples include extracellular vesicles, particles that mimic
   immune cells or pathogens, and hybrid designer molecules with multiple
   signaling functions, engineered to target and bind immune cell surface
   molecules. Interactions between these materials and immune cells are
   leading to increased understanding of natural immune communication and
   function, as well as development of immune therapeutics for the
   treatment of infection, cancer, and autoimmune disease. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The current study presents an effective and selective multifunctional
   nanoparticle used to deliver antiatherogenic therapeutics to inflamed
   proatherogenic regions without off-target changes in gene expression or
   particle-induced toxicities. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene
   expression, playing a critical role in biology and disease including
   atherosclerosis. While anti-miRNA are emerging as therapeutics, numerous
   challenges remain due to their potential off-target effects, and
   therefore the development of carriers for selective delivery to diseased
   sites is important. Yet, co-optimization of multifunctional
   nanoparticles with high loading efficiency, a hidden cationic domain to
   facilitate lysosomal escape and a dense, stable incorporation of
   targeting moieties is challenging. Here, we create coated, cationic
   lipoparticles (CCLs), containing anti-miR-712 (similar to 1400
   molecules, >95\% loading efficiency) within the core and with a neutral
   coating, decorated with 5 mol \% of peptide (VHPK) to target vascular
   cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Optical imaging validated
   disease-specific accumulation as anti-miR-712 was efficiently delivered
   to inflamed mouse aortic endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. As with
   the naked anti-miR-712, the delivery of VHPK-CCL-anti-miR-712
   effectively downregulated the d-flow induced expression of miR-712 and
   also rescued the expression of its target genes tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein
   with kazal motifs (RECK) in the endothelium, resulting in inhibition of
   metalloproteinase activity. Moreover, an 80\% lower dose of
   VHPK-CCL-anti-miR-712 (1 mg/kg dose given twice a week), as compared
   with naked anti-miR-712, prevented atheroma formation in a mouse model
   of atherosclerosis. While delivery of naked anti-miR-712 alters
   expression in multiple organs, miR-712 expression in nontargeted organs
   was unchanged following VHPK-CCL-anti-miR-712 delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Uncontrolled bleeding from traumatic wounds is a major factor in deaths
   resulting from military conflict, accidents, disasters and crime.
   Self-assembling peptide nanofibers have shown superior hemostatic
   activity, and herein, we elucidate their mechanism by visualizing the
   formation of nanofiber-based clots that aggregate blood components with
   a similar morphology to fibrin-based clots. Furthermore, to enhance its
   direct application to a wound, we developed layer-by-layer assembled
   thin film coatings onto common materials used for wound dressings gauze
   and gelatin sponges. We find these nanofibers elute upon hydration under
   physiological conditions and generate nanofiber-based clots with blood.
   After exposure to a range of harsh temperature conditions (-80 to 60
   degrees C) for a week and even 5 months at 60 degrees C, these
   hemostatic bandages remain capable of releasing active nanofibers. In
   addition, the application of these nanofiber-based films from gauze
   bandages was found to accelerate hemostasis in porcine skin wounds as
   compared to plain gauze. The thermal robustness, in combination with the
   self-assembling peptide's potent hemostatic activity, biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, and low cost of production, makes this a promising
   approach for a cheap yet effective hemostatic bandage.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous descent arrival (CDA) procedures provide time and fuel
   savings, and reduce the noise impact of aircraft operations near
   airports. To date, these procedures have been designed to limit the
   performance envelopes to achieve trajectory commonality. In this paper,
   the performance bounds of CDA procedure via multiphase optimal vertical
   trajectory generation problems with respect to two performance
   indices-flight time and fuel consumption - have been investigated. The
   optimal CDA vertical profile is first divided into two segments: the
   cruise segment before the top of descent (TOD) and the descent segment
   from the TOD. Then, the second segment is further subdivided based on
   flap setting and speed constraints. Finally, the resulting multiphase
   optimal control problem is solved using a pseudospectral method. Two
   different types of aircraft, B737-500 (light) and B767-400 (heavy), are
   used in a numerical study, and the optimal CDA trajectories of the two
   types are compared with a typical vertical navigation (VNAV) CDA
   trajectory used in CDA applications at several airports. Then, the
   utility of suboptimal VNAV CDA trajectories that can be created with
   known flight management system (FMS) VNAV descent modes is explored, and
   thereby enabling onboard calculation in the FMS via the sensitivity
   analysis that is performed with various wind conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The nexus of advanced manufacturing methods, computer-aided design
   tools, and modern structural-analysis software has enabled the design
   and fabrication of structurally complex wing structures with unique
   features. This is particularly true for small unmanned aircraft, in
   which discrete structural hinges can easily be integrated into the
   overall vehicle design. This paper examines the use of discrete
   structural hinges for tailoring the low-frequency flight dynamics of the
   vehicle. For sufficiently soft discrete structural hinges, substantial
   coupling between flexible and rigid modes occurs, leading to the
   potential to modify the flight dynamic behavior through structural
   flexibility. Using a multibody flight dynamics simulation tool with a
   nonlinear lifting-line aerodynamic representation, different
   structural-hinge elastic properties, orientation, and location on the
   aircraft are examined. The results for a small unmanned aircraft
   indicate that flexibility mostly affects the longitudinal modes and
   associated handling qualities of the vehicle. Changes in the
   short-period and phugoid modes due to flexibility caused by a set of
   discrete structural hinges are often antagonistic. A structural-hinge
   stiffness above a certain critical value tends to improve short-period
   flying qualities; below this value, the short-period flying qualities
   degrade. In addition to the stiffness characteristics of the discrete
   structural hinge, orientation of the hinge has a significant effect on
   flight dynamics. Orienting the structural hinge to produce pitch-flap
   coupling can triple the short-period-mode damping, which could improve a
   nominally Level 3 rated aircraft to a Level 1 rated aircraft.}},

Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{82-96}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present a length-dependent model for the thermomechanical response of
   ceramics through a concurrent multiscale scheme that accounts for: (i)
   the locally varying values of the sub-grain thermal conductivity tensor
   due to the interaction of phonons with microstructural features such as
   grain boundaries, and (ii) a continuum model of thermal stresses that
   explicitly resolves the polycrystalline structure of the material. At
   the subgrain level, we compute the values of the thermal conductivity
   tensor using the Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time
   approximation. At the continuum level, the polycrystalline structure of
   the specimen is resolved explicitly by a finite element mesh and the
   texture of the polycrystal is assumed to be given. At this level, we
   adopt a Fourier model of heat conduction which utilizes values of
   thermal conductivity obtained at the lower scale. The mechanical
   response of the grains is modeled as elastic and anisotropic. The
   capabilities of the model are demonstrated through a series of examples,
   which highlight the potential of our approach for designing materials
   with improved thermomechanical response. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study involves an investigation of the impact of the various levels
   of atmospheric dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) treatment on the
   surface of eucalyptus fibers at different levels of beating with the
   objective of enhancing paper strength properties. The DBD treatment led
   to significant improvements in wet-strength tensile properties,
   increasing them by 2\%-112\%, as a function of the dosage of atmospheric
   plasma applied. Also, using controlled dosages of the DBD treatment,
   dry-strength tensile could be improved, reaching a 58\% increase. In
   addition, non-beaten samples showed greater increases in strength
   properties than the beaten samples. Moreover, the acid surface content
   was unaltered by the DBD treatment, perhaps due to over-oxidation and
   generation of low molecular weight species that are easily removed by
   washing with water. Furthermore, increases in wettability could be
   observed for specific DBD dosage of treatments. Atomic force microscopy
   images of the treated handsheets showed that DBD treatment results in
   surface smoothing of the fibers. In conclusion, DBD treatment was shown
   to be an effective approach for eucalyptus fiber modification,
   especially in terms of enhancement of wet-strength properties.}},

Abstract = {{Many biomedical applications necessitate a targeted intracellular
   delivery of the nanomaterial to specific cells. Therefore, a
   non-invasive and reliable imaging tool is required to detect both the
   delivery and cellular endocytosis of the nanoparticles. Herein, we
   demonstrate that magneto-photo-acoustic (MPA) imaging can be used to
   monitor the delivery and to identify endocytosis of magnetic and
   optically absorbing nanoparticles. The relationship between
   photoacoustic (PA) and magneto-motive ultrasound (MMUS) signals from the
   in vitro samples were analyzed to identify the delivery and endocytosis
   of nanoparticles. The results indicated that during the delivery of
   nanoparticles to the vicinity of the cells, both PA and MMUS signals are
   almost linearly proportional. However, accumulation of nanoparticles
   within the cells leads to nonlinear MMUS-PA relationship, due to
   non-linear MMUS signal amplification. Therefore, through longitudinal
   MPA imaging, it is possible to monitor the delivery of nanoparticles and
   identify the endocytosis of the nanoparticles by living cells. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The operation of small cells in TV white spaces (TVWSs) represents a
   coexistence challenge due to their unplanned deployment, their
   heterogeneous transmission technologies, and the scarcity of TVWS
   channels in crowded cities. Whenever a new small cell is switched on, a
   spectrum reassignment of already-deployed small cells can be used to
   avoid high interference and enable coexistence. However, as users may
   turn on and off their small cells at times, these reassignments may lead
   to frequent reconfigurations of already-deployed small cells. For this
   reason, a solution named small-cell dynamic deployment (SCDD) is
   designed to reassign TVWS channels only to the small cells in the
   neighborhood of the new cell. A channel allocation is proposed for SCDD
   formulated as an exact potential game. Its exact potential function is
   the sum of the average capacity of the small cells considered in the
   game. Results show that SCDD requires a few channel reconfigurations of
   already-deployed small cells because the channel assignment outside the
   neighborhood of the new cell remains unchanged. However, SCDD performs
   similarly to the case in which the allocation may modify the channels of
   all small cells already deployed.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic engineering is generally focused on static optimization of
   cells to maximize production of a desired product, though recently
   dynamic metabolic engineering has explored how metabolic programs can be
   varied over time to improve titer. However, these are not the only types
   of applications where metabolic engineering could make a significant
   impact. Here, we discuss a new conceptual framework, termed `'precision
   metabolic engineering,{''} involving the design and engineering of
   systems that make different products in response to different signals.
   Rather than focusing on maximizing titer, these types of applications
   typically have three hallmarks: sensing signals that determine the
   desired metabolic target, completely directing metabolic flux in
   response to those signals, and producing sharp responses at specific
   signal thresholds. In this review, we will first discuss and provide
   examples of precision metabolic engineering. We will then discuss each
   of these hallmarks and identify which existing metabolic engineering
   methods can be applied to accomplish those tasks, as well as some of
   their shortcomings. Ultimately, precise control of metabolic systems has
   the potential to enable a host of new metabolic engineering and
   synthetic biology applications for any problem where flexibility of
   response to an external signal could be useful. (C) 2015 International

Abstract = {{Micronutrient deficiencies, including zinc deficiency, are responsible
   for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. A key obstacle to
   allocating scarce treatment resources is the ability to measure
   population blood micronutrient status inexpensively and quickly enough
   to identify those who most need treatment. This paper develops a
   metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli to produce different
   colored pigments (violacein, lycopene, and beta-carotene) in response to
   different extracellular zinc levels, for eventual use in an inexpensive
   blood zinc diagnostic test. However, obtaining discrete color states in
   the carotenoid pathway required precise engineering of metabolism to
   prevent reaction at low zinc concentrations but allow complete reaction
   at higher concentrations, and all under the constraints of natural
   regulator limitations. Hence, the metabolic engineering challenge was
   not to improve titer, but to enable precise control of pathway state. A
   combination of gene dosage, post-transcriptional, and post-translational
   regulation was necessary to allow visible color change over
   physiologically relevant ranges representing a small fraction of the
   regulator's dynamic response range, with further tuning possible by
   modulation of precursor availability. As metabolic engineering expands
   its applications and develops more complex systems, tight control of
   system components will likely become increasingly necessary, and the
   approach presented here can be generalized to other natural sensing
   systems for precise control of pathway state. (C) 2015 International

   tasks, such as guiding a swarm of robots into a particular geometric
   configuration. In doing so, we define what it means to impose an HSI
   control structure on a multi-robot system. Control Lyapunov functions
   are used to establish feasibility for a user to achieve a particular
   geometric configuration with a multi-robot system under some selected
   HSI control structure. Several examples of multi-robot systems with
   unique HSI control structures are provided to illustrated the use of
   CLFs to establish feasibility. Additionally, we also uses these examples

Abstract = {{Evanescent waves induced by thermal fluctuations can tunnel through
   nanoscale gap spacing, leading to super-Planckian thermal radiation.
   However, investigations of near-field thermal radiation of macroscopic
   objects have been limited to simple planar or effectively planar
   geometries until recently. Based on exact formulations including the
   scattering theory and Green's function method, patterning thin films
   into ID and 2D metasurfaces is found to increase the radiative heat flux
   by more than 1 order of magnitude in a certain range of thicknesses. The
   underlying mechanism of this counterintuitive phenomenon lies in the
   excitation of hyperbolic modes supporting high local density of states
   for broad frequency and k-space regimes. The radiative heat flux of a 2D
   metasurface increases monotonically with the thickness, while the heat
   flux of a ID metasurface is not so sensitive to the thickness and is
   surprisingly higher than that of its 2D counterparts. The stark
   difference is attributed to the rapid-decay surface modes supported by a
   ID metasurface in addition to the slow-decay hyperbolic modes.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon is functionalized by different treatments with sulfuric
   acid and hot liquid water and used as catalyst for the hydrolysis of
   cellobiose in a continuously operated fixed bed reactor.
   Characterization results reveal that the chemically treated materials
   are more disordered with a lower degree of graphitization, while
   adsorption isotherms demonstrate that van der Waals forces dominate the
   interaction between carbohydrates and the surface of catalysts. All
   catalysts are stable during the hydrolysis of cellobiose under flow
   conditions. Carbon catalysts with a limited fraction of sulfonic acid
   groups exhibit moderate cellobiose conversion but a higher and sustained
   glucose selectivity. The high selectivity is attributed to a higher
   fraction of weak acid sites, where degradation of glucose only occurs to
   a limited extent due to less accessibility and competitive adsorption
   with cellobiose. Furthermore, the strong sulfonic acid groups are more
   accessible for degradation reactions to occur. In contrast, the catalyst
   with a higher fraction of sulfonic acid groups shows increased
   cellobiose conversion but decreased glucose selectivity because glucose
   monomers can be converted to degradation products at these sites.}},

Abstract = {{A key step in conversion of cellulosic biomass into sustainable fuels
   and chemicals is thermochemical pretreatment to reduce plant cell wall
   recalcitrance. Obtaining an improved understanding of the fundamental
   chemistry of lignin, the most recalcitrant component of biomass, during
   pretreatment is critical to the continued development of renewable
   biofuel production. To examine the intrinsic chemistry of lignin during
   dilute acid pretreatment (DAP), lignin was isolated from poplar and
   switchgrass using a cellulolytic enzyme system and then treated under
   DAP conditions. Our results highlight that lignin is subjected to
   depolymerization reactions within the first 2 min of dilute acid
   pretreatment and these changes are accompanied by increased generation
   of aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin. This is followed by
   a competing set of depolymerization and repolymerization reactions that
   lead to a decrease in the content of guaiacyl lignin units and an
   increase in condensed lignin units as the reaction residence time is
   extended beyond 5 min. A detailed comparison of changes in functional
   groups and molecular weights of cellulolytic enzyme lignins demonstrated
   different structural parameters, related to the recalcitrant properties
   of lignin, are altered during DAP conditions.}},
