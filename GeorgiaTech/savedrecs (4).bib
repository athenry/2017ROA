Abstract = {{Studies investigating passivation behaviour and corrosion resistance in
   simulated alkaline environments have typically been conducted in
   solutions containing sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH)
   and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)), with limited study of the effect of
   sulfates (SO42-). These sulfates are known to be present in the pore
   solution of materials like Portland cement-based concrete and may also
   ingress by the exposure to sulfate-rich environments. This study
   investigates the passivation behaviour and potentiodynamic polarisation
   behaviour of a high-strength carbon steel and high-strength stainless
   steels (austenitic and duplex) in saturated calcium hydroxide solutions
   containing up to 2000 ppm SO42-. Results indicate a negligible impact on
   the passivation behaviours of single-phase carbon steel and austenitic
   stainless steels. However, in duplex stainless steels, 1000 ppm of SO42-
   promotes passivation, whereas higher concentrations of 2000 ppm inhibit
   passivation. Additional research is necessary to correlate the altered
   passivation behaviour resulting from the presence of SO42- with
   chloride-induced corrosion resistance.}},

Title = {{Polarization-Insensitive Remote Access Unit for Radio-Over-Fiber Mobile
   Fronthaul System by Reusing Polarization Orthogonal Light Waves}},
Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the complexity and cost of remote access units (RAUs),
   colorless transport architecture is preferred in a wavelength-division
   multiplexing (WDM) system. The wavelength-reuse technique is commonly
   adopted to realize colorless RAUs. However, in traditional approaches,
   RAUs employ crystal-based Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) to modulate the
   distributed carriers. Hence, polarization tracking systems are necessary
   to align the polarization state of the distributed carriers with the MZM
   principal axis. This increases the cost of the RAUs. In this paper, a
   full-duplex millimeter-wave (MMW) radio-over-fiber (RoF) access
   architecture employing polarization-insensitive RAUs is proposed. In our
   proposed RAUs, the upstream signals are generated using
   polarization-orthogonal lights, and the performance of the upstream
   signals is independent of the polarization state of the MZM input
   lights. The proposed system is mathematically formulated and
   experimentally demonstrated. The 1.2-Gb/s quadrature phase-shift keying
   (QPSK) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) downstream
   signal at the 60-GHz band and 5-Gb/s on-off keying (OOK)
   polarization-insensitive upstream signal over a 15-km standard
   single-mode fiber (SSMF) are demonstrated. In our results, a
   polarization insensitive RAU is successfully obtained. The power penalty
   resulting from the interference of downstream signal is about 0.4 and
   0.6 dB with a bit error rate (BER) of 10(-9) in back-to-back and 15-km
   fiber transmission, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Systems of motile microscopic particles can exhibit behaviors that
   resemble those of living microorganisms, including cooperative motion,
   self-organization, and adaptability to changing environments. Using
   mesoscale computational modeling, we design synthetic microswimmers and
   microcapsules that undergo controllable, self-propelled motion in
   solution. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels are used to actuate the
   microswimmers and to enable their navigation and chemotaxing behavior.
   The self-propelled motion of microcapsules on solid surfaces is achieved
   by the release of encapsulated solutes that alter the surface
   adhesiveness. These signaling solutes also enable interactions among
   multiple microcapsules that lead to complex, cooperative behavior. Our
   findings provide guidelines for creating microscopic devices and
   machines able to autonomously move and mimic the communication and
   chemotaxis of biological microorganisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Since vision-based sensors typically cannot directly measure the
   relative linear and angular velocities between two spacecraft, it is
   useful to develop attitude-and position-tracking controllers-namely,
   pose-tracking controllers-that do not require such measurements. Using
   dual quaternions and based on an existing attitude-only tracking
   controller, a pose-tracking controller that does not require relative
   linear-or angular-velocity measurements is developed in this paper.
   Compared to the existing literature, this velocity-free pose-tracking
   controller guarantees that the pose of the chaser spacecraft will
   converge to the desired pose independent of the initial state, even if
   the reference motion is not sufficiently exciting. In addition, the
   convergence region does not depend on the gains chosen by the user. The
   velocity-free controller is verified and compared with a
   velocity-feedback controller through two simulations. In particular, the
   proposed velocity-free controller is compared qualitatively and
   quantitatively with a velocity-feedback controller and an extended
   Kalman filter using a relatively realistic satellite proximity-operation
   scenario.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{800-810}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that intelligibility can be improved for cochlear
   implant (CI) recipients with the ideal binary mask (IBM). In realistic
   scenarios where prior information is unavailable, however, the IBM must
   be estimated, and these estimations will inevitably contain errors.
   Although the effects of both unstructured and structured binary mask
   errors have been investigated with normal-hearing (NH) listeners, they
   have not been investigated with CI recipients. This study assesses these
   effects with CI recipients using masks that have been generated
   systematically with a statistical model. The results demonstrate that
   clustering of mask errors substantially decreases the tolerance of
   errors, that incorrectly removing target-dominated regions can be as
   detrimental to intelligibility as incorrectly adding
   interferer-dominated regions, and that the individual tolerances of the
   different types of errors can change when both are present. These trends
   follow those of NH listeners. However, analysis with a mixed effects
   model suggests that CI recipients tend to be less tolerant than NH
   listeners to mask errors in most conditions, at least with respect to
   the testing methods in each of the studies. This study clearly
   demonstrates that structure influences the tolerance of errors and
   therefore should be considered when analyzing binary-masking algorithms.

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen growing adoption of wireless structural sensor
   nodes that can significantly reduce the cost and installation effort of
   a structural health monitoring system. While previous wireless sensor
   development has mainly focused upon dynamic and vibration measurements
   at lower frequency domains, in this study, a new wireless ultrasonic
   sensing node capable of megahertz excitation and sampling is proposed.
   In addition to presenting the design of the wireless ultrasonic sensing
   node, experimental notch test and fatigue test of a dog-bone specimen
   are described in this article. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the ultrasonic characteristics of surface cracks can be identified in
   both scenarios with the proposed wireless sensor node. Furthermore, a
   signal processing procedure is proposed to obtain an accurate estimation
   of the ultrasonic signal amplitude, which can be a key indicator for
   crack identification. The procedure involves signal reconstruction with
   the cardinal sine function and envelope detection using discrete Hilbert
   transform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the feasibility of a real-time active matching
   circuit (MC) for wireless power transfer applications, especially for
   biomedical systems. One prototype of low-cost real-time automatic MC,
   utilizing a variable circuit topology, including discrete passives and
   p-i-n diodes, has been implemented and the principle has been verified
   by measurements. One genetic algorithm was introduced to optimize the
   design over a wide range of impedances to match. As a result of
   preliminary operation verification tests, the proposed real-time MC
   system results in improving the transfer coefficient in the range of
   10-16-cm coil separation distance a maximum of 3.2 dB automatically in
   about 64 ms. Similar performance improvement results were observed in
   additional tests under misaligned conditions, as well as for
   nonsymmetrical Tx-Rx coil configurations further verifying the potential
   applicability of the proposed system to practical biomedical devices.}},

Abstract = {{The use of MIMO technology has yielded high capacity in commercial
   wireless systems. However, a major issue of MIMO systems is that the
   channel capacity is highly dependent on the correlation between antenna
   elements. Therefore, multi-polarized antennas have been implemented in
   MIMO systems to reduce the antenna correlation and realize compact
   devices. To better understand the performance of multi-polarized
   antennas as compared to their uni-polarized counterparts in MIMO
   transmission, polarized channel modeling is necessary. This article
   presents an overview of polarized channel modeling. We compare different
   multi-polarized MIMO models and give some tips for choosing proper MIMO
   systems. In addition, some open problems are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Software implementations of thermodynamic property routines for
   ammonia-water mixtures are developed for refrigeration and
   air-conditioning applications. Saturation correlations are employed to
   identify single-phase state points, yielding up to a 5-fold reduction in
   property evaluation time. A run-time database of previously evaluated
   state points is implemented to improve initial guesses for iterative
   property evaluation, reducing property evaluation time by 45\% in a
   representative study. The property routines are implemented in a
   standalone program and as a compiled routine for use in MATLAB r and
   Simulink r. Both implementations perform property evaluations
   significantly faster than existing software packages. Program
   performance is measured on a 2.2 GHz machine, and average individual
   state point evaluation times were found to range from 50 to 930 mu s,
   depending on the provided input properties. Additionally, a segmented,
   transient, ammonia-water absorber model is developed in Simulinko to
   assess the use of the property routines for practical engineering
   calculations. The proposed computational techniques can be applied to
   accelerate property evaluations for other mixtures. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The cutting plane approach to finding minimum-cost perfect matchings has
   been discussed by several authors over past decades. Its convergence has
   been an open question. We develop a cutting plane algorithm that
   converges in polynomial-time using only Edmonds' blossom inequalities,
   and which maintains half-integral intermediate LP solutions supported by
   a disjoint union of odd cycles and edges. Our main insight is a method
   to retain only a subset of the previously added cutting planes based on
   their dual values. This allows us to quickly find violated blossom
   inequalities and argue convergence by tracking the number of odd cycles
   in the support of intermediate solutions.}},

Title = {{Capacitated Vehicle Routing with Nonuniform Speeds}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{318-331}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) involves distributing
   identical items from a depot to a set of demand locations using a single
   capacitated vehicle. We introduce the heterogeneous capacitated vehicle
   routing problem, a generalization of CVRP to the setting of multiple
   vehicles having nonuniform speeds, and present for it a constant-factor
   approximation algorithm.
   Our main contribution is an approximation algorithm for the
   heterogeneous traveling salesman problem, which is the special case of
   heterogeneous CVRP with uncapacitated vehicles. Given a metric denoting
   distances between vertices, a depot r containing k vehicles having
   respective speeds \{lambda(i)\}(i=1)(k), the objective in heterogeneous
   TSP is to find a tour for each vehicle (starting and ending at r) so
   that every vertex is covered in some tour and the maximum completion
   time is minimized; the completion time of a vehicle is the distance
   traveled divided by its speed.
   Our algorithm relies on a new approximate minimum spanning tree
   construction called Level-Prim, which is related to but different from
   Light Approximate Shortest-path Trees. We also extend the widely used
   tour-splitting technique to nonuniform speeds, using ideas from the
   2-approximation algorithm for scheduling in unrelated machines.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new variational principle in finite elastostatics
   applicable to arbitrary elastic solids that may contain constitutively
   rigid spatial domains (e. g., rigid inclusions). The basic idea consists
   in describing the constitutive rigid behavior of a given spatial domain
   as a set of kinematic constraints over the boundary of the domain. From
   a computational perspective, the proposed formulation is shown to reduce
   to a set of algebraic constraints that can be implemented efficiently in
   terms of both single-field and mixed finite elements of arbitrary order.
   For demonstration purposes, applications of the proposed
   rigid-body-constraint formulation are illustrated within the context of
   elastomers, reinforced with periodic and random distributions of rigid
   filler particles, undergoing finite deformations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design methodology for RF power transmission to
   millimeter-sized implantable biomedical devices. The optimal operating
   frequency and coil geometries are found such that power transfer
   efficiency (PTE) and tissue-loss-constrained allowed power are
   maximized. We define receiver power reception susceptibility (Rx-PRS)
   and transmitter figure of merit (Tx-FoM) such that their multiplication
   yields the PTE. Rx-PRS and Tx-FoM define the roles of the Rx and Tx in
   the PTE, respectively. First, the optimal Rx coil geometry and operating
   frequency range are identified such that the Rx-PRS is maximized for
   given implant constraints. Since the Rx is very small and has lesser
   design freedom than the Tx, the overall operating frequency is
   restricted mainly by the Rx. Rx-PRS identifies such operating frequency
   constraint imposed by the Rx. Secondly, the Tx coil geometry is selected
   such that the Tx-FoM is maximized under the frequency constraint at
   which the Rx-PRS was saturated. This aligns the target frequency range
   of Tx optimization with the frequency range at which Rx performance is
   high, resulting in the maximum PTE. Finally, we have found that even in
   the frequency range at which the PTE is relatively flat, the tissue loss
   per unit delivered power can be significantly different for each
   frequency. The Rx-PRS can predict the frequency range at which the
   tissue loss per unit delivered power is minimized while PTE is
   maintained high. In this way, frequency adjustment for the PTE and
   tissue-loss-constrained allowed power is realized by characterizing the
   Rx-PRS. The design procedure was verified through full-wave
   electromagnetic field simulations and measurements using de-embedding
   method. A prototype implant, 1 mm in diameter, achieved PTE of 0.56\%
   (22.5 dB) and power delivered to load (PDL) was 224 mu W at 200 MHz with
   12 mm Tx-to-Rx separation in the tissue environment.}},

Abstract = {{A triple-loop wireless power transmission (WPT) system equipped with
   closed-loop global power control, adaptive transmitter (Tx) resonance
   compensation (TRC), and automatic receiver (Rx) resonance tuning (ART)
   is presented. This system not only opposes coupling and load variations
   but also compensates for changes in the environment surrounding the
   inductive link to enhance power transfer efficiency (PTE) in
   applications such as implantable medical devices (IMDs). The Tx was
   built around a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) reader, operating at 13.56 MHz. A local Tx loop
   finds the optimal capacitance in parallel with the Tx coil by adjusting
   a varactor. A global power control loop maintains the received power at
   a desired level in the presence of changes in coupling distance, coil
   misalignments, and loading. Moreover, a local Rx loop is implemented
   inside a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) to avoid PTE
   degradation due to the Rx coil surrounding environment and process
   variations. The PMIC was fabricated in a 0.35-pm 4M2P standard CMOS
   process with 2.54 mm(2) active area. Measurement results show that the
   proposed triple-loop system improves the overall PTE by up to 10.5\% and
   4.7\% compared to a similar open- and single closed-loop system,
   respectively, at nominal coil distance of 2 cm. The added TRC and ART
   loops contribute 2.3\% and 1.4\% to the overall PTE of 13.5\%,
   respectively. This is the first WPT system to include three loops to
   dynamically compensate for environment and circuit variations and
   improve the overall power efficiency all the way from the driver output
   in Tx to the load in Rx.}},

   combines realistic modeling of the medium and write/read processes,

Abstract = {{The potential benefits of using human resources efficiently in the
   service sector constitute an incentive for decision makers in this
   industry to intelligently manage the work shifts of their employees,
   especially those dealing directly with customers. In the long term, they
   should attempt to find the right balance between employing as few labor
   resources as possible and keeping a high level of service. In the short
   run (e.g., 1 week), however, contracted staff levels cannot be adjusted,
   and management efforts thus focus on the efficient assignment of shifts
   and activities to each employee. This article proposes a mixed integer
   program model that solves the short-term multi-skilled workforce tour
   scheduling problem, enabling decision makers to simultaneously design
   workers' shifts and days off, assign activities to shifts and assign
   those to employees so as to maximize and balance coverage of a firm's
   demand for on-duty staff across multiple activities. Our model is simple
   enough to be solved with a commercial MIP solver calibrated by default
   without recurring to complex methodologies, such as extended
   reformulations and exact and/or heuristic column generation subroutines.
   A wide computational testing over 1000 randomly generated instances
   suggests that the model's solution times are compatible with daily use
   and that multi-skilling is a significant source of labor flexibility to
   improve coverage of labor requirements, in particular when such
   requirements are negatively correlated and part-time workers are a
   scarce resource.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the feasibility of an error-free switching of two
   nanomagnets coupled via their dipolar fields by applying a spin current
   to one of them is presented. It is demonstrated that the dynamic nature
   of dipolar interaction between the nanomagnets may cause the
   magnetization of the second magnet to precess back to its original state
   despite having crossed the free-axis equatorial plane during the
   transient phase. This non-reversal is very different than the purely
   successful or unsuccessful switchings noted in other reversal analyses
   presented in the literature and, in this paper, is referred to as a
   dipolar switching glitch. The dynamic dipolar coupling between
   nanomagnets creates temporary titled precessional trajectories pushing
   the magnetization of the nanomagnet into high-energy states. Relaxation
   from these high-energy positions leads to fast, but quasi-random
   switching behavior. The maximum separation between the magnets for
   perfect coupling has been quantified as a function of the magnet planar
   dimensions. It is also shown that the simpler models that do not
   consider the mutual coupling between the two magnets underestimate the
   maximum allowed separation between the two magnets and, as such, are too
   conservative.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the development of an optical flow visualization method for
   resolving the flow velocity vector field in lymphatic vessels in vitro.
   The aim is to develop an experimental protocol for accurately estimating
   flow parameters, such as flow rate and shear stresses, with high spatial
   and temporal resolution. Previous studies in situ have relied on
   lymphocytes as tracers, but their low density resulted in a reduced
   spatial resolution whereas the assumption that the flow was fully
   developed in order to determine the flow parameters of interest may not
   be valid, especially in the vicinity of the valves, where the flow is
   undoubtedly more complex. To overcome these issues, we have applied the
   time-resolved microparticle image velocimetry (mu-PIV) technique, a
   well-established method that can provide increased spatial and temporal
   resolution that this transient flow demands. To that end, we have
   developed a custom light source, utilizing high-power light-emitting
   diodes, and associated control and image processing software. This paper
   reports the performance of the system and the results of a series of
   preliminary experiments performed on vessels isolated from rat
   mesenteries, demonstrating, for the first time, the successful
   application of the mu-PIV technique in these vessels. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{Cyclical industrial networks are becoming highly desirable for their
   efficient use of resources and capital. Progress toward this ideal can
   be enhanced by mimicking the structure of naturally sustainable
   ecological food webs (FWs). The structures of cyclic industrial
   networks, sometimes known as eco-industrial parks (EIPs), are compared
   to FWs using a variety of important structural ecological parameters.
   This comparison uses a comprehensive data set of 144 FWs that provides a
   more ecologically correct understanding of how FWs are organized than
   previous efforts. In conjunction, an expanded data set of 48 EIPs gives
   new insights into similarities and differences between the two network
   types. The new information shows that, at best, current EIPs are most
   similar to those FWs that lack the components that create a biologically
   desirable cyclical structure. We propose that FWs collected from 1993
   onward should be used in comparisons with EIPs, given that these
   networks are much more likely to include important network functions
   that directly affect the structure. We also propose that the metrics
   used in an ecological analysis of EIPs be calculated from an FW matrix,
   as opposed to a community matrix, which, to this point, has been widely
   used. These new insights into the design of ecologically inspired
   industrial networks clarify the path toward superior material and energy
   cycling for environmental and financial success.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology for the accurate and efficient determination of
   steady-state thermal-hydraulic parameters for prismatic high-temperature
   gas reactors is developed. Whole-core steady-state temperature,
   pressure, and mass flow distributions are determined for the conceptual
   MHTGR-350 {[}Modular High Temperature Gas Reactor] reactor design and
   also for a range of values of the important parameters. Full-core
   three-dimensional heat conduction calculations are performed at the
   individual fuel pin and lattice assembly block levels. A simplified
   one-dimensional fluid model is developed to predict convective heat
   removal rates from solid core nodes. Downstream fluid properties are
   determined by performing a channel energy balance along the axial node
   length. To establish flow distribution, channel exit pressures are
   compared, and inlet mass flows are adjusted until a uniform outlet
   pressure is reached. Bypass gaps between assembly blocks as well as
   coolant channels are modeled. Finite volume discretization of energy and
   momentum conservation equations are formulated and explicitly integrated
   in time. Iterations are peiformed until all local core temperatures
   stabilize and global convective heat removal matches heat generation.
   Whole-core steady-state, thermal-hydraulic results are presented for
   various axial power and uniform radial power configurations. For all
   cases, peak temperatures were below expected normal operational limits
   for TRISO fuels. Bottom peaked axial power shapes had the highest peak
   temperatures but the lowest average temperatures. Different reactor
   designs with increased core inlet temperatures, reduced flow rates, or
   higher-power-density fuels could however challenge temperature limits.
   Partial assembly hydrodynamic and temperature results compared favorably
   with those available in the literature for similar analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Polypropylene (PP) with high melt flow index (MFI) or low molecular
   weight, although desired in melt spinning for enhanced productivity, is
   difficult to be spun into high-strength fiber using the standard process
   where extensive jet stretching is applied. In this work, a processing
   route involving minimal jet stretch has been explored. A two-stage hot
   drawing procedure in the solid state was found to be suitable for
   producing high-strength fiber from low-molecular-weight PP with an
   ultrahigh MFI of 115 g/10 min. Fibers produced achieve a maximum tensile
   strength and Young's modulus of approximately 600 MPa and 12 GPa,
   respectively. The melt temperature of the fiber reached 170.8 degrees C,
   approximately 5 degrees C higher than that of the original resin.
   Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) study shows that the stable
   alpha-monoclinic crystalline structure is developed during the drawing
   process. A well-oriented crystalline structure along the fiber axis is
   generated, having a crystalline orientation factor as high as 0.84. (C)

Abstract = {{The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonistic activities of hydroxylated
   polychlorinated biphenyls (HO-PCBs) were recently characterised. To
   further explore the interactions between HO-PCBs and the GR, and to
   elucidate structural characteristics that influence the GR antagonistic
   activity of HO-PCBs, molecular docking and three-dimensional
   quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies were
   performed. Comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA)
   was performed using both ligand- and receptor-based alignment schemes.
   Results generated from the receptor-based model were found to be more
   satisfactory, with q(2) of 0.632 and r(2) of 0.931 compared with those
   from the ligand-based model. Some internal validation strategies (e.g.
   cross-validation analysis, bootstrapping analysis and Y-randomisation)
   and an external validation method were used respectively to further
   assess the stability and predictive ability of the derived model.
   Graphical interpretation of the model provided some insights into the
   structural features that affected the GR antagonistic activity of
   HO-PCBs. Molecular docking studies revealed that some key residues were
   critical for ligand-receptor interactions by forming hydrogen bonds
   (Glu540) and hydrophobic interactions with ligands (Ile539, Val543 and
   Trp577). Although CoMSIA sometimes depends on the alignment of the
   molecules, the information provided is beneficial for predicting the GR
   antagonistic activities of HO-PCB homologues and is helpful for
   understanding the binding mechanisms of HO-PCBs to GR.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy at a high altitude is far more stable and stronger than that

   to the current generation by a coupled effect of contact electrification

   the structure/material parameters of the WTENG-flag to improve the power
   output. This 2D WTENG-flag can also be stacked in parallel connections
   in many layers for a linearly increased output. Finally, a self-powered
   high-altitude platform with temperature/humidity
   sensing/telecommunicating capability is demonstrated with the WTENG-flag

Abstract = {{The development of camouflage methods, often through a general
   resemblance to the background, has recently become a subject of intense
   research. However, an artificial, active camouflage that provides fast
   response to color change in the full-visible range for rapid background
   matching remains a daunting challenge. To this end, we report a method,
   based on the combination of bimetallic nanodot arrays and
   electrochemical bias, to allow for plasmonic modulation. Importantly,
   our approach permits real-time light manipulation readily matchable to
   the color setting in a given environment. We utilize this capability to
   fabricate a biomimetic mechanical chameleon and an active matrix display
   with dynamic color rendering covering almost the entire visible region.}},

Title = {{Excluding Contact Electrification in Surface Potential Measurement Using
   Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a characterization method that
   could image surface potentials of materials at the nanoscale, has
   extensive applications in characterizing the electric and electronic
   properties of metal, semiconductor, and insulator materials. However, it
   requires deep understanding of the physics of the measuring process and
   being able to rule out factors that may cause artifacts to obtain
   accurate results. In the most commonly used dual-pass KPFM, the probe
   works in tapping mode to obtain surface topography information in a
   first pass before lifting to a certain height to measure the surface
   potential. In this paper, we have demonstrated that the tapping-mode
   topography scan pass during the typical dual-pass KPFM measurement may
   trigger contact electrification between the probe and the sample, which
   leads to a charged sample surface and thus can introduce a significant
   error to the surface potential measurement. Contact electrification will
   happen when the probe enters into the repulsive force regime of a tip
   sample interaction, and this can be detected by the phase shift of the
   probe vibration. In addition, the influences of scanning parameters,
   sample properties, and the probe's attributes have also been examined,
   in which lower free cantilever vibration amplitude, larger adhesion
   between the probe tip and the sample, and lower cantilever spring
   constant of the probe are less likely to trigger contact
   electrification. Finally, we have put forward a guideline to rationally
   decouple contact electrification from the surface potential measurement.
   They are decreasing the free amplitude, increasing the set-point
   amplitude, and using probes with a lower spring constant.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of Ag@Au concave cuboctahedra by titrating
   aqueous HAuCl4 into a suspension of Ag cuboctahedra in the presence of
   ascorbic add (AA), NaOH, and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PIT) at room
   temperature. Initially, the Au atoms derived from the reduction of Au3+
   by AA are conformally deposited on the entire surface of a Ag
   cuboctahedron. Upon the formation of a complete Au shell, however, the
   subsequently formed Au atoms are preferentially deposited onto the
   Au\{100\} facets, resulting in the formation of a Ag@Au cuboctahedron
   with concave structures at the sites of \{111\} facets. The concave
   cuboctahedra embrace excellent SERS activity that is more than 70-fold
   stronger than that of the original Ag cuboctahedra at an excitation
   wavelength of 785 nm. The concave cuboctahedra also exhibit remarkable
   stability in the presence of an oxidant such as H2O2 because of the
   protection by a complete Au shell. These two unique attributes enable in
   situ SERS monitoring of the reduction of 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP) to
   4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) by NaBH4 through a 4,4'-dimercaptoazobenzene
   (trans-DMAB) intermediate and the subsequent oxidation of 4 -ATP back to
   trans-DMAB upon the introduction of H2O2.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to create a synergistic effect of nanostructure engineering

   Herein, we judiciously crafted ZnFe2O4/carbon nanocomposites composed of

   nanospheres in conjunction with the formation of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles
   through the thermal decomposition of ZnFe2O4 precursors incorporated

Abstract = {{Silver-based ceramic composite electrodes are expected to be widely
   applied in medium- or low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),
   SOFCs operated on carbon-containing fuels, and solid oxide electrolysis
   cells (SOECs). To optimize the composition of a silver-based ceramic
   composite electrode, the performances of Ag-YSZ (yttrium-stabilized
   zirconia) and Ag-GDC (gadolinium doped ceria) are investigated. First,
   they are used as electrode materials to make symmetric electrodes on a
   YSZ electrolyte, to which impedance spectra are measured in an ambient
   atmosphere to evaluate their feasibility as cathode materials. It was
   found that that Ag-YSZ reaches the lowest polarization resistance when
   the content of Ag is 65\% (w, mass fraction), while for Ag-GDC, the
   value is 70\% (w). The Ag-YSZ and Ag-GDC with the lowest polarization
   resistance are used as electrode materials to make SOFC single cells
   whose electrochemical performances are tested. The polarization
   resistance of an anode of the SOFCs can be obtained by subtracting the
   cathode polarization resistance from the overall SOFC polarization
   resistance. Both the polarization resistance result and the output
   performance show that the performance of Ag-GDC is superior to Ag-YSZ as
   an anode. In the present work, Ag-YSZ is more suitable as the cathode
   and the Ag-GDC as the anode. The present work provides not only useful
   data for Ag-based composite electrodes but also a method for measuring
   the polarization resistance of SOFC anodes.}},

Abstract = {{A keyword-sensitive language modeling framework for spoken keyword
   search (KWS) is proposed to combine the advantages of conventional
   keyword-filler based and large vocabulary continuous speech recognition
   (LVCSR) based KWS systems. The proposed framework allows keyword search
   systems to be flexible on keyword target settings as in the LVCSR-based
   keyword search. In low-resource scenarios it facilitates KWS with an
   ability to achieve high keyword detection accuracy as in the
   keyword-filler based systems and to attain a low false alarm rate
   inherent in the LVCSR-based systems. The proposed keyword-aware grammar
   is realized by incorporating keyword information to re-train and modify
   the language models used in LVCSR-based KWS. Experimental results, on
   the evalpart1 data of the IARPA Babel OpenKWS13 Vietnamese tasks,
   indicate that the proposed approach achieves a relative improvement,
   over the conventional LVCSR-based KWS systems, of the actual term
   weighted value for about 57 \% (from 0.2093 to 0.3287) and 20 \% (from
   0.4578 to 0.5486) on the limited-language-pack and full-language-pack

Abstract = {{We develop a novel and simple method for controlling the density and
   size of polyaniline (PANI) nanowires vertically grown on silicon
   substrate. The method is based on employing
   poly(styrene-block-4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) nanoporous array on
   Mn2O3 seed layer as template. The nanoporous template with Mn2O3 seed at
   the bottom of each nanopore could be achieved by PS-b-P4VP self-assemble
   on Mn2O3 seed layer and reconstruction in 1 wt\% HF methanol solution.
   Furthermore, PANI nanoparticles could be generated in each nanopore by
   oxidizing aniline with Mn2O3 seed at the bottom of nanopores. The PANI
   nanoparticles further grew to nanowires when ammonium peroxydisulfate
   (APS) was added to the reaction solution. Interestingly, the distance,
   arrangement and diameter of PANI nanowires were confined by the
   nanopores. Therefore, density- and size-controlled PANI nanowire arrays
   with vertical orientation were obtained. The techniques have significant
   potential application in nanoelectronic devices.}},

Title = {{The characteristics of brown carbon aerosol during winter in Beijing}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{355-364}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Brown carbon (i.e., light-absorbing organic carbon, or BrC) exerts
   important effects on the environment and on climate in particular. Based
   on spectrophotometric absorption measurements on extracts of bulk
   aerosol samples, this study investigated the characteristics of BrC
   during winter in Beijing, China. Organic compounds extractable by
   methanol contributed approximately 85\% to the organic carbon (OC) mass.
   Light absorption by the methanol extracts exhibited a strong wavelength
   dependence, with an average absorption Angstrom exponent of 7.10 (fitted
   between 310 and 450 nm). Normalizing the absorption coefficient (babs)
   measured at 365 nm to the extractable OC mass yielded an average mass
   absorption efficiency (MAE) of 1.45 m(2)/g for the methanol extracts.
   This study suggests that light absorption by BrC could be comparable
   with black carbon in the spectral range of near-ultraviolet light. Our
   results also indicate that BrC absorption and thus BrC radiative forcing
   could be largely underestimated when using water-soluble organic carbon
   (WSOC) as a surrogate for BrC. Compared to previous work relying only on
   WSOC, this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of BrC
   aerosol based on methanol extraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   post-processing spray images}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Moments-algorithm was developed to post-process images of sprays
   with the aim of characterizing the sprays' complex features (e.g.,
   trajectory, dispersions and dynamics) in terms of simple curves, which
   can be used for developing correlation models and design tools. To
   achieve this objective, the algorithm calculates the first moments of
   pixel intensity values in instantaneous images of the spray to determine
   its center-of-gravity (CG) trajectory (i.e., the spray density-weighted
   centerline trajectory). Thereafter, the second moments (i.e.,
   standard-deviations, sigma) of intensities are calculated to describe
   the dispersion of spray materials around the CG. After the instantaneous
   CG's and sigma's for the instantaneous images have been obtained, they
   are arithmetically averaged to produce the average spray trajectories
   and dispersions. Additionally, the second moments of instantaneous CG's
   are used to characterize the spray's fluctuation magnitude. The
   Moments-algorithm has three main advantages over threshold-based
   edge-tracking and other conventional post-processing approaches: (1) It
   simultaneously describes the spray's instantaneous and average
   trajectories, dispersions and fluctuations, instead of just the
   outer/inner-edges, (2) the use of moments to define these spray
   characteristics is more physically meaningful because they reflect the
   statistical distribution of droplets within the spray plume instead of
   relying on an artificially interpreted ``edge{''}, and (3) the use of
   moments decreases the uncertainties of the post-processed results
   because moments are mathematically defined and do not depend upon
   user-adjustments/interpretations.}},

Abstract = {{In order to compare the costs and the benefits of 2-D and 3-D integrated
   circuits (3-DICs) technologies, a compact simulation tool for 3-DIC
   system evaluation and design space exploration is presented. The
   simulator is implemented in the MATLAB, and is composed of several
   modules, including a compact 3-DIC wire-length distribution, a wire
   pitch and repeater insertion module, a 2-D and 3-DIC power supply noise
   estimation module, and a finite-difference thermal simulator. The
   simulator is validated against published data for several commercial 2-D
   processors at the 65-, 45-, and 32-nm nodes. In order to quantify the
   benefits of both 2-D and 3-D integration approaches, a 32-nm CPU core is
   modeled, and the impact of several technology parameters, including
   interlayer dielectric material, on-chip wire material, die thickness,
   and cooling solution, is explored. The results suggest that the 3-D
   integration may provide a significant power reduction for the 32-nm test
   case, but more aggressive cooling solutions must be employed to maintain
   the same clock frequency due to the increased areal power density of the
   3-D CPU.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the wire-tap channel model consisting of
   three users, namely, a transmitter, a legal receiver, and an
   eavesdropper, where the eavesdropper has possible unlimited centralized
   or distributed multiple antennas, while the legal user has just a single
   antenna. With this model, we study the realization of strict positive
   secrecy rate through Rayleigh flat fading channels using M-ary phase
   shift keying (PSK) and orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) based on
   channel reciprocal principle. We demonstrate that the information rate
   at the eavesdropper can be reduced to zero and a positive communication
   rate at the legal receiver can be realized if the transmitter employs a
   proper phase precoder based on the channel reciprocal, and uses OSTBC
   and M-ary PSK modulations for data transmissions. Application examples
   of space-time codes for positive secrecy rate are illustrated. As we
   have given the eavesdropper more capabilities than the legal receiver
   and thus captured a worst case scenario, any positive secrecy rate that
   is achieved serves as a lower bound on the secrecy capacity.}},

   through-silicon-vias (TSV) technology. Different TSV insertion methods
   were used and compared. A 20\% improvement in power consumption is
   observed in the 3D implementation compared with the 2D counterpart.
   Thanks to the vertical stacking dies, a 40\% footprint reduction is
   achieved in the 3D implementation. Two different integration topologies
   for 3D ADC and an ultrasound transducer arrays are considered and
   compared. Either the circuit dies are facing up, resulting in a
   face-to-face bonding between the transducer arrays and the three
   dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC), or the 3D IC dies are facing
   down, resulting a face-to-back connection. The simulation results show
   that the 3D face-up integration suppresses the TSV coupling noise to the
   analog input by around 10 dB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{While metal is the most common conducting constituent element in the
   fabrication of metamaterials, graphene provides another useful building
   block, that is, a truly two-dimensional conducting sheet whose
   conductivity can be controlled by doping. Here we report the
   experimental realization of a multilayer structure of alternating
   graphene and Al2O3 layers, a structure similar to the metal-dielectric
   multilayers commonly used in creating visible wavelength hyperbolic
   metamaterials. Chemical vapour deposited graphene rather than exfoliated
   or epitaxial graphene is used, because layer transfer methods are easily
   applied in fabrication. We employ a method of doping to increase the
   layer conductivity, and our analysis shows that the doped chemical
   vapour deposited graphene has good optical properties in the
   mid-infrared range. We therefore design the metamaterial for
   mid-infrared operation; our characterization with an infrared
   ellipsometer demonstrates that the metamaterial experiences an optical
   topological transition from elliptic to hyperbolic dispersion at a
   wavelength of 4.5 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing fundamental relationships between strain and work function
   (WF) in organic semiconductors is important not only for understanding
   electrical properties of organic thin films, which are subject to both
   intrinsic and extrinsic strains, but also for developing flexible
   electronic devices. Here we investigate tensile and compressive strain
   effects on the WF of rubrene single crystals. Mechanical strain induced
   by thermal expansion mismatch between the substrate and rubrene is
   quantified by X-ray diffraction. The corresponding WF change is measured
   by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. The WF of rubrene increases
   (decreases) significantly with in-plane tensile (compressive) strain,
   which agrees qualitatively with density functional theory calculations.
   An elastic-to-plastic transition, characterized by a steep rise of the
   WF, occurs at similar to B0.05\% tensile strain along the rubrene
   pi-stacking direction. The results provide the first concrete link
   between mechanical strain and WF of an organic semiconductor and have
   important implications for understanding the connection between
   structural and electronic disorder in soft organic electronic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The strength of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) near-field
   interactions scales in a wellknown, nearly universal manner. Here, we
   show that embedding resonators in an anisotropic dielectric with a large
   permittivity can substantially increase coupling strength. We
   experimentally demonstrate this effect with Si nanowires containing two
   phosphorus-doped segments. The near-field decay length scaling factor is
   extracted from in situ infrared spectral response measurements using the
   ``plasmon ruler{''} equation and found to be ca. 4-5 times larger than
   for the same resonators in isotropic vacuum or Si. Discrete dipole
   approximation calculations support the observed coupling behavior for
   nanowires and show how it is affected by the resonator geometry, carrier
   density, and embedding material (Si, Ge, GaAs, etc.). Our findings
   demonstrate that equivalent near-field interactions are achievable with
   a smaller total volume and/or at increased resonator spacing, offering
   new opportunities to engineer plasmon-based chemical sensors, catalysts,
   and waveguides.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is a serious
   skeletal complication associated with the long-term oral or intravenous
   use of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs). Here, we
   investigated the effects of an ionic cocktail prepared from
   water-soluble microfibrous borate glass on neutralizing the inhibitory
   effects of two heterocyclic N-BPs, risedronate or zoledronic acid, on
   osteoclastogenesis, apoptosis of differentiated osteoclasts and
   osteoclast function. Cell growth and proliferation assays were first
   performed on RAW 264.7 cells to optimize the concentrations of the ionic
   cocktail and N-BPs to be used for static cell culture. The
   pre-osteoclasts were then stimulated with RANKL to differentiate into
   osteoclasts. The effects of the ionic cocktail and N-BPs on osteoclast
   differentiation, apoptosis and function were subsequently examined using
   3 series of experiments conducted at the gene, protein, morphological
   and functional levels. After concentration optimization, the ionic
   cocktail was found to partially reverse N-BP-induced inhibition of
   osteoclastogenesis, stimulation of osteoclasts apoptosis and reduction
   of osteoclast resorptive activity. Ultrastructural examination of
   osteoclasts that had been exposed to either N-BP identified classical
   features of late apoptosis and secondary necrosis, while osteoclasts
   exposed simultaneously to the concentration-optimized ionic cocktail and
   N-BPs exhibited only signs of early apoptosis that were possibly
   reversible. Taken together, the results of the 4 series of experiments
   indicate that the ionic cocktail produced from dissolution of borate
   glass dressings has the potential to rescue the adverse effects of
   heterocyclic N-BPs on osteoclast differentiation and function. These
   results warrant further confirmation using dynamic cell culture and
   small animal BRONJ models.
   Statement of significance
   Long-term oral and intravenous use of nitrogen-containing
   bisphosphonates (N-BPs) may result in bisphosphonate-related
   osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) due to the suppression of normal bone
   turnover. There is no effective treatment for such a complication to
   date. This work reported the use of an ionic cocktail derived from
   water-soluble microfibrous borate glass to revert heterocyclic
   N-BP-induced inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, stimulation of
   osteoclasts apoptosis and reduction of osteoclasts resorption in static
   cell culture condition. This ionic cocktail may have the potential to be
   further developed into a new adjunctive treatment for BRONJ. (C) 2015

Title = {{A mechanistic study of the interaction of water-soluble borate glass

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{339-347}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Long-term oral and intravenous use of nitrogen-containing
   bisphosphonates (N-BPs) is associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw.
   Although N-BPs bind strongly to bone surfaces via non-covalent bonds, it
   is possible for extrinsic ions to dissociate bound N-BPs from
   mineralized bone by competitive desorption. Here, we investigate the
   effects and mechanism of using an ionic cocktail derived from borate
   bioactive glass for sequestration of heterocyclic N-BPs bound to
   apatite. By employing solid-state and solution-state analytical
   techniques, we confirmed that sequestration of N-BPs from
   bisphosphonate-bound apatite occurs in the presence of the
   borate-containing ionic cocktail. Simulations by density functional
   theory computations indicate that magnesium cation and borate anion are
   well within the extent of the risedronate or zoledronate anion to form
   precipitate complexes. The sequestration mechanism is due to the borate
   anion competing with bisphosphonates for similar electron-deficient
   sites on the apatite surface for binding. Thus, application of the
   borate-containing ionic cocktail represents a new topical lavage
   approach for removing apatite-bound heterocyclic N-BPs from exposed
   necrotic bone in bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.
   Statement of significance
   Long-term oral consumption and injections of nitrogen-containing
   bisphosphonates (N-BPs) may result in death of the jaw bone when there
   is traumatic injury to the bone tissues. To date, there is no effective
   treatment for such a condition. This work reported the use of an ionic
   cocktail derived from water-soluble borate glass microfibers to displace
   the most potent type of N-BPs that are bound strongly to the mineral
   component on bone surfaces. The mechanism responsible for such an effect
   has been identified to be cation-mediated complexation of borate anions
   with negatively-charged N-BPs, allowing them to be released from the
   mineral surface. This borate-containing cocktail may be developed into a
   novel topical rinse for removing mineral-bound N-BPs from exposed dead
   bone. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   improved bone formation around the implant. Little is known about how
   implant surface properties can affect immune cells that generate a wound
   healing microenvironment. The aim of our study was to examine the effect
   of surface modifications on macrophage activation and cytokine
   production. Macrophages were cultured on seven surfaces: tissue culture
   polystyrene (TCPS) control; hydrophobic and hydrophilic smooth Ti (PT
   and oxygen-plasma-treated (plasma) PT); hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   microrough Ti (SLA and plasma SLA), and hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   nano-and micro-rough Ti (aged modSLA and modSLA). Smooth Ti induced
   inflammatory macrophage (M1-like) activation, as indicated by increased
   levels of interleukins IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha. In contrast,
   hydrophilic rough titanium induced macrophage activation similar to the
   anti-inflammatory M2-like state, increasing levels of interleukins IL-4
   and IL-10. These results demonstrate that macrophages cultured on high
   surface wettability materials produce an anti-inflammatory
   microenvironment, and this property may be used to improve the healing
   response to biomaterials.
   Statement of significance
   Metals like titanium (Ti) are common in orthopaedics and dentistry due
   to their ability to integrate with surrounding tissue and good
   biocompatibility. Roughness- and wettability-increasing surface
   modifications promote osteogenic differentiation of stem cells on Ti.
   While these modifications increase production of osteoblastic factors
   and bone formation, little is known about their effect on immune cells.
   The initial host response to a biomaterial is controlled primarily by
   macrophages and the factors they secrete in response to the injury
   caused by surgery and the material cues. Here we demonstrate the effect
   of surface roughness and wettability on the activation and production of
   inflammatory factors by macrophages. Control of inflammation will inform
   the design of surface modification procedures to direct the immune
   response and enhance the success of implanted materials. (C) 2015 Acta

Title = {{Coarse-grained elastodynamics of fast moving dislocations}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{143-155}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The fundamental mechanism of dynamic plasticity in metallic materials
   subjected to shock loading remains unclear because it is difficult to
   obtain the precise information of individual fast moving dislocations in
   metals from the state-of-the-art experiments. In this work, the dynamics
   of sonic dislocations in anisotropic crystalline materials is explored
   through a concurrent atomistic-continuum modeling method. We make a
   first attempt to characterize the complexity of nonuniformly moving
   dislocations in anisotropic crystals from atomistic to microscale,
   including the energy intensities as well as the wavelengths of acoustic
   phonons emitted from sonic dislocations, and the velocity-dependent
   stress fluctuations around the core of nonuniformly moving dislocations.
   Instantaneous dislocation velocities and phonon drag effects on the
   dislocation motions are quantified and analyzed. Mach cones in a
   V-shaped pattern of the phonon wave-fronts are observed in the wake of
   the sonic dislocations. Analysis of simulation results based on a
   wavelet transform show that the faster a dislocation is moving, the
   longer the emitted phonon wavelength. The dislocation velocity drops
   dramatically with the occurrence of the interactions between
   dislocations and phonon waves reflected from the boundaries of
   specimens. The concurrent atomistic-continuum modeling framework is
   demonstrated to be the first multiscale method that explicitly treats
   the strong coupling between the long-range elastic fields away from the
   dislocation core, the highly nonlinear time-dependent stress field
   within the core, and the evolutions of the atomic scale dislocation core
   structures. As such, it is shown that this method is capable in
   predicting elastodynamics of dislocations in the presence of inertia
   effects associated with sonic dislocations in micron sized anisotropic
   crystalline materials from the atomic level, which is not directly
   accessible to the recent elastodynamic discrete dislocation model. (C)

   Poly(3-hexylthiophene) Blends for High Performance Flexible Organic
   Field Effect Transistors}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Decreased conjugated polymer regioregularity can provide for mechanical
   flexibility, which is favorable for the fabrication of flexible
   electronics; however, concomitant decreased thin-film crystallinity
   severely deteriorates charge transport performance. Here, the advantage
   of this inverse relationship has been taken to fabricate flexible
   organic field effect transistors using ultraviolet irradiated
   regioregular (RR) and regiorandom (RRa) poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
   blend thin-films as the device active layer. The blend films exhibit
   prominent charge carrier mobility up to 0.22 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Even when
   the RR-P3HT component comprises only a small proportion of the blend,
   vertical phase separation of the components ensures formation of
   effective charge transport pathways. The underlying mechanism is
   correlated to molecular self-assembly of RR-P3HT and its unfavorable
   intermolecular interactions with RRa-P3HT. Transistor performance is
   retained upon application of high external strain and bending 1000
   times. The top-gate architecture enables the dielectric to serve as a
   self-encapsulation layer to protect the underlying semiconductor from
   atmospheric oxygen and moisture, resulting in over 700 h ambient device
   stability. This facile blend approach is expected to be an alternative
   strategy for the fabrication of high performance flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
   U.S., and is a multifactorial disease that preferentially occurs in
   regions of the arterial tree exposed to disturbed blood flow. The
   detailed mechanisms by which d-flow induces atherosclerosis involve
   changes in the expression of genes, epigenetic patterns, and metabolites
   of multiple vascular cells, especially endothelial cells. This review
   presents an overview of endothelial mechanobiology and its relation to
   the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis with special reference to the
   anatomy of the artery and the underlying fluid mechanics, followed by a
   discussion of a variety of experimental models to study the role of
   fluid mechanics and atherosclerosis. Various in vitro and in vivo models
   to study the role of flow in endothelial biology and pathobiology are
   discussed in this review. Furthermore, strategies used for the global
   profiling of the genome, transcriptome, miR-nome, DNA methylome, and
   metabolome, as they are important to define the biological and
   pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis. These ``omics{''}
   approaches, especially those which derive data based on a single animal
   model, provide unprecedented opportunities to not only better understand
   the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis development in a holistic and
   integrative manner, but also to identify novel molecular and diagnostic
   targets. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many bioactive molecules have intracellular targets, but have difficulty
   crossing the cell membrane to reach those targets. To address this
   difficulty, we fabricated arrays of nanoneedles to gently and
   simultaneously puncture 10(5) cells and thereby provide transient
   pathways for transport of molecules into the cells. The nanoneedles were
   microfabricated by etching silicon to create arrays of nanoneedles
   measuring 12 mu m in height, tapering to a sharp tip less than 30 nm
   wide to facilitate puncture into cells and spaced 10 mu m apart in order
   to have at least one nanoneedle puncture each cell in a confluent
   monolayer. These nanoneedles were used for intracellular delivery in two
   ways: puncture loading, in which nanoneedle arrays were pressed into
   cell monolayers, and centrifuge loading, in which cells in suspension
   were spun down onto nanoneedle arrays. The effects on intracellular
   uptake and cell viability were determined as a function of nanoneedle
   length and sharpness, puncture force and duration, and molecular weight
   of the molecule delivered. Under optimal conditions, intracellular
   uptake was seen in approximately 50 \% of cells while maintaining high
   cell viability. Overall, this study provides a comparative analysis of
   intracellular delivery using nanoneedle arrays by two different loading
   methods over a range of operating parameters.}},

Title = {{Cross-Level Effects Between Neurophysiology and Communication During
   Team Training}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We investigated cross-level effects, which are concurrent
   changes across neural and cognitive-behavioral levels of analysis as
   teams interact, between neurophysiology and team communication variables
   under variations in team training.
   Background: When people work together as a team, they develop neural,
   cognitive, and behavioral patterns that they would not develop
   individually. It is currently unknown whether these patterns are
   associated with each other in the form of cross-level effects.
   Method: Team-level neurophysiology and latent semantic analysis
   communication data were collected from submarine teams in a training
   simulation. We analyzed whether (a) both neural and communication
   variables change together in response to changes in training segments
   (briefing, scenario, or debriefing), (b) neural and communication
   variables mutually discriminate teams of different experience levels,
   and (c) peak cross-correlations between neural and communication
   variables identify how the levels are linked.
   Results: Changes in training segment led to changes in both neural and
   communication variables, neural and communication variables mutually
   discriminated between teams of different experience levels, and peak
   cross-correlations indicated that changes in communication precede
   changes in neural patterns in more experienced teams.
   Conclusion: Cross-level effects suggest that teamwork is not reducible
   to a fundamental level of analysis and that training effects are spread
   out across neural and cognitive-behavioral levels of analysis.
   Cross-level effects are important to consider for theories of team
   performance and practical aspects of team training.
   Application: Cross-level effects suggest that measurements could be
   taken at one level (e.g., neural) to assess team experience (or skill)
   on another level (e.g., cognitive-behavioral).}},

Abstract = {{Transportation networks constitute a critical infrastructure enabling
   the transfers of passengers and goods, with a significant impact on the
   economy at different scales. Transportation modes, whether air, road, or
   rail, are intrinsically coupled through passenger transfers and are
   interdependent. The frequent occurrence of perturbations on one or
   several modes disrupts passengers' entire journeys, directly and through
   ripple effects. This paper provides a case report of the Asiana crash in
   San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on July 6, 2013, and its
   repercussions on the multimodal transportation network. It studies the
   resulting propagation of disturbances on the transportation
   infrastructure in the USA, particularly on the U.S. air transport
   network and the ground transportation in the Bay Area. The perturbation
   takes different forms and varies in scale and time frame: cancelations
   and delays snowball in the airspace, with up to 86\% of cancelations in
   the U.S. due to the SFO crash; highway traffic near the airport is
   impacted by congestion in previously not congested locations, with low
   speed and high delays on US 101; and transit passenger demand exhibits
   unusual traffic peaks in between airports in the Bay Area, with up to
   180 passengers more per hour between SFO and Oakland International
   Airport Bay Area Rapid Transit stations. This paper also investigated
   the effect of the crash on the social media Twitter. This paper, through
   a case study, aims at stressing the importance of further data-driven
   research on interdependent infrastructure networks. The end goal is to
   form the basis for optimization models behind providing more reliable
   passenger door-to-door journeys and improved transport network
   resilience.}},

Abstract = {{In designing organic materials for electronics applications,
   particularly for organic photovoltaics (OPV), the ionization potential
   (IP) of the donor and the electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor play
   key roles. This makes OPV design an appealing application for
   computational chemistry since IPs and EAs are readily calculable from
   most electronic structure methods. Unfortunately reliable, high-accuracy
   wave function methods, such as coupled cluster theory with single,
   double, and perturbative triples {[}CCSD(T)] in the complete basis set
   (CBS) limit are too expensive for routine applications to this problem
   for any but the smallest of systems. One solution is to calibrate
   approximate,. less computationally expensive methods against a database
   of high-accuracy IP/EA values; however, to our knowledge, no such
   database exists for systems related to OPV design. The present work is
   the first of a multipart study whose overarching goal is to determine
   which computational methods can be used to reliably compute IPs and EAs
   of electron acceptors. This part introduces a database of 24 known
   organic electron acceptors and provides high-accuracy vertical IP and EA
   values expected to be within +/- 0.03 eV of the true non-relativistic,
   vertical CCSD(T)/CBS limit. Convergence of IP and EA values toward the
   CBS limit is studied systematically for the Hartree-Fock, MP2
   correlation, and beyond-MP2 coupled cluster contributions to the focal
   point estimates.}},

Abstract = {{In a remarkable example of convergent evolution, we show that the
   zooplanktonic sea butterfly Limacina helicina `flies' underwater in the
   sameway that very small insects fly in the air. Both sea butterflies and
   flying insects stroke their wings in a characteristic figure-of-eight
   pattern to produce lift, and both generate extra lift by peeling their
   wings apart at the beginning of the power stroke (the well-known
   Weis-Fogh `clap-and-fling' mechanism). It is highly surprising to find a
   zooplankter `mimicking' insect flight as almost all zooplankton swim in
   this intermediate Reynolds number range (Re=10-100) by using their
   appendages as paddles rather than wings. The sea butterfly is also
   unique in that it accomplishes its insect-like figure-of-eight wing
   stroke by extreme rotation of its body (what we call `hyper-pitching'),
   a paradigm that has implications for micro aerial vehicle (MAV) design.
   No other animal, to our knowledge, pitches to this extent under normal
   locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering the surface structure of noble-metal nanocrystals offers an
   effective route to the development of catalysts or electrocatalysts with
   greatly enhanced activity. Here, we report the synthesis of Pt-based
   icosahedral nanocages whose surface is enclosed by both \{111\} facets
   and twin boundaries while the wall thickness can be made as thin as six
   atomic layers. The nanocages are derived from Pd@Pt-4.5L, icosahedra by
   selectively etching away the Pd in the core. During etching, the
   multiply twinned structure can be fully retained whereas the Pt atoms in
   the wall reconstruct to eliminate the corrugated structure built in the
   original Pt shell. The Pt-based icosahedral nanocages show a specific
   activity of 3.50 mA cm(-2) toward the oxygen reduction reaction, much
   greater than those of the Pt-based octahedral nanocages (1.98 mA cm(-2))
   and a state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.35 mA cm(-2)). After
   5000 cycles of accelerated durability test, the mass activity of the
   Pt-based icosahedral nanocages drops from 1.28 to 0.76 A mg(P nu)(-1)
   which is still about four times greater than that of the original Pt/C
   catalyst (0.19 A mg(Pt)(-1)).}},

   miniature system contains a virtual impactor and a quartz crystal
   microbalance (QCM) resonant sensor. The virtual impactor is fabricated
   by three-dimensional (3D) printing process for classifying airborne
   particles according to their size. The QCM resonant sensor is utilized
   to detect the mass of the separated particles from the virtual impactor.
   The design of virtual impactor is optimized by computational fluid
   dynamics simulation and the QCM for its resonance in thickness shear
   mode is analyzed by finite element method. Silicon dioxide powders with
   diameter in the range from 0.5 to 8 m are successfully separated
   according to their size by the virtual impactor, which indicates that
   the classification characteristic coincides with the theoretical and
   simulation results. PM concentration in a chamber is measured by the
   proposed monitoring system and the experimental results show that the
   resonant frequency of the QCM turns downward linearly with the PM mass
   loading increasing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic sign retroreflectivity condition is one of the most critical
   factors impacting night-time driving safety. The federal rule on minimum
   traffic sign retroreflectivity incorporated in the 2009 Manual on
   Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) issued by the Federal Highway
   Administration (FHWA) is compelling transportation agencies to evaluate
   how to comply. As the traditional manual methods have become financially
   and/or practically infeasible, there is an urgent need for an effective
   and efficient retroreflectivity evaluation method. This paper
   investigates the possibility and proposes a methodology for
   automatically evaluating traffic sign retroreflectivity condition using
   mobile light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and computer vision. The
   proposed methodology uses (a) the traffic sign detection and color
   segmentation methods that are introduced for the first time to evaluate
   the retroreflectivity of different traffic sign colors separately in an
   automated manner; (b) the proposed theoretical-empirical LIDAR
   retro-intensity normalization scheme to more reliably model the
   radiometric responses of traffic sign captured in the mobile LIDAR data;
   (c) the population-based condition assessment method for the first time
   to statistically quantify the retroreflectivity condition of traffic
   signs rather than an four-point average. An experimental test was
   conducted on 35 Type I Engineer Grade stop signs. The result shows that
   the proposed methodology can produce a promising outcome with consistent
   retroreflectivity evaluations based on handheld retroreflectometer
   measurements; the proposed methodology can, also, better identify
   traffic signs with non-homogeneous deteriorated retroreflectivity. The
   reliable retroreflectivity evaluation results make the proposed
   methodology an appealing alternative for transportation agencies to use
   to comply with the FHWA's requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The formation and evolution of surface species during the
   hydrodeoxygenation of various bio-oil model compounds (anisole,
   m-cresol, and guaiacol) over Pt/HBEA and HBEA is investigated. Anisole
   and m-cresol form phenate and cresolate species on Lewis acid sites,
   while guaiacol can chemisorb more strongly forming bidentate surface
   species. The position of functional groups within these molecules has a
   strong influence on the degree of hydrodeoxygenation over Pt/HBEA, due
   to steric hindrance of the C-O scission step. Consequently, the highest
   yield of deoxygenated products is formed over anisole, followed by
   m-cresol and guaiacol. No deoxygenation products are produced from HBEA.
   On the basis of operando transmission FTIR spectroscopy experiments at
   400 degrees C and 1 atm of hydrogen pressure, a timeline for the
   formation of polynuclear aromatics and graphitic coke from aromatics
   with different substituents is established for Pt/HBEA. The early
   formation of relatively small amounts of graphitic coke and polynuclear
   aromatics results in pronounced catalyst deactivation. In addition, the
   formation of strongly adsorbed monomeric species appears to restrict
   transport processes within the zeolite pores and contribute to
   deactivation.}},

   the tensile and compressive moduli for both static and dynamic cases. It
   is found that the tensile and compressive moduli are different. Further,
   under dynamic loading, both compressive and tensile moduli are frequency
   dependent. As a by-product, the micromechanics models also predict wave
   attenuation in the dynamic case. Numerical simulations using the finite
   element method are conducted to validate the micromechanics models.}},

Abstract = {{A popular perception is that landfalling tropical cyclones help to
   mitigate droughts in the Southeastern United States (SeUS). However
   intriguing paradigms on the role of large scale SST variations on
   continental US including SeUS droughts and seasonal Atlantic tropical
   cyclone activity confronts us. These paradigms suggest that in the
   presence of warm (cold) eastern tropical Pacific and cold (warm)
   Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) lead to the
   increased likelihood of wetter (drier) conditions over the continental
   US including the SeUS. Juxtaposing this understanding with the fact that
   landfalling tropical cyclones contribute significantly to the annual
   mean total rainfall in the SeUS and in El Nio (La Nia) years with cold
   (warm) tropical Atlantic SSTA lead to reduced (increased) Atlantic
   tropical cyclone activity raises a conflict on the role of the
   large-scale SST variations in SeUS hydroclimate. This study attempts to
   investigate the apparent dichotomous role of the large scale SST
   variations on the SeUS hydrology by examining the role of rainfall from
   landfalling tropical cyclones in the SeUS to local seasonal droughts.
   Our study finds that the contribution of the rainfall from landfalling
   tropical cyclone on the mitigation of monthly drought in the 28 SeUS
   watersheds is relatively insignificant. So much so that the hydrological
   model uncertainty in estimating the drought index over the 28 SeUS
   watersheds is larger than the sensitivity exhibited by the drought index
   to the inclusion of rain from landfalling tropical cyclone. The
   conclusions of this study are justified by the fact that the timing of
   the landfalling tropical cyclone in relation to overall soil moisture
   conditions of the watershed does not coincide with a drought like
   situation in the 1948-2006 time period analyzed in this study. This
   largely stems from the fact that the large-scale flow pattern resulting
   in abundant (lack of) advection of moisture for anomalously wet (dry)
   summer and fall seasons in the SeUS emanating from the source region of
   the Caribbean Sea and the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean coincides
   with the steering flow of the Atlantic tropical cyclones bound to make
   landfall in the SeUS (recurving away from the SeUS).}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant advances in robotics, commercially advanced
   prosthetics provide only a small fraction of the functionality of the
   amputated limb that they are meant to replace. Peripheral nerve
   interfacing could provide a rich controlling link between the body and
   these advanced prosthetics in order to increase their overall utility.
   Here, we report on the development of a fully integrated regenerative
   microchannel interface with 30 microelectrodes and signal extraction
   capabilities enabling evaluation in an awake and ambulatory rat animal
   model. In vitro functional testing validated the capability of the
   microelectrodes to record neural signals similar in size and nature to
   those that occur invivo. In vitro dorsal root ganglia cultures revealed
   striking cytocompatibility of the microchannel interface. Finally,

   composed of simulated annealing with a particle filter based generator

   incorporated into this framework. A constraint on the deformation is
   enforced whose role is to ensure physically meaningful fields (i.e.,
   invertible). Further, examples in which landmark constraints serve to
   guide the registration are shown. Results on 2D and 3D data demonstrate

Abstract = {{This paper presents the initial findings of an ongoing research effort
   focused on identifying, quantifying, and ranking essential industry
   practices for the successful delivery of faster fast-track, or Flash
   Track, projects. The research data collection involves literature
   search, engineering, procurement, construction industry interviews, and
   discussions with an industry expert panel. This research has extensively
   explored and analyzed U.S. and international practices and has deeply
   explored project execution practices in industries other than
   construction, including manufacturing, shipbuilding, and software
   engineering/development. The methodology employed in this research
   entails deployment of a three-round Delphi process and an Analytic
   Hierarchy Process to produce a comprehensive list of prioritized
   recommendations on essential Flash Track practices. This paper
   contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying and ranking 18
   industry best practices essential to successfully manage the unique
   challenges and risks inherent in Flash Track projects. This research
   finds that planning, execution, and organizational practices are the
   most essential considerations for successful Flash Tracking. It also
   highlights the central role of trusting relationships and fully
   integrated work teams and, in doing so, extends earlier studies calling
   for innovative approaches, rethinking prevailing practices, and
   entertaining a new paradigm in Flash Track projects. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Influence of symbiont-produced bioactive natural products on holobiont

Journal = {{MARINE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Marine invertebrates are a major source of bioactive natural products,
   many of which are produced by associated microbes. These compounds
   protect the invertebrate host against predators, competitors, or
   pathogens by affecting the cellular processes of the host's adversary,
   but knowledge about the interaction of the host itself with these
   symbiont-produced natural products is limited. For example, larvae of
   the marine bryozoan, Bugula neritina, are defended from predation by the
   bryostatins, polyketides synthesized by its uncultured endosymbiont,
   ``Candidatus Endobugula sertula.{''} Bryostatins are potent modulators
   of the eukaryotic signaling protein, protein kinase C (PKC) that is
   involved in many cellular processes. In this study, we investigated how
   host reproduction responds to the absence of the symbiont and
   symbiont-produced bryostatins in colonies after antibiotic curing and in
   colonies with naturally reduced symbiont titers. The fecundity of the
   symbiont-reduced B. neritina colonies was significantly decreased,
   suggesting that host reproduction is dependent on the symbiont, and/or
   the bryostatins they produce. To assess the role of PKC in this
   response, Western blot analysis of protein extracts from symbiotic and
   symbiont-reduced B. neritina colonies revealed a difference in
   bryostatin-activated conventional PKCs, but none for
   bryostatin-independent PKCs. Similar results were observed for PKCs in
   symbiotic and naturally occurring symbiont-reduced colonies, as well as
   in the model invertebrate, Caenorhabditis elegans, exposed to
   bryostatin, suggesting that the bryostatins potentially modulate PKC
   activity in symbiotic B. neritina and bryostatin-exposed C. elegans.
   Analysis of the B. neritina transcriptome led to the identification of
   five PKC isozymes. Since PKCs have been reported to be involved in
   regulation of reproductive processes and oocyte maturation in various
   organisms, the findings of this study suggest that the symbiont-produced
   bryostatins are an important cue for reproduction in the host B.

   photovoltaics}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{444-452}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Typical installation of a microinverter in a plane parallel position on
   the back side of a monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) panel can
   lead to differential heating of the PV cells immediately above the
   microinverter by as much as 4 degrees C. Rotation of the microinverter
   to a perpendicular position allows the microinverter itself to run
   cooler by about 4 degrees C and completely removes the distinctive heat
   signature on the panels. Because the thermal effects of the
   microinverters are significant for only two of the 72 cells on the
   panel, changes in DC power output from the panels are not detectable.
   However, lower microinverter temperatures increase microinverter
   efficiency by about 0.65\%, such that overall AC power production is
   increased by about 0.09\%. In addition to these small improvements to be
   gained by the repositioning of microinverters, there are also potential
   long-term concerns that nonuniform heating may lead to accelerated
   degradation in the affected area of the panel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Severe birth defects occur in approximate to 2-3\% of live-born infants
   and are a leading cause of death in the young. Structural malformations
   can occur in just about any major organ system and often their causes
   are unknown. The pediatric population presents a unique set of
   opportunities to the field of tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine (TERM). Infants and young children have significantly greater
   regenerative capacity than adults, which could be leveraged in TERM
   strategies. Children also arguably stand to benefit the most from TERM.
   Although the lack of growth potential and relatively short life span of
   synthetic materials may be suitable for adults, it is unacceptable for
   children. Furthermore, given that there is a particular scarcity of
   pediatric donor organs, the need for living functional tissue
   replacements that can grow with the child is quite evident. There is
   enormous potential for the TERM community to address the needs of the
   pediatric population.}},

Title = {{A study on simultaneous design of a Hall Effect Thruster and its
   low-thrust trajectory}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{34-47}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Space missions involving Hall Effect Thrusters are more and more common,
   and designs of both Hall Effect Thrusters and low-thrust trajectories
   require more elaborated process to meet the on-going mission demands.
   The design of a new Hall Effect Thruster can be improved by considering
   mission goals for high-demand missions rather than by relying on the
   current empirical and experimental design process. Moreover, the
   optimization of low-thrust trajectories involving the Hall Effect
   Thrusters can also be improved by incorporating the physics of the Hall
   Effect Thrusters rather than using a simplified model of the given
   thruster or incorporating the limited existing thruster characteristics.
   In order to accomplish these two objectives, a simultaneous design
   environment of the Hall Effect Thruster and its associated low-thrust
   trajectory is developed. By linking these two disciplines through a
   direct embedding of the Hall thruster analysis module within the low
   thrust optimal control problem, we show that a new Hall Effect Thruster
   and the associated low-thrust trajectory can be designed simultaneously.
   As a starting example applying this coupled strategy, a plausible,
   high-demand mission scenario is attempted with highly simplified
   assumptions on trajectory optimization, which is the final stage of a
   geostationary transfer orbit that takes place entirely outside the Van
   Allen radiation belts. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most
   promising converter topologies for medium/high-power applications. Since
   the MMC is structured based upon stacking up a number of
   series-connected identical submodules (SMs), to improve its fault
   tolerance and reliability, SM failure detection and location is of
   significant importance. In this paper, the impact of open-circuit switch
   failures of the SMs on the operation of the MMC is analyzed. Based on
   the analysis under SM failure conditions, two SM failure detection and
   location methods are proposed, that is, a clustering algorithm
   (CA)-based method and a calculated capacitance (CC)-based method. In the
   proposed CA-based method, a pattern-recognition-based fault diagnosis
   approach, which employs the clustering algorithm to detect and locate
   the faulty SMs with open-switch failures through identifying the pattern
   of 2-D trajectories of the SM characteristic variables, is developed.
   The proposed CC-based method is based on the calculation and comparison
   of a physical component parameter, that is, the nominal SM capacitance,
   and is capable of failure detection, location, and classification within
   one stage. The performance of the proposed failure detection methods for
   an MMC system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in
   the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results
   demonstrate the capabilities of the two proposed methods in detecting
   and locating any SM failure under various conditions accurately and
   efficiently.}},

Title = {{A Stackelberg game theoretic model for optimizing product family
   architecting with supply chain consideration}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Planning of an optimal product family architecture (PFA) plays a
   critical role in defining an organization's product platforms for
   product variant configuration while leveraging commonality and variety.
   The focus of PFA planning has been traditionally limited to the product
   design stage, yet with limited consideration of the downstream supply
   chain-related issues. Decisions of supply chain configuration have a
   profound impact on not only the end cost of product family fulfillment,
   but also how to design the architecture of module configuration within a
   product family. It is imperative for product family architecting to be
   optimized in conjunction with supply chain configuration decisions. This
   paper formulates joint optimization of PFA planning and supply chain
   configuration as a Stackelberg game. A nonlinear, mixed integer bilevel
   programming model is developed to deal with the leader-follower game
   decisions between product family architecting and supply chain
   configuration. The PFA decision making is represented as an upper-level
   optimization problem for optimal selection of the base modules and
   compound modules. A lower-level optimization problem copes with supply
   chain decisions in accordance with the upper-level decisions of product
   variant configuration. Consistent with the bilevel optimization model, a
   nested genetic algorithm is developed to derive near optimal solutions
   for PFA and the corresponding supply chain network. A case study of
   joint PFA and supply chain decisions for power transformers is reported
   to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed Stackelberg
   game theoretic joint optimization of PFA and supply chain decisions. (C)

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the leading mode of
   interannual climate variability. However, it is unclear how ENSO has
   responded to external forcing, particularly orbitally induced changes in
   the amplitude of the seasonal cycle during the Holocene. Here we present
   a reconstruction of seasonal and interannual surface conditions in the
   tropical Pacific Ocean from a network of high-resolution coral and
   mollusc records that span discrete intervals of the Holocene. We
   identify several intervals of reduced variance in the 2 to 7 yr ENSO
   band that are not in phase with orbital changes in equatorial
   insolation, with a notable 64\% reduction between 5,000 and 3,000 years
   ago. We compare the reconstructed ENSO variance and seasonal cycle with
   that simulated by nine climate models that include orbital forcing, and
   find that the models do not capture the timing or amplitude of ENSO
   variability, nor the mid-Holocene increase in seasonality seen in the
   observations; moreover, a simulated inverse relationship between the
   amplitude of the seasonal cycle and ENSO-related variance in sea surface
   temperatures is not found in our reconstructions. We conclude that the
   tropical Pacific climate is highly variable and subject to millennial
   scale quiescent periods. These periods harbour no simple link to orbital
   forcing, and are not adequately simulated by the current generation of
   models.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were
   conducted in order to evaluate the hypothesis that the hydrodynamic slip
   length is a surface property. The system under investigation was water
   confined between two graphite layers to form nanochannels of different
   sizes (3-8 nm). The water-carbon interaction potential was calibrated by
   matching wettability experiments of graphitic-carbon surfaces free of
   airborne hydrocarbon contamination. Three equilibrium theories were used
   to calculate the hydrodynamic slip length. It was found that one of the
   recently reported equilibrium theories for the calculation of the slip
   length featured confinement effects, while the others resulted in
   calculations significantly hindered by the large margin of error
   observed between independent simulations. The hydrodynamic slip length
   was found to be channel-size independent using equilibrium calculations,
   i.e., suggesting a consistency with the definition of a surface
   property, for 5-nm channels and larger. The analysis of the individual
   trajectories of liquid particles revealed that the reason for observing
   confinement effects in 3-nm nanochannels is the high mobility of the
   bulk particles. Nonequilibrium calculations were not consistently
   affected by size but by noisiness in the smallest systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), containing more than one

   systems. We demonstrate the controlled synthesis and detailed
   characterization of hybrid ZIF-7-90 frameworks containing linkers of
   ZIF-7 (rhombohedral) and ZIF-90 (cubic). ZIF-7-90 materials with
   SOD-type topology are obtained in three crystalline phases depending on
   the linker composition and synthesis technique. The effect of synthesis
   conditions on the activation-induced phase transition from rhombohedral
   to other topologies is studied. Nitrogen physisorption at 77 K and CO2
   physisorption at 273 K shows the tunability of the pore-size
   distribution and the framework flexibility as a function of framework

Title = {{Using a new WALSPMF model to quantify the source contributions to PM2.5
   at a harbour site in China}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{PM2.5 variances have adverse impacts on human beings and the
   environment: therefore, source apportionment is very important and is a
   hot global topic. In this work, a new model called WALSPMF is proposed
   and evaluated for its accuracy. First, a synthetic test was carried out
   to compare the estimated source profile and contributions with the
   synthetic ones. Average absolute error (AAE) values were also calculated
   between the estimated and synthetic source contributions; most of the
   values were low (<15\%), which indicated that the results of the WALSPMF
   model might be acceptable. Next, samples of PM2.5 were collected from a
   large harbour sampling site in China (Tanggu). The PM2.5 mean level was
   110.63 mu g m(-3), with a range of 28.67 mu g m(-3)-302.17 mu g m(-3).
   The ambient PM2.5 dataset was separately introduced into both the
   WALSPMF and EPAPMF 5.0 models to identify the possible sources and their
   contributions. Five source categories were extracted by the two models
   and can be identified in the following consistent order: coal combustion
   (33\% for WALSPMF, 30\% for EPAPMF 5.0), secondary nitrate (19\% for
   WALSPMF, 21\% for EPAPMF 5.0), crustal dust (18\% for WALSPMF, 22\% for
   EPAPMF 5.0), secondary sulphate (16\% for WALSPMF, 15\% for EPAPMF 5.0),
   and vehicle exhaust (14\% for WALSPMF, 12\% for EPAPMF 5.0). The
   positive results of multiple verifications suggested good performance of
   the WALSPMF model; thus, it is essential to put this new model forward
   as a way to potentially enrich the modern source apportionment
   technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Hydrodynamic loading in concomitance with exogenous cytokine stimulation
   modulates differentiation of bovine mesenchymal stem cells towards
   osteochondral lineages}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are viewed as a having
   significant potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
   therapies. Clinical implementation of MSCs, however, demands that their
   preparation be stable and reproducible. Given that environmental and
   bioprocessing parameters such as substrate stiffness, seeding densities,
   culture medium composition, and mechanical loading can result in
   undirected differentiation of the MSC population, the objective of this
   study was to systematically investigate how hydrodynamic loading
   influences the differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs) towards the osteochondral lineages both in the presence and
   absence of exogenous, inductive factors.
   Methods: Expanded bovine MSCs were suspended in 2.5 \% agarose, cast in
   a custom mold, and placed into either static or one of two dynamic
   culture environments consisting of ``high{''} and ``low{''} magnitude
   shear conditions. Constructs were supplemented with varying
   concentrations (0, 1, 10, 100 ng/mL) of either TGF-beta 3 or BMP-2
   throughout cultivation with tissue samples being collected following
   each week of culture.
   Results: In the absence of exogenous supplementation, hydrodynamic
   loading had little effect on cell phenotype at either magnitude of
   stimulation. When cultures were supplemented with BMP-2 and TGF-beta 3,
   MSCs gene expression progressed towards the osteogenic and chondrogenic
   pathways, respectively. This progression was enhanced by the presence of
   hydrodynamic loading, particularly under high shear conditions, but may
   point the chondrogenic cultures down a hypertrophic path toward
   osteogenesis reminiscent of endochondral ossification if TGF-beta 3
   supplementation is insufficient.
   Conclusions: Moving forward, these results suggest bioprocessing
   conditions which minimize exposure of chondrogenic cultures to fluid
   shear stress to avoid undesirable differentiation of the MSC population.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we report a novel method for synthesizing
   temperature-sensitive polymer-modified cellulose nanofibril (CNF)
   cryogel microspheres. The pristine cryogel microspheres were first
   prepared using a spray-freeze dry method in the presence of a chemical
   crosslinker. Afterwards, NIPAm (N-isopropylacrylamide), a
   temperature-sensitive monomer, was polymerized and grafted to the
   cellulose cryogel microspheres through in situ free radical
   polymerization in the cryogel microreactor. The morphology, chemical
   structure, thermal sensitivity, bulk density and water uptake capacity
   of the hybrid microspheres were characterized. The CNF-PNIPAm hybrid
   microspheres exhibited a good temperature response at around 32 A
   degrees C in water. The swelling behavior and drug release capability of
   CNF-PNIPAm hybrid microspheres were also investigated. The microspheres
   with PNIPAm exhibited a controllable drug release rate. The temperature
   effect on the drug release rate was also observed. These results
   indicated that porous CNF-PNIPAm hybrid microspheres could serve as a
   new type of material for controlled drug release.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) have been of great interest as reinforcing
   fillers because of their low density, high aspect ratio, and excellent
   mechanical strength properties. The advantages of CNFs, however, are
   often limited by their self-aggregation tendency and poor interfacial
   compatibility with hydrophobic polymer matrices. In this study, maleated
   styrene block copolymers were grafted on the surface of CNFs through
   esterification. The grafted polymer fraction of 25 wt\% by gravimetric
   measurement was obtained. The evidence of grafting was also supported by
   changes in chemical functional groups and addition of the polymer
   thermal degradation step. A contact angle as high as 130A degrees was
   observed on modified CNF film. The influences of modified CNFs on the
   surface morphology, thermal stability, and crystallinity were also
   evaluated and compared with those of neat CNFs. The reinforcing
   capability of CNFs as reinforcing fillers in the hydrophobic polymer
   matrix was assessed. The results also highlight the effect of improved
   compatibility between the surface modified CNF and polystyrene matrix to
   maintain optimum tensile strength at various filler concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization in China during the first decade of the twenty first
   century has brought about profound environmental changes at citywide and
   regional scales. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of
   indicators and put forward a new evaluation method for measuring
   environmental impacts of urbanization from 2000 to 2010. We compared
   these impacts among 286 cities in mainland China and found that the
   overall quantity of pollutant discharge decreased as cities became more
   economically developed during the years 2000-2010. However, larger and
   denser cities, and wealthier cities in the eastern part of China tended
   to have larger quantities of pollutant discharge, resource consumption,
   and changes in land use (i.e., expansion of the built environment). The
   discharge increase occurred despite these cities having increased their
   investment in pollution control and construction of municipal
   environmental infrastructure. The negative impact from the intensity of
   pollutant discharge (i.e., discharge per unit of economic output) was
   generally less in more developed cities, although this was not always
   the case. Some cities, such as resource-based cities and old industrial
   cities, had both larger quantities of pollutant discharge and greater
   pollution intensity compared to other types of cities, indicating that
   environmental impacts did not necessarily decrease with increasing
   urbanization. The results of this study provide a promising basis for
   decision-making to reduce the impacts for different types of cities in
   the decades to come.}},

Abstract = {{The development of elastomeric, bioresorbable and biocompatible
   segmented polyurethanes (SPUs) for use in tissue-engineering
   applications has attracted considerable interest because of the existing
   need of mechanically tunable scaffolds for regeneration of different
   tissues, but the incorporation of osteoinductive molecules into SPUs has
   been limited. In this study, SPUs were synthesized from poly
   (e-caprolactone) diol, 4,40-methylene bis (cyclohexyl isocyanate) using
   biologically active compounds such as ascorbic acid, L-glutamine,
   beta-glycerol phosphate, and dexamethasone as chain extenders. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the formation of both
   urethanes and urea linkages while differential scanning calorimetry,
   dynamic mechanical analysis, X-ray diffraction and mechanical testing
   showed that these polyurethanes were semi-crystalline polymers
   exhibiting high deformations. Cytocompatibility studies showed that only
   SPUs containing beta-glycerol phosphate supported human mesenchymal stem
   cell adhesion, growth, and osteogenic differentiation, rendering them
   potentially suitable for bone tissue regeneration, whereas other SPUs
   failed to support either cell growth or osteogenic differentiation, or
   both. This study demonstrates that modification of SPUs with osteogenic
   compounds can lead to new cytocompatible polymers for regenerative
   medicine applications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{268-282}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The use of soft, synthetic materials for the replacement of soft,
   load-bearing tissues has been largely unsuccessful due to a lack of
   materials with sufficient fatigue and wear properties, as well as a lack
   of fundamental understanding on the relationship between material
   structure and behavior under cyclic loads. In this study, we
   investigated the response of several soft, biomedical polymers to cyclic
   compressive stresses under aqueous conditions and utilized dynamic
   mechanical analysis and{''} differential scanning calorimetry to
   evaluate the role of thermo-mechanical transitions on such behavior.
   Studied materials include: polycarbonate urethane, polydimethylsiloxane,
   four acrylate copolymers with systematically varied thermo-mechanical
   transitions, as well as bovine meniscal tissue for comparison. Materials
   showed compressive moduli between 2.3 and 1900 MPa, with polycarbonate
   urethane (27.3 MPa) matching closest to meniscal tissue (37.0 MPa), and
   also demonstrated a variety of thermo-mechanical transition behaviors.
   Cyclic testing resulted in distinct fatigue-life curves, with failure
   defined as either classic fatigue fracture or a defined increased in
   maximum strain due to ratcheting. Our study found that polymers with
   sufficient dissipation mechanisms at the testing temperature, as
   evidenced by tan delta values, were generally tougher than those with
   less dissipation and exhibited ratcheting rather than fatigue fracture
   much like meniscal tissue. Strain recovery tests indicated that, for
   some toughened polymers, the residual strain following our cyclic
   loading protocol could be fully recovered. The similarity in ratcheting
   behavior, and lack of fatigue fracture, between the meniscal tissue and
   toughened polymers indicates that such polymers may have potential as
   artificial soft tissue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical data management systems typically provide caregiver teams with
   useful information, derived from large, sometimes highly heterogeneous,
   data sources that are often changing dynamically. Over the last decade
   there has been a significant surge in interest in using these data
   sources, from simply reusing the standard clinical databases for event
   prediction or decision support, to including dynamic and
   patient-specific information into clinical monitoring and prediction
   problems. However, in most cases, commercial clinical databases have
   been designed to document clinical activity for reporting, liability,
   and billing reasons, rather than for developing new algorithms. With
   increasing excitement surrounding ``secondary use of medical records{''}
   and ``Big Data{''} analytics, it is important to understand the
   limitations of current databases and what needs to change in order to
   enter an era of ``precision medicine.{''} This review article covers
   many of the issues involved in the collection and preprocessing of
   critical care data. The three challenges in critical care are
   considered: compartmentalization, corruption, and complexity. A range of
   applications addressing these issues are covered, including the
   modernization of static acuity scoring; online patient tracking;
   personalized prediction and risk assessment; artifact detection; state
   estimation; and incorporation of multimodal data sources such as genomic
   and free text data.}},

Abstract = {{A novel combined autotrophic nitritation and bioelectrochemical-sulfur
   denitrification (CANBSD) process was developed for treatment of
   synthetic ammonium-rich wastewater with low carbon/nitrogen ratio. Total
   nitrogen removal of the CANBSD was higher than 95 \%, the effluent SO4
   (2-) was lower than 1280 mg L-1, and the maximum nitrogen volumetric
   loading rate was 1.2 kg m(-3) day(-1) when (1) the influent NH4 (+)-N
   was lower than 1008 mg L-1, (2) hydraulic retention time was between 3.7
   and 32 h, (3) the DO was between 0.5 and 1.2 mg L-1, (4) the pH was
   between 7.5 and 8.2, and (5) the temperature was between 28 and 30 A
   degrees C. Both the NH4 (+)-N removal and conversion to NO2 (-)-N in the
   nitritation membrane reactor (NMBR) were maintained at about 50 \%, and
   the residual NH4 (+)-N and accumulated NO2 (-)-N were subsequently
   treated in the bioelectrochemical-sulfur three-dimensional
   denitrification reactor. The CANBSD energy consumption was 0.13 and 3.4
   kWh m(-3), respectively, for influent NH4 (+)-N of 100 and 1000 mg L-1.
   The energy consumption of CANBSD was close to that of partial

Title = {{Local stability analysis and eigenvalue sensitivity of reacting
   bluff-body wakes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{788}},
Pages = {{549-575}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental and theoretical investigation of
   high-Reynolds-number low-density reacting wakes mar a hydrodynamic Hopf
   bifurcation. This configuration is applicable to the wake flows that are
   commonly used to stabilize flames in high-velocity flows. First, an
   experimental study is conducted to measure the limit-cycle oscillation
   of this reacting bluff-body wake. The experiment is repeated while
   independently varying the bluff-body lip velocity and the density ratio
   across the flame. In all cases, the Wake exhibits a sinuous oscillation.
   Linear stability analysis is performed on the measured time-averaged
   velocity and density fields. In the first stage of this analysis, a
   local spatiotemporal stability analysis is performed on the measured
   time-averaged velocity and density fields. The stability analysis
   results are compared to the experimental measurement and demonstrate
   that the local stability analysis correctly captures the influence of
   the lip velocity and density ratio parameters on the sinuous mode. In
   the second stage of the analysis, the linear direct and adjoint global
   modes are estimated by combining the local results. The sensitivity of
   the eigenvalue to changes in intrinsic feedback mechanisms is found by
   combining the direct and adjoint global modes. This is referred to as
   the eigenvalue sensitivity throughout the paper for reasons of brevity.
   The predicted global mode frequency is consistently within 10\% of the
   measured value, and the linear global mode shape closely resembles the
   measured nonlinear oscillations. The adjoint global mode reveals that
   the oscillation is strongly sensitive to open-loop forcing in the shear
   layers. The eigenvalue sensitivity identifies a wavemaker in the
   recirculation zone of the wake. A parametric study shows that these
   regions change little when the density ratio and lip velocity change. In
   the third stage of the analysis, the stability analysis is repeated for
   the varicose hydrodynamic mode. Although not physically observed in this
   unforced flow, the varicose mode can lock into longitudinal acoustic
   waves and cause thermoacoustic oscillations to occur. The paper shows
   that the local stability analysis successfully predicts the global
   hydrodynamic stability characteristics of this flow and shows that
   experimental data can be post-processed with this method in order to
   identify the wavemaker regions and the regions that are most sensitive
   to external forcing, for example from acoustic waves.}},

Abstract = {{Full characterization of complex reaction mixtures is necessary to
   understand mechanisms, optimize yields, and elucidate secondary reaction
   pathways. Molecular-level information for species in such mixtures can
   be readily obtained by coupling mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with
   thin layer chromatography (TLC) separations. User-guided investigation
   of imaging data for mixture components with known m/z values is
   generally straightforward; however, spot detection for unknowns is
   highly tedious, and limits the applicability of MSI in conjunction with
   TLC. To accelerate imaging data mining, we developed DetectTLC, an
   approach that automatically identifies m/z values exhibiting TLC
   spot-like regions in MS molecular images. Furthermore, DetectTLC can
   also spatially match m/z values for spots acquired during alternating
   high and low collision-energy scans, pairing product ions with
   precursors to enhance structural identification. As an example,
   DetectTLC is applied to the identification and structural confirmation
   of unknown, yet significant, products of abiotic pyrazinone and
   aminopyrazine nucleoside analog synthesis.}},

Title = {{Micro-macro approach of salt viscous fatigue under cyclic loading}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{13-31}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to explain the origin of fatigue observed
   in salt rock subject to cyclic loading. We used a self-consistent
   homogenization scheme to upscale the viscoplastic and damage behavior of
   halite polycrystals from mono-crystal viscous glide and breakage
   mechanisms. We modeled mono-crystals as spherical inclusions embedded in
   an infinite homogeneous matrix, and we assumed purely elastic
   inclusion/matrix interactions. We introduced a failure criterion at the
   mono-crystal scale in order to predict grain breakage and the subsequent
   damage effects on salt rock elastic moduli. We wrote an algorithm that
   allows computing macroscopic and microscopic stresses and strains during
   creep and cyclic axial loading. Although some simplifying assumptions
   were made in our micro-macro approach, the model provided
   micro-mechanical interpretations to important aspects of salt rock
   viscoplastic and fatigue behavior, which had not been explained so far,
   such as strain hardening, creep recovery, as well as damage and
   accelerated creep due to grain breakage. Moreover, incremental
   viscoplastic strains decreased over the cycles, which is in agreement
   with the phenomenon of ``shakedown{''} observed in elasto-plastic media.
   Salt rock can be viewed as a model material. More generally, this
   research is expected to bring new perspectives to study the microscopic
   origin of fatigue in viscous polycrystalline materials. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Chlorophenols can be easily oxidized into chlorobenzoquinones (CBQs),

   solution, is proposed. Current variations and the presence of CO2 could
   significantly affect these reaction pathways. In particular, higher
   currents enhance the hydroxylation process by promoting alkaline
   conditions and abundant H2O2 formation. As both OH- and H2O2 are strong
   nucleophiles, they easily react with CBQ products to form hydroxylated
   products, which can significantly reduce solution toxicity. An adequate
   supply of CO2 can provide favorable pH conditions and facilitate
   enzymatic steps, such as substrate oxidation and radical coupling, to
   generate precipitable polymerized products. All of the results suggest
   that toxic intermediate products can be effectively reduced and
   controlled during the electroenzymatic process to remove DCP and other
   phenolic pollutants from wastewaters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Design and other fundamental topics in engineering are often isolated to
   dedicated courses. An opportunity exists to foster a culture of
   engineering design and multidisciplinary problem solving throughout the
   curriculum. Designettes, charettelike design challenges, are rapid and
   creative learning tools that enable educators to integrate design
   learning in a single class, across courses, across terms, and across
   disciplines. When two or more courses join together in a designette, a
   multidisciplinary learning activity occurs; multiple subjects are
   integrated and applied to open-ended problems and grand challenges. This
   practice helps foster a culture of design, and enables the introduction
   of multidisciplinary design challenges. Studies at the Singapore
   University of Technology and Design (SUTD) demonstrate learning of
   engineering subject matter in a bio-inspired robotics designette
   (MechAnimal), an interactive musical circuit designette, and an
   automated milk delivery (AutoMilk) designette. Each challenge combines
   problem clarification, concept generation, and prototyping with subject
   content such as circuits, biology, thermodynamics, differential
   equations, or software with controls. From pre- and post-surveys of
   students, designettes are found to increase students' understanding of
   engineering concepts. From 321 third-semester students, designettes were
   found to increase students' perceptions of their ability to solve
   multidisciplinary problems.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces the material and electrical characterization of two
   dielectric inks for use with inkjet printing fabrication and the

   utilized to realize thick (>4 mu m) and thin (<400 nm) inkjet-printed
   dielectric films, respectively. The material formulations for each ink
   are outlined in detail in order to achieve the desired viscosity and
   surface tension for optimal printing with a Dimatix inkjet printing
   system. Once printability and processing techniques are tuned and
   established, various material and electrical characterizations are
   performed, including printed profile measurement, multilayer profile
   tendencies, thermal reflow processing, UV-ozone surface energy
   modification, relative permittivity extraction, leakage current density,
   and dielectric breakdown voltage. Finally, the demonstration of
   fully-printed post-processed on-chip capacitors utilizing both thin and

Abstract = {{Batch experiments for the hydrolysis of xylan and pure cellulose
   (Avicel) hydrolysis and the decomposition of xylose and glucose were
   performed at varying sulfuric acid concentrations in the range of 10 to

   Increasing the temperature and acid concentration hastened the
   hydrolysis and the sugar decomposition rates. The hydrolysis rate of
   Avicel was much slower than that of xylan because of its crystallinity.
   The kinetic parameters for the concentrated acid hydrolysis reaction
   were estimated for both glucose and xylose reaction paths. The effect of
   initial cellulose crystallinity on the acid hydrolysis rate was also
   investigated, such that the cellulose was treated with various
   concentrations of phosphoric acid. A dramatic reduction in the cellulose
   crystalline index was observed when the phosphoric acid concentration
   was in a narrow range around 80 wt.\%. It was found that the hydrolysis

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of finite 1:1 dimer chains to mitigate
   the transmission of shock disturbances. Dimer chains consist of
   alternating light and heavy masses with interconnecting compliance.
   Changing the mass ratio has provided interesting results in previous

   zero-preload, certain mass ratios have revealed minimal levels of
   transmitted force. This paper examines this phenomenon from the
   perspective of utilizing it in practical isolation systems. The
   zero-preload Hertzian contact case is contrasted with chains connected
   by linear or cubic springs. Through numerical simulations, tradeoffs are
   examined between displacement and transmitted force. Parametric studies
   are conducted to examine how isolation performance changes with mass
   ratio, stiffness, and different chain lengths.}},

Pages = {{75-85}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results from an experimental investigation of
   propane condensing inside horizontal tubes at three mass fluxes, two
   tube diameters and reduced pressures of 0.25-0.95. These conditions
   represent the saturation pressures and mass fluxes of most interest to
   the process and HVAC\&R industries. In this first part, Part I, of a
   two-part study, the trends in heat transfer coefficient and frictional
   pressure gradient for these conditions are discussed and comparisons
   with available models from the literature are made. A small increase in
   heat transfer coefficient with tube diameter is observed for the
   specific tube diameters range studied, which is different from the trend
   predicted by most correlations. High-speed flow visualization results
   from a previous study, conducted using the same test facility, are used
   to explain the trend with tube diameter. No heat transfer coefficient
   correlation from the literature predicted all the tesults from the
   present study adequately; notably, all correlations perform increasingly
   poorly at higher reduced pressures. Also, no correlation from the
   literature adequately predicts the frictional pressure drops measured in
   this study. In the companion paper, Part II, the heat transfer and
   pressure drop results from this paper are used to develop correlations
   applicable to a wide range of operating conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this second part, Part II of a two-part study, data reported in Part
   I for condensation of hydrocarbons over a wide range of conditions are
   used to develop models for pressure drop and heat transfer coefficients.
   The pressure drop model accounts for the pressure drop occurring in the
   vapor and liquid phases, and due to phase interactions. The model
   provides improved predictions over existing correlations at lower
   frictional pressure drop conditions, such as in larger tube diameters
   and at higher saturation pressures. The data from Part I of this study
   are also used to develop a physically consistent condensation heat
   transfer model for horizontal smooth tubes. This model incorporates a
   novel method to account for the heat transfer through the upper liquid
   film that typically forms in horizontal tubes. The approach models the
   evolution of the liquid film from purely horizontal (annular) flow to a
   combination of vertical (falling film) and horizontal (annular) flow.
   Moreover, the evolution with quality is modeled continuously without
   resorting to interpolation between flow regimes. In doing so, this model
   accurately reflects the observations from flow visualization studies,
   and is a departure from the approach typically followed in existing
   correlations. Both models are developed using a database containing only
   hydrocarbon data (propane and pentane), but are shown to also accurately
   predict synthetic refrigerant behavior. Special attention is paid to
   developing a model that is equally applicable to all of the operating
   conditions in the database, thus equal weighting is given to high
   pressure and low pressure conditions, and all mass fluxes and tube
   diameters. The models predict the frictional pressure drop and heat
   transfer coefficient for the propane database with average deviations of
   3\% and -1\%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose rotation inferred from the polar decomposition of the flow
   gradient as a diagnostic for elliptic (or vortex-type) invariant regions
   in non-autonomous dynamical systems. We consider here two- and
   three-dimensional systems, in which polar rotation can be characterized
   by a single angle. For this polar rotation angle (PRA), we derive
   explicit formulas using the singular values and vectors of the flow
   gradient. We find that closed level sets of the PRA reveal elliptic
   islands in great detail, and singular level sets of the PRA uncover
   centers of such islands. Both features turn out to be objective
   (frame-invariant) for two-dimensional systems. We illustrate the
   diagnostic power of PRA for elliptic structures on several examples. (C)

Abstract = {{We employ Anderson extrapolation to accelerate the classical Jacobi
   iterative method for large, sparse linear systems. Specifically, we
   utilize extrapolation at periodic intervals within the Jacobi iteration
   to develop the Alternating Anderson-Jacobi (AAJ) method. We verify the
   accuracy and efficacy of AAJ in a range of test cases, including
   nonsymmetric systems of equations. We demonstrate that AAJ possesses a
   favorable scaling with system size that is accompanied by a small
   prefactor, even in the absence of a preconditioner. In particular, we
   show that AAJ is able to accelerate the classical Jacobi iteration by
   over four orders of magnitude, with speed-ups that increase as the
   system gets larger. Moreover, we find that AAJ significantly outperforms
   the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method in the range of problems
   considered here, with the relative performance again improving with size
   of the system. Overall, the proposed method represents a simple yet
   efficient technique that is particularly attractive for large-scale
   parallel solutions of linear systems of equations. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   local mean decomposition analysis}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{147-157}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{When a gas pipeline leaks, the leak aperture and its position cannot be
   easily identified. This paper proposed a leak aperture recognition and
   location method based on root mean square (RMS) entropy of local mean
   deposition (LMD) and Wigner-Ville time-frequency analysis. Firstly,
   wavelet packet energy analysis is employed to remove noise and extract
   the primary energy leak bands to reconstruct. The reconstructed signal
   is then decomposed using LMD, and the RMS entropy of PF components is
   calculated. The RMS entropies of multiple groups are used to build the
   feature vector, and it is then input into support vector machines (SVMs)
   to achieve the aperture recognition. An adaptive method based on mutual
   information is proposed to select the sensitive product function (PF)
   components, and the time-frequency parameters of the sensitive PF
   components are then calculated using Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)
   method. The time delays are obtained by analyzing the time-frequency
   parameters. Finally the leak location was achieved by combining time
   delay with leak signal propagation velocity. The experimental results
   show that the proposed method can effectively identify different leak
   apertures, and the leak location accuracy is better than that of the
   direct cross-correlation method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Relationship between mixed and pure gas self-diffusion for ethane and
   ethene in ZIF-8/6FDA-DAM mixed-matrix membrane by pulsed field gradient
   NMR}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{499}},
Pages = {{12-19}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to study self-diffusion of
   an ethane/ethene mixture and the corresponding pure gases in a
   mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) formed by dispersing ZIF-8 particles in
   6FDA-DAM polymer. In addition to the MMM, diffusion measurements of the
   pure gases were also carried out for the membrane constituents, i.e.
   ZIF-8 particle bed and the pure polymer film. PFG NMR studies were
   performed at a high magnetic field of 17.6 T using large magnetic field
   gradients up to 30 T/m. The former allowed achieving sufficiently large
   signal-to-noise ratios, while the latter enabled diffusivity
   measurements to be performed for molecular displacements smaller than
   the size of ZIF-8 particles. As a result, the gas self-diffusivities for
   the diffusion inside the ZIF-8 particles dispersed in the MMM and for
   the diffusion inside the surrounding polymer matrix could be obtained
   separately. For each gas, the diffusivities inside the ZIF-8 and polymer
   phases of the MMM were found to be smaller than the corresponding
   diffusivities in the neat ZIF-8 particle bed and pure polymer film. This
   observation is explained by the reduced framework flexibility of ZIF-8
   and the polymer chain rigidification in the MMM. The ethane and ethene
   diffusivities in the MMM loaded with the ethane/ethene mixture were
   compared with the corresponding diffusivities in the MMM loaded with a
   single gas. It was found that the presence of another gas component in
   the ZIF-8 particles dispersed in the MMM does not change the
   self-diffusivity inside the particles for both gases. At the same time,
   the self-diffusivity of the faster-diffusing sorbate (ethene) in the
   polymer phase of the MMM was reduced by co-adsorption of the
   slower-diffusing sorbate (ethane) in the MMM. The analytical expression
   proposed in our previous work for the long-range diffusivity in MMMs was
   validated for gas mixtures and pure gases based on the experimental data
   reported in this work. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of arsenic poisoning on MoO3- and WO3-doped V2O5/TiO2
   catalysts are studied and the poisoning resistance effect of MoO3 are
   revealed. The arsenic at certain amount (above 10\% of arsenic from XPS)
   decreases the surface area and the number of active sites where
   reduction takes place. From the results of DRIFTS and DFT, arsenic
   lowers the surface acidity by decreasing the quantity of Lewis acid
   sites and the stability of Bronsted acid sites. We also found newly
   formed As-OH groups of poisoned catalysts (at 1440 cm(-1)) have quite
   low activity at high temperature.
   MoO3 provides better activity on poisoned catalysts than WO3 does on
   V2O5/TiO2 catalysts. This may be due to the good dispersion of MoO3 on
   the support. The reactivity of surface W-O-W and W = O groups is
   considerably lower than the corresponding Mo-O-Mo and Mo = O groups from
   the OFT calculations models. This could be one of the explanations on
   the decrease of surface acidity of poisoned catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Self-powered wireless sensors require power delivery systems capable of
   harvesting from very low input voltage while consuming minimal bias
   current. This paper presents a multistage boost regulator capable of
   generating 3 V to supply RF blocks in self-powered wireless sensors from

   automated bias gating. The efficiency of the multistage conversion at a
   high conversion ratio is enhanced through the regulation and control of
   the intermediate-node voltage. A test chip, fabricated in 130 nm CMOS,
   demonstrates functional operation from as low as 10 mV input and
   consumes 190 nA bias current. Single-stage boost regulator demonstrates
   Peak efficiency of 89\%, while the cascaded two stage peaks at 72\%. In
   the cascaded system, the variable intermediate-node voltage operation
   shows up to 9\% efficiency improvement over fixed intermediate-node

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction, is a
   highly-ordered complex of hundreds of proteins. Despite decades of
   genetics work, the functional relationships and the roles of those
   sarcomeric proteins in animal behaviors remain unclear. In this paper,
   we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of the motor neurons that
   induce muscle contraction can facilitate quantitative studies of muscle
   kinetics in C. elegans. To increase the throughput of the study, we
   trapped multiple worms in parallel in a microfluidic device and
   illuminated for photoactivation of channelrhodopsin-2 to induce
   contractions in body wall muscles. Using image processing, the change in
   body size was quantified over time. A total of five parameters including
   rate constants for contraction and relaxation were extracted from the
   optogenetic assay as descriptors of sarcomere functions. To potentially
   relate the genes encoding the sarcomeric proteins functionally, a
   hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted on the basis of those
   parameters. Because it assesses physiological output different from
   conventional assays, this method provides a complement to the phenotypic
   analysis of C. elegans muscle mutants currently performed in many labs;
   the clusters may provide new insights and drive new hypotheses for
   functional relationships among the many sarcomere components.}},

Title = {{Associations between Self-Reported Gastrointestinal Illness and Water
   System Characteristics in Community Water Supplies in Rural Alabama: A
   Cross-Sectional Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Community water supplies in underserved areas of the United States may
   be associated with increased microbiological contamination and risk of
   gastrointestinal disease. Microbial and health risks affecting such
   systems have not been systematically characterized outside outbreak
   investigations. The objective of the study was to evaluate associations
   between self-reported gastrointestinal illnesses (GII) and
   household-level water supply characteristics.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional study of water quality, water supply
   characteristics, and GII in 906 households served by 14 small and
   medium-sized community water supplies in Alabama's underserved Black
   Belt region.
   Results
   We identified associations between respondent-reported water supply
   interruption and any symptoms of GII (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.01,
   95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.65-5.49), as well as low water
   pressure and any symptoms of GII (aOR: 4.51, 95\% CI = 2.5-57.97). We
   also identified associations between measured water quality such as lack
   of total chlorine and any symptoms of GII (aOR: 5.73, 95\% CI =
   1.09-30.1), and detection of E. coli in water samples and increased
   reports of vomiting (aOR: 5.01, 95\% CI = 1.62-15.52) or diarrhea (aOR:
   7.75, 95\% CI = 2.06-29.15).
   Conclusions
   Increased self-reported GII was associated with key water system
   characteristics as measured at the point of sampling in a
   cross-sectional study of small and medium water systems in rural Alabama
   in 2012 suggesting that these water supplies can contribute to endemic
   gastro-intestinal disease risks. Future studies should focus on further
   characterizing and managing microbial risks in systems facing similar
   challenges.}},

Title = {{Economic Evaluation of Individual School Closure Strategies: The Hong
   Kong 2009 H1N1 Pandemic}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   School closures as a means of containing the spread of disease have
   received considerable attention from the public health community.
   Although they have been implemented during previous pandemics, the
   epidemiological and economic effects of the closure of individual
   schools remain unclear.
   Methodology
   This study used data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong to develop
   a simulation model of an influenza pandemic with a localised population
   structure to provide scientific justifications for and economic
   evaluations of individual-level school closure strategies.
   Findings
   The estimated cost of the study's baseline scenario was USD330 million.
   We found that the individual school closure strategies that involved all
   types of schools and those that used a lower threshold to trigger school
   closures had the best performance. The best scenario resulted in an 80\%
   decrease in the number of cases (i. e., prevention of about 830,000
   cases), and the cost per case prevented by this intervention was
   USD1,145; thus, the total cost was USD1.28 billion.
   Conclusion
   This study predicts the effects of individual school closure strategies
   on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. Further research could determine
   optimal strategies that combine various system-wide and district-wide
   school closures with individual school triggers across types of schools.
   The effects of different closure triggers at different phases of a
   pandemic should also be examined.}},

Abstract = {{Medicine relies on the use of pharmacologically active agents (drugs) to
   manage and treat disease. However, drugs are not inherently effective;
   the benefit of a drug is directly related to the manner by which it is
   administered or delivered. Drug delivery can affect drug
   pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism, duration of
   therapeutic effect, excretion, and toxicity. As new therapeutics (e.g.,
   biologics) are being developed, there is an accompanying need for
   improved chemistries and materials to deliver them to the target site in
   the body, at a therapeutic concentration, and for the required period of
   time. In this Perspective, we provide an historical overview of drug
   delivery and controlled release followed by highlights of four emerging
   areas in the field of drug delivery: systemic RNA delivery, drug
   delivery for localized therapy, oral drug delivery systems, and biologic
   drug delivery systems. In each case, we present the barriers to
   effective drug delivery as well as chemical and materials advances that
   are enabling the field to overcome these hurdles for clinical impact.}},

   were directly synthesized via a modified CVD method followed by
   subsequent high-temperature degassing treatment. The encapsulated

   reaction process. The BN shells of most nanospheres consisted of 2-6
   atomic layers. Because of the low thickness, the obtained BN hollow
   nanospheres presented excellent performance in many aspects. For
   instance, they were demonstrated as useful nanocontainers for
   controllable multistep release of iodine, which could diffuse and be
   encapsulated into the few-layer BN hollow nanospheres when heating. They
   were also promising support materials that could markedly increase the
   photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanocrystals.}},

   coupled nanoFe/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and nanoNiO/MWCNT
   nanocomposite materials for use as anodes and cathodes in rechargeable

   very high discharge capacities (800 mAh g(Fe)(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)
   current density), which exceed that of commercial Ni-Fe cells by nearly
   1 order of magnitude at comparable current densities. These cells also
   showed the lack of any ``activation{''}, typical in commercial
   batteries, where low initial capacity slowly increases during the
   initial 20-50 cycles. The use of a highly conductive MWCNT network
   allows for high-capacity utilization because of rapid and efficient
   electron transport to active metal nanoparticles in oxidized {[}such as
   Fe(OH)(2) or Fe3O4] states. The flexible nature of MWCNTs accommodates
   significant volume changes taking place during phase transformation
   accompanying reduction oxidation reactions in metal electrodes. At the
   same time, we report and discuss that high surface areas of active
   nanoparticles lead to multiple side reactions. Dissolution of Fe anodes
   leads to reprecipitation of significantly larger anode particles.
   Dissolution of Ni cathodes leads to precipitation of Ni metal on the
   anode, thus blocking transport of OH-anions. The electrolyte molarity
   and composition have a significant impact on the capacity utilisation
   and cycling stability.}},

Title = {{Pathway engineering of Propionibacterium jensenii for improved
   production of propionic acid}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Propionic acid (PA) is an important chemical building block widely used
   in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. In our previous
   study, a shuttle vector was developed as a useful tool for engineering
   Propionibacterium jensenii, and two key enzymes-glycerol dehydrogenase
   and malate dehydrogenase-were overexpressed to improve PA titer. Here,
   we aimed to improve PA production further via the pathway engineering of
   P. jensenii. First, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene (ppc) from
   Klebsiella pneumoniae was overexpressed to access the one-step synthesis
   of oxaloacetate directly from phosphoenolpyruvate without pyruvate as
   intermediate. Next, genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and
   pyruvate oxidase (poxB) were deleted to block the synthesis of the
   by-products lactic acid and acetic acid, respectively. Overexpression of
   ppc and deleting ldh improved PA titer from 26.95 +/- 1.21 g.L-1 to

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the equivalent in-plane mechanical properties of
   one dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D), periodic magneto-elastic
   lattices. A lumped parameter model describes the lattices using magnetic
   dipole moments in combination with axial and torsional springs. The
   homogenization procedure is applied to systems linearized about stable
   configurations, which are identified by minimizing potential energy.
   Simple algebraic expressions are derived for the properties of 1D
   structures. Results for 1D lattices show that a variety of stiffness
   changes are possible through reconfiguration, and that magnetization can
   either stiffen or soften a structure. Results for 2D hexagonal and
   re-entrant lattices show that both reconfigurations and magnetization
   have drastic effects on the mechanical properties of lattice structures.
   Lattices can be stiffened or softened and the Poisson's ratio can be
   tuned. Furthermore for certain hexagonal lattices the sign of Poisson's
   ratio can change by varying the lattice magnetization. In some cases
   presented, analytical and numerically estimated equivalent properties
   are validated through numerical simulations that also illustrate the
   unique characteristics of the investigated configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Materials near structural phase transitions find applications in a wide
   range of devices. Typically, phase transitions are determined
   macroscopically through measurements of relevant order parameters and
   related property coefficients. Here, a method for understanding electric
   field induced phase transitions in ferroelectrically active materials at
   the nanometer scale via acoustic detection with band-excitation
   piezoresponse force microscopy (BE-PFM) is introduced. Specifically, the
   field-induced rhombohedral (R) to tetragonal (T) phase transition in
   single crystal 0.72PbMg(1/3)Nb(2/3)O(3)-0.28PbTiO(3) (PMN-PT) is mapped.
   It is shown that due to sample heterogeneity, some regions are more
   prone to the R-T transition, and display signatures in the acquired
   piezoresponse loops, as well as pronounced softening in the elastic
   modulus (monitored via the resonant frequency and calibrated with models
   of cantilever dynamics) that occurs just prior to phase switching.
   Landau-Devonshire thermodynamic theory confirms the stability of the
   tetragonal phase under applied fields in PMN-PT, while phase-field
   modeling suggests that the transition evolves smoothly in the probed
   volume of the tip, both in agreement with the BE-PFM results. These
   results confirm the validity and utility of utilizing acoustic changes
   at phase transitions to detect their onset in nanoscale probed volumes,
   allowing spatial mapping of their onset with unprecedented resolution.}},

Abstract = {{In an aqueous suspension process, protein dispersions facilitated
   improved alignment and organization of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
   chains into highly ordered crystalline structures. A solution of P3HT in
   1,2,4-trichlorbenzene (TCB) was added to an aqueous dispersion of the
   hydrophobin, Cerato ulmin (CU). Upon gentle agitation, the semiconductor
   solution was readily confined within CU membrane-stabilized
   microstructures, often with extended shapes. UV-vis and polarized
   micro-Raman spectroscopy suggested complex, enhanced molecular alignment
   due to a transition from isotropic to liquid crystalline fluid to
   polycrystalline states. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction corroborates
   this interpretation. On aging, the initial CU:P3HT/TCB structures
   develop dendritic architectures that slowly release polymer-containing
   capsules. The counterintuitive evolution from large structures to
   smaller ones suggests the initial structures were nonequilibrium, and it
   opens the door to latex-like processing of semiconducting polymers into
   crystalline, high-performance thin films for device applications.
   Preliminary studies using an organic field-effect transistor
   architecture suggest that optimized processing and device configuration
   will enable highly crystalline active materials with efficient charge
   transport characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a novel adaptive fault tolerant control (FTC)
   scheme for a class of control input and system state constrained
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with both
   multiplicative and additive actuator faults. The input constraints can
   be asymmetric, and the state constraints can be time-varying. A novel
   tan-type time-varying Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is proposed to
   deal with the state constraints, and an auxiliary system is designed to
   analyze the effect of the input constraints. We show that under the
   proposed adaptive FTC scheme, exponential convergence of the output
   tracking error into a small neighbourhood of zero is guaranteed, while
   the constraints on the system state will not be violated during
   operation. Estimation errors for actuator faults are bounded in the
   closed loop. An illustrative example on a two degree-of-freedom robotic
   manipulator is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed FTC scheme. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Here we follow, both experimentally and theoretically, the development
   of magnetism in Tb clusters from the atomic limit, adding one atom at a
   time. The exchange interaction is, surprisingly, observed to drastically
   increase compared to that of bulk, and to exhibit irregular oscillations
   as a function of the interatomic distance. From electronic structure
   theory we find that the theoretical magnetic moments oscillate with
   cluster size in exact agreement with experimental data. Unlike the bulk,
   the oscillation is not caused by the RKKY mechanism. Instead, the
   inter-atomic exchange is shown to be driven by a competition between
   wave-function overlap of the 5d shell and the on-site exchange
   interaction, which leads to a competition between ferromagnetic
   double-exchange and antiferromagnetic super-exchange. This understanding
   opens up new ways to tune the magnetic properties of rare-earth based
   magnets with nano-sized building blocks.}},

Abstract = {{Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) cathode suffers from different
   contaminations, such as CO2, when the cell is operated under the
   realistic conditions. Herein, mechanism of CO2 corrosion on high
   performance Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFN) cathode has been
   studied. Xray diffraction (XRD) and conductivity measurement show that
   CO2 has no detrimental effects on BCFN electrode at 600 degrees C.
   However, the reaction between BCFN and CO2 will occur because of surface
   oxygen loss of BCFN at 800 degrees C. Most importantly, the
   electrochemical impedance spectrum results show that BCFN electrode
   contaminated by CO2 can be recovered by purging air again. These results
   suggest that BCFN could be a very promising cathode material for SOFCs.

Abstract = {{Transition state theory (TST) methods are useful for predicting
   adsorbate diffusivities in nanoporous materials at time scales
   inaccessible to molecular dynamics (MD). Most TST applications treat the
   nanoporous framework as rigid, which is inaccurate in highly flexible
   materials or where adsorbate dimensions are comparable to the size of
   pore apertures. In this study, we demonstrate two computationally
   efficient TST methods for simulating adsorbate diffusion in nanoporous
   materials where framework flexibility has a significant influence on
   diffusion. These methods are applied to light gas diffusion in porous
   organic cage crystal 3 (CC3), a highly flexible molecular crystal that
   has shown promise in gas separation applications. Diffusion in CC3 is
   modeled as a series of uncorrelated adsorbate hops between cage
   molecules and the voids between adjacent cages. The first method we
   applied to compute adsorbate hopping rates in CC3 is implicit ligand
   sampling (ILS). In ILS TST, hopping rates are calculated in an ensemble
   of rigid framework snapshots captured from a fully flexible MD
   trajectory of the empty CC3 structure. The second TST method we applied
   is umbrella sampling (US), where hopping rates are computed from a
   series of biased MD simulations. Our ILS and US TST calculations are
   shown to agree well with direct MD simulation of adsorbate diffusion in
   CC3. We anticipate that the efficient TST methods detailed here will be
   broadly applicable to other classes of flexible nanoporous materials
   such as metal-organic frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, by employing halogen elements (fluorine, chlorine,
   bromine, and iodine) as dopant we demonstrate a unique strategy to
   enhance the output performance of ZnO-based flexible piezoelectric
   nanogenerators. For a halogen-doped ZnO nanowire film, dopants and
   doping concentration dependent lattice strain along the ZnO c-axis are
   established and confirmed by the EDS, XRD, and HRTEM analysis. Although
   lattice strain induced charge separation was theoretically proposed, it
   has not been experimentally investigated for wurtzite structured ZnO
   nanomaterials. Tuning the lattice strain from compressive to tensile
   state along the ZnO c-axis can be achieved by a substitution of halogen
   dopant from fluorine to other halogen elements due to the ionic size
   difference between dopants and oxygen. With its focus on a group of
   nonmetal element induced lattice strain in ZnO-based nanomaterials, this
   work paves the way for enhancing the performance of wurtzite-type
   piezoelectric semiconductor nanomaterials via lattice strain strategy
   which can be employed to construct piezoelectric nanodevices with higher
   efficiency in a cost-effective manner.}},

Abstract = {{The unequal reactivity of the two isocyanate groups in an isophorone

   nanocrystals (CNCs) with both urethane and isocyanate functionality. The
   chemical functionality of the modified CNCs was verified with ATR-FTIR
   analysis and elemental analysis. The selectivity for the secondary
   isocyanate group using dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) as the reaction
   catalyst was confirmed with C-13 NMR. The modified CNCs showed
   improvements in the onset of thermal degradation by 35 degrees C
   compared to the unmodified CNCs. Polyurethane composites based on IPDI
   and a trifunctional polyether alcohol were synthesized using unmodified
   (um-CNC) and modified CNCs (m-CNC). The degree of nanoparticle
   dispersion was qualitatively assessed with polarized optical microscopy.
   It was found that the modification step facilitated superior
   nanoparticle dispersion compared to the um-CNCs, which resulted in
   increases in the tensile strength and work of fracture of over 200\%
   compared to the neat matrix without degradation of elongation at break.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally-induced phase separation (TIPS) method was used to synthesize
   polymer matrix (PM) membranes for reverse osmosis from cellulose
   acetate/polyethylene glycol (CA/PEG300) conjugated with silica
   nanoparticles (SNPs). Experimental data showed that the conjugation of
   SNPs changed the surface properties as dense and asymmetric composite
   structure. The results were explicitly determined by the permeability
   flux and salt rejection efficiency of the PM-SNPs membranes. The effect
   of SNPs conjugation on MgSO4 salt rejection was more significant in
   magnitude than on permeation flux i.e. 2.38 L/m(2) h. FTIR verified that
   SNPs were successfully conjugated on the surface of PM membrane. DSC of
   PM-SNPs shows an improved T-g from 76.2 to 101.8 degrees C for PM and
   PM-54 respectively. Thermal stability of the PM-SNPs membranes was
   observed by TGA which was significantly enhanced with the conjugation of
   SNPs. The micrographs of SEM and AFM showed the morphological changes
   and increase in the valley and ridges on membrane surface. Experimental
   data showed that the PM-54 (0.4 wt\% SNPs) membrane has maximum salt
   rejection capacity and was selected as an optimal membrane. (C) 2015

   (WW). PFOA degradation was significantly suppressed in the presence of
   chloride and carbonate species and did not occur until all the chloride
   was converted to ClO3- in UW and for low DOC concentrations in SW. The
   model was able to simulate the PS decay, pH changes, radical
   concentrations, and ClO3- formation for UW and SW. However, our model
   was unable to simulate PFOA degradation well in WW, possibly from PS
   activation by NOM, which in turn produced sulfate radicals.}},

Abstract = {{Charge regulation in the electrical double layer has important
   implications for ion adsorption, interparticle forces, colloidal
   stability, and deposition phenomena. Although charge regulation
   generally receives little attention, its consequences can be major,
   especially when considering interactions between unequally charged
   surfaces. The present article discusses common approaches to quantify
   such phenomena, especially within classical Poisson-Boltzmann theory,
   and pinpoints numerous situations where a consideration of charge
   regulation is essential. For the interpretation of interaction energy
   profiles, we advocate the use of the constant regulation approximation,
   which summarizes the surface properties in terms of two quantities,
   namely, the diffuse layer potential and the regulation parameter. This
   description also captures some pronounced regulation effects observed in
   the presence of multivalent ions.}},

Abstract = {{Sphingolipids have been identified as important signaling compounds in
   stress responses. However, it is not always clear how different
   sphingolipid profiles are achieved in a particular stress situation.
   Here we propose a detailed mass action model, containing 42 dependent
   variables and 137 reactions, that offers explanations of the roles of
   variant ceramides species, which differ in the lengths of their fatty
   acyl chains and their saturation state, in the response to hydroxyurea
   stress. The simulations demonstrate that the cells manage to achieve
   hydroxyurea tolerance through a well-coordinated, differential usage of
   the variant ceramide species. Moreover, the results suggest that key
   enzymes have different affinities toward saturated and unsaturated fatty
   acyl chains, which implies that the saturation state affords the cells
   with an additional mode of regulation that had not been recognized so
   far. These conclusions from our computational analysis are yet to be
   validated experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Single-span membrane proteins (ssMPs) represent approximately one-half
   of all membrane proteins and play important roles in cellular
   communications. However, like all membrane proteins, ssMPs are prone to
   misfolding and aggregation because of the hydrophobicity of
   transmembrane helices, making them difficult to study using common
   aqueous solution-based approaches. Detergents and membrane mimetics can
   solubilize membrane proteins but do not always result in proper folding
   and functionality. Here, we use cell-free protein synthesis in the
   presence of oil drops to create a one-pot system for the synthesis,
   assembly, and display of functional ssMPs. Our studies suggest that oil
   drops prevent aggregation of some in vitro-synthesized ssMPs by allowing
   these ssMPs to localize on oil surfaces. We speculate that oil drops may
   provide a hydrophobic interior for cotranslational insertion of the
   transmembrane helices and a fluidic surface for proper assembly and
   display of the ectodomains. These functionalized oil drop surfaces could
   mimic cell surfaces and allow ssMPs to interact with cell surface
   receptors under an environment closest to cell-cell communication. Using
   this approach, we showed that apoptosis-inducing human transmembrane
   proteins, FasL and TRAIL, synthesized and displayed on oil drops induce
   apoptosis of cultured tumor cells. In addition, we take advantage of
   hydrophobic interactions of transmembrane helices to manipulate the
   assembly of ssMPs and create artificial clusters on oil drop surfaces.
   Thus, by coupling protein synthesis with self-assembly at the water-oil
   interface, we create a platform that can use recombinant ssMPs to
   communicate with cells.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{164}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{84-92}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in U.S. prisoners
   is high; however, HCV testing and treatment are rare. Infected inmates
   released back into society contribute to the spread of HCV in the
   general population. Routine hepatitis screening of inmates followed by
   new therapies may reduce ongoing HCV transmission.
   Objective: To evaluate the health and economic effect of HCV screening
   and treatment in prisons on the HCV epidemic in society.
   Design: Agent-based microsimulation model of HCV transmission and
   progression of HCV disease.
   Data Sources: Published literature.
   Target Population: Population in U.S. prisons and general community.
   Time Horizon: 30 years.
   Perspective: Societal.
   Interventions: Risk-based and universal opt-out hepatitis C screening in
   prisons, followed by treatment in a portion of patients.
   Outcome Measures: Prevention of HCV transmission and associated disease
   in prisons and society, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs),
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and total prison budget.
   Results of Base-Case Analysis: Implementing risk-based and opt-out
   screening could diagnose 41 900 to 122 700 new HCV cases in prisons in
   the next 30 years. Compared with no screening, these scenarios could
   prevent 5500 to 12 700 new HCV infections caused by released inmates,
   wherein about 90\% of averted infections would have occurred outside of
   prisons. Screening could also prevent 4200 to 11 700 liver-related
   deaths. The ICERs of screening scenarios were \$19 600 to \$29 200 per
   QALY, and the respective first-year prison budget was \$900 to \$1150
   million. Prisons would require an additional 12.4\% of their current
   health care budget to implement such interventions.
   Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results were sensitive to the time
   horizon, and ICERs otherwise remained less than \$50 000 per QALY.
   Limitation: Data on transmission network, reinfection rate, and opt-out
   HCV screening rate are lacking.
   Conclusion: Universal opt-out HCV screening in prisons is highly
   cost-effective and would reduce HCV transmission and HCV-associated
   diseases primarily in the outside community. Investing in U.S. prisons
   to manage hepatitis C is a strategic approach to address the current
   epidemic.}},

   Polymeric Composites with High Thermal Conductivity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Polymer composites with high thermal conductivity have recently
   attracted much attention, along with the rapid development of the
   electronic devices toward higher speed and performance. However, a
   common method to enhance polymer thermal conductivity through an
   addition of high thermally conductive fillers usually cannot provide an
   expected value, especially for composites requiring electrical
   insulation. Here, we show that polymeric composites with silver
   nanoparticle-deposited boron nitride nanosheets as fillers could
   effectively enhance the thermal conductivity of polymer, thanks to the
   bridging connections of silver nanoparticles among boron nitride
   nanosheets. The thermal conductivity of the composite is significantly
   increased from 1.63 W/m-K for the composite filled with the silver
   nanoparticle-deposited boron nitride nanosheets to 3.06 W/m-K at the
   boron nitride nanosheets loading of 25.1 vol \%. In addition, the
   electrically insulating properties of the composite are well preserved.
   Fitting the measured thermal conductivity of epoxy composite with one
   physical model indicates that the composite with silver
   nanoparticle-deposited boron nitride nanosheets outperforms the one with
   boron nitride nanosheets, owning to the lower thermal contact resistance
   among boron nitride nanosheets' interfaces. The finding sheds new light
   on enhancement of thermal conductivity of the polymeric composites which
   concurrently require the electrical insulation.}},

   on GaN using chemical vapor deposition. UV excitation permits
   simultaneous investigation of the diamond (D) and disordered carbon (DC)

   along the diamond growth direction, the DC component of the diamond
   layer is found to be highest near the GaN-on-diamond interface and
   diminish with characteristic length scale of similar to 3.5 mu m.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the diamond near the interface
   confirms the presence of DC. Combined micro-Raman and TEM are used to
   develop an optical method for estimating the DC volume fraction. (C)

Abstract = {{Successful bench-to-bedside translation of nanomedicine relies heavily
   on the development of nanocarriers with superior therapeutic efficacy

   designing tumor-pH-labile linkage-bridged copolymers of clinically
   validated poly(d,l-lactide) and poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG-Dlink(m)-PDLLA) for safe and effective drug delivery. Upon arriving
   at the tumor site, PEG-Dlink(m)-PDLLA nanoparticles will lose the PEG
   layer and increase zeta potential by responding to tumor acidity, which
   significantly enhances cellular uptake and improves the invivo tumor
   inhibition rate to 78.1\% in comparison to 47.8\% of the non-responsive
   control. Furthermore, PEG-Dlink(m)-PDLLA nanoparticles show comparable
   biocompatibility with the clinically used PEG-b-PDLLA micelle. The
   improved therapeutic efficacy and safety demonstrate great promise for
   our strategy in future translational studies.}},

   radio-over-fiber, we release coordination overhead and provide joint
   processing, resource sharing, precise synchronizations, and channel
   orthogonality based on which coordination multipoint transmissions are
   achieved. We theoretically derive gains in a 2 x 1 transmission model
   with space-frequency block coding. A real-time end-to-end experiment
   reveals extended transmission distance, robust stability, improved power
   performance, and enlarged field of view. The significance of
   centralization is experimentally analyzed in terms of impacts from

Title = {{System for Rapid, Precise Modulation of Intraocular Pressure, toward
   Minimally-Invasive In Vivo Measurement of Intracranial Pressure}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Pathologic changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) are commonly observed
   in a variety of medical conditions, including traumatic brain injury,
   stroke, brain tumors, and glaucoma. However, current ICP measurement
   techniques are invasive, requiring a lumbar puncture or surgical
   insertion of a cannula into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled
   ventricles of the brain. A potential alternative approach to ICP
   measurement leverages the unique anatomy of the central retinal vein,
   which is exposed to both intraocular pressure (IOP) and ICP as it
   travels inside the eye and through the optic nerve; manipulating IOP
   while observing changes in the natural pulsations of the central retinal
   vein could potentially provide an accurate, indirect measure of ICP. As
   a step toward implementing this technique, we describe the design,
   fabrication, and characterization of a system that is capable of
   manipulating IOP in vivo with <0.1 mmHg resolution and settling times
   less than 2 seconds. In vitro tests were carried out to characterize
   system performance. Then, as a proof of concept, we used the system to
   manipulate IOP in tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) while video of the
   retinal vessels was recorded and the caliber of a selected vein was
   quantified. Modulating IOP using our system elicited a rapid change in
   the appearance of the retinal vein of interest: IOP was lowered from 10
   to 3 mmHg, and retinal vein caliber sharply increased as IOP decreased
   from 7 to 5 mmHg. Another important feature of this technology is its
   capability to measure ocular compliance and outflow facility in vivo, as
   demonstrated in tree shrews. Collectively, these proof-of-concept
   demonstrations support the utility of this system to manipulate IOP for
   a variety of useful applications in ocular biomechanics, and provide a
   framework for further study of the mechanisms of retinal venous
   pulsation.}},

Abstract = {{Amyloid propagation requires high levels of sequence specificity so that
   only molecules with very high sequence identity can form
   cross-beta-sheet structures of sufficient stringency for incorporation
   into the amyloid fibril. This sequence specificity presents a barrier to
   the transmission of prions between two species with divergent sequences,
   termed a species barrier. Here we study the relative effects of protein
   sequence, seed conformation, and environment on the species barrier
   strength and specificity for the yeast prion protein Sup35p from three
   closely related species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group;
   namely, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus, and
   Saccharomyces paradoxus. Through in vivo plasmid shuffle experiments, we
   show that the major characteristics of the transmission barrier and
   conformational fidelity are determined by the protein sequence rather
   than by the cellular environment. In vitro data confirm that the
   kinetics and structural preferences of aggregation of the S. paradoxus
   and S. bayanus proteins are influenced by anions in accordance with
   their positions in the Hofmeister series, as observed previously for S.
   cerevisiae. However, the specificity of the species barrier is primarily
   affected by the sequence and the type of anion present during the
   formation of the initial seed, whereas anions present during the seeded
   aggregation process typically influence kinetics rather than the
   specificity of prion conversion. Therefore, our work shows that the
   protein sequence and the conformation variant (strain) of the prion seed
   are the primary determinants of cross-species prion specificity both in
   vivo and in vitro.}},

   resolution of relatively large material volumes and have generated big
   datasets, Although such computations have captured faithfully the many
   features observed in the corresponding experiments, there has not yet
   been a broadly adopted framework to quantitatively analyze the predicted
   material structures and compare them rigorously with experiments. This
   paper demonstrates that the recently developed framework for the
   quantification of the material structure, based on the concepts of
   2-point spatial correlations and principal component analyses (PCA), can
   address this critical need. It is further demonstrated that the adoption
   of a rigorous framework for structure quantification can help to
   establish objectively many of the modeling parameters and choices made
   in the simulations. (c) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline, nanoporous platinum (NP Pt)
   is investigated using a combination of experimental measurements and
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The NP Pt considered in this work
   is characterized by an hierarchical internal structure with comparable
   characteristic strut thickness t and grain size D. The hardness of NP Pt
   with typical strut thickness t= 2-10 nm is measured by nanoindentation
   experiments to be H-f =0.2-1.3 GPa. Using standard scaling assumptions,
   a characteristic individual strut strength can be estimated from the
   hardness measurements as sigma(s) = 0.3-2.5 GPa. These values compare
   reasonably well with the ones obtained from MD simulations of isolated
   struts, represented as nanowires with crystalline structure similar to
   the experimentally observed NP Pt. The findings suggest that for
   nanocrystalline NP structures with t D the strength of individual struts
   decreases gradually with decreasing strut size, so that the overall
   mechanical strength remains relatively high. The simulations provide
   insight into the underlying deformation mechanisms and behavior within
   the struts during mechanical loading. In particular, as struts decrease
   in size, they accommodate strain primarily through grain boundary
   plasticity, such as sliding. However, as strut size increases,
   dislocations begin to play a larger role in accommodating strain. (c)

Abstract = {{An inductively-powered wireless integrated neural recording system
   (WINeR-7) is presented for wireless and battery-less neural recording
   from freely-behaving animal subjects inside a wirelessly powered
   standard homecage. The WINeR-7 system employs a novel wide-swing dual
   slope charge sampling (DSCS) analog front-end (AFE) architecture, which
   performs amplification, filtering, sampling, and analog-to-time
   conversion with minimal interference and small amount of power. The
   output of the DSCS-AFE produces a pseudodigital pulse-width modulated
   (PWM) signal. A circular shift register time-division multiplexes (TDM)
   the PWM pulses to create a TDM-PWM signal, which is fed into an on-chip
   915-MHz transmitter (Tx). The AFE and Tx are supplied at 1.8 and 4.2 V,
   respectively, by a power management block, which includes a high
   efficiency active rectifier and automatic resonance tuning, operating at
   13.56 MHz. The eight-channel system-on-a-chip was fabricated in a
   0.35-mu m CMOS process, occupying 5x2.5 mm(2) and consumed 51.4 mW. For
   each channel, the sampling rate is 21.48 kHz and the power consumption
   is 19.3 mu W. In vivo experiments were conducted on freely-behaving rats
   in an energized homecage by continuously delivering 51.4 mW to the
   WINeR-7 system in a closed-loop fashion and recording local field
   potentials.}},

   meta-materials for patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{Patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms are becoming available with
   the advent of additive manufacturing. Phantoms currently in use are
   focused on the geometrical accuracy and mechanical properties under
   small deformation. Mimicking the mechanical properties at large
   deformation is challenging because of the inherent difference between
   the mechanical behaviors of polymeric materials and that of human
   tissues. In this study, the mechanical behavior of soft tissues under a
   uniaxial tension is mimicked by dual-material 3D printed meta-materials
   with stiff micro-structured fibers embedded in a soft polymeric matrix.
   Although the two base materials are strain-softening polymers, some of
   the designed meta-materials demonstrate certain degree of
   strain-stiffening behavior. Further investigation shows how the
   stress-strain curve of the meta-materials can be controlled by the
   design parameters. Sensitivity analysis is used to study the effects of
   each parameter. General design guidelines are proposed based on the
   results of the experiments. Dual-material 3D printed meta-materials have
   great potential in fabricating patient-specific phantoms with accurate
   mechanical properties that are associated with the gender, age,
   ethnicity, and other physiological/pathological characteristics.
   Mechanically accurate phantoms can play an important role in a variety
   of biomedical applications, including validation of computational
   models, testing of medical devices, surgery planning, medical education
   and training, and doctor-patient interaction. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{220}},
Pages = {{44-57}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Certain properties of titania and the ammonium- and proton-form of Y
   zeolites silica/alumina = 5.2 were explored before and after treatment
   by triethylamine (TEA). The effect of the triethylamine upon the
   physical and chemical properties of both titania and the zeolite were
   characterized by physical and chemical adsorption methods. BET surface
   area data showed enhanced surface area of the TEA-treated nanotitania
   over the untreated nanotitania; whereas, the TEA-treated zeolite showed
   a considerable decrease in surface area compared to the untreated
   zeolite. A lower bound on the exothermic heat release from the sol-gel
   generated TiO2 nanoparticle-TEA interaction has been evaluated.
   Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of the TEA-treated Y zeolite
   showed that weakly adsorbed TEA left the surface between 150 and 300
   degrees C; strongly adsorbed TEA decomposed to ethylene and ammonia at
   higher temperatures. Methanol adsorption isotherms and
   temperature-programmed, surface reaction (TPSR) were used to understand
   further the Zeolite-TEA interactions and correlations were made to CO2
   adsorption. XPS, IR, and Raman spectroscopies, powder XRD, and Al-27
   MAS-NMR spectroscopy were used characterize the changes attending the
   TEA adsorption. Pre-adsorbed, triethylamine decorated acid sites so as
   to neutralize these sites for the reaction of methanol to dimethyl
   ether. Carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, products of the methanol probe
   reaction, were observed - suggesting that basic sites are present in
   this treated zeolite and titania. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Band structure effects on resonant tunneling in III-V quantum wells
   versus two-dimensional vertical heterostructures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Since the invention of the Esaki diode, resonant tunneling devices have
   been of interest for applications including multi-valued logic and
   communication systems. These devices are characterized by the presence
   of negative differential resistance in the current-voltage
   characteristic, resulting from lateral momentum conservation during the
   tunneling process. While a large amount of research has focused on III-V
   material systems, such as the GaAs/AlGaAs system, for resonant tunneling
   devices, poor device performance and device-to-device variability have
   limited widespread adoption. Recently, the symmetric field-effect
   transistor (symFET) was proposed as a resonant tunneling device
   incorporating symmetric 2-D materials, such as transition metal
   dichalcogenides (TMDs), separated by an interlayer barrier, such as
   hexagonal boron-nitride. The achievable peak-to-valley ratio for TMD
   symFETs has been predicted to be higher than has been observed for III-V
   resonant tunneling devices. This work examines the effect that band
   structure differences between III-V devices and TMDs has on device
   performance. It is shown that tunneling between the quantized subbands
   in III-V devices increases the valley current and decreases device
   performance, while the interlayer barrier height has a negligible impact
   on performance for barrier heights greater than approximately 0.5 eV.

Title = {{Effect of Framework Flexibility on C-8 Aromatic Adsorption at High
   Loadings in Metal-Organic Frameworks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{370-376}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Many simulations of adsorption in nanoporous materials such as
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) treat the adsorbing materials as rigid.
   We show that the use of this approximation to describe the
   multicomponent adsorption of C-8 aromatics in MOFs under industrial
   conditions gives results that differ dramatically from descriptions that
   include local framework flexibility. To address this issue, we develop
   an efficient method for capturing the effect of framework flexibility on
   adsorption in nanoporous materials. Our flexible snapshot method uses
   GCMC simulations to model adsorption in snapshots collected using fully
   flexible MD simulations and can be applied to any framework-adsorbate
   system for which reliable force fields are available. Our method gives
   considerably better agreement with experiments for multicomponent C-8
   aromatic selectivities in multiple MOFs than more traditional
   calculations using a single rigid framework. The rotation of organic
   linkers in the MOFs has a strong influence on selectivities in these
   systems. Because many MOFs contain this structural feature, we expect
   that using simulations that incorporate this kind of internal
   flexibility will be important in obtaining accurate adsorption
   predictions in a range of circumstances. This is especially true for
   many industrially relevant separations in MOFs, in particular, those
   that exploit high pore loadings of adsorbed species.}},

Title = {{Tandem Solar Cells from Accessible Low Band-Gap Polymers Using an
   Efficient Interconnecting Layer}},
Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{16-19}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Tandem solar cell architectures are designed to improve device
   photoresponse by enabling the capture of wider range of solar spectrum
   as compared to single-junction device. However, the practical
   realization of this concept in bulk-heterojunction polymer systems
   requires the judicious design of a transparent interconnecting layer
   compatible with both polymers. Moreover, the polymers selected should be
   readily synthesized at large scale (>1 kg) and high performance. In this
   work, we demonstrate a novel tandem polymer solar cell that combines low
   band gap poly isoindigo {[}P(T3-iI)-2], which is easily synthesized in
   kilogram quantities, with a novel Cr/MoO3 interconnecting layer. Cr/MoO3
   is shown to be greater than 80\% transparent above 375 nm and an
   efficient interconnecting layer for P(T3-iI)-2 and PCDTBT, leading to
   6\% power conversion efficiencies under AM 1.5G illumination. These
   results serve to extend the range of interconnecting layer materials for
   tandem cell fabrication by establishing, for the first time, that a
   thin, evaporated layer of Cr/MoO3 can work as an effective
   interconnecting layer in a tandem polymer solar cells made with scalable
   photoactive materials.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{A facile approach using click chemistry is demonstrated for
   immobilization of metalloporphyrins onto the surface of silica-coated
   iron oxide particles. Oleic-acid stabilized iron oxide nanocrystals were
   prepared by thermal decomposition of iron(III) acetylacetonate. Their
   crystallinity, morphology, and superparamagnetism were determined using
   X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and a
   superconducting quantum interference device. Monodisperse coreshell
   particles were produced in the silica-coating of iron oxide via
   microemulsion synthesis. Surface modification of these particles was
   performed in two steps, which included the reaction of silica-coated
   iron oxide particles with 3-bromopropyltrichlorosilane, followed by
   azido-functionalization with sodium azide. Monoalkylated porphyrins were
   prepared using the Williamson ether synthesis of commercially available
   tetra(4-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin with propargyl bromide in the presence
   of a base. 1H NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
   confirmed the identity of the compounds. The prepared monoalkyne
   porphyrins were zinc-metalated prior to their introduction to
   azide-functionalized, silica-coated iron oxide particles in the click
   reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
   and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize
   the surface chemistry after each step in the reaction. In addition,
   particle size was determined using dynamic light scattering and
   microscopy. The presented methodology is versatile and can be extended
   to other photoreactive systems, such as phthalocyanines and
   boron-dipyrromethane, which may lead to new materials for optical,
   photonic, and biological applications.}},

Title = {{Direct calculation of modal contributions to thermal conductivity via
   Green-Kubo modal analysis}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{We derived a new method for direct calculation of the modal
   contributions to thermal conductivity, which is termed Green-Kubo modal
   analysis (GKMA). The GKMA method combines the lattice dynamics formalism
   with the Green-Kubo formula for thermal conductivity, such that the
   thermal conductivity becomes a direct summation of modal contributions,
   where one need not define the phonon velocity. As a result, the GKMA
   method can be applied to any material/group of atoms, where the atoms
   vibrate around stable equilibrium positions, which includes
   non-stoichiometric compounds, random alloys, amorphous materials and
   even rigid molecules. By using molecular dynamics simulations to obtain
   the time history of each mode's contribution to the heat current, one
   naturally includes anharmonicity to full order and can obtain insight
   into the interactions between different modes through the
   cross-correlations. As an example, we applied the GMKA method to
   crystalline and amorphous silicon. The modal contributions at each
   frequency result from the analysis and thereby allow one to apply a
   quantum correction to the mode heat capacity to determine the
   temperature dependence of thermal conductivity. The predicted
   temperature dependent thermal conductivity for amorphous silicon shows
   the best agreement with experiments to date. The GKMA method provides
   new insight into the nature of phonon transport, as it casts the problem
   in terms of mode-mode correlation instead of scattering, and provides a
   general unified formalism that can be used to understand phonon-phonon
   interactions in essentially any class of materials or structures where
   the atoms vibrate around stable equilibrium sites.}},

Journal = {{DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{198}},
Pages = {{232-240}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Given a set of n random events in a probability space, represented by n
   Bernoulli variables necessarily independent), we consider the
   probability that at least k out of n events occur. When partial
   distribution information, i.e., marginal probabilities and all joint
   probabilities of up to m (m < n) events, are provided, only an upper or
   lower bound can be computed for this probability. Recently Prekopa and
   Gao (2005) proposed a polynomialsize linear program to obtain strong
   bounds for the probability of union of events, i.e., k = 1. In this
   work, we propose inequalities that can be added to this linear program
   to strengthen the bounds. We also show that with a slight modification
   of the objective function this linear program and the inequalities can
   be used for the more general case where k is any positive integer less
   than or equal to n. We use the strengthened linear program to compute
   probability bounds for the examples used by Prekopa and Gao, and the
   comparison shows significant improvement in the bound quality. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A series of ternary mixed metal oxides containing Group IIIA elements
   (In, Ga, Al) is prepared by means of an alcoholic co-precipitation
   method. Specifically, oxide catalysts with a molar composition of
   In/Ga/Al=5: 15: 80, 10: 10: 80, and 15: 5: 80 are reported. The chemical
   composition, redox properties, and catalyst structures are fully
   characterized, with the results suggesting that the indium, gallium, and
   aluminum moieties are well-dispersed in the catalysts. The catalysts are
   evaluated for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 570 and 600 degrees C
   under 1 atm total pressure. The most effective catalyst with a
   composition of In/Ga/Al=5: 15: 80 provides 17\% conversion and
   approximately 86\% C3H6 selectivity with an initial activity of 4.6
   mmolh(-1)gcat(-1) and 24.1 mmolh(-1)m(-2). The intrinsic activity on an
   active metal (i.e. indium and gallium) basis is approximately 3 times
   that of the In2O3-Ga2O3 family and approxi-mately 3-9 times that of the
   In2O3-Al2O3 family. The catalyst deactivates with time on stream, and
   regeneration tests show that removal of surface coke and recovery of an
   In2O3 state helps to regain the initial activity, whereas reducing In2O3
   domains into In-0 does not allow for recovery of the performance. Raman
   analysis of the carbonaceous species deposited on the catalyst indicates
   catalysts with higher gallium content give more graphitic carbon, which
   correlates with higher C3H6 selectivity, whereas catalysts with more
   disordered coke are associated with lower selectivity. However, higher
   gallium content causes more coke formation, which leads to faster
   deactivation. This initial study of this family of mixed oxides suggests
   that an ideal In/Ga ratio may exist whereby catalyst properties may be
   optimized.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{215-226}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2D MRS) is challenging,
   even with state-of-art compressive sensing methods, such as L1-sparsity
   method. In this work, using the prior that the 2D MRS can be regarded as
   a series of Lorentzian functions, we aim to develop a robust
   Lorentzian-sparsity based spectroscopy reconstruction method for
   high-dimensional MRS.
   The proposed method sparsifies 2D MRS in Lorentzian functions. Instead
   of thousands of pixel-wise variables, this Lorentzian-sparsity method
   significantly reduces the number of unknowns to several geometric
   variables, such as the center, magnitude and shape parameters for each
   Lorentzian function. The spectroscopy reconstruction is formulated as a
   nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, and the simulated
   annealing algorithm is developed to solve the problem.
   The proposed method was compared with inverse FFT method and L1-sparsity
   method, under various undersampling factors. While FFT and L1 results
   contained severe artifacts, the Lorentzian-sparsity results provided
   significantly improved spectroscopy.
   A new 2D MRS reconstruction method is proposed using the Lorentzian
   sparsity, with significantly improved MRS reconstruction quality, in
   comparison with standard inverse FFT method or state-of-art L1-sparsity
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In order to better understand the behavior and governing characteristics

   wetting transparency. A microscopic analysis was also conducted in order
   to identify the parameters, such as the interaction potential energy
   landscape and the interfacial liquid structure that govern the wetting
   behavior of graphene-coated surfaces. The interfacial liquid structure
   was found to be different between uncoated Si(100) and the
   graphene-coated version and very similar between uncoated Si(111) and
   the graphene-coated version. However, the concentration of liquid
   particles for both silicon surfaces was found to be very similar under

Abstract = {{Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated the
   dynamic reconstruction and evolution of ZnO polar and non-polar surfaces
   under high-energy electron beam irradiation. Electron beam radiolysis
   creates oxygen vacancies and a Zn rich (0001) surface. Positive polar
   charges at the (0001) surface expel loosely bonded Zn ions to diffuse
   away from the (0001) polar surface. As a result, mass loss was observed
   around the (0001) surface. Dehydration by the electron beam breaks the
   charge balance on the (000 (\$) over bar1) polar surface. The negative
   charges on the (000 (\$) over bar1) surface suppress the radiolysis
   effect and further absorb Zn ions to the surface to neutral the polar
   charges. The ideal stacking sequences of Zn ions in hexagonal ZnO
   structure can be considered as ABAB. along its c axis, while the
   absorbed individual Zn ion on the (000 (\$) over bar1) surface occupies
   the C site to form three bonds with surface O ions beneath, instead of
   one bond in the ideal structure. With more Zn ion absorption and surface
   oxidization, new nanocrystals grow up from the (000 (\$) over bar1)
   polar surface. New nanocrystals nucleated at the (01 (\$) over bar 10)
   non-polar surface are driven by the electric field of the polar charges
   as well, for the Zn ions were always observed to absorb on the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{For many decades, phonon transport at interfaces has been interpreted in
   terms of phonons impinging on an interface and subsequently transmitting
   a certain fraction of their energy into the other material. It has also
   been largely assumed that when one joins two bulk materials, interfacial
   phonon transport can be described in terms of the modes that exist in
   each material separately. However, a new formalism for calculating the
   modal contributions to thermal interface conductance with full inclusion
   of anharmonicity has been recently developed, which now offers a means
   for checking the validity of this assumption. Here, we examine the
   assumption of using the bulk materials' modes to describe the
   interfacial transport. The results indicate that when two materials are
   joined, a new set of vibrational modes are required to correctly
   describe the transport. As the modes are analyzed, certain
   classifications emerge and some of the most important modes are
   localized at the interface and can exhibit large conductance
   contributions that cannot be explained by the current physical picture

Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive inherited disease associated with
   multiorgan damage that compromises epithelial and inflammatory cell
   function. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have significantly
   advanced the potential of developing a personalized cell-based therapy
   for diseases like CF by generating patient-specific stem cells that can
   be differentiated into cells that repair tissues damaged by disease
   pathology. The F508del mutation in airway epithelial cell-derived
   CF-iPSCs was corrected with small/short DNA fragments (SDFs) and
   sequence-specific TALENs. An allele-specific PCR, cyclic enrichment
   strategy gave similar to 100-fold enrichment of the corrected CF-iPSCs
   after six enrichment cycles that facilitated isolation of corrected
   clones. The seamless SDF-based gene modification strategy used to
   correct the CF-iPSCs resulted in pluripotent cells that, when
   differentiated into endoderm/airway-like epithelial cells showed
   wild-type (wt) airway epithelial cell cAMP-dependent Cl ion transport or
   showed the appropriate cell-type characteristics when differentiated
   along mesoderm/hematopoietic inflammatory cell lineage pathways.}},

Title = {{Intraoperative Spectroscopy with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Image-Guided
   Surgery of Malignant Brain Tumors}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{Intraoperative cancer imaging and fluorescence-guided surgery have
   attracted considerable interest because fluorescence signals can provide
   real-time guidance to assist a surgeon in differentiating cancerous and
   normal tissues. Recent advances have led to the clinical use of a
   natural fluorophore called protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) for image-guided
   surgical resection of high-grade brain tumors (glioblastomas). However,
   traditional fluorescence imaging methods have only limited detection
   sensitivity and identification accuracy and are unable to detect
   low-grade or diffuse infiltrating gliomas (DIGs). Here we report a
   low-cost hand-held spectroscopic device that is capable of
   ultrasensitive detection of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence in vivo,
   together with intraoperative spectroscopic data obtained from both
   animal xenografts and human brain tumor specimens. The results indicate
   that intraoperative spectroscopy is at least 3 orders of magnitude more
   sensitive than the current surgical microscopes, allowing ultrasensitive
   detection of as few as 1000 tumor cells. For detection specificity,
   intraoperative spectroscopy allows the differentiation of brain tumor
   cells from normal brain cells with a contrast signal ratio over 100. In
   vivo animal studies reveal that protoporphyrin IX fluorescence is
   strongly correlated with both MRI and histological staining, confirming
   that the fluorescence signals are highly specific to tumor cells.
   Furthermore, ex vivo spectroscopic studies of excised brain tissues
   demonstrate that the hand-held spectroscopic device is capable of
   detecting diffuse tumor margins with low fluorescence contrast that are
   not detectable with current systems in the operating room. These results
   open new opportunities for intraoperative detection and
   fluorescence-guided resection of microscopic and low-grade glioma brain
   tumors with invasive or diffusive margins.}},

Title = {{Transformation of Tetracycline Antibiotics and Fe(II) and Fe(III)
   Species Induced by Their Complexation}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{145-153}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) are frequently detected micropollutants
   and are known to have a strong tendency to complex with metal ions such
   as Fe(II) and Fe(III) in aquatic environments. Experiments with Fe(II)
   and TCs showed that the complexation of Fe(II) with tetracycline (TTC),
   oxytetracycline (OTC), or chlorotetracycline (CTC) could lead to the
   accelerated oxidation of Fe(II) and the promoted degradation of TCs
   simultaneously. The reaction started with complexation of Fe(II) with TC
   followed by oxidation of the Fe(II)-TC complex by dissolved oxygen to
   generate a Fe(III)-TC complex and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS
   (primarily .OH) then degraded TC. The oxidation rate constants of Fe(II)
   in the Fe-II-H2L and Fe-II-HL complexes were 0.269 and 1.511 min(-1),
   respectively, at ambient conditions (pH 7, 22 degrees C, and Po-2,. of
   0.21 atm), which were about 60 and 350 times of the oxidation rate of
   uncomplexed Fe(II). Humic acids (HA) compete with TCs for Fe(II), but
   the effect was negligible at moderate HA concentrations (<= 10 mg.L-1).
   Experiments with Fe(III) and TCs showed that the complexation of Fe(III)
   with TC could generate oxidized TC and Fe(II) without the need of oxygen
   at a relatively slower rate compared to the reaction involving Fe(II),
   02, and TCs. These findings indicate the mutually influenced
   environmental transformation of TCs and Fe(II) and Fe(III) induced by
   their complexation. These newly identified reactions could play an
   important role in affecting the environmental fate of TCs and cycling of
   Fe(II) and Fe(III) in TCs-contaminated water and soil systems.}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The nitrate radical (NO3) is the dominant nighttime oxidant in most
   urban and rural environments and reacts rapidly with biogenic volatile
   organic compounds to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and organic
   nitrates (ON). Here, we study the formation of SOA and ON from the NO3
   oxidation of two monoterpenes (alpha-pinene and beta-pinene) and
   investigate how they evolve during photochemical aging. High SOA mass
   loadings are produced in the NO3+beta-pinene reaction, during which we
   detected 41 highly oxygenated gas- and particle-phase ON possessing 4 to
   9 oxygen atoms. The fraction of particle-phase ON in the beta-pinene SOA
   remains fairly constant during photochemical aging. In contrast to the
   NO3+beta-pinene reaction, low SOA mass loadings are produced during the
   NO3+alpha-pinene reaction, during which only S highly oxygenated gas-
   and particle-phase ON are detected. The majority of the particle-phase
   ON evaporates from the alpha-pinene SOA during photochemical aging, thus
   exhibiting a drastically different behavior from that of beta-pinene
   SOA. Our results indicate that nighttime ON formed by NO3+monoterpene
   chemistry can serve as either permanent or temporary NO sinks depending
   on the monoterpene precursor.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets poses a
   challenge to the alignment of reads to reference genomes in terms of
   alignment quality and execution speed. Some available aligners have been
   shown to obtain high quality mappings at the expense of long execution
   times. Finding fast yet accurate software solutions is of high
   importance to research, since availability and size of NGS datasets
   continue to increase. In this work we present an efficient
   parallelization approach for NGS short-read alignment on multi-core
   clusters. Our approach takes advantage of a distributed shared memory
   programming model based on the new UPC++ language. Experimental results
   using the CUSHAW3 aligner show that our implementation based on dynamic
   scheduling obtains good scalability on multi-core clusters. Through our
   evaluation, we are able to complete the single-end and paired-end
   alignments of 246 million reads of length 150 base-pairs in 11.54 and
   16.64 minutes, respectively, using 32 nodes with four AMD Opteron 6272
   16-core CPUs per node. In contrast, the multi-threaded original tool
   needs 2.77 and 5.54 hours to perform the same alignments on the 64 cores
   of one node. The source code of our parallel implementation is publicly
   available at the CUSHAW3 homepage (http://cushaw3.sourceforge.net).}},

Abstract = {{The effects of 90 degrees partial dislocation on the performance of Si
   anode in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) and Mg-ion batteries (MIBs) are studied
   by the multi-scale simulation method. In defect-free Si crystal, Na and
   Mg interstitials prefer to stay at tetrahedral (T-d) site and the
   migration path is T-d-Hex-T-d. Because of the insufficient binding
   strength of Na (-0.79 eV) and Mg (-0.969 eV), perfect Si crystal is not
   suitable for the storage of them. In the presence of 90 degrees partial
   dislocation, its spacious cores may promote the binding energies of Na
   and Mg to 0.423 eV and 0.4 eV, respectively. This leads to the insertion
   of Na and Mg into Si anode possible. Moreover, it is thermodynamically
   and kinetically favorable for Na and Mg diffusion into the 90 degrees
   partial dislocation core and surrounding areas. They may concentrate in
   the dislocation core. This core can also provide a fast diffusion avenue
   for Na (Mg) by lowing the migration barriers from 1.04 eV (1.02 eV) to
   0.75 eV (0.804 eV). Therefore, 90 degrees partial dislocation may
   improve the charge/discharge rate of NIBs and MIBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   nanocomposite under shock compression}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Laser-driven shock compression experiments and corresponding finite
   element method simulations are carried out to investigate the blueshift
   in the optical emission spectra under continuous laser excitation of a
   dilute composite consisting of 0.15\% CdTe quantum dots by weight
   embedded in polyvinyl alcohol polymer. This material is a potential
   candidate for use as internal stress sensors. The analyses focus on the
   time histories of the wavelength blue-shift for shock loading with
   pressures up to 7.3 GPa. The combined measurements and calculations
   allow a relation between the wavelength blueshift and pressure for the
   loading conditions to be extracted. It is found that the blueshift first
   increases with pressure to a maximum and subsequently decreases with
   pressure. This trend is different from the monotonic increase of
   blueshift with pressure observed under conditions of quasistatic
   hydrostatic compression. Additionally, the blueshift in the shock
   experiments is much smaller than that in hydrostatic experiments at the
   same pressure levels. The differences in responses are attributed to the
   different stress states achieved in the shock and hydrostatic
   experiments and the time dependence of the mechanical response of the
   polymer in the composite. The findings offer a potential guide for the
   design and development of materials for internal stress sensors for
   shock conditions. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Epithelial cells cultured within collagen and laminin gels proliferate
   to form hollow and polarized spherical structures, recapitulating the
   formation of a rudimentary epithelial organ. However, the contributions
   of extracellular matrix (ECM) biochemical and biophysical properties to
   morphogenesis are poorly understood because of uncontrolled presentation
   of multiple adhesive ligands, limited control over mechanical
   properties, and lot-to-lot compositional variability in these natural
   ECMs. We engineered synthetic ECM-mimetic hydrogels with independent
   control over adhesive ligand density, mechanical properties, and
   proteolytic degradation to study the impact of ECM properties on
   epithelial morphogenesis. Normal cyst growth, polarization, and lumen
   formation were restricted to a narrow range of ECM elasticity, whereas
   abnormal morphogenesis was observed at lower and higher elastic moduli.
   Adhesive ligand density dramatically regulated apicobasal polarity and
   lumenogenesis independently of cell proliferation. Finally, a threshold
   level of ECM protease degradability was required for apicobasal polarity
   and lumen formation. This synthetic ECM technology provides new insights
   into how cells transduce ECM properties into complex morphogenetic
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical nanomaterials are highly suitable as electrocatalysts and

   The intrinsic kinetics of an electrocatalyst are associated with the

   structures need to be controlled. A comparative state-of-the-art review
   of catalysts and supports is provided along with detailed synthesis
   methods. To further improve the design of these hierarchical
   nanomaterials, in-depth research on the effect of materials architecture
   on reaction and transport kinetics is necessary. Inspiration can be
   derived from nature, which is full of very effective hierarchical
   structures. Developing fundamental understanding of how desired

Abstract = {{Objective: To systematically examine the effects of robotic therapy on
   upper extremity (UE) function in children with cerebral palsy (CP).
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, CINAHL,
   Cochrane, PsychInfo, TRIP, and Web of Science up to July 2013. Studies
   of children with CP, using robotic therapy and measures of UE were
   included. Results: Nine articles using three different robotic systems
   were included. Of these, seven were case studies. Overall, robotic
   therapy showed the potential effects as all studies reported at least
   one positive outcome: a moderate effect in improving reaching duration,
   smoothness, or decreased muscle tone, and a small to large effect in
   standardized clinical assessment (e.g. Fugl-Meyer). Conclusion: This
   review confirms the potential for robotic therapy to improve UE function
   in children with CP. However, the paucity of group design studies
   summons the need for more rigorous research before conclusive
   recommendations can be made.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{220-225}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{We use three dimensional computer simulations to investigate the free
   swimming of plunging elastic plates with aspect ratios ranging from 0.5
   to 5 in a viscous fluid with Reynolds number 250. We show that maximum
   velocity occurs near the first natural frequency regardless of aspect
   ratio, whereas the maximum swimming economy occurs away from the first
   natural frequency and is associated with a specific swimmer bending
   pattern. Moreover, we show that the low aspect ratio swimmers, those
   with wider spans, are not only the fastest but also the most economical.
   The faster speeds are associated with a decrease in effective drag for
   low aspect ratio plunging swimmers. We find that the recently proposed
   vortex-induced drag model adequately explains the drag reduction by
   suggesting that the smaller relative size of side vortices in low aspect
   ratio swimmers creates less drag per unit width. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   body centered cubic beta) arc modelled using Density Functional Theory
   (DFT). The Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) is used to
   determine structural and elastic properties, as well as the density of
   states. The Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximations are used to predict the
   phases' bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli; and Poisson's ratios.
   Four exchange-correlation potentials are used and compared. These are
   the LDA, the PBE-GGA, the RPBE, and the PBEsol. All potentials showed
   relatively good accuracy when predicting the lattice constant. The RPBE

Title = {{Grain Subdivision Fission Gas Swelling Model for UO2}},
Journal = {{MRS ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{2465-2470}},
Abstract = {{Under high burnup UO2 fuel pellets can experience high bumup structure
   (HBS) at the rim also known as rim effect. The HBS is exceptionally
   porous with line grain sizes. HBS increases the swelling further than it
   would have achieved at a larger grain size. A theoretical swelling model
   is used in conjunction with a grain subdivision simulation to calculate
   the swelling of UO2. In UO2 the nucleation sites are at vacancies and
   the bubbles are concentrated at grain boundaries. Vacancies are created
   due to irradiation and gas diffusion is dependent on vacancy migration.
   In addition to intragranular bubbles, there are intergranular bubbles at
   the grain boundaries. Over time as intragranular bubbles and gas atoms
   accumulate on the grain boundaries, the intergranular bubbles grow and
   cover the grain faces. Eventually they grow into voids and interconnect
   along the grain boundaries, which can lead to fission gas release when
   the interconnection reaches the surface. This is known as the saturation
   point. While the swelling model used does not originally incorporate a
   changing grain size, the simulation allows for more accurate swelling
   calculations by introducing a fractional HBS based on the temperature
   and bumup of the pellet. The fractional FIBS is introduced with a
   varying grain size. Our simulations determine the level of swelling and
   saturation as a function of bumup by combining an independent model and
   simulation to obtain a more comprehensive model.}},

Abstract = {{A Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, using a modified version of the

   varied by introducing a detachment rate for individual vacancies leaving
   the void and either treating this value as constant for all size voids
   or having this value be dependent on the size of the void. Molecular
   Dynamics simulations were used to determine the binding energies of
   vacancies for voids of varying size. The simulation was then run over
   long time periods to determine the number of defects in the simulation
   under irradiation conditions. It was found that the additional
   complexity of size dependent void detachment rates had little effect on
   the defect concentrations and thus a constant barrier should be
   sufficient for simulations of voids in bcc metals.}},

Abstract = {{In support of a recent surge in research to develop an accident tolerant
   reactor, accident tolerant fuels and cladding candidates are being
   investigated. Relative motion between the fuel rods and fuel assembly
   spacer grids can lead to excessive fuel rod wear and, in some cases, to
   fuel rod failure. Based on industry data, grid-to-rod-fretting (GTRF)
   has been the number one cause of fuel failures within the U.S.
   pressurized water reactor (PWR) fleet, accounting for more than 700 of
   all PWR leaking fuel assemblies. APMT, an Fe-Cr-Al steel alloy, is being
   examined for the I2S-LWR project as a possible alternative to
   conventional fuel cladding in a nuclear reactor due to its favorable
   performance under LOCA conditions. Tests were performed to examine the
   reliability of the cladding candidate under simulated fretting
   conditions of a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The contact is
   simulated with a rectangular and a cylindrical specimen over a line
   contact area. A combination of SEM analysis and wear \& work rate
   calculations arc performed on the samples to determine their performance
   and wear under fretting. While APMT can perform favorably in loss of
   coolant accident scenarios, it also needs to perform well when compared
   to Zircaloy-4 with respect to fretting wear.}},

   with a DNN-HMM system enables modeling of multi-frame distributions,
   which conventional systems find difficult to accomplish. To further
   improve the performance, more confusable data is generated by boosting
   the likelihood of the sentences that have more errors. The keyword
   spotting system is implemented within a weighted finite state transducer
   (WFST) framework and the DNN is optimized using standard backpropagation
   and stochastic gradient decent. We evaluate the performance of the
   proposed framework on a large vocabulary spontaneous conversational
   telephone speech dataset (Switchboard-1 Release 2). The proposed
   approach achieves an absolute figure of merit improvement of 3.65\% over
   the baseline system.}},

Abstract = {{Active voice authentication (AVA) is a new mode of talker
   authentication, in which the authentication is performed continuously on
   very short segments of the voice signal, which may have instantaneously
   undergone change of talker. AVA is necessary in providing real-time
   monitoring of a device authorized for a particular user. The
   authentication test thus cannot rely on a long history of the voice data
   nor any past decisions. Most conventional voice authentication
   techniques that operate on the assumption that the entire test utterance
   is from only one talker with a claimed identity (including i-vector)
   fail to meet this stringent requirement. This paper presents a different
   signal modeling technique, within a conditional vector-quantization
   framework and with matching short-time statistics that take into account
   the co-located speech codes to meet the new challenge. As one variation,
   the temporally co-located VQ (TC-VQ) associates each codeword with a set
   of Gaussian mixture models to account for the co-located distributions
   and a temporally co-located hidden Markov model (TC-HMM) is built upon
   the TCVQ. The proposed technique achieves an window-based equal error
   rate in the range of 3-5\% and a relative gain of 4-25\% over a baseline
   system using traditional HMMs on the AVA database.}},

   mispronunciations produced by L2 learners caused by using inaccurate
   speech attributes, such as manner and place of articulation. Compared
   with conventional score-based CAPT (computer assisted pronunciation
   training) systems, our proposed framework has three advantages: (1) each
   mispronunciation in a tree can be interpreted and communicated to the L2
   learners by traversing the corresponding path from a leaf node to the
   root node; (2) corrective feedback based on speech attribute features,
   which are directly used to describe how consonants and vowels are
   produced using related articulators, can be provided to the L2 learners;
   and (3) by building the phone-dependent decision tree, the relative
   importance of the speech attribute features of a target phone can be
   automatically learned and used to distinguish itself from other phones.
   This information can provide L2 learners speech attribute feedback that
   is ranked in order of importance. In addition to the above mentioned
   advantages, experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can
   detect most pronunciation errors and provide accurate diagnostic
   feedback.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel progressive learning (PL) framework
   for deep neural network (DNN) based speech enhancement. It aims at
   decomposing the complicated regression problem of mapping noisy to clean
   speech into a series of subproblems for enhancing system performances
   and reducing model complexities. As an illustration, we design a
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based PL architecture by guiding each hidden
   layer of the DNN to learn an intermediate target with gradual SNR gains
   explicitly. Furthermore, post-processing, with the rich set of
   information from the multiple learning targets, can further be
   conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that SNR-based progressive
   learning can effectively improve perceptual evaluation of speech quality
   and short -time objective intelligibility in low SNR environments, and
   reduce the model parameters by 50\% when compared with the DNN baseline
   system. Moreover, when combined with post-processing, the proposed
   approach can be further improved.}},

Abstract = {{Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a significant cause of mortality
   among the aging population. Because disease mechanisms are still
   unclear, the only current treatment option for this disease is aortic
   valve replacement. In order to understand the disease and develop
   treatment targets, we must explore the hemodynamic and mechanical forces
   affecting the valve, as well as the biological pathways altered by those
   mechanics ultimately leading to tissue calcification. The unique
   structure of the valve allows it to adapt to the constantly changing
   mechanical environment and the wide array of forces exerted upon the
   tissue during the cardiac cycle. CAVD results in an impairment in the
   structure and function of the aortic valve, resulting in pathological
   systemic changes. A variety of mechanosensors at the valvular
   endothelial cell surface are responsible for transmission of mechanical
   signals to alter cell phenotype and ultimate tissue function. Recently,
   valvular microRNAs have been discovered to be mechanosensitive, possibly
   regulating key signaling in the pathology of CAVD. Our understanding of
   the aortic valve and CAVD is evolving rapidly, and future therapies rely
   on further exploration of this complex disease.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses the coarse mesh transport method COMET to solve the
   eigenvalue and pin fission density distribution of the Very High
   Temperature Reactor (VHTR). It does this using the Boltzmann transport
   equation without such low-order approximations as diffusion, and it does
   not simplify the reactor core problem through homogenization techniques.
   This method is chosen as it makes highly efficient use of grid computing
   resources: it conducts a series of calculations at the block level using
   Monte Carlo to model the explicit geometry within the core without
   approximation, and compiles a compendium of data with the solution set.
   From there, it is able to solve the desired core configuration on a
   single processor in a fraction of the time necessary for whole-core
   deterministic or stochastic transport calculations. Thus, the method
   supplies a solution which has the accuracy of a whole-core Monte Carlo
   solution via the computing power available to the user.
   The core solved herein, the VHTR, was chosen due to its complexity. With
   a high level of detailed heterogeneity present from the core level to
   the pin level, and with asymmetric blocks and control material present
   outside of the fueled region of the core, this reactor geometry creates
   problems for methods which rely on homogenization or diffusion methods.
   Even transport methods find it challenging to solve. As it is desirable
   to reduce the number of assumptions necessary for a whole core
   calculation, this choice of reactor and solution method combination is
   an appropriate choice for a demonstration on an efficient use of grid
   computing.}},

Abstract = {{A new multiphysics method is presented for coupled neutronics and
   thermal fluids calculations in the VHTR. This new method combines the
   capabilities of two existing solvers: the COMET neutronics solver, and a
   thermal fluids module designed specifically for the gas-cooled reactor
   lattice design featured in this next-generation reactor. This paper
   provides the necessary background on the neutronics and thermal fluids
   aspects of the new solution strategy and explains the mode of coupling.
   A test problem is presented in order to prove the efficacy of the new
   coupled method.
   Results are given for a whole-core VHTR, including detailed temperature
   information at the fuel pin level, explicit power calculations of

Abstract = {{The internationally circulated Pool Critical Assembly (PCA) Pressure
   Vessel Benchmark was analyzed using the PENTRAN Parallel S-N code system
   for the geometry, material, and source specifications as described in
   the PCA Benchmark documentation. Improvements to the benchmark are
   proposed here through the application of more representative flux and
   volume weighted homogenized cross sections for the PCA reactor core,
   which were obtained from a rigorous heterogeneous modeling of all fuel
   assembly types in the core. A new source term definition is also
   proposed based on calculated relative power in each core fuel assembly
   with a spectrum based on the Uranium-235 fission spectra. This research
   focused on utilizing the BUGLE-96 cross section library and accompanying
   reaction rates, while also examining PENTRAN's adaptive differencing
   implemented on a coarse mesh basis, as well as fixed use of Directional
   Theta-Weighted (DTW) S-N differencing scheme in order to compare the
   calculated PENTRAN results to measured data. The results show good
   comparison with the measured benchmark data, which suggests PENTRAN is a
   viable, reliable code system for calculation of light water reactor
   neutron shielding and pressure vessel dosimetry calculations.
   Furthermore, the improvements to the benchmark methodology resulting
   from this work provide a 6 percent increase in accuracy of the
   calculation (based on the average of all calculation points), when
   compared with experimentally measured results at the same spatial
   locations in the PCA pressure vessel simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo methods are a central component of radiotherapy treatment
   planning, shielding design, detector modeling, and other applications.
   Long calculation times, however, can limit the usefulness of these
   purely stochastic methods. The coarse mesh method for photon and
   electron transport (COMET-PE) provides an attractive alternative. By
   combining stochastic pre-computation with a deterministic solver,
   COMET-PE achieves accuracy comparable to Monte Carlo methods in only a
   fraction of the time. The method's implementation has been extended to
   3D, and in this work, it is validated by comparison to DOSXYZnrc using a
   photon radiotherapy benchmark. The comparison demonstrates excellent
   agreement; of the voxels that received more than 10\% of the maximum
   dose, over 97.3\% pass a 2\% / 2mm acceptance test and over 99.7\% pass
   a 3\% / 3mm test. Furthermore, the method is over an order of magnitude
   faster than DOSXYZnrc and is able to take advantage of both
   distributed-memory and shared-memory parallel architectures for
   increased performance.}},

Abstract = {{The NEA Monte Carlo Performance benchmark started in 2011 aiming to
   monitor over the years the abilities to perform a full-size Monte Carlo
   reactor core calculation with a detailed power production for each fuel
   pin with axial distribution. This paper gives an overview of the
   contributed results thus far. It shows that reaching a statistical
   accuracy of 1 \% for most of the small fuel zones requires about 100
   billion neutron histories. The efficiency of parallel execution of Monte
   Carlo codes on a large number of processor cores shows clear limitations
   for computer clusters with common type computer nodes. However, using
   true supercomputers the speedup of parallel calculations is increasing
   up to large numbers of processor cores. More experience is needed from
   calculations on true supercomputers using large numbers of processors in
   order to predict if the requested calculations can be done in a short
   time.
   As the specifications of the reactor geometry for this benchmark test
   are well suited for further investigations of full-core Monte Carlo
   calculations and a need is felt for testing other issues than its
   computational performance, proposals are presented for extending the
   benchmark to a suite of benchmark problems for evaluating fission source
   convergence for a system with a high dominance ratio, for coupling with
   thermal-hydraulics calculations to evaluate the use of different
   temperatures and coolant densities and to study the correctness and
   effectiveness of burnup calculations. Moreover, other contemporary
   proposals for a full-core calculation with realistic geometry and
   material composition will be discussed.}},

   to study the issues of parameter identifiability and estimation. We
   define the L-2-consistency for calibration as a justification for

   original Kennedy-O'Hagan (KO) method leads to asymptotically
   L-2-inconsistent calibration. This L-2-inconsistency can be remedied by
   modifying the original estimation procedure. A novel calibration method,

Journal = {{FME TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{237-248}},
Abstract = {{When crane payloads are lifted off the ground, the payload may
   unexpectedly swing sideways. This occurs when the payload is not
   directly beneath the hoist. Because the hoist point is far above the
   payload, it is difficult for crane operators to know if the hoist cable
   is perfectly vertical before they start to lift the payload. Some amount
   of horizontal motion of the payload will always occur at lift off. If an
   off-centered lift results in significant horizontal motion, then it
   creates a hazard for the human operators, the payload, and the
   surrounding environment. This paper presents dynamic models of
   off-centered lifts and experimental verification of the theoretical
   predictions. The inverse problem of setting a large payload on the
   ground can also be challenging. For example, when laying down a long
   payload starting from a near-vertical orientation in the air, to a
   horizontal position on a flat surface, the payload can unexpectedly
   slide sideways. This paper presents motion-control solutions that aid
   operators performing challenging lay-down operations.}},

Abstract = {{We improve uncalibrated visual servoing for multiple cameras. This moves
   robots towards being more effective in unstructured environments. Our
   approach improves performance and reliability by prioritizing data from
   particular cameras in the system. Adaptive filtering is used to effect
   this in an uncalibrated situation. Rules are introduced for ensuring
   positive definite covariance estimates, with the resulting control law
   then compared to two prior methods. Performance metrics show that the
   new control law yields lower tracking error than previous approaches and
   the standard deviations of these metrics indicate that it provides a
   much more reliable system. Simulation results include improvements up to
   33\% in the performance metric for a static target and 63\% in standard
   deviation of the performance metric for a moving target.}},

   from all hierarchies, starting from the bottom material-level, to the
   device-and interconnect-level, and to the top system-level models.
   Multiple design parameters across all hierarchies are co-optimized
   simultaneously to maximize the overall chip throughput instead of just
   the intrinsic delay or energy dissipation of the device or interconnect

Abstract = {{This paper reviews cantilever-based resonant chemical microsensors,
   which detect an analyte of interest via a change of the resonance
   frequency of a characteristic vibration mode, caused by the added mass
   upon sorption of the analyte into a sensing film deposited on the

   hammer-like resonant sensors that comprise a head region suspended by a
   cantilever support structure, the results can be applied to other
   material systems and resonator geometries as well. The cantilever
   vibrations are excited electrothermally and sensed using four
   piezoresistors arranged in a Wheatstone bridge. Approaches to address
   the three `S' metrics of chemical sensors, i.e., sensitivity,
   selectivity, and stability are highlighted. In particular, the benefits
   of localized deposition of the sensing film and the analysis of signal
   transients are explored.}},

Abstract = {{We proposed an auxiliary categorization framework for training speech
   synthesis systems using deep neural networks (DNNs) and recurrent neural
   networks (RNNs). The adopted artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
   regression models comprising a few hidden layers and an affine-
   transform layer for transforming the contextual features into a set of
   speech synthesis parameters. In order to incorporate categorization
   information into training ANNs, similar to DNN- based speech
   recognition, the proposed approach stacks a secondary classification
   layer on top of the hidden layers for the regression ANN and trained it
   together with the primary affinetransform. Four categorization tasks,
   for classification of voicing, phonation position, phone identity and
   hidden Markov model state, are considered. The experimental results show
   that the proposed framework can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE)
   of the generated log fundamental frequency by about 10.8\% and 4.3\% for
   DNN and RNN based synthesis systems, respectively. With the extra
   classification layers, subjective listening tests also favor DNN and RNN
   generated speech by about 24\% and 15\%, respectively, over the ANN
   baselines without using any categorical information.}},

Abstract = {{Although adaptive control offers a unique way to control dynamical
   systems without excessive reliance on their mathematical models, it is
   well known that nonidentical command profiles result in nonidentical
   closed-loop responses with such controllers, and therefore, it is of
   practical interest to study theoretical ways to construct predictable
   closed-loop responses when adaptive controllers are in the loop. To that
   end, we introduce a new concept called scalability to adaptive control
   in this paper. In particular, we analyze how to scale learning rates of
   adaptive weight update laws of various adaptive control schemes with
   respect to given command profiles to achieve a predictable closed-loop
   response. Illustrative numerical examples are provided to demonstrate
   the proposed concept and a possible utilization for the evaluation of
   adaptive controllers.}},

Abstract = {{In cloud investment markets, consumers are looking for the lowest cost
   and a desirable fairness while providers are looking for strategies to
   achieve the highest possible profit and return. Most existing models for
   auction-based resource allocation in cloud environments only consider
   the overall profit increase and ignore the profit of each participant
   individually or the difference between the rich and the poor
   participants. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional fairness
   combinatorial double auction (MDFCDA) model which strikes a balance
   between the revenue and the fairness among participants. We solve a
   winner determination problem (WDP) through integer programming which
   incorporates the fairness attribute based on the history of participants
   which is stored in a repository. Our evaluation results show that the
   proposed model increases the willingness of participants to take part in
   the next auction rounds. Moreover the average percentage of resources
   utilization is increased.}},

Abstract = {{A new automated method for estimation of the gestational age is
   presented in this paper based on the intervals between fetal cardiac
   valve timings and the Q-wave of fetal electrocardiogram ( fECG). The
   intervals were estimated automatically from one-dimensional Doppler
   Ultrasound and noninvasive fECG. Among the intervals, Isovolumic
   Contraction Time, Electromechanical Delay Time, Ventricular Filling Time
   and their interactions were selected in a stepwise regression process.
   Compared with Crown-Rump Length as gold standard, a mean absolute error
   of 3.8 weeks was obtained using leave-one-out cross validation. This
   method also outperformed a fetal heart rate based approach. Since valve
   intervals reflect the autonomic function, this method provides a novel
   measure of the development of fetal autonomic nervous system that may be
   growth curve independent.}},

Abstract = {{In the past few decades heart sound signals (i.e., phonocardiograms or
   PCGs) have been widely studied. Automated heart sound segmentation and
   classification techniques have the potential to screen for pathologies
   in a variety of clinical applications. However, comparative analyses of
   algorithms in the literature have been hindered by the lack of a large
   and open database of heart sound recordings. The PhysioNet/ Computing in
   Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2016 addresses this issue by assembling the
   largest public heart sound database, aggregated from eight sources
   obtained by seven independent research groups around the world. The
   database includes 4,430 recordings taken from 1,072 subjects, totalling
   233,512 heart sounds collected from both healthy subjects and patients
   with a variety of conditions such as heart valve disease and coronary
   artery disease. These recordings were collected using heterogeneous
   equipment in both clinical and nonclinical (such as in-home visits). The
   length of recording varied from several seconds to several minutes.
   Additional data provided include subject demographics (age and gender),
   recording information (number per patient, body location, and length of
   recording), synchronously recorded signals (such as ECG), sampling
   frequency and sensor type used. Participants were asked to classify
   recordings as normal, abnormal, or not possible to evaluate
   (noisy/uncertain). The overall score for an entry was based on a
   weighted sensitivity and specificity score with respect to manual expert
   annotations. A brief description of a baseline classification method is
   provided, including a description of open source code, which has been
   provided in association with the Challenge. The open source code
   provided a score of 0.71 (Se=0.65 Sp=0.76). During the official phase of
   the competition, a total of 48 teams submitted 348 open source entries,
   with a highest score of 0.86 (Se=0.94 Sp=0.78).}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of the Physionet/CinC Challenge 2016 is to
   automatically classify heart sound recordings as normal or abnormal. The
   Challenge provides 3,153 labeled audio recordings taken from a single
   precordial location, as well as Springer's state-of-the-art beat
   segmentation algorithm.
   Algorithm: Using Springer's segmentation algorithm, we divide each audio
   segment into an array of sub-second audio files corresponding to the
   four phases of the cardiac cycle. We take an N-point FFT of each audio
   segment and create five different data matrices: one for each sub-cycle
   (S1, Systole, S2, and Diastole), and one for a complete cardiac cycle. A
   column of the data matrix corresponds to the N-point FFT of one audio
   segment. Using sparse coding, we decompose the data matrix into a
   dictionary matrix and a sparse coefficient matrix. The dictionary matrix
   represents statistically important spectral features of the audio
   segments. The sparse coefficient matrix is a mapping that represents
   which features are used by each segment. Working in the sparse domain,
   we train support vector machines (SVMs) for each sub-cycle and for the
   complete cycle. We train a sixth SVM to combine the results from the
   preliminary SVMs into a single binary label for the entire sound
   recording.
   Results: Our algorithm achieves a cross-validation score of 0.8652 (Se=
   0.8669 and Sp= 0.8634). The best unofficial score when tested on a
   subset of the unknown challenge data is 0.812 (Se= 0.825 and Sp= 0.799).
   Conclusions: We developed an algorithm to classify heart sound
   recordings as normal or pathological. Our results show that sparse
   coding is an effective way to define spectral features of the cardiac
   cycle and its sub-cycles for the purpose of classification. Further work
   will attempt to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the
   algorithm by exploring other classifiers while still working in the
   sparse domain.}},

Abstract = {{Zong's open-source algorithm `wabp.c' (2003) has been widely used for
   onset detection of arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms. This code
   was subsequently modified by Li and Clifford (2012) to avoid possible
   double detections in a beat cycle. However, its performance was not
   systematically validated, especially on a noisy pulse database. This
   study aimed to evaluate its detection accuracy on both clean and noisy
   ABP pulse signals. Synchronously recorded ECG and ABP signals in two
   databases from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014 were
   used. Reference QRS positions were used as the benchmarks for pulse
   onset detection. Three signal quality assessment (SQA) methods, i.e.,
   Sun's jSQI (2006), a modified jSQI (jSQI2) and Gaussian Template
   Matching (GTM), were performed and the onset detection results were
   compared with and without each SQA. For the clean set-p database, the
   algorithm achieved an accuracy of 99.56\% without SQA and slightly
   enhanced its accuracy to 99.97\%, 99.84\% and 99.79\% when using the
   jSQI, jSQI2 and GTM methods respectively. For the noisy set-p2 database,
   the algorithm achieved an accuracy of only 76.42\% without SQA but
   significantly increased to 96.73\%, 90.60\% and 90.79\% respectively.
   The jSQI2 and GTM methods exhibited a higher accuracy for assessing the
   ABP signal quality compared to the jSQI method. In summary, the
   open-source pulse onset detection algorithm was found to achieve high
   detection accuracy in a low noise pulsatile database while relative low
   detection accuracy was observed when using a relatively noisy database.
   Combining the algorithm with an appropriate SQA procedure significantly
   improved beat detection accuracy.}},

   Given an input collection D of n sequences of total length N, a length

   This problem is motivated by clustering and assembly applications in

   necessitate efficient parallel approximate sequence matching algorithms.
   We present a novel distributed memory parallel algorithm that solves
   this approximate sequence matching problem in O ((N/p log N + occ)
   log(k) N) expected time and takes only O (log(k+1) N) expected rounds of
   global communications, under some realistic assumptions, where p is the

Abstract = {{A key trend facing extreme-scale computational science is the widening
   gap between computational and I/O rates, and the challenge that follows
   is how to best gain insight from simulation data when it is increasingly
   impractical to save it to persistent storage for subsequent visual
   exploration and analysis. One approach to this challenge is centered
   around the idea of in situ processing, where visualization and analysis
   processing is performed while data is still resident in memory. This
   paper examines several key design and performance issues related to the
   idea of in situ processing at extreme scale on modern platforms:
   scalability, overhead, performance measurement and analysis, comparison
   and contrast with a traditional post hoc approach, and interfacing with
   simulation codes. We illustrate these principles in practice with
   studies, conducted on large-scale HPC platforms, that include a
   miniapplication and multiple science application codes, one of which
   demonstrates in situ methods in use at greater than 1M-way concurrency.}},

Abstract = {{Although health care technology is progressing, in important ways access
   is dropping for many communities across the globe. Contributing factors
   include increasing awareness and options for diagnosis and treatment,
   and hence expectations, with consequential increases in complexity,
   training, and costs for health service delivery. Changes in wealth
   distribution, aging populations, and increasing burdens from chronic
   conditions also exacerbate these issues. Many attempts at delivering
   affordable health care technologies into resource-poor regions of the
   world have had limited impact, often with a focus only on cost or
   simplicity. However, with close attention to appropriate design
   considerations, including sustainable business practices and local
   cultural dynamics, there is the potential to revolutionize the field and
   deliver health care support technologies that empower, educate, and
   learn from the user. This article discusses the main concepts in
   designing relevant and sustainable health care technologies for
   resource-constrained communities and proposes structural ecosystem
   changes that may be required to achieve this goal.}},

Abstract = {{Controllers for software defined networks (SDNs) are quickly maturing to
   offer network operators more intuitive programming frameworks and
   greater abstractions for network application development. Likewise, many
   security solutions now exist within SDN environments for detecting and
   blocking clients who violate network policies. However, many of these
   solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little
   thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is
   addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client
   beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually
   implement a state change via an external command. This presents a burden
   for the network and its clients and administrators. Hence, we present a
   security policy transition framework for revoking security measures in
   an SDN environment once said measures are activated.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) for
   lane-keeping, one important design objective is to appropriately share
   the steering control with the driver. Hence, the steering behavior of

   behavior of the driver, and conducts a series of field tests to identify
   the model parameters to validate the two-point visual driver model in
   real scenarios. Both an extended Kalman filter and an unscented Kalman

   using a joint-state estimation algorithm and a dual estimation

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed extensive research activities in the
   development of control law architectures for cyber-physical systems
   consisting of sensing, computing and communication modules working
   together to control physical systems. One of the main challenges in
   cyber-physical systems is the vulnerability to adversarial attacks. As
   the important module in cyber physical systems, sensor measurements are
   prone to malicious attacks due to the use of open computation and
   communication architectures. This paper proposes an adaptive sliding
   mode observer for state estimation of systems subjected to adversarial
   attacks. The novelty of the method considered here lies in the use of
   the equivalent control concept to explicitly reconstruct attack signals
   and consequently the system state. A design procedure is described and
   simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Many driver models assume that a human driver can be modeled as a linear
   time-invariant system. Although during specific execution tasks this can
   be a reasonably good model, in general, this is an unrealistic and quite
   restrictive assumption for most real-life situations where more complex
   cognitive functions need to be evoked, such as long-term, deliberative
   planning, prioritization among several possible alternatives, etc. In
   this paper we model a human driver as a hybrid controller that switches
   between long-term, discrete planning tasks and short-term, continuous
   trajectory tracking tasks. The new driver model is based on the
   well-known two-point visual driver model, and it uses a model predictive
   control (MPC) module in the anticipatory control channel to better
   predict deliberative, human driver actions. We evaluate this model's
   performance, and compare it with other driver models using numerical
   simulations. The results show that the proposed new driver model reacts
   to the variation of the direction angle in the same way as most human
   drivers do, and outperforms previous similar driver models.}},

Abstract = {{With the demand and supply for electric vehicles (EVs) in rapid growth
   at a global scale, due to factors such as environmental awareness, tax
   and monetary incentives, government regulations, and technological
   advances, a range of technical issues in efficient EV design has been
   gaining great attention. With consumer concerns around EV range and
   battery degradation, several initiatives have been investigating
   technologies which could further address the above issues. Recognizing
   the need for increasing the driving range and decreasing the impact of
   scenarios that negatively affect it as prime design issues, one of the
   resulting areas of interest is to explore options on better managing
   energy for heating, ventilation and the air conditioning (HVAC) system,
   which can decrease the range of EVs by as much as 30\% when in use. With
   key driver for identifying the most promising ideas and technologies
   worth extensive investigations, the objective is to develop a
   methodology for managing the selection of technologies during conceptual
   design, through assessing HVAC power demand effects and employing
   advanced energy management techniques. A methodology for identifying
   emerging technology concepts has been outlined and demonstrated in the
   context of a virtual electric vehicle system. As a result, MOTEVETOR, a
   portable, interactive multi-criteria decision making tool has been
   created which allows for performing trades between vehicle
   configurations carrying different technology packages, as part of
   supporting EV conceptual design.}},

Abstract = {{Market competition drives attention to the prospects of New and Emerging
   Science \& Technologies (NESTs), which are fast changing and, so far,
   have relatively limited applications. Technology evolution pathways, as
   a powerful representation of the development of technology, have caught
   researchers' interest as a tool to trace historical progression, explore
   knowledge diffusion, and forecast future NESTs trends. Citation analysis
   approaches are actively applied to structure a large number of patents,
   map patent distribution, and capture knowledge transfer and change in
   technologies or industries. This paper (1) introduces the indicator of
   connectivity and modularity in the interior citation network to identify
   the technology development stage; (2) takes family patent information
   into the process of building a comprehensive patent citation network;
   (3) extracts technological trajectories by applying integrated
   approaches of main path analyses, namely global main path analysis and
   global key-route main analysis, among different technological stages. We
   illustrate this approach with Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as an
   example of a promising NEST, contributing to the remarkable growth in
   the renewable energy industry. The results show how our method can trace
   the main development trajectory of a research field and discern the
   technology focus to help decision-makers facilitate technology
   management.}},

   motion of a deputy spacecraft about a chief spacecraft with a set of

   functions that are expressed in terms of relative orbital elements, in
   order to target a desired relative orbit. Through defining a scalar
   potential function in terms of relative orbital elements, the resulting
   potential field may be shaped such that the path of steepest descent
   lies in the direction of the desired elements. A major advantage of the
   relative orbital elements-based approach is that the artificial
   potential functions allow targeting of a specified relative orbit
   geometry, whereas prior formulations only allow targeting of discrete
   Cartesian state vectors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to apply the random finite set-based multi-Bernoilli
   filter to frame-to-frame tracking of space objects observed in electro
   optical imagery for space domain awareness applications. First, this
   paper will review random finite set filters applied to frame to frame
   tracking and their applications to space. A new likelihood function for
   space based imagery will be presented, based on the matched filter. A
   more educated birth model will be proposed which better models potential
   SO using observer characteristics and object dynamics. Simulation
   results will explore the range of objects that canbe tracked. The final
   algorithm is able to perform completely uncued detection down to a total
   object SNR of 5.6 and a per pixel SNR of 1.5. Promising but inconclusive
   results are shown for total object SNR of 3.35 and per pixel SNR of 0.7.}},

Abstract = {{The observation to observation correlation problem can be addressed by
   determining if the probabilistic admissible regions produced from each
   observation have a point of intersection. An observation association
   method is developed which uses an optimization based approach to
   identify the point of intersection between two probabilistic admissible
   regions. A binary hypothesis test with a selected false alarm rate is
   used to probabilistically determine whether an intersection exists at
   the point(s) of minimum distance. The distribution of states about a
   point of intersection, if it exists, is the initial orbit estimate. If a
   point of intersection does not exist, then the observations are
   uncorrelated. The efficacy of the correlation method is demonstrated on

Abstract = {{This paper presents two strategies for designing underactuated, planar
   robotic walking gaits and for realizing them experimentally. The methods
   draw upon insights gained from the authors' recent work which leverages
   properties of the mechanics of the robot to design a controller that
   stabilizes walking by regulating the transfer of angular momentum about
   one support pivot to the next. One proposed gait design strategy is to
   simulate a closed-loop hybrid model of the robot under the action of the
   mechanics-based controller to produce an implicit periodic orbit for
   each set of controller parameters. The second design strategy modifies
   traditional usage of nonlinear optimization to produce parameterized
   outputs corresponding to a stable Hybrid Zero Dynamics. The novel
   approach is to reformulate the HZD stability constraint using the
   mechanics of the system and to propose an alternative to the periodic
   HZD orbit existence constraint through the use of an angular momentum
   variant of the Linear Inverted Pendulum. The two methods are used to
   design gaits that are implemented in experiments with the AMBER-3M
   robot.}},

Abstract = {{Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) exhibit inherently compliant behavior
   due to the elasticity present at the intersection of human tissue and
   the robot. This compliance, can prominently influence the operation of
   some SRLs, depending on the application. In order to control the
   residual vibrations of SRLs, we have used an input-shaping method which
   is a computationally inexpensive approach. The effectiveness of this
   method in controlling the residual vibrations of a SRL has been proven
   using robustness analysis. User studies show that reducing the
   vibrations using input shaping directly increases the user satisfaction
   and comfort by at least 9\%. It is also observed that 36\% of the users
   preferred unshaped commands. We hypothesize that the shaped commands put
   a higher cognitive load on the user compared to unshaped commands. This
   shows that when dealing with human-robot interaction, user satisfaction
   becomes an equally important parameter as traditional performance
   criteria and should be taken into account while evaluating the success
   of any vibration-control method.}},

Abstract = {{People suffering from speech disorders cannot produce comprehensible
   speech. Particularly, motor speech disorders affect the ability to
   control and synchronize articulators, such as tongue, lips, and jaw,
   which are responsible for speech production. Typically, people suffering
   from such disorders undergo speech therapy, led by speechP-language
   pathologists (SLPs), in which they may be asked to repeat a set of
   utterances. Speech performance is assessed and errors are corrected by
   the SLP via attempts to adjust the articulators' motion for the errant
   sounds. However, in order to provide accurate feedback, SLPs must be
   able to monitor and analyze articulators' movements. Currently,
   available speech articulator tracking systems are not suitable for use
   in the SLPs' private practices as they either prevent natural speech,
   are costly, bulky, or too complex to setup and/or calibrate for each
   therapy session. The system presented here uses offP-theP-shelf
   components and captures three important speech modalities: tongue
   movements, voice, and lip gestures simultaneously and unobtrusively,
   thus presents a potentially suitable solution for SLPs and their
   patients in their daily routines as it is noninvasive, wireless, low
   cost, low maintenance, portable, and plugP-andP-play.}},

   by the stimulation controller in real-time based on the measured gait
   metric, the target gait metric, and the relationship between the
   stimulus parameters and gait metric found in experiments in the walking
   cat. As a proof of concept, we controlled the spatial step symmetry as a
   gait metric by modulating stimulation amplitude during cat walking on a
   split-belt treadmill. The results demonstrated that the developed system
   could reliably maintain the spatial step symmetry of the cat in the

Abstract = {{The new trend towards minimally invasive mm-sized and free-floating

   transmission to these medical devices. The magnetic field produced by
   external transmitter (Tx) coils at the position of the implants can be
   considered homogeneous to separate optimization of the Tx and receiver
   (Rx) coils for efficient power transfer. This paper focuses on
   optimization of the solenoid-type Rx coils, which are suitable for this
   application. We have developed an analytical model of solenoid coils
   that includes the impact of tissue and coating around the coils and
   verifies through simulations and measurements. Using the proposed model,
   under a given size restriction and a specific load, we find the optimal
   operating frequency and coil geometry by maximizing a figure of merit
   for Rx. For a mm-sized coil, the optimal operating frequency and the
   number of turns are found 500 MHz and 6, respectively, if the coil is
   closely wound using AWG36 copper wires.}},

Abstract = {{For wireless power transfer to multiple millimetersized implantable
   medical devices (IMDs), power delivered to a load should be over minimum
   operating power of the IMDs and power transfer efficiency (PTE) should
   be maximized to reduce specific absorption rate across a wide area of
   interest. We have demonstrated advantages of using a 3-coil inductive
   link to energize multiple IMDs and its PTE optimization to power up
   bonding-wire wound coils implanted in tissue environment, in contrast to
   earlier works that focused on 2-coil inductive link optimization
   methodologies to a single mm-sized IMD. HFSS simulation results show
   superiority of the 3-coil inductive link to wirelessly deliver power to
   multiple mm-sized coils. A 3-coil inductive link optimization method,
   considering the desired radius of the resonator coil, is presented.
   Measured PTE to the bodingwire wound coil in tissue media were 9.13\%
   and 2.01\% at 275 MHz and 131 MHz when resonator radii were 0.5 cm and 1
   cm, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Interference cancellation (IC) has been proposed to improve bandwidth
   utilization for the majority of modern wireless networks. We claim that
   the conventional model for IC residual error, which is that the residual
   error power is simply a fraction of the power of the packet being
   cancelled, is overly simplified. In this paper, we evaluate the
   practical residual error of IC with spread MSK modulation in a flat
   fading environment for a low power wide area (LPWA) wireless sensor
   network application. In particular, we address the
   two-packets-overlapping scenario as a function of the signal to noise
   ratio (SNR) of each packet and the overlapping degree. Using
   softwaredefined radios, we demonstrate that the average realistic
   residual error power based on packet transmission with a single
   pseudonoise preamble is not a constant fraction of the power of the
   packet being canceled. Rather, it depends on the synchronization and
   channel estimation errors, which in turn, depend on the SINR of the
   stronger packet preamble.}},

Abstract = {{Scheduling is one of the most important resource allocation for
   networked systems. Conventional scheduling policies are primarily
   developed under light-tailed (LT) traffic assumptions. However, recent
   empirical studies show that heavy-tailed (HT) traffic flows have emerged
   in a variety of networked systems, such as cellular networks, the
   Internet, and data centers. The highly bursty nature of HT traffic
   fundamentally challenges the applicability of the conventional
   scheduling policies. This paper aims to develop novel throughput-optimal
   scheduling algorithms under hybrid HT and LT traffic flows, where
   classic optimal policies (e.g., maximum-weight/backpressure schemes),
   developed under LT assumption, are not throughput-optimal anymore. To
   counter this problem, a delay-based maximumweight scheduling policy with
   the last-in first-out (LIFO) service discipline, namely LIFO-DMWS, is
   proposed with the proved throughput optimality under hybrid HT and LT
   traffic. The throughput optimality of LIFO-DMWS gives that a networked
   system can support the largest set of incoming traffic flows, while
   guaranteeing bounded queueing delay to each queue, no matter the queue
   has HT or LT traffic arrival. Specifically, by exploiting asymptotic
   queueing analysis, LIFO-DMWS is proved to achieve throughout optimality
   without requiring any knowledge of traffic statistic information (e.g.,
   the tailness or burstiness of traffic flows). Simulation results
   validate the derived theories and confirm that LIFO-DMWS achieves
   bounded delay for all flows under challenging HT environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates spectrum-power trading between a small cell (SC)
   and a macro-cell (MC), where the SC consumes power to serve the
   macro-cell users (MUs) in exchange for some bandwidth from the MC. Our
   goal is to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) of the SC while
   guaranteeing the quality of service of each MU as well as small cell
   users (SUs). Specifically, given the minimum data rate requirement and
   the bandwidth provided by the MC, the SC jointly optimizes MU selection,
   bandwidth allocation, and power allocation while guaranteeing its own
   minimum required system data rate. The problem is challenging due to the
   binary MU selection variables and the fractional form objective
   function. We first show that in order to achieve the maximum system EE,
   the bandwidth of an MU is shared with at most one SU in the SC. Then,
   for a given MU selection, the optimal bandwidth and power allocations
   are obtained by exploiting the fractional programming. To perform MU
   selection, we first introduce the concept of trading EE. Then, we reveal
   a sufficient and necessary condition for serving an MU without
   considering the total power constraint and the minimum data rate
   constraint. Based on this insight, we propose a low computational
   complexity MU selection algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems, long motor leads can have
   many detrimental effects, including cable charging current, overvoltage
   at the motor terminals, and voltage stress on power modules. Different
   types of AC system grounding can also interact with long motor leads to
   yield undesirable effects on drive operation. Analyzing models of
   various components of a drive system is useful to determine any
   potential issues prior to installation and to recommend any needed
   filter solutions to mitigate these issues. However, prior cable models
   have several shortcomings and are inadequate for fully understanding
   long cable effects prior to VFD system installation. In this paper, a
   commercially available finite element analysis (FEA) tool is applied to
   generate a wide frequency range model for a multi-conductor VFD cable.
   It is shown that this cable model can be used in a system level
   simulation to determine application issues for low power AC drives. The
   method is validated using experimental tests on selected cable, motor
   and drive combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate calculation of the phase inductance profile of switched
   reluctance machines (SRMs) is of crucial importance in SRM design
   because it is a key parameter to predict the performance indices such as
   the torque and core loss. Instead of using the time-consuming finite
   element analysis (FEA) or the methods that require prior knowledge of
   magnetic fields from an FEA such as curve fitting and magnetic
   equivalent circuit (MEC), this paper proposes a fast and accurate
   analytical approach to determine the unsaturated phase inductance of a
   6/4 SRM at arbitrary rotor positions by solving the partial differential
   equations of magnetic scalar/vector potentials based on Maxwell's
   equations. Conformal mapping is applied to deal with the non-radial or
   non-tangential geometric structures when calculating the inductance of
   the SRM. The agreement between the results of the proposed analytical
   method and FEA validates the analysis.}},

   Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with penalty function is applied to
   find the optimal solution for a user defined objective function. After
   several rounds of searching process with the PSO, the optimal regions
   can be found for the design variables in terms of the performance

Abstract = {{The world food system is a globalized and interconnected network, and
   prior research has shown the US is one of the most important countries
   within this global network. Considering this, any affects on the US food
   network might have far reaching implications. The objective of this
   paper is to show how the efficiency of the US food network can be
   optimized and to examine the tradeoffs between sustainability,
   efficiency, and resiliency in a network science based approach. To do
   this we use the 2012 US Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data focusing on
   origin-destination flows for 5 categories of food. We interpret these
   origin-destination flows as a directed weighted network and use a linear
   programming (LP) based approach to reconfigure the flows in order to
   minimize the ``food miles{''} in the network. We extend our LP to a
   multi-objective optimization problem in order to consider partially
   optimized solutions that are closer to the current food network.
   Finally, we calculate characteristics of the optimized networks and
   compare them to the original network. Our results show that the US food
   network has the potential for more than a 50\% reduction in ``food
   miles{''}, which will result in a food system that is not only more
   economically efficient but also with a smaller sustainability impact by
   reducing the corresponding transportation GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Data Science research has a long history in academia which spans from
   large-scale data management, to data mining and data analysis using
   technologies from database management systems (DBMS's). While
   traditional HPC offers tools on leveraging existing technologies with
   data processing needs, the large volume of data and the speed of data
   generation pose significant challenges. Using the Hadoop platform and
   tools built on top of it drew immense interest from academia after it
   gained success in industry.
   Georgia Institute of Technology received a donation of 200 compute nodes
   from Yahoo. Turning these industrial machines into a research Data
   Science Platform (DSP) poses unique challenges, such as: nontrivial
   hardware design decisions, configuration tool choices, node integration
   into existing HPC infrastructure, partitioning resource to meet
   different application needs, software stack choices, etc.
   We have 40 nodes up and running, 24 running as a Hadoop and Spark
   cluster, 12 running as a HBase and OpenTSDB cluster, the others running
   as service nodes. We successfully tested it against Spark Machine
   Learning algorithms using a 88GB image dataset, Spark DataFrame and
   GraphFrame with a Wikipedia dataset, and Hadoop MapReduce wordcount on a
   300GB dataset. The OpenTSDB cluster is for real-time time series data
   ingestion and storage for sensor data. We are working on bringing up
   more nodes. We share our first-hand experience gained in our journey,
   which we believe will benefit and inspire other academic institutions.}},

Abstract = {{One of the top reliability concerns in power systems classified by NERC
   is hidden failures in protection schemes. Such failures are defects that
   go undetected under normal operating conditions but manifest themselves
   during faults or transients, which may lead to the false operation of
   relaying schemes. Specifically, hidden failures typically lead to
   incorrect input to relays and adversely affect protection logic, often
   with catastrophic results. This paper introduces a centralized
   protection scheme that detects hidden failures in real time under normal
   or abnormal operating conditions and eliminates their consequences. The
   approach entails acquiring all data collected by the relays, meters, and

Abstract = {{The increasing penetration of variable energy sources, plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEV) and storage in the distribution system generates the need
   for load forecasting at a more granular level than at the substations.
   Load forecasting at the distribution transformer level can provide an
   estimate of how the load is distributed in the distribution network
   rather than a substation total estimate. It opens possibilities for
   various applications and use cases including better demand-response
   management, resource scheduling, enhanced losses minimization, and more
   accurate management of distribution transformer loading. In order to
   achieve higher accuracy of transformer loading forecasting, distribution
   transformer meters or equivalent aggregation of the transformer served
   load based on smart meters is required. This paper presents two linear
   models for computationally efficient short-term load forecasting on
   distribution transformers. The first model uses an aggregate load and
   the second uses an average load approach. The average load method
   exhibits prediction accuracy superior to the aggregate load approach.
   The proposed models are tested on smart grid community data provided by
   Pecan Street.}},

Abstract = {{High penetration of Converter-Interfaced Generation (CIG) presents
   challenges because there exists no or very little mechanical coupling
   between CIGs and the power grid. During transients, the operational
   constraints of the inverters may be exceeded to the point of damaging
   the inverters or causing the shutdown of the inverters (LVRT logic).
   This paper proposes a Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) enabled
   supplementary predictive inverter control scheme to minimize the
   transients during grid disturbances. This control scheme only uses local
   information and does not require any communication from the system
   (remote) side. We first estimate frequency as well as rate of frequency
   change of the remote side with only local information via DSE, which
   uses high-fidelity dynamic model of the interested component to provide
   accurate feedback to the inverter controls. Second, a supplementary
   predictive inverter control scheme is utilized to control the output
   frequency, real power as well as the reactive power of the grid-side
   inverter. Numerical simulations show that the proposed DSE method can
   accurately estimate remote side frequency as well as rate of frequency
   change. Additionally, the proposed control scheme can successfully
   minimize transients during system frequency oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the use of a distributed dynamic state estimation,
   executed each cycle, to enable simultaneous cyber security and
   operational security. The basis of the method is: (a) data verification
   that detects bad data or byzantine type attacks and (b) command
   interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of
   view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational
   reliability point of view. To ensure speed, the command authentication
   is done at the relay level and relay controls. Since all controls in a
   modern substation are exercised through a relay, this approach provides
   100\% coverage. The command authentication is performed by capturing
   each command, performing a simulation of the effects of the command via
   a faster than real time simulation using the real time model, and if
   there are no adverse effects, the command is authenticated and is
   allowed to proceed. This paper focuses on the approach that enables the
   faster than real time simulation and provides performance metrics of the
   method. The simulation results demonstrate the high speed-up of
   distributed DSE and validate the effectiveness of the command
   authentication and intrusion detection method based on the proposed
   equivalencing method.}},

Abstract = {{State estimation is a critical function in the energy management system
   that processes measurements from the field and determines the most
   likely state of the power system. As more sensing is added and wider
   areas need to be estimated in real time, the computational speed of
   state estimation becomes increasingly more important. This paper
   proposes a scalable method that uses automatic graph partitioning to
   decompose a global state estimation problem into a series of smaller
   sub-problems and forces these sub-problems to reach a consensus using
   the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The proposed
   method is demonstrated on the IEEE 14 bus, 57 bus, 118 bus, and 300 bus
   systems. Simulation results suggest that partitioning the global state
   estimation problem into smaller state estimation problems greatly
   improves the computational performance, even for a serial

Abstract = {{We propose joint modeling strategies leveraging up-on large-scale
   mixed-band training speech for recognition of both narrowband and
   wideband data based on deep neural networks (DNNs). We utilize
   conventional down-sampling and up-sampling schemes to go between
   narrowband and wideband data. We also explore DNN-based speech bandwidth
   expansion (BWE) to map some acoustic features from narrowband to
   wideband speech. By arranging narrowband and wideband features at the
   input or the output level of BWE-DNN, and combining down-sampling and
   up-sampling data, different DNNs can be established. Our experiments on
   a Mandarin speech recognition task show that the hybrid DNNs for joint
   modeling of mixed-band speech yield significant performance gains over
   both the narrowband and wideband speech models, well-trained separately,
   with a relative character error rate reduction of 7.9\% and 3.9\% on
   narrowband and wideband data, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed
   strategies also consistently outperform other conventional DNN-based

Abstract = {{It is well known that the variability in speech caused by the accents or
   dialects of speakers degrades the performance of speech recognition
   systems. One method to prevent this degradation is to correctly identify
   the accent or dialect of a speaker so that the putative system can be
   designed to use this information. In this paper, we apply the extreme
   learning machine, an efficient neural network learning algorithm, to the
   problem of accent/dialect classification on the TIMIT dataset. Mel
   frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and the normalized energy
   parameter are computed from word samples in each dialect class, and
   these along with their first and second derivatives are used as training
   features. A novel architecture and a weighting scheme are used to
   classify North American dialects into seven groups. Using this
   technique, we obtain an classification accuracy of 76.92\%, which to our
   knowledge is the best result reported for dialect classification on the
   TIMIT dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Physically and computationally efficient hardware coupled with fast
   sparse approximation solvers provide opportunities for real-time visual
   processing on low-power embedded platforms. This paper presents a system
   using the low-power Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) on the highly
   programmable, brain-inspired IBM TrueNorth chip. A small-scale spiking
   LCA network is successfully implemented on the TrueNorth chip, resulting
   in node dynamics comparable to that of a discretized LCA network. The
   sparse representations computed by the LCA implemented on TrueNorth
   result in minimal reconstruction error for every trial. This performance
   is achieved using only 11 of the available 4096 cores on the chip,
   offering the potential for scalability for real-world applications of
   this system.}},

Abstract = {{LTE in Unlicensed band (LTE-U) has gained intensive attention recently
   due to its capability to offload mobile data to unlicensed bands. In
   order to use unlicensed band, LTE-U has to coexist with WiFi - another
   wireless technology that operates in unlicensed bands. This coexistence
   is riddled with several challenges as these technologies use different
   core networks, backhauls and deployment plans. Within this broad
   paradigm, we present Duet, a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer solution
   that enables both LTE-U and WiFi nodes to operate fairly and
   efficiently, with the following properties: (1) no changes in WiFi
   framework, (2) high performance of LTE-U and WiFi networks within static
   and dynamic load scenarios, and (3) robustness to fully and partially
   connected networks. Using ns-3, we simulate Duet in various scenarios
   and show that Duet can improve the overall network throughput by up to
   74\%.}},

Abstract = {{Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm which
   separates the control plane from the data forwarding plane. The
   centralized controller provides the global view of the distributed
   network states for user applications. However, the scalability of SDN is
   subject to the delay, the capacity of the controller, the bandwidth of
   the control channel, and other issues. To solve this problem,
   peer-to-peer (p2p) SDN, where multiple independent controllers control
   their own networks and these controllers exchange the only required
   state changing events, is an emerging control plane architecture. In
   this paper, we focus on the traffic engineering in the p2p SDN
   administrated by one operator. We first identify some fundamental
   challenges (i.e., path aggregation for advertisement, routing loop,
   overhead) for the traffic engineering in the p2p SDN. Then we proposed a
   novel protocol exchanging the required network information to enable the
   traffic engineering between neighboring SDN domains. The experiments
   show that our protocol can achieve nearly same performance (about 98\%)
   as the one with God's knowledge (the full information of the whole
   network). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to
   investigate the traffic engineering problem in the p2p SDN.}},

Abstract = {{Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) stand as a promising new technology to
   enrich interaction with objects in both the physical and virtual world.
   As BCI technology continues to mature for possibly becoming a essential

   authenticating the very user of the input device. We attempt to analyze
   and improve current and new methods of user authentication that can be
   provided through consumer-grade BCIs. We first propose a new
   neurological framework for an authentication system integrated with
   BCIs. We then evaluate the effectiveness of the framework in conjunction
   with the fidelity and usability of electroencephalogram (EEG) data
   obtained from a consumer-grade BCI to analyze different types of sensory
   pass-thoughts and their effectiveness among individuals. Preliminary
   results show that the proposed framework is promising to improve the

Abstract = {{While the big data revolution in the consumer, business, and social
   networks domains is widely known, a similar revolution is taking place
   in the sciences and engineering driven by high-throughput
   instrumentation. This talk will feature big data challenges in the life
   sciences, primarily due to advances in sequencing that resulted in
   several orders of magnitude throughput increases per unit cost during
   the last decade. These advances are democratizing big data generation
   capabilities and spawning new scientific inquiries that would not be
   feasible otherwise. The time, cost, and complexity of data analysis have
   overtaken the cost and speed of data generation as the primary
   bottlenecks, posing significant challenges for computer scientists. I
   will present an overview of my group's research in addressing some of
   these issues through the development of parallel algorithms and high
   performance computing approaches. Apart from opening new avenues of
   investigation in parallel processing, research in this domain is also
   leading to broadly applicable techniques in areas such as graph
   analytics and parallel machine learning. I will also brief the audience
   on the ongoing federal initiatives in the United States aimed at
   nurturing multi-stakeholder partnerships to advance such big data
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled Lagrangian particle tracking (CLPT) is a feedback control
   methodology for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in dynamic ocean
   environments that can reveal information about ocean flow and model
   error through the operation of AUVs. From CLPT, we evaluate the
   navigational performance of AUVs with controlled Lagrangian prediction
   error (CLPE), which represents the difference between the predicted and
   true trajectories of AUVs. In this paper, using CLPE, we develop an
   adaptive learning algorithm that allows AUVs to learn their true motion
   in ocean flow fields in real time. While previous work shows that CLPE
   increases over time in simulated and field experiments, the proposed
   algorithm forces CLPE to converge to zero so that the vehicle motion
   model is unique and flow fields can be identified. For the robustness of
   the proposed algorithm, we prove that CLPE is ultimately bounded under
   disturbances. The proposed algorithm is verified by simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{We present a set of software packages that integrates the arbitration
   framework, user interface utilities, and native vehicle behaviors found
   in the Mission-Oriented Operating Suite (MOOS-IvP) into the Robot

   community due to a large library of maritime-specific autonomy
   behaviors, interfaces to common unmanned underwater vehicles, utility
   programs, and the inclusion of a default arbitration framework for
   autonomous decision making. However, the Robot Operating System (ROS)
   has grown in use within the autonomy and robotics communities at large
   due to the utility of its communications framework, node introspection
   capabilities, and messaging architecture. In our work we combine the
   best capabilities of both robotics architectures into two packages for
   use in maritime autonomy applications. The packages allow introspection
   of the various components of the IvP autonomy framework and allow
   behaviors to be backwards-compatible with standard MOOS-IvP.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation and mapping in relatively featureless underwater and
   under-ice environments is a difficult challenge. Using common sensors
   already onboard many unmanned underwater vehicles to aid in this process
   provides a self-contained and cost-effective solution. Evaluation of
   such visual navigation and mapping methods under development requires
   multiple UUVs to gather the required sonar and video data in underwater
   and under-ice environments, which is costly and prohibitive. It is also
   difficult to ensure accurate ground truth is available during such data
   collection missions. Alternatively, a simulation approach is presented
   here to provide datasets with full ground truth and fine-grained
   controllability, requiring much fewer resources. This can enable faster
   and more robust development of these algorithms prior to costly field
   testing. The simulation methods and datasets developed are presented
   herein. The code and datasets themselves will be made available as part

Abstract = {{This paper presents the 300 GHz path loss measurements on a computer
   motherboard. In the measurement campaign, three different scenarios have
   been considered: a line-of-sight (LoS) scenario in the presence of a
   large ground plane (i.e. motherboard), a LoS scenario where the
   transmitter (Tx) and receiver (R.) have different heights such as a link
   between the processor and memory, and an obstructed LoS scenario where
   the EM waves are guided from the T. to the R. through the metal
   parallel-plate structures such as Dual In-line Memory Modules (DIMM's)
   on the motherboard. The results show that in the presence of the
   motherboard, LoS path can be positively or negatively interfered by the
   reflections from the ground plane. The outcome strongly depends on the
   antenna position with respect to the motherboard. Furthermore, it is
   found that if the T. and R. antennas are not on the same height, the
   height difference of less than a centimeter between antennas is
   tolerable. However, the height difference of several centimeters, as
   found in links between the processor and memory would suffer from
   significant path loss. Finally, it was found that the chip-to-chip link
   that is obstructed by a parallel metal plates can experience both path
   loss higher or lower than free space path loss, depending on the spacing
   between metal plates. All these results indicate that optimal
   communications can be achieved by carefully positioning the antennas
   with respect to the motherboard layout.}},

Abstract = {{Current-generation screen-printed (SP) Ag pastes have shown capability
   to contact lightly doped Si solar cell emitters displaying low
   saturation current density (J(0e)) with high fill factor (FF). However,
   we have observed that higher firing temperatures are needed to achieve
   low resistance Ag contact, which may degrade J(0e) and result in lower
   open circuit voltage (V-OC). Higher firing temperatures have also
   resulted in rear SP Al film blistering. In order to decouple the effects
   of front and rear contact formation on cell performance, we present data
   on the impact of SP Ag contacts on n(+) phosphorus (P) emitter J(0e) for
   a range of doping densities and firing temperatures. Using a range of Ag
   coverage areas (A(metal)) we extract the J(0e) under SP Ag
   (J(0e),(metal)). We observe that the change in J(0e) as a function of
   A(metal) (dJ(0e)/dA(metal)) increases as firing temperature increases,
   indicating increasing J(0e),(metal). Calculated V-OC loss at A(metal) =
   7\%, a typical coverage for SP Ag contacts, cannot fully account for
   experimental V-OC loss, and Al back surface field (Al-BSF) degradation
   due to high temperature firing was found to dominate V-OC losses.}},

Abstract = {{A non-invasive, active neuro-vascular assessment system was developed
   using a modified temperature-controlled glove and feedback techniques.
   The glove incorporates local heating and cooling of the hand using
   multi-point skin temperature measurements as feedback, and thereby
   induces local and central mechanisms involved in thermoregulation.
   Electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and non-invasive
   finger-cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurements were used to monitor
   electrophysiology and hemodynamic changes in response to temperature
   modulation. Then, the triggered neuro-vascular mechanisms associated
   with thermoregulation were quantified by extracting parameters from the
   measured waveforms, specifically heart rate variability (HRV), vascular
   tone, and BP. The system was tested on six young, healthy individuals
   with no history of microvascular diseases. During heating, vasodilation,
   decrease in systolic BP, and a decrease in parasympathetic tone were
   observed, while during cooling, vasoconstriction and increased BP were
   observed. While such changes are expected physiologically using passive
   experiments, the ability to modulate the physiology non-invasively with
   a controlled, quantitative, and inexpensive instrument can potentially
   enable serial assessments of neuro-vascular control outside of clinical
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a new algorithm to adaptively detect change points
   of functional connectivity networks in the brain. It uses scans from
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) which is
   one of the major tools to investigate intrinsic brain functionality.
   Different regions of the resting brain form networks that change states
   within a few seconds to minutes. The change points of these networks are
   different in normal and disordered brain functions and their
   understanding can help in identification of brain disorders. These
   changes arise from many unknown factors and extraction of these change
   points is one of the the major challenges in the absence of any ground
   truth. Our algorithm detects these change points adaptively by computing
   sum of absolute sign differences of adjacent images in rsfMRI scans
   using measures from image and video processing. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that these change
   points can be detected reliably in both task-based and resting-state
   networks. The outcomes also point to new directions for future work.}},

   study, we investigated decoding stroke patients' gait intention through
   a wireless EEG system. To overcome patient-specific EEG patterns due to
   impaired cerebral cortices, common spatial patterns (CSP) was employed.
   We demonstrated that CSP filter can be used to maximize the EEG signal
   variance-ratio of gait and standing conditions. Finally, linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) classification was conducted, whereby the
   average accuracy of 73.2\% and the average delay of 0.13 s were achieved
   for 3 chronic stroke patients. Additionally, we also found out that the

Abstract = {{Objective. The work presented here describes a new tool for peripheral
   nerve interfacing, called the microneedle cuff (mu N-cuff) electrode.
   Approach. mu N arrays are designed and integrated into cuff electrodes
   for penetrating superficial tissues while remaining non-invasive to
   delicate axonal tracts. Main results. In acute testing, the presence of
   75 m height mu Ns decreased the electrode-tissue interface impedance by
   0.34 k., resulting in a 0.9 mA reduction in functional stimulation
   thresholds and increased the signal-to-noise ratio by 9.1 dB compared to
   standard (needle-less) nerve cuff electrodes. Preliminary acute
   characterization suggests that mu N-cuff electrodes provide the
   stability and ease of use of standard cuff electrodes while enhancing
   electrical interfacing characteristics. Significance. The ability to
   stimulate, block, and record peripheral nerve activity with greater
   specificity, resolution, and fidelity can enable more precise
   spatiotemporal control and measurement of neural circuits.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated how the neural state influences how the
   brain responds to electrical stimulation using a 16-channel
   microelectrode array with 8 stimulation and recording channels implanted
   in the rat hippocampus. In two experiments we identified the stimulation
   threshold at which the brain changes to an afterdischarge state. In one
   experiment a range of suprathreshold stimulations were applied, and in
   another the stimulation was not changed. The neural state was measured
   by the power spectral density prior to stimulation. In the first
   experiment, these measures and the stimulation parameters were used as
   features, either together or separately, for training a Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether the stimulation would
   produce an afterdischarge. In the second experiment, recursive feature
   elimination was used to iteratively remove the neural state features
   from the recording channels that had the least impact on the overall
   accuracy. In the first experiment 43 stimulations elicited 26
   afterdischarges. In predicting the post-stimulation state-change
   (afterdischarge vs. no afterdischarge) the feature space of only neural
   state had a higher accuracy (67.4\%) than when combined with the
   stimulation parameters (65.1\%) or the stimulation parameters alone
   (58.1\%). The overall classification results from both feature spaces
   containing the neural state were non-independent (chi-squared p < 0.01).
   In the second experiment, the channels that were the least predictive
   were those on the more distal ends of the recording electrode, and the
   most predictive were clustered in the center of the electrode.
   Additionally, the accuracy increased when 4 channels were removed. The
   findings from these experiments suggest that both the pre-stimulation
   state and the spatial properties from where it is measured can play a
   role in how neural stimulation can induce functional changes in the
   hippocampal networks.}},

   over time of the kicking kinematics. For validation, the method is used
   to track the articulation of a robotic humanoid that was programmed to

   applied to a sequence collected from an actual infant and the resultant

Abstract = {{Abnormal oscillatory movement (i.e. tremor) is usually evaluated with
   qualitative assessment by clinicians, and quantified with subjective
   scoring methods. These methods are often inaccurate. We utilized a
   quantitative and standardized task based on the Fitts' law to assess the
   performance of arm movement with tremor by controlling a gyration mouse
   on a computer. The experiment included the center-out tapping (COT) and
   rectangular track navigation (RTN) tasks. We report the results of a
   pilot study in which we collected the performance for healthy
   participants in whom tremor was simulated by imposing oscillatory
   movements to the arm with a vibration motor. We compared their movement
   speed and accuracy with and without the artificial ``tremor.{''} We
   found that the artificial tremor significantly affected the path
   efficiency for both tasks (COT: 56.8 vs. 46.2\%, p < 0.05; RTN: 94.2 vs.
   67.4\%, p < 0.05), and we were able to distinguish the presence of
   tremor. From this result, we expect to quantify severity of tremor and
   the effectiveness therapy for tremor patients.}},

Abstract = {{Pan-cancer analyses attempt to discover similar features among multiple
   cancers to identify fundamental patterns common to cancer development
   and progression. A pan-cancer analysis integrating both protein
   expression and transcriptomic data is important because it can identify
   genes that are linked to proteins potentially responsible for a
   patient's status. This study aims to identify differentially expressed (
   DE) genes between early and advanced cases of multiple cancer types
   through the usage of RNA sequencing data. The relevance of these genes
   is further investigated by developing predictive models using K-nearest
   neighbor and linear discriminant analysis classifiers. The use of
   cancer-specific and non-cancer specific features resulted in several
   moderately performing models. Highlighted genes were further
   investigated to determine if they encoded for proteins identified in a
   previously conducted pan-cancer analysis. The results of this study
   suggest that a pan-cancer analysis may be highly complementary to
   standard analyses of individual cancers for identifying biologically
   relevant DE genes and can assist in developing effective predictive
   models for cancer progression.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with certain clotting disorders or conditions have a greater
   risk of developing arterial or venous clots and downstream embolisms,
   strokes, and arterial insufficiency. These patients need prescription
   anticoagulant drugs to reduce the possibility of clot formation.
   However, historically, the clinical decision making workflow in
   determining the correct type and dosage of anticoagulant(s) is part
   science and part art. To address this problem, we developed
   Anticoagulation Manager, an intelligent clinical decision workflow
   management system on iOS-based mobile devices to help clinicians
   effectively choose the most appropriate and helpful follow-up clotting
   tests for patients with a common clotting profile. The app can provide
   physicians guidance to prescribe the most appropriate medication for
   patients in need of anticoagulant drugs. This intelligent app was
   jointly designed and developed by medical professionals in CDC and
   engineers at Georgia Tech, and will be evaluated by physicians for
   ease-of-use, robustness, flexibility, and scalability. Eventually, it
   will be deployed and shared in both physician community and developer

Abstract = {{Misdosing medications with sensitive therapeutic windows, such as
   heparin, can place patients at unnecessary risk, increase length of
   hospital stay, and lead to wasted hospital resources. In this work, we
   present a clinician-in-the-loop sequential decision making framework,
   which provides an individualized dosing policy adapted to each patient's
   evolving clinical phenotype. We employed retrospective data from the
   publicly available MIMIC II intensive care unit database, and developed
   a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an optimal heparin
   dosing policy from sample dosing trails and their associated outcomes in
   large electronic medical records. Using separate training and testing
   datasets, our model was observed to be effective in proposing heparin
   doses that resulted in better expected outcomes than the clinical
   guidelines. Our results demonstrate that a sequential modeling approach,
   learned from retrospective data, could potentially be used at the
   bedside to derive individualized patient dosing policies.}},

Abstract = {{Full range of motion (ROM) at a joint is necessary for efficient and
   adaptive movement; as such, it is an essential clinical evaluation
   measure for assessing an individual's motor function, which can be
   affected by any number of musculoskeletal injuries and neuropathies.
   Measurement of joint ROM in the clinic has classically been accomplished
   statically through the use of a manual goniometer. More recent efforts
   in the fields of prosthetics and orthotics have demonstrated the
   potential utility of wearable systems (e.g., exoskeletons, orthoses)
   designed to control joint motion(s) and instrumented with sensors
   capable of capturing joint angle data dynamically. This paper presents a
   novel methodology to assess the performance of a variety of angle
   sensors in the context of wearable joint angle measurement, particularly
   for use in articulated ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs). Dynamic and static
   errors are considered, and a cost-benefit analysis of a variety of
   off-the-shelf and custom-built sensors is reported to provide
   comparative data for selecting a sensor to measure joint motion in
   wearable exoskeletal systems. All of the sensors considered reported
   angular errors below 5. across all tests, though the optical encoder
   consistently demonstrated the highest accuracy (< 0.7 degrees) and
   precision, and both the resistive potentiometers exhibited the highest
   error in the dynamic tests (1.5 degrees to 4 degrees). The anisotropic
   magnetoresistive (AMR) sensor demonstrated the highest
   performance-to-cost ratio.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for performing activity classification for a joint health
   assessment system using acoustical emissions from the knee is presented.
   The algorithm was refined based on linear acceleration data from the
   shank and the thigh sampled at 100 Hz/ch and collected from eight
   healthy subjects performing unloaded flexion-extension and sit-to-stand
   motions. The algorithm was implemented on a field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA)-based processor and has been validated in real-time on a
   subject performing two minutes of activities consisting of
   flexion-extension, sit-to-stand, and other motions while standing. When
   an activity is detected, the algorithm generates an enable signal for
   high throughput data acquisition of knee joint sounds using two airborne
   microphones (100 kHz/ch) and two single-axis gyroscope and accelerometer
   pairs (1 kHz/ch). This approach can facilitate energy-efficient
   recording of joint sound signatures in the context of flexion-extension
   and sit-to-stand activities from freely-moving subjects throughout the
   day, potentially providing a means of evaluating rehabilitation status,
   for example, following acute knee injury.}},

Abstract = {{Discovering patterns in co-occurrences data between objects and groups
   of concepts is a useful task in many domains, such as healthcare data
   analysis, information retrieval, and recommender systems. These
   relational representations come from objects' behaviors in different
   views, posing a challenging task of integrating information from these
   views to uncover the shared latent structures. The problem is further
   complicated by the high dimension of data and the large ratio of missing
   data. We propose a new paradigm of learning semantic relations using
   tensor factorization, by jointly factorizing multi-view tensors and
   searching for a consistent underlying semantic space across each views.
   We formulate the idea as an optimization problem and propose efficient
   optimization algorithms, with a special treatment of missing data as
   well as high-dimensional data. Experiments results show the potential
   and effectiveness of our algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is diagnosed by analysis of the morphological
   and rhythmic properties of the electrocardiogram. It was recently shown
   that accurate detection of AFib is possible using beat-to-beat interval
   variations. This raises the question of whether AFib detection can be
   performed using a pulsatile waveform such as the Photoplethysmogram
   (PPG). The recent explosion in use of recreational and professional
   ambulatory wrist-based pulse monitoring devices means that an accurate
   pulse-based AFib screening algorithm would enable large scale screening
   for silent or undiagnosed AFib, a significant risk factor for multiple
   diseases. We propose a noise-resistant machine learning approach to
   detecting AFib from noisy ambulatory PPG recorded from the wrist using a
   modern research watch-based wearable device (the Samsung Simband).
   Ambulatory pulsatile and movement data were recorded from 46 subjects,
   15 with AFib and 31 non symptomatic. Single channel electrocardiogram
   (ECG), multi-wavelength PPG and tri-axial accelerometry were recorded
   simultaneously at 128 Hz from the non-dominant wrist using the Simband.
   Recording lengths varied from 3.5 to 8.5 minutes. Pulse (beat) detection
   was performed on the PPG waveforms, and eleven features were extracted
   based on beat-to-beat variability and waveform signal quality. Using
   10-fold cross validation, an accuracy of 95\% on out-of-sample data was
   achieved, with a sensitivity of 97\%, specificity of 94\%, and an area
   under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.99. The described
   approach provides a noise-resistant, accurate screening tool for AFib
   from PPG sensors located in an ambulatory wrist watch. To our knowledge
   this is the first study to demonstrate an algorithm with a high enough
   accuracy to be used in general population studies that does not require
   an ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic monitor.}},

Abstract = {{Impulse radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) radar has recently emerged as a
   promising candidate for non-contact monitoring of respiration and heart
   rate. Different studies have reported various radar based algorithms for
   estimation of these physiological parameters. The radar can be placed
   under a subject's mattress as he lays stationary on his back or it can
   be attached to the ceiling directly above the subject's bed. However,
   advertent or inadvertent movement on part of the subject and different
   postures can affect the radar returned signal and also the accuracy of
   the estimated parameters from it. The detection and analysis of these
   postural changes can not only lead to improvement in estimation
   algorithms but also towards prevention of bed sores and ulcers in
   patients who require periodic posture changes. In this paper, we present
   an algorithm that detects and quantifies different types of motion
   events using an under-the-mattress IR-UWB radar. The algorithm also
   indicates a change in posture after a macro-movement event. Based on the
   findings of this paper, we anticipate that IR-UWB radar can be used for
   extracting posture related information in non-clinical enviroments for
   patients who are bed-ridden.}},

   different regions in the brain and their functions at high
   spatiotemporal resolution, a tool is needed for obtaining long-term
   single unit activity (SUA) across the entire brain area. The concept and
   preliminary design of a distributed free-floating wireless implantable
   neural recording (FF-WINeR) system are presented, which can enabling SUA
   acquisition by dispersedly implanting tens to hundreds of untethered 1
   mm(3) neural recording probes, floating with the brain and operating
   wirelessly across the cortical surface. For powering FF-WINeR probes, a
   3-coil link with an intermediate high-Q resonator provides a minimum S21
   of -22.22 dB (in the body medium) and -21.23 dB (in air) at 2.8 cm coil
   separation, which translates to 0.76\%/759 mu W and 0.6\%/604 mu W of
   power transfer efficiency (PTE) / power delivered to a 9 k Omega load
   (PDL), in body and air, respectively. A mock-up FF-WINeR is implemented
   to explore microassembly method of the 1x1 mm(2) micromachined silicon
   die with a bonding wire-wound coil and a tungsten micro-wire electrode.
   Circuit design methods to fit the active circuitry in only 0.96 mm(2) of
   die area in a 130 nm standard CMOS process, and satisfy the strict power
   and performance requirements (in simulations) are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of an individual's neural response to stimuli (the event-related
   potential or ERP) has potential as a biometric because it is highly
   resistant to fraud relative to other conventional authentication
   systems. P300 is an ERP in human electroencephalography (EEG) that
   occurs in response to an oddball stimulus when an individual is actively
   engaged in a target detection task. Because P300 is consistently
   detectable from almost every subject, it is considered a potential
   signal for biometric applications. This paper presents a feasibility
   study of using topological plots of P300 as a biometric in subject
   authentication. The variation in latency and location of P300 response
   of 24 participants performing the P300Speller task were studied. Data
   sets from four participants were used for algorithm training; data from
   the other 20 participants were used as imposters for algorithm
   validation. The result showed that the algorithm was able to correctly
   identify three out of these four participants. Validation test also
   proved that the algorithm was able to reject 95\% of the imposters for
   those three authenticated participants.}},

Abstract = {{Intravenous infiltration is a condition wherein an infused solution
   leaks inadvertently into soft tissue surrounding a hypodermic needle
   site. This occurrence affects approximately 6.5\% of patients in
   hospitals worldwide, and can lead to severe tissue damage if not treated
   immediately. The methods currently used by medical staff to detect an
   infiltration are subjective and can potentially be prone to error.
   Infiltration is an even larger concern in pediatric patients, who have
   smaller veins than adults and have more difficulty in communicating pain
   or other discomfort associated with the infiltration with medical staff.
   For these reasons, automatic IV infiltration detection could potentially
   reduce the risk associated with this damaging condition. This paper
   proposes a novel proof-ofconcept system that uses non-invasive sensing
   in conjunction with a low-power embedded computing platform to deliver
   continuous infiltration monitoring around the IV catheter site. This
   kind of system could be able to detect an infiltration by non-invasively
   monitoring for known symptoms: swelling of soft tissue and increased
   skin firmness; these symptoms can be sensed by measuring skin stretch
   and local bioimpedance. Moreover, the low-power design and wireless
   capabilities can potentially enable continuous wear. The proposed
   automatic IV infiltration detection system could significantly improve
   the number of infiltrations identified and treated on time.}},

Abstract = {{We present a System-On-Chip Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) for
   analyzing and processing the signals off an accelerometer for a wearable
   joint health assessment device. FPAAs have been shown to compute with an
   efficiency of 1000 times, as well as area efficiencies of 100 times,
   more than digital solutions. This work presents a low power signal
   processing system which allows us to extract features from the output of
   the accelerometer. These features are used by the classifier,
   implemented using a vector matrix multiplication and a two output
   1-winner-take-all, to detect flexion and extension cycles in the
   subject. The compiled design consumes 0.636 mu W of power for the front
   end analog signal processing chain where as the single layer classifier
   uses 13 mu W of power. Thus the system is highly suitable for wearable
   applications where power consumption is a major concern. The current
   FPAA is fabricated in a 0.35 mu m CMOS process and is operated at a
   power supply of 2.5 volts. The Gm-C filters and other circuits are
   operated in the subthreshold regime of the transistor to obtain the
   highest transconductance to current ratio offered by the process.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we extract features from an under-the-mattress impulse
   radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) radar and a microphone, placed on the
   side table of the bed, to classify epochs belonging to normal sleep and
   those that contain an apnea event in them. Sleep apnea is the most
   common form of sleep related breathing disorder in adults with an
   estimated prevalance of 5-15\%. The common diagnostic process for sleep
   apnea, polysomnography (PSG), involves sleeping in well-equipped sleep
   clinics. The cost and discomfort associated with the process has spurred
   research towards the design of portable home-based monitoring devices.
   However, these include sensors which need to be attached to patients at
   various locations on the body. In this preliminary and on-going study,
   we collected 18 hours of data of 3 subjects who were previously
   diagnosed with sleep apnea. The data was recorded using non-contact
   sensors, an IR-UWB radar and a microphone, in a sleep clinic along with
   the time synchronized gold-standard PSG data. A simple linear classifier
   was used to perform binary classification between normal and apnea
   epochs and the performance was analyzed compared to the true results
   provided by the PSG. It was observed, that combining snore features from
   the microphone data improves the overall accuracy of the classifier.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of tremor characteristics by movement disorder physicians
   are usually done at single time points in clinic settings, so that the
   description of the tremor does not take into account the dependence of
   the tremor on specific behavioral situations. Moreover,
   treatment-induced changes in tremor or behavior cannot be quantitatively
   tracked for extended periods of time. We developed a wearable tremor
   measurement system with tremor and activity recognition algorithms for
   long-term upper limb behavior tracking, to characterize tremor
   characteristics and treatment effects in their daily lives. In this
   pilot study, we collected sensor data of arm movement from three healthy
   participants using a wrist device that included a 3-axis accelerometer
   and a 3-axis gyroscope, and classified tremor and activities within
   scenario tasks which resembled real life situations. Our results show
   that the system was able to classify the tremor and activities with
   89.71\% and 74.48\% accuracies during the scenario tasks. From this
   results, we expect to expand our tremor and activity measurement in

Abstract = {{This study presents a reinforcement learning approach for the
   optimization of the proportional-integral gains of the feedback
   controller represented in a computational model of epilepsy. The chaotic
   oscillator model provides a feedback control systems view of the
   dynamics of an epileptic brain with an internal feedback controller
   representative of the natural seizure suppression mechanism within the
   brain circuitry. Normal and pathological brain activity is simulated in
   this model by adjusting the feedback gain values of the internal
   controller. With insufficient gains, the internal controller cannot
   provide enough feedback to the brain dynamics causing an increase in
   correlation between different brain sites. This increase in
   synchronization results in the destabilization of the brain dynamics,
   which is representative of an epileptic seizure. To provide compensation
   for an insufficient internal controller an external controller is
   designed using proportional-integral feedback control strategy. A
   cross-entropy optimization algorithm is applied to the chaotic
   oscillator network model to learn the optimal feedback gains for the
   external controller instead of hand-tuning the gains to provide
   sufficient control to the pathological brain and prevent seizure
   generation. The correlation between the dynamics of neural activity
   within different brain sites is calculated for experimental data to show
   similar dynamics of epileptic neural activity as simulated by the
   network of chaotic oscillators.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting emergence of a low-rank signal from high-dimensional data is
   an important problem arising from many applications such as camera
   surveillance and swarm monitoring using sensors. We consider a procedure
   based on the largest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix over a
   sliding window to detect the change. To achieve dimensionality
   reduction, we present a sketching-based approach for rank change
   detection using the low-dimensional linear sketches of the original
   high-dimensional observations. The premise is that when the sketching
   matrix is a random Gaussian matrix, and the dimension of the sketching
   vector is sufficiently large, the rank of sample covariance matrix for
   these sketches equals the rank of the original sample covariance matrix
   with high probability. Hence, we may be able to detect the low-rank
   change using sample covariance matrices of the sketches without having
   to recover the original covariance matrix. We character the performance
   of the largest eigenvalue statistic in terms of the false-alarm-rate and
   the expected detection delay, and present an efficient online
   implementation via subspace tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a sequence S of length n emitted by a Discrete Memoryless
   Source (DMS) with unknown distribution p. We wish to construct a
   lossless source code that maps S to a sequence S' of minimal length m
   such that S' approximates in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence a
   sequence emitted by another DMS with known distribution q. Our main
   result is the existence of a coding scheme that performs such a task
   with an asymptotically optimal compression rate, i.e., such that the
   limit of m/n is H(p)/H(q) as n goes to infinity. Our coding scheme
   overcomes the challenges created by the lack of knowledge about p by
   relying on a sufficiently fine estimation of H (p), followed by an
   appropriately designed type-based compression that jointly performs
   source resolvability and universal lossless source coding. Our result
   recovers several previous results that either assume p uniform, or q
   uniform, or p known. The price paid for these generalizations is the use
   of common randomness with vanishing rate. We further determine that the
   length of the latter roughly scales as the square root of n, by an
   analysis of second order asymptotics and error exponents.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic event picking plays a key role in seismology studies. The goal
   of seismic event picking is to detect the onset of a seismic event,
   which typically causes an increase in the amplitude of the recorded
   signal. In this paper, we present a sequential change-point detection
   method for online seismic event detection, based on the generalized
   maximum likelihood statistic. We assume that the signals prior to the
   event are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with zero mean and known
   variance, and after the event are i.i.d. Gaussian with zero mean and an
   increased unknown variance. We form a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)
   based statistic by replacing the unknown variance with its maximum
   likelihood estimate, which takes a simple form and has a recursive
   implementation. An event is detected whenever the statistic exceeds a
   prescribed threshold. We compare the performance of our GLR procedure
   relative to the commonly used short-term-average/long-term-average
   (STA/LTA) algorithm, which is the state-of-the-art for seismic event
   detection, using large-scale seismic dataset and demonstrate the
   benefits of our GLR statistic. We also present a joint detection method
   to utilize the capability of seismic sensors to record signals through
   three independent channels, to achieve much better detection
   performance. We also present a method to combine GLR procedure with
   P-wave and S-wave filtering.}},

Abstract = {{Trajectory optimization considers the problem of deciding how to control
   a dynamical system to move along a trajectory which minimizes some cost
   function. Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an optimal control
   method which utilizes a second-order approximation of the problem to
   find the control. It is fast enough to allow real-time control and has
   been shown to work well for trajectory optimization in robotic systems.
   Here we extend classic DDP to systems with multiple time-delays in the
   state. Being able to find optimal trajectories for time-delayed systems
   with DDP opens up the possibility to use richer models for system
   identification and control, including recurrent neural networks with
   multiple timesteps in the state. We demonstrate the algorithm on a two
   tank continuous stirred tank reactor. We also demonstrate the algorithm
   on a recurrent neural network trained to model an inverted pendulum with
   position information only.}},

Abstract = {{We study an SIS epidemic model over an arbitrary fixed network topology
   where the n agents, or nodes of the network, have partial information
   about the epidemic state. The agents react by distancing themselves from
   their neighbors when they believe the epidemic is currently prevalent.
   An agent's awareness is weighted from three sources of information: the
   fraction of infected neighbors in their contact network, their social
   network, and a global broadcast of the fraction of infected nodes in the
   entire network. The dynamics of the benchmark (no awareness) and
   awareness models are described by discrete-time 2(n)-state Markov
   chains. Through a coupling technique, we establish monotonicity
   properties between the benchmark and awareness models. Particularly, we
   show that the expectation of any increasing random variable on the space
   of sample paths, e.g. eradication time or total infections, is lower for
   the awareness model. In addition, we give a characterization for this
   difference of expectations in terms of the coupling distribution. In
   simulations, we evaluate how different sources of information affect the
   spread of an epidemic.}},

   methods in that, at every iteration, every agent performs a consensus
   update of its decision variables followed by an optimization step of its
   local objective function and local constraint. Unlike other methods, the
   last step of our method is not a projection to the feasible set, but
   instead a subgradient step in the direction that minimizes the local
   constraint violation. We show that the algorithm converges almost
   surely, i.e., every agent agrees on the same optimal solution, when the
   objective functions and constraint functions are nondifferentiable and

   qualitatively compare the infinite dimensional MP and the stochastic
   Dynamic Programming Principle ( DPP) frameworks as applied to control of

   the presented framework is a multi trajectory optimization method to
   solve nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems for Q-MJD processes.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a class of scheduling problems that concern the routing of a
   set of mobile agents over the edges of an underlying guidepath network.
   These problems are motivated by (i) the operations of some unit-load,

   contemporary production and distribution facilities, and also by (ii)
   the operations that take place in the physical layouts implementing the
   elementary logical operations that are employed in quantum computing.
   The presented results include (a) a systematic formulation of the
   considered scheduling problems as mixed integer programs (MIPs), (b) a
   Lagrangian relaxation of these MIP formulations, and (c) the development
   of a customized dual-ascent algorithm for the systematic and expedient
   solution of the corresponding dual problem. The latter provides lower

Abstract = {{We propose a novel methodology for stochastic trajectory optimization
   which is based on merging the theory of spectral expansions with
   Differential Dynamic Programming. Specifically, we employ polynomial
   chaos expansions to handle parametric uncertainties and utilize the
   Karhunen-Loeve transformation to represent stochastic forces. This
   allows us to build a generic framework and avoid relying on restrictive
   assumptions regarding the form of stochasticity. In addition,
   Differential Dynamic Programming provides an iterative algorithm for
   finding optimal controls which attains scalability and, under mild
   assumptions, fast convergence. The obtained method is capable of
   controlling the distribution of the system's trajectory and can be used
   in both planning and control. Last but not least, we formulate a
   variational integration scheme for uncertain systems that are
   represented by spectral expansions. Simulated examples validate the
   applicability and numerical efficiency of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{A causal modeling for an impulsive system with a state dependent
   switching surface is defined and analyzed on a new extended real space,
   denoted as Krylov hyperreals, which is based on the nonstandard analysis
   (NSA). The recent work of the authors contains the detailed construction
   of the extended space, and the generalized function on that space. In
   the first part of the paper, important concepts of NSA, and the
   suggested function space are reviewed. Next, a new generalization of a
   continuous but not differentiable function will be defined on the Krylov
   hyperreals in order to properly define a composition between singular
   and non differentiable function. By using an analogy to a spring and
   damper model, the authors suggest an equivalent causal model of the
   state dependent impulsive system by introducing the powers of singular
   control in the original continuous dynamics. A motivational example of a
   bouncing ball moving on a horizontal surface is analyzed to show the
   effectiveness.}},

   sensors to estimate a collection of hidden states to a user-specified

   views in order to minimize expected uncertainty. This formulation leads
   to an optimization problem with as many coupled LMI constraints as the
   number of hidden states. The network solves this problem by means of a
   new distributed random approximate projections method that is robust to
   the state disagreement errors that will exist among the robots as the
   distributed filter fuses the collected measurements and is
   computationally light enough to handle large numbers of hidden states.}},

   authority about only two of the three principal axes, the objective is
   to align the uncontrolled third axis of all satellites such that they
   point along the same direction. Two control laws are proposed, one which
   aligns two satellites towards the same direction in inertial space, and
   another one which synchronizes an N-satellite system such that the
   satellites align their underactuated axes towards a fixed inertial
   direction. The synchronization discrepancy between the satellites is
   expressed in a unique parameterization that describes the uncontrolled
   axis of one satellite in the frame of the other via a stereographic
   projection, while the velocity discrepancy is described using a partial
   angular velocity difference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies optimal control processes governed by a specific
   family of systems described by functional differential equations (FDEs)
   involving the sup-operator. Systems evolving with the state suprema
   constitute a useful abstraction for various models of technological and
   biological processes. The specific theoretic framework incorporates
   state suprema in the right hand side of the initially given differential
   equation and finally leads to a FDE with the state-dependent delays. We
   study a class of nonlinear FDE-featured optimal control problems (OCPs)
   in the presence of some additional control constraints. Our aim is to
   develop implementable first-order optimality conditions for the retarded
   OCPs under consideration. We use the celebrated Lagrange approach and
   prove a variant of the Pontryagin-like Minimum Principle for the given
   OCPs. Moreover, we discuss a computational approach to the main dynamic
   optimization problems and also consider a possible application of the
   developed methodology to the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control
   of solar energy plants.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual constraints have been recognized as an essential bridging tool
   which has the potential to translate rich nonlinear bipedal control
   methodologies to the control of prostheses. In this paper, we propose a
   hybrid system model based two-step direct collocation approach to
   automatically generate three-dimensional (3D) human-like multi-contact
   prosthetic gaits (via virtual constraints) for an asymmetric
   amputee-prosthesis system model. Unimpaired human locomotion is studied
   first to provide a reference for this gait design method. Specific
   requirements such as amputee comfortability, human likeness, physical
   limitations for hardware implementation are then discussed explicitly in
   order to quantify a well-designed prosthetic gait. A 29 degrees of
   freedom 3D unsymmetrical bipedal robotic model is considered to model
   the asymmetric amputee-prosthesis system. Imposing the prosthetic gait
   requirements as nonlinear constraints and utilizing the asymmetric 3D
   hybrid system model, a two-step direct collocation based optimization
   method is proposed to generate 3D prosthetic gaits automatically. The
   resulting prosthetic gait is analyzed in detail, showing the designed
   multi-contact gait is human-like, formally stable and optimal w.r.t the
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we study the problem of keeping the objective functions of
   individual agents epsilon-differentially private in cloud-based
   distributed optimization, where agents are subject to global constraints
   and seek to minimize local objective functions. The communication
   architecture between agents is cloud-based instead of communicating
   directly with each other, they coordinate by sharing states through a
   trusted cloud computer. In this problem, the difficulty is twofold: the
   objective functions are used repeatedly in every iteration, and the
   influence of perturbing them extends to other agents and lasts over
   time. To solve the problem, we analyze the propagation of perturbations
   on objective functions over time, and derive an upper bound on them.
   With the upper bound, we design a noise-adding mechanism that randomizes
   the cloud based distributed optimization algorithm to keep the
   individual objective functions epsilon-differentially private. In
   addition, we study the trade-off between the privacy of objective
   functions and the performance of the new cloud-based distributed
   optimization algorithm with noise. We present simulation results to
   numerically verify the theoretical results presented.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are generally regarded as the smallest
   functional units necessary to reproduce multicellular systems such as
   tissues and organs. Recent work showed that agent-based models of the
   stochastic dynamics of locally interacting stem cell agents accurately
   capture the time-dependent distributions of a variety of spatial
   patterns. Starting from a 3-dimensional, local interaction model of ESC
   proliferation and differentiation, in this paper, we developed a pattern
   classification and parameter optimization approach to maximize the
   occurrence of desired morphogenic patterns. Our approach uses Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a pattern classification method that
   exploits a quantitative characterization of pattern formation. Since
   patterning likely imprints subsequent choices that stem cell aggregates
   make in lineage specification (e.g. precursors of neurons, lung cells,
   or muscle cells), our parameter optimization approach can be used to
   synthesize global differentiation patterns through local cues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces saddle-point methods for distributed
   continuous-time online convex optimization, where the system objective
   function varies arbitrarily over time subject to some global inequality
   constraints. The overall dynamics of the proposed saddle-point
   controller are described by a system of differential equations, coupled
   linearly through the network Laplacian. The controller pushes actions
   along the negative gradient direction of the objective, constraint
   violation, as well as network disagreement using only causal and locally
   available information, while dynamically adapting the Lagrange
   multipliers in a decentralized fashion. We define regret as the cost
   difference with the optimal action over time. We show that the proposed
   saddle-point controller achieves a regret of order 0(root T) with the
   time horizon T. We also address the impact of the network topology,
   encoded in the spectrum of the network Laplacian, as a factor on the
   speed of convergence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a cooperative filtering scheme for online parameter
   identification of 2D diffusion processes using data collected by a
   mobile sensor network moving in the diffusion field. The diffusion
   equation is incorporated into the information dynamics associated with
   the trajectories of the mobile sensors. A cooperative Kalman filter is
   developed to provide estimates of field values, the gradient, and the
   temporal variations of the field values along the trajectories. This
   leads to a co-design scheme for state estimation and parameter
   identification for diffusion processes that is different from using
   static sensors. Utilizing the state estimates from the filters, a
   recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is designed to estimate the
   unknown diffusion coefficient of the field. A set of sufficient
   conditions is derived for the convergence of the cooperative Kalman
   filter. Simulation results show satisfactory performance of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{A novel bio-inspired strategy, the Hybrid Speeding Up Slowing Down
   (Hybrid SUSD) strategy, is introduced to achieve distributed control of
   a multi-agent system for the localization of multiple sources in a
   search space. Hybrid SUSD switches between bio-inspired exploration
   algorithms and exploitation algorithms. The exploration algorithms
   provide coverage of the workspace with non-zero probability. The
   exploitation algorithms leverage the SUSD strategy for source seeking
   without explicit gradient estimation. Conditions for switching between
   exploration and exploitation are developed based on measurements taken
   by an agent and the number of neighbors an agent may have. Given a
   confined search space, the convergence of the hybrid SUSD to locate a
   source is rigorously justified. Simulation results confirm that the
   strategy allows each agent to converge to one of the source locations.
   The Hybrid SUSD may be used as a distributed optimization algorithm that
   is able to find all minima of a function over a confined search space.}},

Abstract = {{Recent progress in randomized motion planning has led to the development
   of a new class of sampling-based algorithms that provide asymptotic
   optimality guarantees, almost surely, notably the RRT{*} algorithm among
   others. The recently proposed RRT\# algorithm utilizes dynamic
   programming ideas (namely, asynchronous value iteration) and implements
   them incrementally on randomly generated graphs to improve on RRT{*} and
   thus obtain high quality solutions with enhanced rates of convergence.
   In this work we explore a different class of dynamic programming
   algorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated
   by iterative sampling, which utilize policy iteration instead of value
   iteration and that are better suited for massive parallelization.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-agent system with uncertainty entails a set of agents intent on
   maximizing their local utility functions that depend on the actions of
   other agents and a state of the world while having partial and different
   information about actions of other agents and the state of the world.
   When agents repeatedly have to make decisions in these settings, we
   propose a general class of decision-making dynamics based on the
   Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm with inertia. We show convergence of the
   proposed algorithm to pure Nash equilibria for the class of weakly
   acyclic games-a structural assumption on local utility functions that
   guarantees existence of pure Nash equilibria-as long as the predictions
   of the agents of their local utilities satisfy a mild asymptotic
   accuracy condition. Using the results on the general dynamics, the paper
   proposes distributed implementations of the FP algorithm with inertia
   suited for networked multi-agent systems and shows its convergence to
   pure Nash equilibria. Numerical examples corroborate the analysis
   providing insights to convergence time.}},

   Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is proposed to deal with the constraint
   requirements which can be both time and iteration varying. We show that
   under the proposed ILC scheme, uniform convergence of the full state
   tracking error beyond a small time interval in each iteration can be
   guaranteed over the iteration domain, while the constraints on the joint
   position vector will not be violated during operation. An illustrative

Abstract = {{This paper presents an optimal gait synthesis method that exploits the
   full body dynamics of robots using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD)
   control framework and for the first time experimentally realizes online
   HZD gait generation for a planar underactuated robot. Hybrid zero
   dynamics is an established theoretical framework that formally enables
   stable control of dynamic locomotion by enforcing virtual constraints
   through feedback controllers. An essential part of successfully
   realizing dynamic walking with HZD framework is determining parameters
   of the virtual constraints that satisfy hybrid invariant condition via
   nonlinear constrained optimization. Due to the complexity of the full
   hybrid system model of the robot, these optimization problems often
   suffer from slow convergence and local minima. In this paper, we improve
   the reliability of the HZD gait optimization and significantly increase
   the convergence speed by taking advantage of the direct transcription
   formulation and the exponential convergence of the global orthogonal
   collocation (a.k.a. pseudospectral) method. As a result, generating HZD
   gaits online becomes feasible with an average computation time less than
   0.5 seconds, as will be demonstrated experimentally on a bipedal robot.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of learning optimal policies for
   satisfying signal temporal logic (STL) specifications by agents with
   unknown stochastic dynamics. The system is modeled as a Markov decision
   process, in which the states represent partitions of a continuous space
   and the transition probabilities are unknown. We formulate two synthesis
   problems where the desired STL specification is enforced by maximizing
   the probability of satisfaction, and the expected robustness degree,
   that is, a measure quantifying the quality of satisfaction. We discuss
   that Q-learning is not directly applicable to these problems because,
   based on the quantitative semantics of STL, the probability of
   satisfaction and expected robustness degree are not in the standard
   objective form of Q learning. To resolve this issue, we propose an
   approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved via
   Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies
   obtained by the approximate approach. The performance of the proposed
   method is demonstrated via simulations.}},

   information theory for source seeking can be realized using this
   framework. Using the framework, we developed a novel algorithm called
   the expected rate algorithm which has lower computational requirement.
   We prove that both infotaxis and expected rate algorithms generate
   identical optimization steps in most cases. Using simulation we show
   that under certain conditions the proposed algorithm generates more
   effective optimization steps than infotaxis and verify the computational
   performance of the proposed algorithm. We also demonstrate the practical
   applicability of the algorithm in source seeking through experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Operational planning of a small and isolated energy system having a
   large wind farm and a battery storage device is studied. Operational
   planning decisions are to be made in two time-scales: daily unit
   commitment (UC) and hourly dispatch. For this problem, Markov decision
   process (MDP) and stochastic programming (SP) are combined to account
   for both daily and hourly changes of wind uncertainty. Two stage SP is
   formulated for day-ahead UC decision and dispatch decisions considering
   a number of scenarios regarding uncertainty with respect to hourly
   ramping of the wind within a day. Here, the value of the end state of
   daily unit commitment and battery with respect to the future beyond the
   day (value function), which is estimated from the MDP formulation, is
   included in the objective function to ensure that longer term
   implications of the decisions are considered. In the MDP formulation,
   daily evolving exogenous information on wind speed is captured, and the
   value function is approximated with a linear model. The coefficient
   vector of the linear model is recursively updated with sampled
   observations estimated from the daily SP model. In connection with this,
   a general wind model for timescales from seasonal to hourly is developed
   to enable seamless connection of the decision making across the scales.
   The results of the proposed integrated method are compared to those of
   just the two-stage SP model through a case study and real wind data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns a first-order algorithmic technique for a class of
   optimal control problems defined on switched-mode hybrid systems. The
   salient feature of the algorithm is that it avoids the computation of
   Frechet or Gateaux derivatives of the cost functional, which can be time
   consuming, but rather moves in a projected-gradient direction that is
   easily computable (for a class of problems) and does not require any
   explicit derivatives. The algorithm is applicable to a class of problems
   where a pointwise minimizer of the Hamiltonian is computable by a simple
   formula, and this includes many problems that arise in theory and
   applications. The natural setting for the algorithm is the space of
   continuous-time relaxed controls, whose special structure renders the
   analysis simpler than the setting of ordinary controls. While the space
   of relaxed controls has theoretical advantages, its elements are
   abstract entities that may not be amenable to computation. Therefore, a
   key feature of the algorithm is that it computes adequate approximations
   to relaxed controls without loosing its theoretical convergence
   properties. Simulation results, including cpu times, support the
   theoretical developments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a sampling-based algorithm to synthesize
   control policies with temporal and uncertainty constraints. We introduce
   a specification language called Gaussian Distribution Temporal Logic
   (GDTL), an extension of Boolean logic that allows us to incorporate
   temporal evolution and noise mitigation directly into the task
   specifications, e.g. ``Go to region A and reduce the variance of your
   state estimate below 0.1 m(2)center dot{''} Our algorithm generates a
   transition system in the belief space and uses local feedback
   controllers to break the curse of history associated with belief space
   planning. Furthermore, conventional automata-based methods become
   tractable. Switching control policies are then computed using a product
   Markov Decision Process (MDP) between the transition system and the
   Rabin automaton encoding the task specification. We present algorithms
   to translate a GDTL formula to a Rabin automaton and to efficiently
   construct the product MDP by leveraging recent results from incremental
   computing. Our approach is evaluated in hardware experiments using a
   camera network and ground robot.}},

Title = {{Energy Efficiency Tradeoff in Interference Channels}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{4495-4508}},
Abstract = {{Interference is one of the major obstacles to improving the performance
   in wireless communication systems. As the ever-growing data traffic is
   carried over extremely dense networks, how to deal with interference
   becomes even more relevant. In this paper, we investigate a network with
   N pairs of users transmitting on the same channel simultaneously from
   the energy efficiency (EE) perspective. For such an interference
   network, we aim to address two issues: what is the EE tradeoff between
   users and how to design energy-efficient resource allocation scheme? To
   answer these two questions, we formulate a non-concave multi-objective
   optimization problem (MOOP) to investigate the EE tradeoff, taking into
   account the minimum data rate requirement of each user. The weighted
   Tchebycheff method is utilized to solve the MOOP by converting it into a
   single-objective optimization problem, which is then solved by the
   Dinkelbach method and the concave-convex procedure method. Based on the
   above, a power control algorithm is developed for the interference
   network to achieve at least a local optimum. The proposed algorithm is
   compared with the orthogonal bandwidth sharing, where each user
   orthogonally shares the whole bandwidth without interfering each other.
   In this scenario, the weighted Tchebycheff and the Dinkelbach methods
   are also utilized to develop the optimal bandwidth allocation and power
   control algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms is
   verified by numerical results, which show that it is better to share the
   bandwidth orthogonally rather than non-orthogonally if the interference
   between each user pair is stronger than a given threshold.}},

Abstract = {{A hospital in Southeast Asia considers deploying a radio-frequency

   impact of the RFID system on the process in terms of time taken and
   visibility of linens in the process. The simulation results show that
   the new process with the RFID system takes about 5.04 minutes longer for
   soiled linens and about 31.48 minutes longer for clean linens than the
   current process without the RFID system does. The increased times are
   mainly due to the activities added in the process to implement the RFID
   system. The results also demonstrate that the RFID system significantly
   improves the visibility of linens in the process. The results of this
   study could prove helpful to those who consider deploying an RFID system

Abstract = {{The growth of energy consumption in data centers is becoming one of the
   significant problems all over the world. The power usage of IT devices
   and air-conditioning (AC) units accounts for up to three-quarters of
   total energy consumption in typical data centers. This study discusses
   the effectiveness of using shutter-controlled air flow management to
   control cold air flow into the servers. It can impact the power
   consumption of both, the servers and the AC units. A raised floor data
   center has two types of aisles - cold and hot. In most cases, excessive
   volumes of cold air are pumped into the servers using cold aisles. We
   are proposing the utilization of a shutter to control the air flow and
   reduce wastage while preventing damage due to increased CPU temperature.
   The shutter is intended to control the air flow and maintain the
   temperature appropriately according to the workload of the servers. We
   evaluated the proposed system for controlling the flow of air into the
   servers. The results show that cold air volumes can be reduced by up to
   92\% while maintaining appropriate control of CPU temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we show how a quantum tunneling reflector (QTR) achieves
   high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when properly locked to a 5.8 GHz
   external signal. The energy cost per bit of the RF device is only 2.9
   pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BLE) transmitters. As a result, sensors communicating through
   backscatter modulation can increase their communication range at low
   energy cost per bit when equipped with a quantum tunneling reflector.
   Although the tunnel diode is highly non-linear, the measured SNR is
   approximately linear for increasing impinging powers; moreover, by
   amplifying signals below -55 dBm, the tunneling reflector achieves high
   sensitivities and extends by a factor of four the range of a backscatter
   system with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is
   often a difficult problem, because 1) the loss function might lack
   structural properties such as convexity or differentiability, since it
   is usually generated via black-box simulation of a stochastic system; 2)
   evaluation of CVaR usually requires rare-event simulation, which is
   computationally expensive. In this paper, we study the extension of the
   recently proposed gradient-based adaptive stochastic search (GASS)
   method to the optimization of CVaR. Instead of optimizing CVaR at the
   risk level of interest directly, we propose to initialize the algorithm
   at a small risk level, and then increase the risk level at each
   iteration adaptively until the target risk level is achieved, while the
   algorithm converges to an optimal solution of the original problem. It
   enables us to adaptively reduce the number of samples needed to estimate
   the CVaR at each iteration, and improves the overall efficiency of the
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-year research project focused on a global aerospace company's
   design-to-production transition, and in particular how to answer
   production-related questions much earlier in a program's design cycle
   than is possible today. A fundamental difficulty is that the time and
   expertise required to formulate appropriate analysis models prevents
   their routine use, especially in new program development. The project's
   goal was to reduce these requirements, and by late 2014 a methodology
   had been developed for on-demand analysis generation to answer routine
   questions about production systems. A pilot project was conducted in
   2015 to demonstrate efficacy, that an implementation of the methodology
   could in fact reduce by at least an order of magnitude the time required
   to answer a frequently-asked question, in a repeatable way while
   specification of the products, their process plans, planned facilities,
   and available resources were frequently changing. This paper summarizes
   the methodology, its pilot project implementation, and preliminary
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation optimization tools have the potential to provide an
   unprecedented level of support for the design and execution of
   operational control in Discrete Event Logistics Systems (DELS). While
   much of the simulation optimization literature has focused on developing
   and exploiting integration and syntactical interoperability between
   simulation and optimization tools, maximizing the effectiveness of these
   tools to support the design and execution of control behavior requires
   an even greater degree of interoperability than the current state of the
   art. In this paper, we propose a modeling methodology for operational
   control decision-making that can improve the interoperability between
   these two analysis methods and their associated tools in the context of
   DELS control. This methodology establishes a standard definition of
   operational control for both simulation and optimization methods and
   defines a mapping between decision variables (optimization) and
   execution mechanisms (simulation/base system). The goal is a standard
   for creating conforming simulation and optimization tools that are
   capable of meeting the functional needs of operational control decision
   making in DELS.}},

   modeling interdependencies and interactions among systems. The High
   Level Architecture (HLA) provides an approach to studying these aspects
   by integrating separately developed simulations in a distributed
   computing environment. These applications require coupling
   interdependent simulations and sequencing their execution to ensure
   certain data dependence requirements are met. An approach to specifying
   the proper sequence of execution of interdependent simulations using
   SysML sequence diagrams is proposed. A means to implement these
   specifications by automatically generating code using HLA's time
   management services is described. This approach is demonstrated through
   the creation of a federated simulation to model interactions among land
   use, transportation, and transit in the San Diego area by integrating
   widely used simulators such as UrbanSim and MATSim.}},

   While most work in community detection has focused on static graphs,

   both small and large batches of edge updates.}},

Abstract = {{The Automata Processor was designed for string-pattern matching. In this
   paper, we showcase its use to execute integer and floating-point
   comparisons and apply the same to accelerate interval stabbing queries.
   An interval stabbing query determines which of the intervals in a set
   overlap a query point. Such queries are often used in computational
   geometry, pattern matching, database management systems, and geographic
   information systems. The check for each interval is programmed as a
   single automaton and multiple automata are executed in parallel to
   provide significant performance gains. While handling 32-bit integers or
   single-precision floating-point numbers, up to 2.75 trillion comparisons
   can be executed per second, whereas 0.79 trillion comparisons per second
   can be completed for 64-bit integers or double-precision floating-point
   numbers. Additionally, our solution leaves the intervals in the set
   unordered; allowing addition or deletion of an interval in constant
   time. This is not possible for contemporary solutions wherein the
   intervals are ordered, making the query times faster, but making the
   updating of intervals complex. Our automata designs exemplify techniques
   that maximize resource utilization and minimize performance bottlenecks,
   which may be useful to future application developers on this processor.
   Their modular design allows them to become constituent parts of larger
   automata, where the numerical comparisons are part of the overall
   pattern matching operation. We have validated the designs on hardware,
   and the routines to generate the necessary automata and execute them on
   the AP will be made available as software libraries shortly.}},

   We first design and implement sequential SpTTM to avoid explicit data
   transformations between a tensor and a matrix, which is the conventional
   approach. We further optimize SpTTM on multicore CPU and GPU systems by
   parallelizing, avoiding locks, and exploiting data locality. Our
   sequential SpTTM is up to 3.5x faster than the SpTTM from Tensor Toolbox
   and 1.5x over that from Cyclops Tensor Framework. Our parallel

Abstract = {{The harvesting of elastic waves propagating in structures can be
   enhanced dramatically by means of focusing techniques through the use of
   mirror and lens concepts. Limited research has explored the elastic
   mirror design via cylindrical stubs that form elliptical and parabolic
   geometries to focus structure-borne waves originating from a point
   source and incident plane waves, respectively. Bulky cylindrical stubs
   used as scatterers in these first-generation heuristic efforts
   drastically altered the host structure although they achieved the
   focusing effect. To enable structurally-embedded elastic wave mirrors, a
   thorough understanding of the elastic mirror working principle is
   required. This work presents a detailed investigation of elastic wave
   mirror design, analysis, and fabrication for enhanced elastic wave
   energy harvesting. Specifically, it is aimed to provide an understanding
   of the elastic mirror mechanism (with an emphasis on the reflection of
   scatterers) for establishing embedded mirror concepts in which the host
   structure is not drastically altered. These configurations are enabled
   through the insertion of metallic beads (e.g. tungsten, lead, steel)
   into blind holes that form the mirror in the aluminum plate domain.
   Finite-element simulations and experimental validations are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Kernel methods and neural networks (NN) are two of the most powerful
   tools of machine learning to solve the engineering and science problems.
   In this paper, we propose kernel ridge regression (KRR) and NN to
   estimate the compressive strength (CS) of concrete with recycled
   aggregate based on the values of cement, natural aggregate, recycled
   aggregate, sand, and water. We collected a dataset of 182 samples and
   carried out the data analysis for each material used in making concrete.
   The dataset is used for training, validation, and testing of concrete's
   CS using KRR and NN. We use both linear and nonlinear kernels in ridge
   regression, and up to four layers NN with three hidden layers and one
   output layer for CS prediction. KRR and NN are designed in MATLAB, and
   we use different NN types and training functions with objective
   evaluation criterion to obtain the optimum models for CS prediction. We
   choose gradient descent with momentum weight bias learning and mean
   square error (MSE) performance functions for model training. Simulation
   results show that both KRR and NN predict the CS of concrete accurately
   and efficiently with admissible MSE and correlation coefficient close to
   one. KRR with nonlinear 4th order polynomial kernel outperforms the NN
   for CS prediction.}},

   modeling. NN adaptive control is designed such the NN controller
   responds online to the changes in system dynamics. NN adaptive

Abstract = {{More and more organizations move their data and workload to commercial
   cloud storage systems. However, the multiplexing and sharing of the
   resources in a cloud storage system present unpredictable data access
   latency to tenants, which may make online data-intensive applications
   unable to satisfy their deadline requirements. Thus, it is important for
   cloud storage systems to provide deadline guaranteed services. In this
   paper, to meet a current form of service level objective (SLO) that
   constrains the percentage of each tenant's data access requests failing
   to meet its required deadline below a given threshold, we build a
   mathematical model to derive the upper bound of acceptable request
   arrival rate on each server. We then propose a Deadline Guaranteed
   storage service (called DGCloud) that incorporates three algorithms. Its
   deadline-aware load balancing scheme redirects requests and creates
   replicas to release the excess load of each server beyond the derived
   upper bound. Its workload consolidation algorithm tries to maximally
   reduce servers while still satisfying the SLO to maximize the resource
   utilization. Its data placement optimization algorithm re-schedules the
   data placement to minimize the transmission cost of data replication.
   Our trace-driven experiments in simulation and Amazon EC2 show the
   higher performance of DGCloud compared with previous methods in terms of
   deadline guarantees and system resource utilization, and the
   effectiveness of its individual algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Modern datacenters employ server virtualization and consolidation to
   reduce the cost of operation and to maximize profit. However,
   interference among consolidated virtual machines (VMs) has barred
   mission-critical applications due to unpredictable performance. Through
   extensive measurements of RUBBoS n-tier benchmark, we found a major
   source of performance unpredictability: the memory thrashing caused by
   VM consolidation can reduce the system throughput by 46\% although
   memory was not over-committed. On a physical host with 4 consolidated
   VMs, we observed two distinct operational modes during a typical RUBBoS
   benchmark experiment. Over the first half of run-time session we found
   frequent CPU IOwait causing very long response time requests even though
   the system is under read-only CPU intensive workload; however, the
   latter half showed no such CPU abnormalities ( IOwait). Using ElbaLens -
   a lightweight tracing tool, we conducted fine-grain analyses at time
   granularities as short as 50ms and found that the abnormal IOwait is
   caused by transient memory thrashing among consolidated VMs. The
   abnormal IOwait induces queue overflows that propagate through the
   entire n-tier system, resulting in very long response time requests due
   to frequent TCP retransmissions. We provide three practical techniques
   such as VM migration, memory reallocation, soft resource reallocation
   and show that they can mitigate the effects of performance interference
   among consolidated VMs.}},

Abstract = {{Scheduling real-time workflows running in the Cloud often need to deal
   with uncertain task execution time and minimize uncertainty propagation
   during the workflow runtime. Efficient scheduling approaches can
   minimize the operational cost of Cloud providers and provide higher
   guarantee of the quality of services (QoS) for Cloud consumers. However,
   most of the existing workflow scheduling approaches are designed for the
   individual workflow runtime environments that are deterministic. Such
   static workflow schedulers are inadequate for multiple and dynamic
   workflows, each with possibly uncertain task execution time. In this
   paper, we address the problem of minimizing uncertainty propagation in
   real-time workflow scheduling. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware
   scheduling architecture to mitigate the impact of uncertainty factors on
   the quality of workflow schedules. Then we present a dynamic workflow
   scheduling algorithm (PRS) that can dynamically exploit proactive and
   reactive scheduling methods. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments
   using real-world workflow traces and our experimental results show that
   PRS outperforms two representative scheduling algorithms in terms of
   costs (up to 60\%), resource utilization (up to 40\%) and deviation (up
   to 70\%).}},

Abstract = {{Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a networking model that allows for
   greater dynamic control of a networking environment. With today's
   increasingly complex networking environment, SDN networks allow for a
   greater degree of control and flexibility of a network. This is
   accomplished through the separation of the control and data planes, as
   well as the implementation of a global programmable controller. A
   Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) can work very well with SDN
   networks as it can help monitor the overall security of a network by
   analyzing the network as a whole and making choices to defend the
   network based on data from the entire network. Using a Hidden Markov
   Model (HMM), a NIDS could monitor a network and learn from the evolving
   network activity of the present and react accordingly. This
   machine-learning NIDS could improve the efficiency of security
   applications and increases the range of activities that they are able to
   accomplish. In this paper we plan to demonstrate the possibility of
   using Hidden Markov models to develop an adaptive NIDS for use in the

   Threshold voltage and gate leakage current degradation affect setup/hold

Abstract = {{One of the major wearout mechanisms in modern microprocessors is
   time-dependent dielectric breakdown. Beyond the 28 nm technology node,
   time-dependent dielectric breakdown from not only the frontend-of-line
   and backend-of-line, but also the middle-of-line, yields a significant
   number of failures in VLSI circuits. In this paper, we investigate the
   impact of time-dependent dielectric breakdown in all phases of
   fabrication processes (i.e., frontend/middle/backend-of-line) on static
   random access memory in modern microprocessors. With the analysis of
   potential resistive short defect locations in a memory cell, we propose
   a methodology for accurately estimating memory reliability degraded by
   time-dependent dielectric breakdown. Using activity profiles and
   device-level wearout models, we also propose a method for statistically
   estimating the lifetime of a memory cell. Using the simulation

Abstract = {{In this work, we are interested in boosting speech attribute detection
   by formulating it as a multi-label classification task, and deep neural
   networks (DNNs) are used to design speech attribute detectors. A
   straightforward way to tackle the speech attribute detection task is to
   estimate DNN parameters using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function
   and employ a sigmoid function in the DNN output nodes. A more principled
   way is nonetheless to incorporate the micro-F1 measure, which is a
   widely used metric in the multi-label classification, into the DNN loss
   function to directly improve the metric of interest at training time.
   Micro-F1 is not differentiable, yet we overcome such a problem by
   casting our task under the maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning
   framework. The results demonstrate that our MFoM approach consistently
   outperforms the baseline systems.}},

Abstract = {{The auditory neural circuit is embedded in a physiological environment
   that can be influenced by hormones. Early work demonstrated that hormone
   mechanisms are highly responsive to social contexts. More recent work
   shows that hormones affect auditory processing across contexts, leading
   to adaptive responses to auditory cues, including those involved in
   social communication. This chapter addresses recent progress in studying
   these and related mechanisms among mammals in a maternal communication
   paradigm, wherein both reproductive hormones (e.g., estrogen, oxytocin)
   and social experience (infant-mother interaction) shape auditory
   responses to infant sounds. By broadly reviewing studies ranging from
   hormones and behavior to sensory processing and plasticity, this chapter
   lays out a systematic approach to investigating how hormones may provide
   a mechanism for enhancing the perception and learning of auditory cues
   in reproductive and other social contexts. As discussed,
   reproductive-related hormones may induce plasticity in central auditory
   circuitry to enable a sustained trace of infant vocalizations in the
   auditory cortex, allowing for better recognition and detection of infant
   cues and sustained maternal behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The shared nature of cloud network infrastructures causes unpredictable
   network performance, which may degrade the performance of these
   applications. Recently, several works propose to explicitly reserve the
   network bandwidth in the cloud with virtual network abstraction models,
   which pre-specify the network bandwidth between virtual machines (VMs)
   for a tenant job. However, the pre-specification fails to exploit the
   elastic feature of the bandwidth resource (i. e., more reserved
   bandwidth within no-elongation threshold bandwidth leads to shorter job
   execution time and vice versa) in job scheduling. It is difficult for
   ordinary tenants (without specialized network knowledge) to estimate the
   exact needed bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new cloud job
   scheduler, in which each tenant only needs to specify job deadline and
   each job's reserved bandwidth is elastically determined by leveraging
   the elastic feature to maximize the total job rewards, which represent
   the worth of successful completion by deadlines. Finally, the scheduler
   tries to reduce the execution time of each job. It also jointly
   considers the computational capacity of VMs and reserved VM bandwidth in
   job scheduling. Using trace-driven and real cluster experiments, we show
   the efficiency and effectiveness of our job scheduler in comparison with
   other scheduling strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, the science and technology of organic
   semiconductors has seen tremendous progress. The electrical and optical
   properties displayed by state-of-the-art organic semiconductors are
   remarkable in their tolerance to disorder, their ability to display high
   charge carrier mobility values and bipolar transport, and in that they
   can be engineered to display optical activity in the spectral range from
   the visible to the near-infrared. This new breed of organic materials is
   forcing us to reevaluate preconceived notions on how to optimize charge
   transport and photogeneration in disordered organic semiconductors.
   Lessons learned in the development of these remarkable organic
   semiconductors have rapidly spread across organic optoelectronic device
   platforms, from organic photovoltaics to organic field-effect
   transistors to organic light emitting diodes and to organic
   photodetectors, and thus are expected to provide further inspiration to
   continue advancing the science and technology of organic
   photorefractives. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a broad
   overview of current understanding of charge transport and
   photogeneration in organic semiconductors, going from crystalline to
   amorphous solids as well as to provide a brief overview of novel organic
   photoconductors that may offer significant opportunities to advance the
   science and technology of organic optoelectronic devices in general and

Abstract = {{New item or topic profiling and recommendation are useful yet

   of acquiring review opinions of the ``sentinel{''} users on the

   thus both user-specific ratings and future popularity of the items can
   be predicted simultaneously. Specifically, such a joint prediction task
   is formulated as a two-stage optimization problem, and a sentinel user
   selection algorithm is devised to facilitate effective latent profiles
   extraction for both item ratings and popularity predictions. Experiments
   with microblogging and movie data sets corroborate that the proposed
   method is capable of mitigating the cold-start problem and it

Abstract = {{Salient muscle activity identification via the phasic electromyographic
   metric (PEM) in human polysomnograms/sleep studies (PSGs) represent a
   potential quantitative metric to aid in differentiation between
   neurodegenerative disorder populations and age-matched controls. A major
   impairment to the implementation of PEM analysis for clinical assessment
   of neurodegenerative disorders includes the time consuming aspects for
   both visual and automated supervised methods, which require exhaustive
   expert scoring of PEM and non-PEM events. In order to surmount the
   aforementioned concerns, we propose a semi-supervised classification
   methodology encased within an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)
   utilizing an embedded Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion to
   automatically classify PEM and non-PEM events based on expert labeling
   of a single PEM instance. Results indicate that the application of a
   semi-supervised approach for PEM identification provides an excellent
   option to reduce the labeling burden within current human PSG muscle
   activity identification schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Fault-tolerant control and operation of complex unmanned and aircraft
   systems is an emerging technology intended to provide the designer and
   operator with flexibility, interoperability, sustainment and reliability
   under changing operational requirements or mission profiles. Moreover,
   it is intended to reconfigure online hardware and software to maintain
   the operational integrity of the system in the event of contingencies
   (fault/failure modes). This paper presents an hierarchical architecture
   that uses available sensor information, fault isolation, failure
   prognosis, system restructuring and controller reconfiguration. The
   fault tolerant control framework relies on prognostic information to
   reconfigure system components and preserve the operational integrity of
   the aircraft. The hierarchical structure starts at the lowest component
   level and migrates to the middle system/subsystem level ending with the
   final mission level. We illustrate the methodology using an
   electro-mechanical actuator (EMA).}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple dynamical model for the transmembrane potential in
   non-excitable mammalian cells. This model allows us to mimic the effect
   of nanoparticles on the transmembrane potential, by decreasing the
   permeability of potassium ion channels. We show that our model agrees
   with the trends observed in our experiments. However, it also exhibits
   opposing trends under certain conditions, which were not seen in the
   experiments. This indicates that the membrane potential can be bistable.
   We analyze the cellular conditions which may cause this apparent
   bistability. The effects of adding nanoparticles on sodium and chloride
   ion channels are also studied using the proposed model. We hypothesize
   that nanoparticles may also block the sodium and chloride ion channels
   but the extent of blockage of these ion channels may differ from that of
   potassium ion channels.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of sensor measurements is critical to the design of high
   performance control systems since sensor uncertainties can significantly
   deteriorate achievable closed-loop dynamical system performance. Sensor
   uncertainty can arise due to low sensor quality, sensor failure, or
   detrimental environmental conditions. For example, relatively cheap
   sensor suites are used for low-cost, small-scale unmanned vehicle
   applications that can result in inaccurate sensor measurements.
   Alternatively, sensor measurements can also be corrupted by malicious
   attacks if dynamical systems are controlled through large-scale,
   multilayered communication networks as is the case in cyber-physical
   systems. This paper presents several adaptive control architectures for
   stabilization of linear dynamical systems in the presence of sensor
   uncertainty and sensor attacks. Specifically, we propose new and novel
   adaptive controllers for state-independent and state-dependent sensor
   uncertainties. In particular, we show that the proposed controllers
   guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop dynamical system when
   the sensor uncertainties are time-invariant and uniform ultimate
   boundedness when the uncertainties are time-varying. We further discuss
   the practicality of the proposed approaches and provide a numerical
   example to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed adaptive control
   architectures.}},

   lemma, we obtain a probabilistic representation of the solution to the
   nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, expressed in the form of a
   decoupled system of FBSDEs. This system of FBSDEs can then be simulated
   by employing linear regression techniques. To enhance the efficiency of
   the proposed scheme when treating more complex nonlinear systems, we
   then derive an iterative modification based on Girsanov's theorem on the
   change of measure, which features importance sampling. The modified
   scheme is capable of learning the optimal control without requiring an
   initial guess. We present simulations that validate the algorithm and
   demonstrate its efficiency in treating nonlinear dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{A significant need has been identified for an improved device for
   transferring mobility limited people, for example, from a bed to a
   wheelchair, a wheelchair to a toilet, a floor to a wheelchair, or a
   wheelchair into a car. A new prototype concept patient transfer assist
   device has been developed, using electro-hydraulic pump controlled
   hydraulic actuation. With such a powerful device working in a relatively
   delicate and unstructured environment with both the patient and
   caregiver in its workspace, a form of interaction control to manage any
   external interaction forces is necessary. This paper presents a form of
   interaction control using redundant sensing of obstacles, using both
   proximity sensing from an ultrasonic sensor and external force sensing
   from a load cell. The control strategy is based on impedance control
   with force feedback. Experiments on one degree of freedom of the patient
   transfer device show that the control strategy can significantly reduce
   external interaction forces, as long as one or both of the sensors
   detects the obstacle. Further investigations will incorporate the
   redundant interaction control into multiple degrees of freedom of the
   patient transfer assist device system, and human operator experiments
   will be performed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, permutation invariant and collision free trajectories for
   a formation control problem are generated by using the root locus
   principle. A polynomial based representation space of multiple robots in
   two dimensional space is proposed, and the invariant properties in this
   space are analyzed. The formation control problem is solved in the
   representation space. A set of permutation invariant trajectories is
   generated by the generalized root locus dynamics. This method can be
   realized without the knowledge of global coordinates, but only with the
   local interaction between robots. In addition, the generalized root
   locus principle gives one degree of freedom to choose a different
   assignment in the formation. At the end, an example of permutation
   invariant safe control is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging and manipulating objects down to the molecular level plays a
   crucial role in many disciplines. It allows to unravel molecular
   phenomena, to form materials with new chemical and physical properties,
   or to build objects on an atomic scale. Science on the nanoscale is
   inherently interdisciplinary. It requires knowledge and insight into
   many fields, spanning from modeling, measuring, imaging, actuation to
   control. Often feedback control facilitates operation with molecular
   precision, despite the fact that many physical phenomena at the
   molecular level are still not well understood, and that stochastic and
   nonlinear effects are inherently present. This work provides an insight
   into some of the current control related research activities on a
   molecular scale. This is done considering examples from different
   fields: control related to scanning probe microscopy such as atomic
   force microscopy, controlled self assembly on a molecular scale, control
   aspects of molecular transport, and the use of control for manipulation
   of single molecules using macroscopic probe tips. The hope is that
   control related researchers, who are not experts in these fields, become
   aware of the opportunities present, which could also drive new
   theoretical developments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method of combining real-time walking
   pattern generation and constrained nonlinear control to achieve robotic
   walking under Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) and torque constraints. The
   proposed method leverages the fact that existing solutions to both
   walking pattern generation and constrained nonlinear control have been
   independently constructed as Quadratic Programs (QPs) and that these
   constructions can be related through an equality constraint on the
   instantaneous acceleration of the center of mass. Specifically, the
   proposed method solves a single Quadratic Program which incorporates
   elements from Model Predictive Control (MPC) based center of mass
   planning methods and from rapidly exponentially stabilizing control
   Lyapunov function (RES-CLF) methods. The resulting QP-based controller
   simultaneously solves for a COM trajectory that satisfies ZMP
   constraints over a future horizon while also producing joint torques
   consistent with instantaneous acceleration, torque, ZMP and RES-CLF
   constraints. The method is developed for simulation and experimental
   study on a seven-link, planar robot.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing state-based parameterized periodic trajectories on complex
   robotic systems, e. g., humanoid robots, can lead to instability due to
   sensor noise exacerbated by dynamic movements. As a means of
   understanding this phenomenon, and motivated by field testing on the
   humanoid robot DURUS, this paper presents sufficient conditions for the
   boundedness of hybrid periodic orbits (i. e., boundedness of walking
   gaits) for time dependent control Lyapunov functions. In particular,
   this paper considers virtual constraints that yield hybrid zero dynamics
   with desired outputs that are a function of time or a state-based phase
   variable. If the difference between the phase variable and time is
   bounded, we establish exponential boundedness to the zero dynamics
   surface. These results are extended to hybrid dynamical systems,
   establishing exponential boundedness of hybrid periodic orbits, i. e.,
   we show that stable walking can be achieved through time-based
   implementations of state-based virtual constraints. These results are
   verified on the bipedal humanoid robot DURUS both in simulation and
   experimentally; it is demonstrated that a close match between time based
   tracking and state based tracking can be achieved as long as there is a
   close match between the time and phase based desired output
   trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the application of classical control methods,
   designed for unconstrained nonlinear systems, to systems with nontrivial
   input constraints. As shown throughout the literature, unconstrained
   classical methods can be used to stabilize constrained systems, however,
   (without modification) these unconstrained methods are not guaranteed to
   work for a general control problem. In this paper, we propose conditions
   for which classical unconstrained methods can be guaranteed to
   exponentially stabilize constrained systems - which we term
   ``feasibility{''} conditions - and we provide examples of how to
   construct explicitly feasible controllers. The control design methods
   leverage control Lyapunov functions (CLF) describing the ``desired
   behavior{''} of the system; and we claim that in the event that a
   system's input constraints prevent the production of an exponentially
   stabilizing input for a particular CLF, a new, locally feasible CLF must
   be produced. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid feasibility
   controller consisting of a continuous- time controller which implements
   a CLF and a discrete parameter update law which finds feasible
   controller parameters as needed. Simulation results suggest that the
   proposed method can be used to overcome certain catastrophic
   infeasibility events encountered in robot locomotion.}},

   an optimization-based controller that formally guarantees collision free

Abstract = {{Networked multiagent systems consist of interacting agents that locally
   exchange information, energy, or matter. Since they do not in general
   have a centralized entity to monitor the activity of each agent,
   resilient distributed control system design for networked multiagent
   systems is essential in providing high system performance, reliability,
   and operation in the presence of system uncertainties. An important
   class of such system uncertainties that can significantly deteriorate
   the achievable closed-loop system performance is sensor uncertainties,
   which can arise due to low sensor quality, sensor failure, sensor bias,
   or detrimental environmental conditions. This paper presents a novel
   distributed adaptive control architecture for networked multiagent
   systems to mitigate the effect of sensor uncertainties. Specifically, we
   consider agents having high-order, linear dynamics with agent
   interactions corrupted by unknown exogenous disturbances. We show that
   the proposed adaptive control architecture guarantees asymptotic
   stability of the closed-loop dynamical system when the exogenous
   disturbances are time-invariant and uniform ultimate boundedness when
   the exogenous disturbances are time-varying. A numerical example is
   provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive
   control architecture.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a novel adaptive fault tolerant control scheme
   to address the finite-time position tracking control problem for a class
   of robot manipulators with joint position constraints and actuator
   faults. Backstepping design with a tan-type Barrier Lyapunov Function
   and a new structure of stabilizing function is presented. Through
   rigorous analysis, we show that despite the potential multiplicative and
   additive actuator faults, the position tracking error can converge into
   a small neighborhood of zero within finite time, while not violating the
   constraint requirement on the joint position vector. All closed loop
   signals are bounded during operation. A simulation study further
   demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A balance between adaptiveness and consistency is desired for a robot to
   select control laws to generate reactions to human movements. Two
   existing algorithms, the weighted majority algorithm and the online
   Winnow algorithm, are biased for either strong adaptiveness or strong

   able to achieve a tradeoff between consistency and adaptiveness. We give
   theoretical analysis to rigorously characterize the performance of DEA.
   Both simulation results and experimental data are demonstrated to
   confirm that DEA enables a robot to learn the preferred control law to

   performance in a team of agents to how the agents perceive (or trust)
   each other. This combination of social dynamics and physical update laws
   not only changes the performance of the system, but it has the potential
   to make it deteriorate in a dramatic fashion. In fact, in the two-agent
   case, it is shown that the system exhibits finite escape time through an
   invariance result that carries over also to larger systems and more
   elaborate trust models. The invariance result states that an increase in
   performance must be accompanied by an increase in the total trust in the
   network (and vice versa for deteriorating performance). Finally, the
   connection is made between the proposed model and the belief and group
   polarization phenomena encountered in group processes driven by social
   interaction dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of optimally balancing motion energy
   and communication transmission energy of a mobile robot tasked with
   transmitting a given number of data bits to a remote station, while
   navigating to a pre-specified destination in a given amount of time. The
   problem is cast in the setting of optimal control, where the robot has
   to choose its path, acceleration, and transmission rate along the path
   so as to minimize its energy required for transmission and motion, while
   satisfying various power and communication constraints. We use realistic
   models for the robot's channel estimation, motion dynamics, and power
   and energy costs. The main contribution of the paper is to show how to
   co-optimize robot's path along with other communication and motion
   variables. Two versions of the problem are solved: the first is defined
   offline by assuming that all the channel measurements are taken before
   the robots starts moving, while in the second the channel estimation is
   updated while the robot is in motion, and hence it is solved online. In
   both cases we utilize an in-house algorithm that computes near-optimal
   solutions in little time, which enables its use in the online setting.
   The optimization strategy is described in detail and validated by
   simulation of realistic scenarios.}},

   the integration of numerous simulations and experiments into the design

   Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are often used in industrial
   applications. PLCs continue to improve their computational abilities and
   are nowadays capable of running codes generated with MATLAB/ Simulink. A
   two-week curriculum was added to a graduate controls course to teach
   students operational techniques and programming of PLCs. Students
   developed skills necessary to design a controller using logic
   operations, logic gates, PLC programming, and a Human Machine Interface
   (HMI). The curriculum required the programming of a PLC and HMI to
   control automated test equipment with electro-pneumatic components.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous-wave (CW) electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems operating
   in the presence of magnetic soil often encounter issues with the voltage
   that the soil induces in the receive coil. Previously, an optimization
   procedure that represents the coils as stream functions and attempts to
   create coils to mitigate the effects of the soil was presented. In this
   paper, the optimization convergence is improved, and a new soil
   constraint that improves the coils created by the optimization is
   developed. New coil metrics are introduced, and new coils are designed
   using the new soil constraint, which allows more freedom for the
   optimization to adjust the soil response. The new coils indicate the
   possibility of improvement over current coil designs.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic induction sensors excel at detecting and classifying
   buried metallic objects. With the help of precomputed electromagnetic
   models, detection algorithms are able to pinpoint a target's location
   and orientation with high accuracy. A target's discrete spectrum of
   relaxation frequencies, is particularly useful for detection purposes.
   The discrete spectrum of relaxation frequencies is a simple pole
   expansion of the target's reaction to magnetic excitations. Its pole
   expansion coefficients can be computed by formulating differential
   Maxwell's equations as a generalized eigenvalue problem. When modeling
   arbitrary three-dimensional objects, this approach is complicated by the
   size of the system matrices and by a large null space that is near the
   eigenvalues of interest. A modified Jacobi-Davidson iteration will be
   described in this paper, that is capable of extracting the eigenvalues
   of interest without interference from the null space.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, hybrid chemical transport/receptor model approach is used to
   develop spatial fields of daily source impacts. The spatial-hybrid (SH)
   method uses source impact fields obtained from CMAQ simulations, which
   are then adjusted to better match species-specific observations.
   Specifically, the SH method assimilates modeled 36-km source impact
   estimates from CMAQ and ground observations from the Chemical Speciation
   Network (CSN) to produce source impacts that better reflect observed
   data. New source profiles are generated using source impact results from
   the SH method. The new source profiles reflect modeled and observed
   concentrations and also reflect secondary formation processes that are
   captured by CMAQ. Results of the application of this method suggest that
   the default source profiles used in emissions inventories may be
   inconsistent with observations. In this work, we present SH source
   impact fields over the year 2006. These results are then used to develop
   updated source profiles for fine particulate matter sources for the
   contiguous U.S. The profiles characterize the composition of 22
   particulate matter species, including major ions, carbon species, and 17
   metals. Sources analyzed include fossil fuel combustion, mobile sources,
   sea salt, biogenic emissions, biomass burning, as well as livestock
   operations, agricultural activities, metals processing, and solvents.
   Source profiles are evaluated by comparing results for two locations
   Atlanta, GA, and St. Louis, MO to previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years, manufacturing industries have accounted for
   one-third of the world total energy consumption and CO2 production.
   These issues, paired with the growing concern over global warming and

   industries. The advancement in computation and information systems have
   enabled researchers to develop intelligent systems that can be used for
   power, energy efficient machinery, temperature control, and intelligent
   scheduling systems that consider both productivity and energy efficiency
   as their objectives. With the aim of minimizing the energy consumption,
   researchers have also focused on the production and distribution of
   electricity. The intelligent techniques have been applied to solve this
   problem and one of the successful applications is known as ``smart
   grids{''}. The application of these intelligent technologies is not only
   limited to manufacturing. It can also be applied to a variety of other

   This allows adopting a single filament material to obtain different
   permittivity values in the various portions of a microwave component.
   Moreover, the variation of the infill factor allows reducing the
   dielectric loss tangent of the material: this permits increasing the
   quality factor of cavity filters even by using the same material. These
   features are illustrated through the design and experimental
   verification of two SIW filters, with identical frequency response but
   fabricated with different infill factor of the printing process, via

Abstract = {{We attempt to formulate Bayesian speaker adaptation for deep models and
   explore two different solutions. In the first ``indirect{''} approach,
   Bayesian adaptation is applied to context-dependent,
   Gaussian-mixture-model based hidden Markov models (CD-GMM-HMMs) with
   bottleneck (BN) features derived from deep neural networks (DNNs). The
   second method directly formulates Bayesian adaptation for CD-DNN-HMMs by
   casting the adaptation step into a generative framework to formulate
   maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation
   schemes. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal task demonstrate that
   both MAP and Structural MAP (SMAP) adaptation schemes are effective even
   with discriminative BN features. Furthermore, SMAP can attain a
   meaningful word error reduction (WERR) of 7.3\% even when 80 hours of
   data, and 284 different speakers are available at training time. We have
   also observed a notable performance improvement with the indirect
   approach, and that supports the plausibility of proposed solution
   towards this novel direction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate a DNN tone-based extended recognition
   network (ERN) approach to Mandarin tone recognition and tone
   mispronunciation detection. Given a toneless syllable sequence, a
   tone-based ERN is constructed by assigning five different tones to each
   toneless syllable, obtaining a fully expanded tonal syllable network.
   Next, Viterbi decoding is carried out on the tone-based ERN to find the
   best tone sequence. With respect to the tone recognition task, different
   acoustic units, and DNN configurations are compared. The experimental
   results show that tonal phone and longer DNN input window achieve better
   recognition performance. Moreover, we have applied confidence score
   extracted from tone-based ERN to verify whether L2 learners' tones are
   correctly pronounced. Compared with the conventional tone-based GOP
   (Goodness of Pronunciation) system, the proposed framework reduces the
   equal error rate by 10.98\% relative.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a regression approach via deep neural network
   (DNN) for unsupervised speech separation in a single-channel setting. We
   rely on a key assumption that two speakers could be well segregated if
   they are not too similar to each other. A dissimilarity measure between
   two speakers is then proposed to characterize the separation ability
   between competing speakers. We demonstrate that the distance between
   speakers of different genders is large enough to warrant a possible
   separation. We finally propose a DNN architecture with dual outputs, one
   representing the female speaker group and the other characterizing the
   male speaker group. Trained and tested on the Speech Separation
   Challenge corpus our experimental results show that the proposed DNN
   approach achieves large performance gains over the state-of-the-art
   unsupervised techniques without using specific knowledge about the mixed
   target and interfering speakers and even outperforms the supervised
   GMM-based method.}},

   the complicated mapping from reverberant to anechoic speech with a

   clearly observable harmonics and improve the speech quality better than
   a recently proposed sigmoid activation and min-max normalization scheme.
   It also outperforms this state-of-the-art algorithm in all objective
   performance metrics at all reverberation times tested. With a large
   training set, the proposed DNN-based dereverberation system can
   consistently improve the restoration of the low-frequency and
   intermediate-frequency contents of the estimated anechoic spectrograms,
   essential for human perception. As for a small training set, the
   proposed DNN system also exhibits a better robustness than the competing

Abstract = {{We investigate the effects of time and frequency sampling on short-time
   Fourier transform modifications to be used for speech dereverberation
   based on deep neural networks (DNNs). We first show that by adopting a
   linear activation function at the output layer and globally normalizing
   the target features into zero mean and unit variance, better
   performances can be obtained than existing DNN approaches. Then we show
   that the quality of dereverberated speech could be degraded with denser
   sampling in time for longer reverberation times, even at the price of
   increased computational complexities, requiring an adaptive time
   sampling strategy. On the other hand, the difference between the
   unwrapped phases of reverberant and anechoic speech becomes negligible
   with a dense sampling in frequency, implying a reduced speech
   distortion. Therefore, there is a great potential to enhance DNN based
   acoustic signal processing if the conventional sampling strategy can be
   carefully adjusted.}},

Abstract = {{In Big data and IoT environments, a huge-sized data is created as the
   result of process execution, some of which are generated by sensors. The
   main issue of such application has been to analyze the data in order to
   suggest enhancements to the process. Evaluation of the conformance of
   process models is of great importance in this regard. For this purpose,
   previous studies in process mining approach suggested conformance
   checking by measuring fitness that uses token replay and node-arc
   relations based on Petri net. However, fitness thus far has not
   considered statistical significance, but just offers a numeric ratio. We
   herein propose a statistical verification based on the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to judge whether two different log data sets are
   following the same process model. Our method can also judge that a set
   of event log data is following a process model by playing out the model
   and generating event log data from the model. We also propose a new
   concept of `Maximum Confidence Dependency' to solve the problem of the
   trade-off between model abstraction and process conformance. We expect
   that our method can be widely used in many applications which deal with
   business process enhancement by analyzing process model and execution
   log.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of cation exchange membrane (CEM) and anion exchange
   membrane (AEM) electrolytes to form of a hybrid, or bipolar membrane
   (BPM) electrolyte, can have unique advantages for electrochemical
   systems including fuel cells, electrolyzers, electrodialysis, and
   photovoltaic solar-to-fuel devices. However, a major challenge for this
   approach is the development of a stable and active interfacial region
   (i.e., junction) that adjoins the CEM and AEM layers. Moreover, a
   fundamental understanding of transport at the CEM-AEM junction is
   lacking. Therefore, the present study focuses on the theoretical
   development and analysis of the nature of the BPM interface. A
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) theory is formalized and applied to a
   representative BPM interface. The findings are reported in terms of bias
   (i.e., overpotential) in a galvanic device with respect to CEM and AEM
   material requirements. Specific attention is paid to our interests in
   the application of the BPM to a fuel cell device with an acidic (CEM)
   anode and alkaline (AEM) cathode. We demonstrate that a BPM with an
   acidic CEM anode and alkaline AEM cathode must promote a trap-assisted
   type of recombination mechanism under forward bias. Without such a
   mechanism, large overpotentials are needed to drive ionic recombination
   processes. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the challenge of distortion map feature
   selection and spatiotemporal pooling in perceptual video quality
   assessment (PVQA). We analyze three distortion maps representing
   different visual features spatially and temporally: squared error, local
   pixel-level SSIM, and absolute difference of optical flow magnitudes. We
   examine the performance of each of these maps with different spatial and
   temporal pooling strategies across three databases. We identify the most
   effective statistical pooling strategies spatially and temporally with
   respect to PVQA. We also show the most significant spatial and temporal
   features correlated with perception for every distortion/feature map.
   Our results show that varying the pooling strategy and distortion maps
   yields a significant improvement in perceptual quality estimation. We
   also deduce insights from our results to better understand the
   sensitivity of human vision to distortions. We aim for these findings to
   provide perceptual cues and guidelines to researchers during metric
   design, perceptual feature selection, HVS modeling and pooling
   selection/optimization. We further show that the same distortions across
   databases can yield different results in terms of PVQA evaluation and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the effect of boosting in image quality
   assessment through multi-method fusion. On the contrary of existing
   studies that propose a single quality estimator, we investigate the
   generalizability of multi-method fusion as a framework. In addition to
   support vector machines that are commonly used in the multi-method
   fusion studies, we propose using neural networks in the boosting. To
   span different types of image quality assessment algorithms, we use
   quality estimators based on fidelity, perceptually-extended fidelity,
   structural similarity, spectral similarity, color, and learning. In the
   experiments, we perform k-fold cross validation using the LIVE, the
   multiply distorted LIVE, and the TID 2013 databases and the performance
   of image quality assessment algorithms are measured via accuracy-,
   linearity-, and ranking-based metrics. Based on the experiments, we show
   that boosting methods generally improve the performance of image quality
   assessment and the level of improvement depends on the type of the
   boosting algorithm. Our experimental results also indicate that boosting
   the worst performing quality estimator with two or more methods lead to
   statistically significant performance enhancements independent of the
   boosting technique and neural network-based boosting outperforms support
   vector machine-based boosting when two or more methods are fused.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factors (TFs) are macromolecules that bind to
   cis-regulatory specific sub-regions of DNA promoters and initiate
   transcription. Finding the exact location of these binding sites (aka
   motifs) is important in a variety of domains such as drug design and
   development. To address this need, several in vivo and in vitro
   techniques have been developed so far that try to characterize and
   predict the binding specificity of a protein to different DNA loci. The
   major problem with these techniques is that they are not accurate enough
   in prediction of the binding affinity and characterization of the
   corresponding motifs. As a result, downstream analysis is required to
   uncover the locations where proteins of interest bind. Here, we propose
   DeeperBind, a long short term recurrent convolutional network for
   prediction of protein binding specificities with respect to DNA probes.
   DeeperBind can model the positional dynamics of probe sequences and
   hence reckons with the contributions made by individual sub-regions in
   DNA sequences, in an effective way. Moreover, it can be trained and
   tested on datasets containing varying-length sequences. We apply our
   pipeline to the datasets derived from protein binding microarrays
   (PBMs), an in-vitro high-throughput technology for quantification of
   protein-DNA binding preferences, and present promising results. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate pipeline that can
   predict binding specificities of DNA sequences from the data produced by
   high-throughput technologies through utilization of the power of deep
   learning for feature generation and positional dynamics modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer survival prediction is an active area of research that can help
   prevent unnecessary therapies and improve patient's quality of life.
   Gene expression profiling is being widely used in cancer studies to
   discover informative biomarkers that aid predict different clinical
   endpoint prediction. We use multiple modalities of data derived from RNA
   deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) to predict survival of cancer patients.
   Despite the wealth of information available in expression profiles of
   cancer tumors, fulfilling the aforementioned objective remains a big
   challenge, for the most part, due to the paucity of data samples
   compared to the high dimension of the expression profiles. As such,
   analysis of transcriptomic data modalities calls for state-of-the-art
   big-data analytics techniques that can maximally use all the available
   data to discover the relevant information hidden within a significant
   amount of noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that predicts
   cancer patients' survival by exploiting the structure of the input
   (manifold learning) and by leveraging the unlabeled samples using
   Laplacian support vector machines, a graph-based semi supervised
   learning (GSSL) paradigm. We show that under certain circumstances, no
   single modality per se will result in the best accuracy and by fusing
   different models together via a stacked generalization strategy, we may
   boost the accuracy synergistically. We apply our approach to two cancer
   datasets and present promising results. We maintain that a similar
   pipeline can be used for predictive tasks where labeled samples are
   expensive to acquire.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on reducing SSI for coronary artery bypass
   graft(CABG) patients at a large safety-net hospital. The SSI rate in
   2010-11 hovered around 20\%. The overall goal is to reduce CABG-SSI
   incidence by 25\% (to < 15\%) and measure its sustainability. A
   system-approach is employed which takes into account the interdependency
   of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative processes. A decision
   tree model and a simulation-optimization model are developed to identify
   critical infection factors. Implemented changes involve pre-op
   sterilization, aggressive nasal cleaning, proper hair-clipping, and
   optimized antibiotics prophylaxis timing and dosage. E-alerts are also
   implemented for documentation to facilitate compliance and training. The
   site realized a drop of 65\% in SSI (from 23\% to 8\%) in the first six
   months. It achieved zero percentage thereafter and sustained that rate
   for 18 months. The system-approach is generalizable and is currently
   being explored for rectal-colon cancer and hysterectomy, the second most
   common elective surgery among American women.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method of stabilizing hybrid models of
   torque-constrained, underactuated walking robots - without using
   nonlinear gait optimization - by lever-aging properties of the mechanics
   of the robot. At its core, the controller stabilizes the transfer of
   angular momentum from one leg to the next through continuous-time
   control coupled with hybrid system models that capture impacts that
   occur at foot strike. In particular, conservation of angular momentum at
   impact allows for computation of the exact transfer of momentum as a
   function of the robot's step length and vertical center of mass velocity
   just prior to foot impact. This motivates the construction of
   continuous-time reference trajectories for the robot's step length and
   vertical center of mass with endpoints corresponding to a desired
   transfer of angular momentum. Stabilization to these trajectories
   results in stable walking, as indicated by numeric Poincare analysis.
   The controller is implemented in simulation of a five-link,
   underactuated 3D robot via Model Predictive Control which provides a
   means of achieving walking under non-trivial actuation limits.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates fast motion planning for robot locomotion that is
   optimized for terrain with complex dynamics, specifically, rapid
   penetration of granular media. Gait planning is critical for many legged
   locomotion control approaches, but they typically assume rigid ground
   contact. We aim to extend these planning methods to include terrain
   dynamics we see in the natural world, like sand and dirt, which can both
   deform and fluidize. Using an added-mass description of collective grain
   motion, we formulated a model of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic terrain
   effects that is both principled and representable with closed-form
   dynamics. As a result, we present a model and fast optimization
   formulation which solves accurate motion plans on granular media with
   tractable solving times (6.4 +/- 3.8 seconds). For validation, we
   optimized open-loop motor trajectories for a testbed jumping robot to
   jump to a target apex height from a bed a loosely packed poppy seeds, a
   model granular medium. While jumps optimized for rigid ground were
   anemic on granular media, terrain-aware trajectories hit within 6\% of
   their target. This demonstrates the potential for robot locomotion which
   meets practical task demands, all while being aware of the terrain
   beneath it.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic humanoid locomotion is a challenging control problem, and
   running is especially difficult to achieve, given the underactuation
   inherent to aerial domains. Previous work developed a gait-generating
   optimization framework for dynamic locomotion in the context of hybrid
   zero dynamics, producing stable 3D walking on the humanoid hardware
   platform DURUS. Here, we demonstrate that this optimization method also
   extends to stable 3D running. Gaits generated from the optimization,
   which utilizes the dynamics of all 23 degrees of freedom to maximize
   energy economy, results in stable running in a DURUS simulation model.
   Notably, the presented running is underactuated in all domains, due to
   DURUS' spring-legged design. Further, we generate 25 different running
   gaits, over a range of speeds (1.5-3.0 m/s), to demonstrate the
   reliability of solving the large-scale nonlinear program. We report
   statistical performance of the optimization in successfully generating
   stable running (average computation time: 323 seconds) in an effort to
   establish a benchmark for large-scale gait generation. We inspected this
   array of gaits across speeds, noting recognizable trends in optimized
   strategies from prior studies on lower-order models-e.g., both increased
   step frequency and step length with speed-along with the first reported
   cost-of-transport curve for a 3D humanoid running model. We consider
   this result an important step toward humanoid running on the DURUS
   hardware platform.}},

Abstract = {{In molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the two main sources of
   uncertainty are the interatomic potential functions and thermal
   fluctuation. The accuracy of the interatomic potential functions plays a
   vital role toward the reliability of MD simulation prediction. Reliable
   molecular dynamics (R-MD) is an interval-based MD simulation platform,
   where atomistic positions and velocities are represented as Kaucher (or
   generalized) intervals to capture the uncertainty associated with the
   interatomic potentials. The advantage of this uncertainty quantification
   (UQ) approach is that the uncertainty effect can be assessed on-the-fly
   with only one run of simulation, and thus the computational time for UQ
   is significantly reduced. In this paper, an extended interval
   statistical ensemble is introduced to quantify the uncertainty
   associated with the system control variables, such as temperature and
   pressure at each time-step. This method allows for quantifying and
   propagating the uncertainty in the system as MD simulation advances. An
   example of interval isothermal isobaric (NPT) ensemble is implemented to
   demonstrate the feasibility of applying the intrusive UQ technique
   toward MD simulation.}},

   models input and output variables for multidisciplinary systems in order
   to mitigate the computational cost when uncertainties are involved.
   Under this framework, the dimension of the random input variables is
   reduced depending on the degree of correlation calculated by an entropy
   based correlation coefficient (e). According to the obtained value of e,
   the dimension is truncated by two different methods. First feature
   extraction methods, namely Principal Component Analysis and the
   Auto-Encoder algorithm, are utilized when the input variables are highly
   correlated. In contrast, the Independent Features Test is implemented as
   the feature selection method if the correlation is too low to select a
   critical subset of model features. An Artificial Neural Network,
   including a Probabilistic Neural Network, is integrated into the
   framework to correctly capture the complex response behavior of the
   multidisciplinary system with low computational cost. The efficacy of
   the proposed method is demonstrated with electro-mechanical engineering
   examples, including a solder joint and a stretchable patch antenna.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a homogenization approach for estimating the
   mechanical properties of periodic lattice structures; it is based on
   semi-rigid joint frame elements, and it takes into account joint
   stiffening effects. Geometrical degradation that arises from the
   additive manufacturing process is considered and integrated into a
   homogenization procedure that uses structural element parameters derived
   from a frame element with semi-rigid joints. The effective values of the
   structural parameters are calculated from a novel as-fabricated model
   describing an additively fabricated strut and are incorporated into
   proposed semi-rigid frame elements. The semirigid joint frame element is
   integrated into a discrete homogenization process. This paper reports
   the results of parametric studies that compare the effective structural
   parameters and the estimated mechanical properties to study the impacts
   of joints and geometric degradation due to additive manufacturing. The
   results of the proposed approach are compared with previous
   homogenization approaches, and show that the proposed method provides
   more accurate estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) gives designers new freedoms to
   create complex geometries and combine parts into one. However, it has
   its own limitations, and more importantly, requires a shift in thinking
   from traditional design for subtractive manufacturing. There is a lack
   of formal and structured guidelines, especially for novice designers. To
   formalize knowledge of DFAM, we have developed an ontology using formal
   OWL/RDF representations in the Protege tool. The description logic
   formalism facilitates expressing domain knowledge as well as capturing
   information from benchmark studies. This is demonstrated in a case study
   with three design features: revolute joint, thread assembly (screw
   connection), and slider-crank. How multiple instances (build events) are
   stored and retrieved in the knowledge base is discussed in light of
   modeling requirements for the DFAM knowledge base: knowledge capture and
   reuse, supporting a tutoring system, integration into CAD tools. A set
   of competency questions are described to evaluate knowledge retrieval.
   Examples are given with SPARQL queries. Knowledge documentation is the
   main objective of the current ontology. However, description logic
   creates multiple opportunities for future work, including representing
   and reasoning about DFAM rules in a structured modular hierarchy,
   discovering new rules with induction, and recognizing patterns with
   classification, e.g., what leads to ``successful{''} vs.
   ``unsuccessful{''} fabrications.}},

Abstract = {{A validation approach is proposed to ensure that the computational
   models corresponding to each scale level in a hierarchical multiscale
   modeling process can produce accurate simulations in the material
   characterizations at multiple levels. In the validation approach, the
   stochastic upscaling method is utilized for the homogenization of the
   geometry and material properties of material structure at each scale
   level of interest. The experimental data is utilized for the validation
   of the predictions made by the multiscale models with homogenized
   properties at each scale level. For the quantitative assessment of the
   model's prediction accuracy, a validation metric that integrates the
   u-pooling method with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be presented.
   Additively manufactured cellular structures are used as application
   examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multiscale

Abstract = {{Functional modeling as a design methodology is often covered in
   engineering design texts as a tool for transforming ``customer speak{''}
   into ``engineering speak.{''} There is little to no empirical data,
   though, that clearly demonstrates that learning functional modeling
   actually improves students' engineering design skills. The overall
   objective of this project is to determine the impact of teaching
   function on engineering students' design synthesis abilities. This paper
   focuses on preliminary data collected as a part of the longitudinal
   study. Students were asked to generate functional models of functionally
   similar systems at two points during an engineering design course: (1)
   once as a homework assignment immediately following the introduction of
   the topic and (2) again as a low stakes in-class activity seven weeks
   later. This paper will present the comparison of models created at both
   data points. Student models at each time point are analyzed using a
   validated 18-question rubric. The results provide promise that, in
   general, students retain their modeling ability, but there are noted
   characteristic differences between homework-generated functional models
   and those generated later in the semester during an in-class activity.
   These characteristics will be discussed as will potential improvements
   to the scoring rubric.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores optimal control and sizing of a recently introduced
   efficient architecture for hydraulic actuation. Previous work
   established a physical model of the architecture posed as a single-input
   single-output (SISO) system in which the ratio of two hydraulic
   pump/motor swash plate angles served as the control input for regulating
   actuation speed. The architecture was heuristically sized and controlled
   within the context of a hydraulic elevator. High-fidelity simulations of
   the system demonstrated an upwards of 75\% decrease in energy
   consumption compared to a throttling architecture. Monte Carlo
   simulations are now used to achieve optimal sizing of the system.
   Several unifounly random points in the design space are chosen and
   evaluated using Dynamic Programming, which provides both a deterministic
   and optimal value for energy efficiency of the system. Aggregation of
   evaluated points reveals a region within the three-dimensional space
   wherein the architecture is optimally sized for efficiency. Dynamic
   Programming is then used to inform efficient rule-based control
   strategies. Control techniques learned from Dynamic Programming suggest
   efficient operation of the system results through the maximization of
   pump/motor 1 displacement and the use of the auxiliary electric motor
   during retraction of the hydraulic cylinder. Dynamic Programming
   informed system achieved a 61\% level of optimality. Additionaly, it
   exhibited a 21\% improvement over a heuristically sized and controlled
   version. It is anticipated that optimal control and sizing guidelines
   presented are applicable within the context of other hydraulic actuation
   technologies for which the studied architecture may be used.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic diffusion is a general phenomenon observed in various
   national and engineering systems. It is typically modeled by either
   stochastic differential equation (SDE) or Fokker-Planck equation (FPE),
   which are equivalent approaches. Path integral is an accurate and
   effective method to solve FPEs. Yet, computational efficiency is the
   common challenge for path integral and other numerical methods, include
   time and space complexities. Previously, one-dimensional continuous-time
   quantum walk was used to simulate diffusion. By combining quantum
   diffusion and random diffusion, the new approach can accelerate the
   simulation with longer time steps than those in path integral. It was
   demonstrated that simulation can be dozens or even hundreds of times
   faster. In this paper, a new generic quantum operator is proposed to
   simulate drift-diffusion processes in high-dimensional space, which
   combines quantum walks on graphs with traditional path integral
   approaches. Probability amplitudes are computed efficiently by spectral
   analysis. The efficiency of the new method is demonstrated with
   stochastic resonance problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an analytical framework for predicting wave energy
   harvested by a circular piezoelectric layer from a harmonic point source
   excitation. The explored acoustic system analyzes a circular
   piezoelectric disk attached to an infinite host domain. An harmonic
   point source is located away from the piezoelectric disk on the infinite
   host layer The analysis approach decomposes the system into two
   subdomains, the piezoelectric disk and an infinite plate, which are then
   separately analyzed. In contrast to traditional analysis methods for
   such systems (a sandwich of layers with different dimensions), this
   technique uses internal interaction forces between the different
   subdomains to find a close-form solution for the vibration of
   propagating waves over the entire field. In addition, the voltage
   generated by the harvester is calculated by using coupled
   electromechanical equations. The analysis is validated by comparing
   response quantities and frequency response functions at different points
   on the piezoelectric circular layer and host layers to those predicted
   using COMSOL simulations, which document good agreement. Analysis of
   this system is an important stepping stone to the next goal, which is
   optimization of energy captured from the propagating wave by designing
   boundary walls (reflector) on the host layer which focus the energy of
   the wave onto the piezoelectric domain. This focused energy can then be
   transferred to the electrical power by via a piezoelectric layer through
   an electrical circuit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper carries-out a higher-order, multiple scales perturbation
   analysis on nonlinear monoatomic and diatomic chains with the intent of
   predicting invariant waveforms. The chains incorporate linear,
   quadratic, and cubic force displacement relationships, and linear
   dampers. Multi-harmonic results for 1st and 2nd order expansions are
   reported in closed form, while results for the 3rd order are computed
   numerically on a case-by-case basis, thus avoiding difficulties
   associated with large symbolic expressions. Dimensionless parameters are
   introduced which characterize the amplitude-dependent nonlinear nature
   of a given chain. Interpretation of the perturbation solutions suggests
   that the nonlinear chains support certain waveforms which propagate
   invariantly; i.e., the spectral content does not change significantly
   over time and space. Numerical simulations confirm this finding using
   initial conditions corresponding to a specific order of the perturbation
   solution, and subsequent FFT's of the response track the growth (or
   decay) of spatial harmonic content. A variance parameter computes mean
   fluctuation of the harmonics about their initial values. For a variety
   of parameter sets, the numerical studies confirm that spectral variance
   reduces when waves receive 2nd order initial conditions as compared to
   1st order ones. Furthermore, chains given 3rd order initial conditions
   exhibit smaller variance when compared to those given 1st and 2nd order
   ones. The studies' results suggest that introducing higher-order
   multiple scales perturbation analysis captures long-term, non localized
   invariant waves (or cnoidal waves), which have the potential for
   propagating coherent information over long distances.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the suppression of geometrically nonlinear vibrations of a
   flexible structure by using nonlinear switching shunt damping circuits,
   namely the Synchronized Switch Damping on Short (SSDS) circuit and the
   Synchronized Switch Damping on Inductor (SSDI) circuit. Following the
   early research on linear shunt circuits, the use of nonlinear switching
   shunts was explored for damping of linear resonance behavior of flexible
   structures in the early 2000s. However, such flexible structures can
   easily undergo undesired bifurcations and exhibit large-amplitude
   nonlinear oscillations that coexist with small oscillations in their
   frequency response. Suppression of such nonlinear vibrations and
   resulting bifurcations with linear resistive-inductive circuits is
   impractical due to extremely large inductance requirements. In the
   present work, the focus is placed on a strongly nonlinear and weakly
   coupled flexible structure for suppressing its large-amplitude periodic
   response branch resulting from saddle-node bifurcations. The Duffmg-like
   structure of interest exhibits nonlinear hardening behavior of
   predominantly cubic stiffness under primary resonance excitation. Purely
   resistive linear shunting, SSDS, and SSDI damping techniques are
   employed and compared with the baseline (near short-circuit) frequency
   response curves (up and down-sweep) of the nonlinear structure.
   Specifically it is shown that the SSDI circuit can substantially reduce
   the large amplitude branch, offering the possibility of entirely
   suppressing undesired large-amplitude bifurcations of the nonlinear
   system up to certain excitation levels in order to achieve low-amplitude
   single-valued frequency response. Coupled nonlinear modeling, numerical
   simulations, and experimental validations are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The design of isolation mounts is of critical importance in the
   protection of structures and sensitive equipment from damage or failure.
   Simultaneous protection from both shock and vibration is particularly
   challenging because of the broadband nature of the input signal and
   because of the deleterious effect of damping on high-frequency
   isolation. Prior work by the authors has shown that chains of
   translating and rotating mass/spring elements can act as a ``mechanical
   filter{''} for input disturbances. If designed correctly, the isolator
   is able to trap some of the input energy into rotational vibration,
   preventing it from damaging the structure. However, in finite length
   chains, wave reflections can result in secondary pulses that hit the
   structure and can diminish the effectiveness of the isolator. In this
   paper, the design of dynamic isolation mounts is improved using an
   optimization technique. Numerical simulations are performed using a
   parametric model of the new mount design. The simulated annealing
   optimization algorithm is used to determine the optimal system
   parameters for a given chain length. It is shown that the optimized
   system is able to achieve significant performance improvements. It is
   also shown that dynamic mounts that allow rotational movement of
   internal elements outperform optimized purely translational-motion
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials made from locally resonating arrays can exhibit
   attenuation bandgaps at wavelengths much longer than the lattice size,
   enabling low-frequency vibration attenuation. For an effective use of
   such locally resonant metamaterial concepts, it is required to bridge
   the gap between the dispersion characteristics and modal behavior of the
   host structure with its resonators. To this end, we develop a novel
   argument for bandgap formation in finite-length beams, relying on modal
   analysis and the assumption of infinitely many resonators. This
   assumption is analogous to the wave assumption of an infinitely long
   beam composed of unit cells, but gives additional analytical insight
   into the bandgap, and yields a simple formula for the frequency range of
   the bandgap. We present a design guideline to place the bandgap for a
   finite beam with arbitrary boundary conditions in a desired frequency
   range that depends only on the total mass ratio and natural frequency of
   the resonators. For a beam with a finite number of resonators and
   specified boundary conditions, we suggest a method for choosing the
   optimal number of resonators. We validate the model with both
   finite-element simulations and a simple experiment, and draw
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the robustness of a two-scale command shaping
   strategy for reducing vibrations in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)
   powertrains during engine restart. Propagation of HEVs through the
   automobile market depends on their perceived quality and performance. In
   this work, a two-scale command shaping strategy addresses the
   drivability of the vehicle by focusing on the reduction of noise,
   vibration, and harshness (NVH) issues associated with restarting the
   internal combustion engine (ICE) during a mode transition. The strategy
   tailors the electric machine (EM) torque profile, which consists of a
   linear and time-varying component, to significantly mitigate the
   powertrain and chassis vibrations for a smoother ICE startup. The
   time-varying EM torque component is calculated by applying a
   perturbation technique for separating the scales of an analytical ICE
   model, which isolates the ICE nonlinear response. Command shaping is
   then applied to the linear problem governed by the remaining scale.
   Simulations confirm that the two-scale command shaping strategy is a
   straighorward technique for reducing powertrain and chassis vibrations
   during ICE restart. In real-time implementation, inaccuracies or
   variations in system parameters and initial conditions arising from the
   operating condition or from general wear during a vehicle's life cycle
   will occur Therefore, successful implementation of the two-scale command
   shaping strategy relies upon the robustness of the perturbation
   technique and command shaping to these variations. This paper validates
   the perturbation technique's' robustness to variations in the ICE
   parameters and initial conditions. Robust command shaping methods are
   also explored to decrease the impact of system parameter variations on
   the efficacy of command shaping. Improving the overall robustness of the
   two-scale command shaping strategy will increase the applicability to
   consumer HEVs by ensuring its performance under variations in system
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber/matrix interfacial shear strength (ISS) is a key factor
   determining the mechanical properties of structural composites. In this
   manuscript the positive effects of both graphene and graphene oxide in
   improving the ISS value of glass-fiber reinforced composites are
   experimentally demostrated. Two strategies will be presented: i) uniform
   dispersion of the nanofillers in the polymer matrix or ii) selective
   deposition of the nanofillers at the fiber/matrix interface. Both
   thermoplastic (polypropylene) and thermosetting (epoxy) matrices are
   investigated and the effects of nanoparticles on the fiber/matrix
   interface are determined through micromechanical tests on single-fiber
   composites. Finally, the beneficial effects of the investigated
   nanofillers on both mechanical and functional (strain monitoring)
   properties of multiscale macrocomposites are experimentally proved for
   the cases of polypropylene-based composites reinforced with short glass
   fibers and on epoxy-based composites reinforced with continuous

Abstract = {{The fault spectral precision plays a significant role in the field of
   mechanical diagnosis. A bearing fault characteristic spectrum revised
   approach based on local mean decomposition (LMD) and interpolation
   correction theory is proposed. Bearing fault vibration signal belongs to
   multi-component modulated AM-FM signals, the LMD method can decompose
   this fault vibration signals into a number of different characteristic
   time scales product functions (PFs), then the spectrum analysis method
   is applied to the first PF1 component and the instantaneous frequencies
   and instantaneous amplitudes are obtained. However, in order to acquire
   accurate frequency and amplitude information and overcome the drawbacks
   such as energy leakage and fence effect, interpolation correction
   algorithm is introduced to the characteristic spectrum. The experimental
   results show that this method can effectively diagnose the bearing fault
   and accurately extract the characteristic spectrum information of
   bearing vibration signals and it has very high engineering application
   value. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In the machining process, cutting fluids are used with an objective to
   control force and temperature thus promoting a longer tool life and
   better surface finish. However up until this point it has not been well
   understood how cutting fluid plays a part on the final workpiece
   residual stress, which is a key performance index in view of its bearing
   on fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and part geometry variations.
   This paper presents a quantitative sensitivity analysis of lubrication
   conditions in terms of cutting force, cutting temperature, and residual
   stress based on the physics-based method. Results indicate that larger
   compressive residual stress can be obtained by increasing the flow rate
   of MQL. However, there is an optimal range of the flow rate to obtain
   maximal compressive residual stress within the test range. The proposed
   prediction model can carry a potential to be applied to dry, MQL, and
   flood cooling machining.}},

Abstract = {{In the modern mixed-signal SoC design cycle, designers are frequently
   tasked with detecting and diagnosing behavioral discrepancies between
   design descriptions given at different levels of hierarchy, e.g.
   behavioral vs. transistor level descriptions or behavioral/transistor
   level descriptions vs. fabricated silicon. One problem is detection, to
   determine if behavioral differences between design descriptions exist.
   If such differences (anomalies) are detected, then diagnosis is
   concerned with identifying the module in a hierarchical design
   description of the system that is most likely the root cause of the
   anomaly (typically under the constraint that only the primary outputs of
   the top-level hierarchies are observed. Previously proposed
   machinelearning classifiers require prior knowledge about the kinds of
   likely design errors typically encountered. In this work, we present a
   novel technique for the algorithmic foundation of circuit diagnosis
   predictions which does not require any assumptions about the nature of
   design errors. Our method employs iterative and alternate on-the-fly
   test generation and least-squares fitting of embedded low-order
   nonlinear filters to produce a best-guess estimate of the root cause of
   the anomaly. Experiments are conducted on two test vehicles, an RF
   transceiver and a phase-locked loop, several bug models are implemented,
   and the system's diagnosis predictions are analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is an
   emerging memory technology which exhibits non-volatility, high density,
   high endurance and nanosecond read and write times. These attributes of
   STT-MRAM make it suitable for last level embedded caches. However,
   defect models, faults and test architectures for emerging memory
   technologies are relatively unexplored. This is further aggravated by
   the fact that STT-MRAM, like other post-CMOS technologies rely on novel
   physics of operation, which can result in unexplored read, write and
   retention fault models. In particular, the stochastic retention failure
   of STT-MRAM has a large impact on the test time. Conventional test
   schemes for retention of STT-MRAM need to be redesigned and optimized
   for testing large STT-MRAM arrays. This paper presents a comprehensive
   analysis of read, write and retention tests in STT-MRAM arrays.
   Resistive and capacitive defects and the corresponding faults are
   studied. A novel MBIST architecture and associated circuits are
   presented for measuring thermal stability (and hence retention times) in
   STT-MRAM bits for characterization and manufacturing tests, amidst
   variations and magnetic coupling. Trade-offs between fault localization,
   area overhead and test-times are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration and acoustic isolation by passive control methods have been
   extensively studied along the years. In a recent past, phononic crystals
   and acoustic metamaterials have also been employed for this purpose.
   These periodic structures present band gaps, which are used herein to
   reduce vibration and acoustic radiation of panels. However, variability
   in the manufacturing process causes material and geometry uncertainties
   that affect their band gap robustness and consequently their dynamic
   attenuation performance. In this work, the robustness of the band gap
   phenomenon in vibroacoustic panels is investigated by employing the WFE
   method together to WKB approximation and KL expansion. A two-dimensional
   analysis where the panel is represented by either a phononic undulated
   beam or a metamaterial straight beam with distributed resonators is
   performed. Spatial correlated variability of the elastic modulus and
   resonator stiffness is considered. Band gap of both panels are shown to
   be robust with respect to this variability. However, vibration and
   acoustic attenuation are reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Graded index separate confinement heterostructure (GRIN-SCH) has been
   suggested for n-InGaP/p(+)-GaAs+i-InGaAs/i-GaAs single quantum well
   (SQW) transistor laser (TL) with linearly graded In xi Ga1-xi As in base
   region (xi : 0 -> 0.029 emitter to QW and xi : 0.038 -> 0.05 from QW to
   collector). Charge control model is used to analyze the proposed device.
   The model has been modified to describe graded effects. Due to using
   graded base structure, base transit time reduces from 1.4 ps to 0.8 ps
   by the induced built-in potential, resulting in an increase of 3dB
   bandwidth in a device with an emitter size area of 4000 mu m(2) and 150
   mu m cavity length.}},

Abstract = {{Suppose that we wish to determine an embedding of points given only
   paired comparisons of the form ``user x prefers item q(i) to item
   q(j).{''} Such observations arise in a variety of contexts, including
   applications such as recommendation systems, targeted advertisement, and
   psychological studies. In this paper we first present an
   optimization-based framework for localizing new users and items when an
   existing embedding is known. We demonstrate that user localization can
   be formulated as a simple constrained quadratic program, and that
   although item localization produces a set of non-convex constraints, we
   can make the problem convex by strategically combining comparisons to
   produce a set of convex linear constraints. Finally, we show that by
   iteratively applying this method to every user and item, we can recover
   an accurate embedding, allowing us to iteratively improve a given
   embedding or even generate an embedding from scratch.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the potential benefits to asynchronous task-based
   execution to achieve high performance under a power cap. Task-graph
   schedulers can flexibly reorder tasks and assign compute resources to
   data-parallel (elastic) tasks to minimize execution time, compared to
   executing step-by-step (bulk-synchronously). The efficient utilization
   of the available cores becomes a challenging task when a power cap is
   imposed. This work characterizes the trade-offs between power and
   performance as a Pareto frontier, identifying the set of configurations
   that achieve the best performance for a given amount of power. We
   present a set of scheduling heuristics that leverage this information
   dynamically during execution to ensure that the processing cores are
   used efficiently when running under a power cap. This work examines the
   behavior of three HPC applications on a 57 core Intel Xeon Phi device,
   demonstrating a significant performance increase over the baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting of acoustoelastic wave energy in thin plates and other
   structures has recently gained attention from the energy harvesting
   community. To enhance the wave power generated, researchers have
   investigated metamaterial-inspired concepts to include funnels, mirrors,
   and defect-based resonators introduced in the metamaterial's bandgap.
   Many of these concepts have been demonstrated experimentally using
   arrangements of cylindrical stubs mounted on the surface of a thin
   plate, where such stubs scatter plane and cylindrical waves in such a
   way as to focus mechanical energy. To support these studies, the authors
   have recently introduced an experimentally-verified analytical framework
   for investigating the coupled electromechanical response of a single
   circular piezoelectric harvester adhered to an infinite plate and
   excited by a distant harmonic point source. This paper extends these
   ideas to consider a similar physical system with the addition of
   multiple cylindrical inclusions. These additions require development of
   an electromechanically-coupled, multiple scattering formulation of
   significantly increased complexity. The formulation also includes an
   electrical circuit model for generating electrical current from incident
   waves interacting with the piezoelectric domain. Following development,
   the formulation is applied to the determination of optimal arrangements
   of scatterers which maximize the electrical power generated.
   Specifically, an optimization study is carried-out in which twenty-five
   scatterers are first placed in a semi-elliptical arrangement with the
   aim of focusing wave energy from one elliptical focus (i.e., source
   location) onto the other. It is known from past studies that additional
   side lobes are generated due to truncation of the ellipse, and thus not
   all of the energy can be focused at single point, as desired. To improve
   upon this situation, an optimization study is performed in which the
   aspect ratio of the ellipse is varied, with the goal of optimizing the
   power harvested from the focal point. Results from the optimization
   studies show conclusively that the side lobes can in fact be minimized,
   and that harvested power can be significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{The recent literature of energy harvesting has shown growing interest in
   nonlinear aeroelastic systems for wind energy harvesting. Among other
   configurations, electrical power extraction from limit cycle
   oscillations of nonlinear beams and plates combined with a transduction
   mechanism in axial flow (inspired by flapping flags) have been pointed
   out as an alternative to traditional horizontal axis wind turbines if
   implemented on a large scale. Although the literature presents several
   works on the modeling and experimental verification of cantilevered
   plates in axial flow using piezoelectric transduction mechanism, the
   investigation of piezoelectric material distribution along the body
   length for proper electrode configuration to avoid cancelation of
   electrical outputs has not been covered. To address this problem, in
   this work, a fluid structure interaction model that couples nonlinear
   beam equation with a lumped vortex-lattice potential flow model is
   implemented. The nonlinear model of the beam in axial flow is verified
   against wind tunnel experimental results and a numerical energy flow
   analysis is employed to determine the distribution of piezoelectric
   material along the body length. Dynamic strain distribution analysis is
   then performed to determine the electrode configuration to avoid
   cancelation of the electrical output.}},

Abstract = {{We present a distributed-parameter electromechanical model and its modal
   analysis for flexoelectric energy harvesting using centrosymmetric
   dielectrics by accounting for both the direct and converse effects as
   well as size dependence of the coupling coefficient. Flexoelectricity is
   the generation of electric polarization in elastic dielectrics by the
   application of a non-uniform mechanical strain field, i.e. a strain
   gradient. In order to accompany atomistic simulations and experimental
   efforts at small scales, there is a growing need for high-fidelity
   device models that can also provide an analytical insight into
   size-dependent electro-elastodynamics of small structures that exhibit
   and exploit flexoelectricity. Particularly, although the conversion of
   mechanical energy into electrical energy (i.e. energy harvesting) is
   more related to the direct effect, it is necessary to accurately model
   the converse effect for thermodynamic consistency and completeness. To
   this end, we present a flexoelectric mono layer centrosymmetric energy
   harvester model (that yields no piezoelectric effect) for converting
   ambient vibration into electricity. The flexoelectric energy harvester
   model based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is focused on strain
   gradient induced polarization resulting from the bending (transverse)
   vibration modes in response to mechanical base excitation. Following
   recent efforts on the converse flexoelectric effect in finite samples,
   the proposed model accounts for two-way coupling, i.e. the direct and
   converse effects, and it also captures the effect of geometric scaling
   on the coupling coefficient. In addition to closed-form solutions of the
   electromechanical frequency response functions, various case studies are
   presented for a broad range of material and geometric parameters.
   Thickness dependence of the electromechanical coupling is analytically
   shown and is observed in simulations of the electromechanical frequency
   response functions as well.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials made from flexible structures with piezoelectric laminates
   connected to resonant shunt circuits can exhibit vibration attenuation
   properties similar to those of their purely mechanical locally resonant
   counterparts. Thus, in analogy to purely mechanical metamaterials,
   electroelastic metamaterials with piezoelectric resonators can exhibit
   vibration attenuation bandgaps. To enable the effective design of these
   locally resonant electroelastic metamaterials, the electromechanical
   behavior of the piezoelectric patches must be reconciled with the modal
   behavior of the electroelastic structure. To this end, we develop a
   novel argument for the formation of bandgaps in bimorph piezoelectric
   beams, relying on modal analysis and the assumption of infinitely many
   segmented shunted electrodes (unit cells) on continuous piezoelectric
   laminates bracketing a substrate. As a case study, the frequency limits
   of the locally resonant bandgap that forms from resonant shunting is
   derived, and a design guideline is presented to place the bandgap in a
   desired frequency range. This method can be easily extended to more
   general circuit impedances, and can be used to design shunt circuits to
   obtain a desired frequency response in the main structure.}},

Abstract = {{Narrowband excitation of fin buffeting is known to exist on several
   modem aircraft configurations at high angles of attack. For a fixed
   angle of attack and model geometry, narrowband peak frequency is a
   linear function of freestream speed. Under these conditions,
   counter-rotating vortex pairs conforming to the Goertler vortex
   mechanism are known to develop and amplify in the flowfield over the
   wings. This phenomenon is explored for relevance to reverse flow over
   rotor blades at high speeds as well. A 42-degree delta wing with rounded
   leading edges is used in a low-speed wind tunnel to confirm the
   phenomenon. The presence of a non-zero yaw angle can increase the
   strength of the Goertler vortices and also change the location of
   maximum intensity. Small fences on the surface have been shown to
   eliminate these narrow-band fluctuations. Dielectric Barrier Discharge
   plasma actuators offer a possible means to eliminate the narrowband
   excitation without obtrusive surface fences. An array of such actuators
   is used to generate counter-rotating vortices. Incense smoke entrained
   into the flow is illuminated with a laser sheet front a laser pointer.
   Video images are used to capture velocity in the potential flow region
   around the vortices. The induced velocity is used to calculate vortex
   strength. Scaling laws are used to estimate the frequency of the
   actuators, as well as the magnitude of the velocity. The scaling
   estimation shows that a plasma actuator is viable for model-scale
   configurations. Continuing experiments for the final paper plan to apply
   the actuator under delta wing high angle of attack operation.}},

Abstract = {{Prior work showed high-resolution maps of aerodynamic load coefficients
   for various geometric shapes, as well as parametric variations on
   canonical models. The problem of obtaining predictions on new shapes
   using generalized interpolations and combinations of canonical shapes,
   is explored in this paper. Two cases are considered. The first is that
   of an engine container used as a helicopter slung load. Full scale
   flight data provide the dynamics, so that the effects of different
   uncertainties and simplifications are examined. The progression is from
   interpolated Fourier coefficient data on an approximate, canonical
   shape, to dynamic simulation at different levels of fidelity. The second
   case is one of predicting the aerodynamic load map of a complex
   practical shape - a road vehicle used as a slung load, starting by
   combining data on canonical shapes. In both cases, this paper presents
   predictions using approximations; the future work expects to present
   wind tunnel results on a scale model of the engine container, and on an
   actual combination of canonical shapes. The cylinder approximation gives
   a good prediction of the flight test dynamics history and divergence
   speed. Adding a drag estimate for the tethers achieves good correlation
   with the flight test trail angle behavior, with some error apparent at
   the highest speed. However; this error underpredicts drag, which may be
   the effect of support structure including flat-plate baffles, not yet
   modeled. In the second case, a weighted combination of Fourier
   coefficients for a cylinder and a rectangular prism, gives a good
   representation of the drag and side force coefficient maps for a HumVee
   model; correlation of the yawing moment is less accurate.}},

Abstract = {{We study the minimum-concave-cost flow problem on a two-dimensional
   grid. We characterize the computational complexity of this problem based
   on the number of rows and columns of the grid, the number of different
   capacities over all the arcs, and the location of sources and sinks. The
   concave cost over each arc is assumed to be evaluated through an oracle
   machine, i.e., the oracle machine returns the cost over an arc in a
   single computational step, given the flow value and the arc index. We
   propose an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in the number of
   columns of the grid for the following cases: (1) the grid has a constant
   number of rows, a constant number of different capacities over all the
   arcs, and sources and sinks in at most two rows; (2) the grid has two
   rows and a constant number of different capacities over all the arcs
   connecting rows; (3) the grid has a constant number of rows and all
   sources in one row, with infinite capacity over each arc. These are
   presumably the most general polynomially solvable cases, since we show
   that the problem becomes NP-hard when any condition in these cases is
   removed. Our results apply to several variants and generalizations of
   the single item dynamic lot sizing model and answer several questions
   raised in serial supply chain optimization.}},

Title = {{Complete Streets Policies and Public Transit}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2543}},
Pages = {{14-24}},
Abstract = {{The concept that streets should be designed for all applicable
   transportation modes is commonly known as ``complete streets.{''} Many
   organizations, including cities, counties, regional authorities, and
   state agencies, have adopted programs encouraging this approach to
   street design. These programs almost universally consider the needs of
   bicyclists and pedestrians. However, it is not understood how well
   transit vehicles and riders are incorporated into these programs. In
   this study, complete streets programs of different types from different
   levels of government across the United States were compared on the basis
   of a consistent, objective set of criteria. These criteria included
   transit as a roadway user, guidance for running ways and for transit
   stops, and transit -related performance measures. Each criterion was
   worth between 1 and 3 points; the total score for each program was
   between 1 and 12 points. Only 12 programs earned at least 1 point for
   each criterion, and only 13 programs earned a cumulative score of 8 or
   greater. Potential relationships between these transit complete streets
   scores and population, location, and overall complete streets scores
   were explored, but no meaningful relationships were found; this result
   indicates that poor representation of transit is a widespread problem
   not limited to certain groups. This research revealed a dramatic gap in
   complete streets programs with regard to transit and calls for future
   attention and guidance of agencies adopting complete streets programs.}},

   Experience from the Netherlands}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2543}},
Pages = {{166-175}},
Abstract = {{Incentive-based travel demand management strategies are gaining
   increasing attention because they are generally considered more
   acceptable by the traveling public and policy makers. This study
   presented a detailed analysis and modeling effort aimed at understanding
   how incentives affected traveler choices by using data collected from a
   reward-based experiment conducted in 2006 in the Netherlands. The
   incentive-based scheme analyzed in this study included monetary rewards
   or credit toward obtaining a smartphone with a view to motivating
   commuters to change their choice of departure time out of the peak
   period or to shift their mode of travel. The mixed panel multinomial
   logit modeling approach adopted in this study was able to isolate the
   impacts of incentives on behavioral choices while accounting for
   variations in such impacts across socioeconomic groups that might have
   been due to unobserved individual preferences and constraints. The model
   also shed light on the effects of behavioral inertia, in which
   individuals were prone to continue their past behavior even when it was
   no longer optimal. Finally, the study offered insights on the extent to
   which behavioral changes persisted after termination of the incentive
   period. In general, it was found that incentives were effective in
   changing behavior and overcame inertial effects; however, individuals
   largely reverted to their original behavior when the rewards were
   eliminated. This finding suggests that incentives need to be provided
   for a sustained period to bring about lasting change.}},

Abstract = {{Finger recovery is much harder than other parts on the upper limbs,
   because finger recovery movement has several key problems need to
   overcome, including high precision of movement, high control resolution
   requirements, variable data with different person, as well as the fuzzy
   signal during the movement. In order to overcome the difficulties, a new
   scheme of finger recovery is presented in the paper based on symmetric
   rehabilitation. In the paralyzed hand side, a mechanical exoskeleton
   hand is designed and simulated to provide skeletal traction, while in
   the regular hand side, the curve magnitude of every joint during
   movement is detected. Then the hand motion is analyzed and recognized
   using Multi-class SVM. Many candidates were chosen to perform the
