Abstract = {{Interrogating fundamental cell biology principles that govern tissue
   morphogenesis is critical to better understanding of developmental
   biology and engineering novel multicellular systems. Recently,
   functional micro-tissues derived from pluripotent embryonic stem cell
   (ESC) aggregates have provided novel platforms for experimental
   investigation; however elucidating the factors directing emergent
   spatial phenotypic patterns remains a significant challenge.
   Computational modelling techniques offer a unique complementary approach
   to probe mechanisms regulating morphogenic processes and provide a
   wealth of spatio-temporal data, but quantitative analysis of simulations
   and comparison to experimental data is extremely difficult. Quantitative
   descriptions of spatial phenomena across multiple systems and scales
   would enable unprecedented comparisons of computational simulations with
   experimental systems, thereby leveraging the inherent power of
   computational methods to interrogate the mechanisms governing emergent
   properties of multicellular biology. To address these challenges, we
   developed a portable pattern recognition pipeline consisting of: the
   conversion of cellular images into networks, extraction of novel
   features via network analysis, and generation of morphogenic
   trajectories. This novel methodology enabled the quantitative
   description of morphogenic pattern trajectories that could be compared
   across diverse systems: computational modelling of multicellular
   structures, differentiation of stem cell aggregates, and gastrulation of
   cichlid fish. Moreover, this method identified novel spatio-temporal
   features associated with different stages of embryo gastrulation, and
   elucidated a complex paracrine mechanism capable of explaining
   spatiotemporal pattern kinetic differences in ESC aggregates of
   different sizes.}},

Title = {{The First Normal Stress Difference in a Shear-Thinning Motor Oil at
   Elevated Pressure}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{654-659}},
Abstract = {{Currently, the only aspect of non-Newtonian behavior being modeled in
   lubrication is the shear dependence of viscosity. However, shear
   thinning is accompanied by a large difference between the normal stress
   in the flow direction and the cross-film direction. This stress
   difference can increase the load capability of a lubricant film without
   increased frictional penalty.
   A commercial 10W-40 motor oil was characterized at elevated pressures.
   Three different high-pressure instruments were employed: a falling-body
   viscometer, a thin-film Couette viscometer, and a parallel-plate
   rheogoniometer. Ordinary shear thinning with a second Newtonian
   inflection was observed. A first normal stress difference of 0.6 MPa was
   measured under what may be mild conditions for a crankshaft journal
   bearing. Elevated pressures are essential to the measurement of
   rheological properties that govern hydrodynamic film thickness and
   friction in automotive components.
   Time-temperature-pressure superposition was validated for the first
   normal stress difference. The first normal stress difference in the
   terminal regime may be estimated from the upper-convected Maxwell model,
   where the shear modulus is assumed to be equal to the Newtonian limit
   shear stress obtained from a measurement of shear thinning. The first
   normal stress difference in the shear-thinning regime may be estimated
   from an extant empirical rule.
   These results will be of substantial importance when analytical
   techniques are developed for hydrodynamic lubrication with real
   non-Newtonian shear response. The results are immediately useful for
   calculating the shear stress for cavitation in ambient pressure
   high-shear viscometers.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, major efforts have been devoted to exploring cheap and active
   non-precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in
   fuel cells for large-scale applications. Herein, we report electrospun
   cobalt-carbon nanofibers (Co-CNFs) as an efficient catalyst for the ORR,
   together with a systematic study of the active site formation. The ORR
   activity of the Co-CNFs increases with increasing Co content up to
   approximately 30 wt\%, at which high ORR activity is exhibited,
   comparable with a commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. XPS and
   structural analysis reveals a Co-pyridinic N-x bond at the edge plane,
   and more Co nanoparticles were found in the Co-CNFs as the Co content
   was increased. These sites can behave as the primary and the secondary
   active sites for the ORR, according to a dual-site mechanism. The ORR
   activity of the Co-CNFs may deteriorate even if only one of these sites
   is limited. The high ORR activity of the Co-CNF catalysts results from
   the synergetic effect of dual site formation for the ORR.}},

Title = {{Shape evolution of multiple interacting droplets in inkjet deposition}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{373-385}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The aim of this paper is to advance the understanding of the
   droplet deposition process to better predict and control the
   manufacturing results for ink-jet deposition.
   Design/methodology/approach - As material interface has both geometric
   and physical significance to manufacturing, the approach the authors
   take is to study the interface evolution during the material joining
   process in ink-jet deposition using a novel shape metric and a
   previously developed powerful simulation tool. This tool is an
   experimentally validated numerical solver based on the combination of
   the lattice Boltzmann method and the phase-field model that enabled
   efficient simulation of multiple-droplet interactions in three
   dimensions.
   Findings - The underlying physics of two-droplet interaction is
   carefully examined, which provides deep insights into the effects of the
   printing conditions on the interface evolution of multiple-droplet
   interaction. By studying line printing, it is found that increasing
   impact velocity or decreasing fluid viscosity can reduce manufacturing
   time. For array printing, the authors have found the issue of air bubble
   entrapment that can lead to voids in the manufactured parts.
   Research limitations/implications - The array of droplets impinges
   simultaneously, in contrast to most ink-jet printers. Sequential
   impingement of lines of droplet needs to be studied. Also, impingement
   on non-planar surfaces has not been investigated yet, but is important
   for additive manufacturing. Finally, it is recognized that the droplet
   hardening mechanisms need to be incorporated in the simulation tool to
   predict and control the final shape and size of the arbitrary features
   and manufacturing time for ink-jet deposition. Practical implications -
   The research findings in this paper imply opportunities for optimization
   of printing conditions and print head design. Furthermore, if precise
   droplet control can be achieved, it may be possible to eliminate the
   need for leveling roller in the current commercial printers to save
   machine and manufacturing cost.
   Originality/value - This work represents one of the first attempts for a
   systematic study of the interface dynamics of multiple-droplet
   interaction in ink-jet deposition enabled by the novel shape metric
   proposed in the paper and a previously developed numerical solver. The
   findings in this paper advanced the understanding of the droplet
   deposition process. The physics-based approach of analyzing the
   simulation results of the interface dynamics provides deep insights into
   how to predict and control the manufacturing relevant outcomes, and
   optimization of the deposition parameters is made possible under the
   same framework.}},

Title = {{Disclination elastica model of loop collision and growth in confined
   nematic liquid crystals}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{5455-5464}},
Abstract = {{Theory and modeling are used to characterize disclination loop-loop
   interactions in nematic liquid crystals under capillary confinement with
   strong homeotropic anchoring. This defect process arises when a mesogen
   in the isotropic phase is quenched into the stable nematic state. The
   texture evolution starts with +1/2 disclination loops that merge into a
   single loop through a process that involves collision, pinching and
   relaxation. The process is characterized with a combined Rouse-Frank
   model that incorporates the tension and bending elasticity of
   disclinations and the rotational viscosity of nematics. The Frank model
   of disclinations follows the Euler elastica model, whose non-periodic
   solution, known as Poleni's curve, is shown to locally describe the
   loop-loop collision and to shed light on why loop-loop merging results
   in a disclination intersection angle of approximately 60 degrees.
   Additional Poleni invariants demonstrate how tension and bending pinch
   the two loops into a single +1/2 disclination ring. The Rouse model of
   disclination relaxation yields a Cahn-Hilliard equation whose time
   constant combines the confinement, tension/bending stiffness ratio and
   disclination diffusivity. Based on predictions made using this three
   stage process, a practical procedure is proposed to find viscoelastic
   parameters from defect geometry and defect dynamics. These findings
   contribute to the evolving understanding of textural transformations in
   nematic liquid crystals under confinement using the disclination
   elastica methodology.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes tasks comparing the simulated performance levels

   identifying (DRI) targets using the Night Vision Integrated Performance
   Model (NV-IPM) version 1.1. Both mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave
   infrared (LWIR) systems, chosen to represent the current
   state-of-the-art, were analyzed across various environmental conditions.
   These states included a range of both man-made and natural obscurants,
   selected to simulate atmospheric conditions commonly experienced
   throughout the world. This report investigates the validity of the
   NV-IPM, down-selects top-performing systems from an original set, and
   provides detailed performance analysis of these best-of-breed systems in
   various environmental scenarios.
   Six sensing systems, Indium-Antimonide (InSb) MWIR,
   Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) MWIR, nBn InSb MWIR, Quantum Well
   Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) LWIR, uncooled LWIR, and dual-band MCT
   MWIR/LWIR system, were evaluated against a variety of environmental
   variations. Specifications for the IR systems were obtained from
   manufacturers or relevant published literature. Simulation results
   indicated the nBn InSb MWIR system as the strongest-performing system in

Abstract = {{Novel urchin-like Pd@CuO-Pd yolk-shell nanostructures are synthesized
   through subsequent oxidation of Pd@Cu2O truncated octahedron core-shell
   precursors with a PdCl42- aqueous solution. The permeable hierarchical
   CuO shells are constructed by a radially standing 1D single-crystalline
   nanothorn with Pd nanoparticles. The Pd nanocube cores are encapsulated
   and confined in the void space of the urchin-like shells. The
   urchin-like yolk-shell Pd@CuO-Pd nanostructures demonstrate excellent
   electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for glucose oxidation.
   Enzyme-free glucose biosensors based on the urchin-like yolk-shell
   Pd@CuO-Pd electrocatalysts display a higher sensitivity (665.9 mu A
   cm(-2) mM(-1)) than those of the CuO nanoparticles (455.8 mu A cm (2) mM
   (1)), Cu2O nanoparticles (220.4 mu A cm (2) mM (1)), Pd@Cu2O truncated
   octahedra (179.1 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)), Pd mixtures (65.5 mu A cm(-2)
   mM(-1)) and Pd nanocubes (1.42 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)). The outstanding
   electrocatalytic performance of the urchin-like Pd@CuO-Pd yolk-shell
   nanostructures might be ascribed to two reasons: the unique hierarchical
   yolk-shell structures provide highly exposed active sites and act as an
   individualized nanoreactor to enhance the mass diffusion and transport
   of reactants at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Moreover, the
   nanocomposite of metal oxide semiconductor CuO and noble metal Pd would
   result in a synergetic effect to improve the electrocatalysis.}},

   layer-by-layer mineralization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Abstract = {{Cellular metabolic pathways are paradigms for the rapid and waste-free
   conversion of molecules into useful products through multiple
   enzyme-catalyzed steps (cascade reactions). Attempts to establish
   efficient cascade reactions for technological applications have focused
   on mimicking nature's high degree of organization by controlling the
   positioning of enzymes through immobilization in tailor-made
   compartments. The present work utilized peptide-mediated layer-by-layer
   mineralization as a facile and generic method for the
   compartmentalisation of multi-enzyme systems in nanoscale silica layers.
   It is demonstrated that, in a multilayer system, the overall rate of the
   reaction cascade was primarily affected by the placement of the enzyme
   catalyzing the first step, with the placement of the enzyme possessing
   the lowest catalytic efficiency also being an important factor. As the
   rate-limiting enzymes were positioned closer to the external silica
   surface, the overall rate of cascade reactions increased. Furthermore,
   distributing the enzymes into different adjacent silica compartments
   yielded higher overall cascade reaction rates compared to placement of
   the enzymes into the same silica layer. The synthetic methods and
   kinetic analyses presented here provide guidance for improving the
   performance of immobilized multi-enzyme systems for a wide range of
   technological applications.}},

Title = {{Photocatalytic reduction of triclosan on Au-Cu2O nanowire arrays as
   plasmonic photocatalysts under visible light irradiation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{17421-17428}},
Abstract = {{Triclosan (TCS) is a potential threat to the environment and human
   health. Photocatalysis can be used to degrade TCS, but the
   photocatalytic efficiency is usually limited by the photoabsorptivity
   and photostability of the photocatalyst. In addition, some toxic
   by-products might also be generated during photocatalytic processes. In
   this study, we prepared Au-coated Cu2O nanowire arrays (Au-Cu2O NWAs) by
   beam sputtering Au onto Cu2O nanowires grown from a Cu foil. We found
   that photocatalytic degradation of TCS under visible light (420 nm <
   lambda 780 nm) irradiation and Au-Cu2O NWAs had several advantages.
   Au-Cu2O NWAs had good photoabsorptivity, high photostability (negligible
   activity loss after 16 runs), excellent photocatalytic activity (47.6
   times faster than that of Cu2O), and low yield of
   dichlorodibenzo-dioxins/ dichlorohydroxydibenzofurans. The degradation
   intermediates were identified as chlorophenoxyphenol, phenoxyphenol,
   chlorophenol, catechol, phenol, benzoquinone, and lower volatile acids.
   We developed the degradation pathway of TCS which follows electron
   reduction and then oxidation by reactive oxygen species. The mechanism
   was developed and strengthened using the radical trapping and other
   measurements. The unusual mechanism and photostability of Au-Cu2O NWAs
   were attributed to the Au/Cu2O/Cu ``sandwich{''} like structure. This
   structure yields a sustained and steady internal electric field, raises
   the conduction band of Cu2O, reinforces the reductive activity of the
   photo-generated electrons, and eliminates the photo-generated holes that
   are responsible for the photo-etching of Cu2O.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Favorable dissociative adsorption of H-2 on electrocatalysts is a key
   requirement of the anode in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell
   (PEMFC). To enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the anode, we
   investigated the characteristics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction
   (HOR) on bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt-Ir over a carbon support. The
   nanoparticle Pt-Ir/C catalysts improved the HOR, owing to strong H-2
   dissociation and ready formation of H+ atoms. In addition, we
   investigated the adsorption configuration and electronic band-gaps of
   the optimized structure using density functional theory calculations, to
   gain insight into the mechanisms and characteristics of H-2 dissociation
   on Pt (111), Ir (111), and Pt-Ir (111). The reaction profile of H-2
   dissociative adsorption on the catalysts indicated enhanced HOR on Pt-Ir
   (111) compared to pure Pt (111), which was attributed to more favorable
   H-2 dissociation in the former, owing to a reduced electronic band-gap.
   The integrated experimental and theoretical study suggests that Pt-Ir/C
   is a potential candidate for preserving the high performance of an
   anodic electrocatalyst in PEMFCs.}},

Title = {{Hollow titanium dioxide spheres as anode material for lithium ion
   battery with largely improved rate stability and cycle performance by
   suppressing the formation of solid electrolyte interface layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{13340-13349}},
Abstract = {{By subjecting amorphous titanium dioxide (TiO2) colloidal spheres as a
   scaffold to a two-step external template-free hydrothermal treatment,
   anatase TiO2 hollow spheres with an average diameter of 410 nm and shell
   thickness of 65 nm were successfully yielded. Such hollow TiO2
   nanostructures possessed a large surface area, abundant active sites and
   reduced Li ion diffusion path and thus were highly favorable for use in
   TiO2-based lithium ion batteries (LIB). Electrochemical measurements
   revealed that asprepared TiO2 hollow spheres exhibited specific
   discharge capacities of 296, 185, 118, 66 and 37 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, 1
   C, 2 C, 5 C and 10 C, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the
   considerably lower values obtained in TiO2 solid nanoparticles (i.e.,
   182, 119, 81, 43 18 mA h g(-1) at discharge rates of 0.1 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5
   C and 1 0 C, respectively). Interestingly, TiO2 hollow spheres showed a
   large irreversible capacity loss and relatively low cycling performance
   due to the residual chemisorbed water in TiO2 and hydroxyl groups
   present on the TiO2 surface. A solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer
   composed primarily of Li2CO3, lithium alkyl carbonates and organic
   phosphates was thus formed on the surface of hollow TiO2 spheres,
   thereby leading to an increased internal cell impedance and the
   decreased rate and cycling performance. The subsequent high-temperature
   annealing effectively removed chemisorbed water and hydroxyls on the
   TiO2 surface. As a consequence, annealed TiO2 hollow spheres rendered
   markedly improved rate stability and cycle performance in the resulting
   TiO2-based LIBs. The specific discharge capacities at rates of 5 C and
   10 C were 77 mA h g(-1) and 50 mA h g(-1), which are considerably larger
   than those obtained from as-prepared TiO2 hollow spheres. Moreover,
   compared to only 42.1\% for as-prepared hollow TiO2 spheres, a capacity
   retention as high as 93.5\% over 200 cycles at 1 C was achieved for
   annealed hollow TiO2 spheres.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The RNAi-mediated knockdown of gene expression is an attractive
   tool for research and therapeutic purposes but its implementation is
   challenging. Here we report on a new method based on photoacoustic
   delivery of siRNA developed to address some of these challenges.
   Materials \& methods: Physical properties and photoacoustic emission of
   carbon black (CB) particles upon near-infrared laser irradiation were
   characterized. Next, ovarian cancer cells Hey A8-F8 were exposed to
   near-infrared nanosecond laser pulses in the presence of siRNA targeting
   EGFR gene and CB particles. The intracellular delivery of siRNA and
   silencing of the target gene were determined by specific qPCR assays.
   Results \& conclusion: Laser-activated CB nanoparticles generated
   photoacoustic emission and enabled intracellular delivery of siRNA and
   significant knockdown of its target EGFR mRNA. This physical method
   represents a new promising approach to targeted therapeutic delivery of
   siRNA.}},

   electricity generation, fouling and regeneration}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{65}},
Pages = {{52361-52368}},
Abstract = {{Cost effective air-cathodes are very important for application of
   Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs). Carbon fiber cloth was used as the base for
   preparing air-cathodes with cheap polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coating
   on the solution-side to replace expensive Nafion as a separator
   regardless of the ion exchange part. The separator on the solution-side
   was a vital part for stable electricity generation. Another PVDF layer
   was coated on the air-side via a thickness-controllable method as the
   diffusion layer. The comparisons between Nafion and PVDF on the
   solution-side of cathode in electricity generation and
   fouling/regeneration were tested in MFCs without any catalyst. The cell
   voltage of the Nafion air-cathode MFC (0.23 V) was slightly higher than
   the PVDF MFC (0.2 V). Biofouling and cation deposition on air-cathodes
   became more severe with time, negatively affecting electricity
   generation. Soaking the air-cathode with solution-side Nafion in HCl
   (maximum power density: 338.1 mW m(-2)) can regenerate the cathodes and
   enhance the electricity generation much more than that regenerated by
   ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation.}},

Pages = {{10083-10095}},
Abstract = {{Stimuli-sensitive hydrogels are an exciting class of materials with
   widespread potential for use in engineering and biomedical applications.
   The design of advanced functional devices using hydrogels requires an
   in-depth understanding of the physics and behaviour of such materials.
   While theoretical tools exist, they are often limited to simple cases.
   Thus, computational methods are necessary to model the complex unsteady
   physics of hydrogels with high fidelity. Mesoscale modelling is an
   emerging approach that enables simulations of polymeric structures at
   length and time scales in between those of molecular dynamics and
   continuum methods. In this feature article, we review various
   computational approaches to model responsive hydrogels and specifically
   focus on dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), a particle-based mesoscale
   method. We discuss several approaches for modelling cross-linked polymer
   networks in DPD, and describe recent applications of DPD to modelling
   hydrogel systems.}},

Abstract = {{An amine hybrid resorcinol-formaldehyde/silica composite aerogel

   negatively affects the CO2 adsorption capacity of AH-RFSA. Water favors
   the CO2 adsorption capacities, especially the useful CO2 adsorption
   capacity. The total CO2 adsorption capacity achieved with the new
   adsorbent at 25 degrees C in dry and humid air is 1.80 and 2.57 mmol
   g(-1), respectively. The useful CO2 adsorption capacity of AH-RFSA in
   humid air is as high as 1.85 mmol g(-1). The adsorbent preparation

Abstract = {{Due to the unique properties of nanoparticles, such as small size, large
   specific surface area and special optical performance, nanosilica is a
   promising candidate for replacing the conventional micron-sized silica
   to reinforce the performance of epoxy resins in microelectronic
   industries. But, its intensive inclination to form agglomerates in epoxy
   matrices, and its negative effects on the viscosity and glass transition
   temperature (T-g) of epoxy resins have limited its applications. In this
   work, a silica hybrid composed of sub-micron sized (500 +/- 50 nm) and
   nano-sized (60 +/- 10 nm) silica spheres was prepared and introduced
   into an epoxy polymer matrix. With this type of silica hybrid as a
   reinforcing filler, the dispersion quality of the nanosilica particles
   into the epoxy matrix was greatly improved due to the de-agglomeration
   effect of the large silica spheres. Also, the T-g of the epoxy
   composites was significantly enhanced while the viscosity of the liquid
   epoxy composites before curing remained lower at high filler loading as
   compared to the corresponding single-sized nanosilica filled epoxy

Abstract = {{The use of high-resolution tomographic techniques has allowed for
   unprecedented observations and a renewed understanding of geomaterials
   and processes. A laboratory x-ray scanner is used to explore the
   potential of the technology in the context of complex geotechnical
   systems. Tests benefit from the fast and non-destructive nature of x-ray
   measurements and the micrometer-scale resolution that is attainable.
   Several first-time observations are reported here. In this paper we
   demonstrate the following: subsurface volume loss in sandy soils can
   cause the formation of sharply defined low-density pipes; cryogenic
   suction consolidates sediments next to ice lenses during ground
   freezing; root growth involves transverse expansion, and the stress
   relaxation at the tip facilitates further longitudinal invasion; blade
   insertion causes successive shear localizations; and the incipient
   formation of desiccation cracks is not necessarily along a planar
   front-in fact, the fracture plane may split as it encounters
   heterogeneities at the tip. Finally, it is shown that x-rays can be used
   to monitor chemical processes that cause coupled mechanical effects,
   such as osmotic consolidation induced by ionic diffusion and mineral
   dissolution. Although brief events may not be tomographically imaged,
   single x-ray radiographs can be analyzed and compared to gain extensive
   process information.}},

   was observed. It is also observed from results that there is increase in
   dielectric constants with increasing photon energy. The observed optical
   changes have been tried to be correlated with the structural changes,

Abstract = {{Most of multi-atlas segmentation methods focus on the registration
   between the full-size volumes of the data set. Although the
   transformations obtained from these registrations may be accurate for
   the global field of view of the images, they may not be accurate for the
   local prostate region. This is because different magnetic resonance (MR)
   images have different fields of view and may have large anatomical
   variability around the prostate. To overcome this limitation, we
   proposed a two-stage prostate segmentation method based on a fully
   automatic multi-atlas framework, which includes the detection stage i.
   e. locating the prostate, and the segmentation stage i. e. extracting
   the prostate. The purpose of the first stage is to find a cuboid that
   contains the whole prostate as small cubage as possible. In this paper,
   the cuboid including the prostate is detected by registering atlas edge
   volumes to the target volume while an edge detection algorithm is
   applied to every slice in the volumes. At the second stage, the proposed
   method focuses on the registration in the region of the prostate
   vicinity, which can improve the accuracy of the prostate segmentation.
   We evaluated the proposed method on 12 patient MR volumes by performing
   a leave-one-out study. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff
   distance (HD) are used to quantify the difference between our method and
   the manual ground truth. The proposed method yielded a DSC of 83.4\% +/-
   4.3\%, and a HD of 9.3 mm +/- 2.6 mm. The fully automated segmentation
   method can provide a useful tool in many prostate imaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac ultrasound plays an important role in the imaging of hearts in
   basic cardiovascular research and clinical examinations. 3D ultrasound
   imaging can provide the geometry or motion information of the heart.
   Especially, the wrapping of cardiac fiber orientations to the ultrasound
   volume could supply useful information on the stress distributions and
   electric action spreading. However, how to acquire 3D ultrasound volumes
   of the heart of small animals in vivo for cardiac fiber wrapping is
   still a challenging problem. In this study, we provide an approach to
   acquire 3D ultrasound volumes of the rat hearts in vivo. The comparison
   between both in vivo and ex vivo geometries indicated 90.1\% Dice
   similarity. In this preliminary study, the evaluations of the cardiac
   fiber orientation wrapping errors were 24.7 degrees for the acute angle
   error and were 22.4 degrees for the inclination angle error. This 3D
   ultrasound imaging and fiber orientation estimation technique have
   potential applications in cardiac imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Two deactivation pathways of Ti and Zr half-metallocene complexes
   activated with B(C6F5)(3) in toluene solvent were studied using Density
   Functional Theory (DFT) with dispersion corrections: (a) H transfer from
   the counterion to Me initiating group to release methane and (b) C6F5
   transfer from the counterion to the metal. Transition state geometries
   and energies were computed for twenty-seven complexes, and the barrier
   height for the C6F5 transfer pathway was linearly correlated to the
   amount of steric congestion near the metal. Unimolecular rate constants
   for catalyst deactivation were predicted for all 27 catalysts by
   constructing a DFT-based quantitative structure activity relationship
   (QSAR). This QSAR was constructed by using the DFT-computed energy
   barrier (Delta V-0) and vibrational frequency along the reaction
   coordinate (nu(double dagger)) as chemical descriptors and fitting QSAR
   parameters to experimental data for reference systems. The computed rate
   constants were in excellent agreement with the available experimental
   data. Specifically, the dominant deactivation pathway for each catalyst
   and the relative deactivation rates of different catalysts were
   correctly predicted. Of note, the IndTi(OC6H-2,3,5,6-Ph-4)
   Me-2/B(C6F5)(3) system is predicted to have a good combination of slow
   deactivation and high olefin polymerization rates.}},

Abstract = {{This work is focused on design and testing of a novel class of
   transducers for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), able to perform
   directional interrogation of plate-like structures. These transducers
   leverage guided waves (GWs), and in particular Lamb waves, that have
   emerged as a very prominent option for assessing the state of a
   structure during operation. GW-SHM approaches greatly benefit from the
   use of transducers with controllable directional characteristics, so
   that selective scanning of a surface can be performed to locate damage,
   impacts, or cracks. In the concepts that we propose, continuous beam
   steering and directional actuation are achieved through proper selection
   of the excitation frequency. The design procedure takes advantage of the
   wavenumber representation of the device, and formulates the problem
   using a Fourier-based approach. The active layer of the transducer is
   made of piezoelectric fibers embedded into an epoxy matrix, allowing the
   device to be flexible, and thus suitable for application on non-flat
   surfaces. Proper shaping of the electrodes pattern through a
   compensation function allows taking into account the anisotropy level
   introduced by the active layer. The resulting spiral frequency steerable
   acoustic actuator is a configuration that features (i) enhanced
   performance, (ii) reduced complexity, and (iii) reduced hardware
   requirements of such devices.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the simulation accuracy of the finite-element (FE) model of
   an as-built structure, measurement data from the actual structure can be
   utilized for updating the model parameters, which is termed as FE model
   updating. During the past few decades, most efforts on FE model updating
   intend to update the entire structure model altogether, while using
   measurement data from sensors installed throughout the structure. When
   applied on large and complex structural models, the typical model
   updating approaches may fail due to computational challenges and
   convergence issues. In order to reduce the computational difficulty,
   this paper studies a decentralized FE model updating approach that
   intends to update one substructure at a time. The approach divides the
   entire structure into a substructure (currently being instrumented and
   updated) and the residual structure. The Craig-Bampton transform is
   adopted to condense the overall structural model. The optimization
   objective is formulated to minimize the modal dynamic residuals from the
   eigenvalue equations in structural dynamics involving natural
   frequencies and mode shapes. This paper investigates the effects of
   different substructure locations and sizes on updating performance. A
   space frame example, which is based on an actual pedestrian bridge on
   Georgia Tech campus, is used to study the substructure location and size
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The work is devoted to the study on elastic wave propagation in graphene
   nanoribbons, performed with peridynamics. Graphene nanoribbons have
   recently gained dramatic increase of interest in the fields of
   nanoelectronics and nanoelectromechanical systems. They can play a key
   role as either modern metallic or semiconductor materials, depending on
   the edge structure, with zigzag or armchair layout, respectively.
   Moreover, graphene opens new perspectives for the millimeter wave-based
   measurements systems. The authors present a peridynamic model used as
   alternative approach to analyze the dynamic behavior of a graphene
   nanoribbon. The model is considered as a periodic structure, i.e. an
   assembly of fundamental structural elements, with the first Brillouin
   zone under study, which undergoes propagation of elastic wave. The
   commonly applied auxiliary atomistic-continuum model for a C-C bond is
   used to set equivalent elastic properties, which are applied to find
   reference dispersion relation via FE model to study the behavior of the
   peridynamic model. The paper discusses its capability of recovering the
   physical nature of the reactions at the atomic scale present in a
   graphene applying dispersion characteristics. The peridynamic model of
   the graphene nanoribbon results from upscaling process carried out for a
   small-scale atomic model, making use of reference dispersion curve. The
   material properties are homogenized over studied domain indirectly by
   tuning the phase velocity for longitudinal in-plane elastic waves. As
   shown, nonlocal nature of peridynamics allows to preserve the
   lengthscale effect, local small-scale inhomogeneity and wave dispersion.
   Hence, the effect of spatial discretization at nano scale, arising from
   the distribution of atoms of carbon in the structure of graphene, may be
   represented with a nonlocal peridynamic model effectively.}},

   Announcements by US Airlines}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2471}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Abstract = {{The majority of studies on airline delays have been based on databases
   that contain information only about the final delay outcome associated
   with a flight; that is, did a flight arrive early or late at the gate
   and, if so, by how many minutes? This paper uses a database from
   FlightStats that contains information on the timing of airline
   notifications of delays to customers. Specifically, the delay
   notification strategies of six U.S. airlines are compared, and the
   timing and accuracy of their delay forecasts are analyzed with data from
   2010. Results show that airlines use different delay notification
   strategies. AirTran and Southwest announce delays more frequently
   throughout the flight departure process, whereas American Airlines,
   American Eagle, Delta, and Jet Blue announce the majority of their
   delays in two distinct periods before departure. Results also indicate
   that ``no news is bad news{''} in the sense that the closer to departure
   that a delay is first announced, the more likely it is to be a long
   delay. An assessment of forecasting accuracy reveals that the majority
   of airlines consistently underforecast delays; the two notable
   exceptions are Jet Blue and AirTran. The timing and accuracy of delay
   forecasts has important implications for airports, particularly as it
   relates to their ability to develop contingency plans for irregular
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Guided wavefields are now routinely measured with scanning laser
   vibrometers for both characterization of guided wave propagation and
   damage assessment. However, these measurements are usually
   time-consuming, particularly for imaging of large areas, primarily
   because of the degree of signal averaging required to reduce incoherent
   noise. A scanned air-coupled transducer is an alternative wavefield
   acquisition method that is based upon recording the very small amplitude
   pressure waves that leak into air from the out-of-plane motion of the
   guided wavefield. Air-coupled methods are attractive because they are
   not sensitive to small variations in surface optical reflectivity and
   special surface preparations are thus not necessary. In addition, not as
   much averaging is needed, making the acquisition process much faster.
   Unlike laser vibrometry, the recorded signals are not a direct measure
   of the wave motion, but experiments have shown that the acquired
   wavefields resemble those obtained from laser-based systems. For the
   work presented here, wavefield data were recorded with both methods for
   the same aluminum plate and composite panel specimens. Data are
   qualitatively compared in several domains to assess differences in
   temporal characteristics and modal content. Although signals are not
   identical, it is shown that the air-coupled transducer data exhibits
   similar modal content to that of the laser vibrometry data and may
   provide a reasonable alternative for some applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cracks, which frequently initiate from fastener holes as a result of
   stress concentration, are one of the most common defects in metallic
   plate-like structures. Among a variety of methods for crack detection,
   ultrasonic guided waves have been shown to be effective. To examine the
   performance of guided wave methods in the laboratory, notches are often
   used to simulate cracks. While extensive research has focused on the
   scattering of guided waves from a notch as well as a hole, limited work
   has been done on the incremental scattering resulting from the addition
   of a notch to an existing hole. This scenario is of particular interest
   for in situ monitoring of fastener holes, where the goal is to detect
   changes in scattering caused by crack initiation and growth. An
   experimental approach is taken here where a broadband chirp excitation
   is applied to surface-mounted PZT transducers to generate guided waves
   in an aluminum plate, and the out-of-plane particle motion is measured
   by a laser vibrometer. Notches are introduced at a through-hole, and the
   corresponding far field scattering information is obtained from
   full-circle laser scans taken before and after introduction of the
   notch. The laser received signals are then filtered to generate
   equivalent responses to narrowband tone burst excitations at different
   center frequencies. It is shown that as the excitation frequency
   increases, i.e., the wavelength approaches the defect size, the angular
   scattering patterns have a more complicated lobe structure. As expected,
   it can be seen for all frequencies considered that the incremental
   scattering patterns are no longer symmetric with respect to the incident
   direction about the line perpendicularly bisecting the notch, which is
   different than those for a notch alone.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of ultrasonic signals on a 2-D rectilinear grid
   resulting from a fixed source, referred to as wavefield imaging, is a
   powerful tool for visualizing wave propagation and scattering. Wavefield
   imaging provides a more complete picture of wave propagation than
   conventional single-point measurements, but creates more challenges for
   analysis. This work considers the development of wavefield-based methods
   for analyzing angle-beam wave propagation and scattering in plates.
   Methods of analysis focus on the separation of scattered waves from the
   total wavefield with the eventual goal of quantitative scatterer
   characterization in a laboratory environment. Two methods for wave
   separation are considered: frequency-wavenumber filtering and wavefield
   baseline subtraction. Frequency-wavenumber filtering is applied to
   wavefield data that are finely sampled in both space and time, whereas
   baseline subtraction is a technique that has typically been applied to
   individual signals recorded from fixed transducers rather than to full
   wavefield data. Baseline subtraction of wavefields, particularly for the
   frequency range considered here, is sensitive to both specimen alignment
   and temperature variations, whereas frequency-wavenumber methods are
   limited in their ability to separate waves traveling in the same
   direction. Results are shown for both methods with a focus on
   investigating and overcoming the challenges to full wavefield baseline
   subtraction.}},

Abstract = {{Abrupt impacts to solid laminate composite panels often produce internal
   damage that is not visible on the impacted surface. It is important that
   such damage be promptly detected since it can compromise the strength of
   composite structures. Ultrasonic C-scan imaging has been extensively
   used to detect and characterize impact damage using both pulse-echo and
   through-transmission methods. More recently developed guided wave
   imaging methods, such as sparse array imaging with baseline subtraction
   and wavefield imaging, have also been used to successfully detect damage
   in composite panels; however, their performance is generally not
   comparable to that achieved with bulk wave C-scans. For this study,
   various force impacts were used to create defect conditions ranging from
   barely detectable damage to extensive damage that was visible on the
   impact surface. Guided wave signals were recorded from an attached
   sparse transducer array before and after the impacts, and panels were
   scanned using both conventional ultrasonic C-scan methods and acoustic
   wavefield imaging. For each method, imaging results are presented and
   compared in terms of their ability to locate and characterize impact
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{This research tests the potential application of the Second Harmonic
   Generation (SHG) method using nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves to
   nondestructively quantify surface microstructural changes in thin stone.
   The acoustic nonlinearity parameter (beta) has been assessed as a
   meaningful indicator for characterizing the nonlinearity of civil
   engineering materials; additionally, Rayleigh waves offer the
   opportunity to isolate a material's near surface microstructural status.
   Sandstone was selected for testing due to its relative uniformity and
   small grain size compared to other stone types; the sample thickness was
   2 inches to reflect the minimum panel thickness recommended by the
   Indiana Limestone Institute. For this research, initially fully
   non-contact generation and detection techniques are evaluated before a
   100kHz wedge transmitter and a 200kHz air-coupled receiver are employed
   for generation and detection of nonlinear Rayleigh waves. Non-contact
   transmitters and receivers have advantages such as removing the
   irregularities associated with coupling as well as not leaving residues,
   which in stone applications can be considered aesthetically damaging.
   The experimental results show that the nonlinear parameter, beta, can be
   effectively isolated using the wedge transmitter and non-contact set up
   and that too much of the signal strength is lost in the fully
   non-contact method to extract meaningful results for this stone and
   stones with slow wave speeds. This indicates that the proposed SHG
   technique is effective for evaluating the nonlinearity parameter, beta,
   and can next be applied to characterize near surface microstructural
   changes in thin applications of dimensioned stone.}},

Abstract = {{This research experimentally investigates the sensitivity of the
   acoustic nonlinearity parameter to microcracks in cement-based
   materials. Based on the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique, an
   experimental setup using non-contact, air-coupled detection is used to
   receive the consistent Rayleigh surface waves. To induce variations in
   the extent of microscale cracking in two types of specimens (concrete
   and mortar), shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA), is used in one set,
   while a companion specimen is prepared without SRA. A 50 kHz wedge
   transducer and a 100 ktlz air-coupled transducer are implemented for the
   generation and detection of nonlinear Rayleigh waves. It is shown that
   the air-coupled detection method provides more repeatable fundamental
   and second harmonic amplitudes of the propagating Rayleigh waves. The
   obtained amplitudes are then used to calculate the relative nonlinearity
   parameter beta(re), the ratio of the second harmonic amplitude to the
   square of the fundamental amplitude. The experimental results clearly
   demonstrate that the nonlinearity parameter (beta(re)) is highly
   sensitive to the microstructural changes in cement-based materials than
   the Rayleigh phase velocity and attenuation and that SRA has great
   potential to avoid shrinkage cracking in cement-based materials.}},

Abstract = {{Material damage in structural components is driven by microstructural
   evolution that occurs at low length scales and begins early in component
   life. In metals, these microstructural features are known to cause
   measurable changes in the acoustic nonlinearity parameter. Physically,
   the interaction of a monochromatic ultrasonic wave with microstructural
   features such as dislocations, precipitates, and vacancies, generates a
   second harmonic wave that is proportional to the acoustic nonlinearity
   parameter. These nonlinear ultrasonic techniques thus have the
   capability to evaluate initial material damage, particularly before
   crack initiation and propagation occur. This paper discusses how the
   nonlinear ultrasonic technique of second harmonic generation can be used
   as a nondestructive evaluation tool to monitor microstructural changes
   in steel, focusing on characterizing neutron radiation embrittlement in
   nuclear reactor pressure vessel steels. Current experimental evidence
   and analytical models linking microstructural evolution with changes in
   the acoustic nonlinearity parameter are summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of the ultrasonic second harmonic generation has
   typically been restricted to simple setups such as through-transmission
   or Rayleigh surface waves. Recent research has evaluated the second
   harmonic waves generation in P-and SV- waves reflected from a
   stress-free surface to enable the single-sided interrogation of a
   specimen. This research considers the second harmonic generation in an
   aluminum specimen, which is analytically evaluated using an approach
   based on a perturbation method. Here, the model is chosen to mimic an
   experimental setup where the longitudinal wave is generated at oblique
   angle using a wedge transducer. Due to the mode conversion at the
   interface of the wedge and the specimen, it is necessary to evaluate
   longitudinal and shear waves, determining all second harmonic waves
   generated in the bulk and at the stress-free boundary. The theoretically
   developed model is then implemented in a commercial finite element code,
   COMSOL, using increasing fundamental wave amplitudes for different
   values of third order elastic constants. The results of this
   computational model verify the analytical approach and the proposed
   measurement setup, taking into account assumptions and approximations of
   the solution procedure. Furthermore, the computational model is used to
   draw important conclusions relevant to the experimental setup, including
   the need to avoid interaction with diffracted waves.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates early thermal aging in 9\% Cr ferritic
   martensitic (FM) steel, which is caused by the formation of second
   phases during high temperature exposure. This study employs a recently
   developed nonlinear ultrasonic technique to explore the sensitivity of
   the nonlinearity parameter. Experimental results show that the
   nonlinearity parameter is sensitive to certain changes in material's
   properties such as thermal embrittlement and hardness changes;
   therefore, it can be used as an indicator of the thermal damage. The
   specimens investigated are heat treated for different holding times
   ranging from 200h to 3000h at 650 degrees C. Nonlinear ultrasonic
   experiments are conducted for each specimen using a wedge transducer to
   generate and an air-coupled transducer to detect Raleigh surface waves.
   The amplitudes of the first and second order harmonics are measured at
   different propagation distances and these amplitudes are used to obtain
   the relative nonlinearity parameter for each specimen with a different
   holding time. The nonlinear ultrasonic results are compared with
   independent mechanical measurements and metallographic images. This
   research proposes the nonlinear ultrasonic technique as a nondestructive
   evaluation tool not only to detect thermal damage in early stages, and
   also to qualitatively assess the stage of thermal damage.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the Nonlinear Impact Resonance Acoustic Spectroscopy (NIRAS)
   method to monitor the evolution of damage due to delayed ettringite
   formation (DEF) is examined. In practice, the temperature of concrete
   during casting of precast concrete members or massive concrete
   structures may reach higher than 70 degrees C which can provide suitable
   conditions for damage to occur due to DEF, particularly in concrete
   which is subsequently exposed to wet environments. While expansion -
   often in excess of 1\% - is characteristic of DEF, the evolution of
   damage begins with microcracking. Unfortunately, there is no standard to
   test the susceptibility of materials or material combinations to DEF. On
   the other hand, NIRAS shows great sensitivity to the detection of
   microcracks and has been successfully applied to concrete to detect
   thermal and alkali silica reaction in concrete. In this preliminary
   research, the NIRAS method is used to discriminate among mortar samples
   which are relatively undamaged and those in the early stages of DEF. The
   results show that NIRAS could be a reliable and robust method in the
   detection of microcracks due to DEF.}},

Abstract = {{This research uses nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves to characterize
   stress corrosion cracking (SCC) damage in welded 304 Stainless Steel
   (304 SS). 304 SS is widely used in reactor pressure vessels, where a
   corrosive environment in combination with applied stress due to high
   internal pressures can cause SCC. Welds and the nearby heat affected
   zones (HAZ) in the vessel material are especially sensitive to SCC
   damage. SCC damage results in microstructural changes such as
   dislocation formation and microcrack initiation that in the long term
   lead to reduced structural integrity and material failure. Therefore,
   the early detection of SCC is crucial to ensure safe operation. It has
   been shown that the microstructural changes caused by SCC can generate
   higher harmonic waves when excited harmonically. This research considers
   different levels of SCC damage induced in samples of welded 304 SS by
   applying stress to a specimen held in a corrosive medium (Sodium
   Thiosulfate). A nonlinear Rayleigh surface wave is introduced in the
   material and the fundamental and the second harmonic waves are measured
   using wedge detection. The nonlinearity parameter that relates the
   fundamental and the second harmonic amplitudes, is computed to quantify
   the SCC damage in each sample. These results are used to demonstrate the
   feasibility of using nonlinear Rayleigh waves to characterize SCC
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between Lamb waves and a sessile water droplet (i.e., a
   droplet resting on a horizontal surface) is quite complex and limited
   research has addressed this issue. However, the similar interaction of
   Rayleigh waves with a water droplet has been considered, both
   experimentally and via models. Motivated by these results, this current
   work applies 3D finite element modeling to study far-field scattering of
   the fundamental antisymmetric Lamb wave mode from a single, axisymmetric
   water droplet on an aluminum plate. The profile of the droplet, which is
   affected by gravity, surface tension, and volume, determines the
   scattering behavior of incident Lamb waves. For small droplets, the
   effects of gravity can be ignored and the droplet is well-described by a
   spherical cap. The effects of the diameter and contact angle of this cap
   on far-field scattering are investigated by analyzing guided wave
   signals M the plate with and without the droplet. Scattered wave
   amplitudes expressed as a function of the scattered angle are compared
   for a number of different droplet geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Particle water and pH are predicted using meteorological observations
   (relative humidity (RH), temperature (T)), gas/particle composition, and
   thermodynamic modeling (ISORROPIA-II). A comprehensive uncertainty
   analysis is included, and the model is validated. We investigate mass
   concentrations of particle water and related particle pH for ambient
   fine-mode aerosols sampled in a relatively remote Alabama forest during
   the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in summer and at various
   sites in the southeastern US during different seasons, as part of the
   Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE) study.
   Particle water and pH are closely linked; pH is a measure of the
   particle H+ aqueous concentration and depends on both the presence of
   ions and amount of particle liquid water. Levels of particle water, in
   turn, are determined through water uptake by both the ionic species and
   organic compounds. Thermodynamic calculations based on measured ion
   concentrations can predict both pH and liquid water but may be biased
   since contributions of organic species to liquid water are not
   considered. In this study, contributions of both the inorganic and
   organic fractions to aerosol liquid water were considered, and
   predictions were in good agreement with measured liquid water based on
   differences in ambient and dry light scattering coefficients (prediction
   vs. measurement: slope = 0.91, intercept = 0.5 mu gm(-3), R-2 = 0.75).
   ISORROPIA-II predictions were confirmed by good agreement between
   predicted and measured ammonia concentrations (slope = 1.07, intercept =
   -0.12 mu gm(-3), R-2 = 0.76). Based on this study, organic species on
   average contributed 35\% to the total water, with a substantially higher
   contribution (50 \%) at night. However, not including contributions of
   organic water had a minor effect on pH (changes pH by 0.15 to 0.23
   units), suggesting that predicted pH without consideration of organic
   water could be sufficient for the purposes of aqueous secondary organic
   aerosol (SOA) chemistry. The mean pH predicted in the Alabama forest
   (SOAS) was 0.94 +/- 0.59 (median 0.93). pH diurnal trends followed
   liquid water and were driven mainly by variability in RH; during SOAS
   nighttime pH was near 1.5, while daytime pH was near 0.5. pH ranged from
   0.5 to 2 in summer and 1 to 3 in the winter at other sites. The
   systematically low pH levels in the southeast may have important
   ramifications, such as significantly influencing acid-catalyzed
   reactions, gas-aerosol partitioning, and mobilization of redox metals
   and minerals. Particle ion balances or molar ratios, often used to infer
   pH, do not consider the dissociation state of individual ions or
   particle liquid water levels and do not correlate with particle pH.}},

   geological exploration, forensics, archeology, snow/ice cover,
   structural health monitoring, and landmine location. Many of the
   applications pertain to urban sensing. Different tools have been
   designed, acquisition systems developed, and detection algorithms
   created to address this important, wide-ranging problem. In this
   chapter, we discuss the important aspects of buried target detection
   with respect to using a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) applied to
   locating subterranean landmines with a system that uses compressive
   sensing (CS) methods. We will show the advantages of using a CS
   detection algorithm and the considerations that need to be taken to make
   this type of algorithm efficient enough to solve practical
   three-dimensional (3D) imaging problems.}},

Abstract = {{Kraft lignin (KL) from black liquor is an abundantly available,

   by the pulp and paper industry, necessitating the development of new
   applications. Current work proposes an innovative KL utilization
   strategy that connects partial lignin degradation with lipid production
   in oleaginous Rhodococcus. Results showed poor bacterial growth when KL
   was used directly as a substrate. On the other hand, when KL
   recalcitrance was reduced by oxygen-pretreatment (O-2-KL), Rhodococcus
   opacus DSM 1069 was capable of utilizing this material and in turn
   accumulated lipids. The maximum lipid yield was measured to be 0.067 mg
   ml(-1) at 36 h of growth and these lipids were mainly composed of
   palmitic (46.9\%) and stearic (42.7\%) acids.}},

Abstract = {{The response of planar sandwich structures with metallic
   square-honeycomb cores under high-intensity water-based impulsive
   loading is analyzed through fully dynamic finite element simulations.
   The analyses concern overall structural response, damage and energy
   dissipation. The steel sandwich plates considered have different contact
   conditions with water-an air-backed configuration which simulates
   contact with water on only the load side and a water-backed
   configuration which simulates submerged conditions. The 3D finite
   element simulations account for the effects of fluid-structure
   interactions and the ductile failure of the sandwich structure material.
   Results show that the primary deformation mode is core-wall buckling in
   light-core structures and shear-rupture in face-sheets and core-webs in
   heavy-core structures. On a unit weight basis, sandwich structures with
   heavy cores perform poorly while those with light cores exhibit superior
   blast-resistance in terms of back-face deflection and total energy
   absorbed. Significant differences between the responses of air-backed
   and water-backed structures are observed. An analysis is carried out to
   develop structure-loading-performance relations to facilitate the design
   of structures tailored for specific loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has witnessed rapid advances in synthesis of
   nanocrystals, which has led to the development of a large variety of
   approaches for producing nanocrystals with controlled dimensions.
   However, most of these techniques lack the high-throughput production.
   Herein, we report on a viable and robust strategy based on an
   inert-gas-driven microflow reactor for continuous crafting of
   high-quality colloidal nanocrystals. With the judicious introduction of
   the inert-gas driven capability, the microflow reactor provides an
   attractive platform for continuous production of colloidal nanocrystals
   in large quantities, including easily-oxidized nanocrystals. The
   as-synthesized nanocrystals possessed a uniform size and shape.
   Intriguingly, the size of nanocrystals can be effectively tailored by
   varying the flow rate and the precursor concentration. We envision that
   the microflow reactor strategy is general and offers easy access to a
   wide range of scalable nanocrystals for potential applications in
   sensors, optics, optoelectronics, solar energy conversion, batteries,
   photocatalysis, and electronic devices.}},

   sensitivities of the spectroscopic properties of 1 in the presence of
   various anions were examined using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy,

   carboxylate, cyanide, fluoride and dihydrogen phosphate anions results
   in an increase in quantum yield for emission of 1, and changes in its
   H-1 NMR chemical shifts. A significant electrostatic interaction of the
   tetrabutylammonium cation with 1, upon strong binding with the counter
   anion, was also indicated by the chemical shifts observed in the H-1 NMR
   titrations. Binding constants of 1 to anions are also calculated based
   on the binding isotherms derived from NMR and UV-vis titrations. DFT
   calculations show that the anion does not significantly impact the
   HOMO/LUMO levels (and subsequently the S-0 -> S-1 transition), but
   rather changes the strength of the S-0 -> S-2 transition, which accounts

   electronic properties, with resulting bandgaps of up to 1 eV. Notably,
   we ascertain that a 11\% strain in the zigzag direction in combination
   with -20\% in the armchair direction produces a bandgap of approximately
   1 eV. We also establish that uniaxial and isotropic biaxial strains of
   up to +/- 20\% are incapable of opening bandgaps, while shear strains of

Title = {{Parameter sensitivity of system reliability using sequential compounding
   method}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{26-36}},
Abstract = {{Computation of sensitivities of the `system' failure probability with
   respect to various parameters is essential in reliability based design
   optimization (RBDO) and uncertainty/risk management of a complex
   engineering system. The system failure event is defined as a logical
   function of multiple component events representing failure modes,
   locations or time points. Recently, the sequential compounding method
   (SCM) was developed for efficient calculations of the probabilities of
   large-size, general system events for a wide range of correlation
   properties. To facilitate the use of SCM in RBDO and uncertainty/risk
   management under a constraint on the system failure probability, a
   method, termed as Chun-Song-Paulino (CSP) method, is developed in this
   paper to compute parameter sensitivities of system failure probability
   using SCM. For a parallel or series system, the derivative of the system
   failure probability with respect to the reliability index is
   analytically derived at the last step of the sequential compounding. For
   a general system, the sensitivity of the probability of the set
   involving the component of interest and the sensitivity of the system
   failure probability with respect to the super-component representing the
   set are computed respectively using the CSP method and combined by the
   chain-rule. The CSP method is illustrated by numerical examples, and
   successfully tested by examples covering a wide range of system event
   types, reliability indices, number of components, and correlation
   properties. The method is also applied to compute the sensitivity of the
   first-passage probability of a building structure under stochastic
   excitations, modeled by use of finite elements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Many high chi block copolymer (BCP) systems often have one block which
   shows a strong preference to wet the free interface at the top of the
   film. This property makes it difficult to form vertically aligned
   lamellae which are desired for many directed self-assembly (DSA)
   applications. To better understand this behavior, simulations of thin
   films of BCPs were carried out using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics
   (MD) model. The property that leads one block to preferentially wet the
   free interface over the other is a difference in cohesive energy density
   (CED) between the two blocks. Our simulation allows for the systematic
   variation in the CED of each block to investigate how the magnitude of
   these differences affects self-assembly behavior. BCPs with no CED
   differences between the blocks show large ranges of underlayer
   compositions where vertical lamellae will form that are minimally
   affected by changing chi of the BCP. The range where vertical lamellae
   will form can be thought of as a process window. Increasing the CED
   asymmetry of the BCP (i.e. the difference in CED between blocks) causes
   a reduction in the process window and also causes a shift in the
   underlayer composition that is the center of the window. Increasing chi
   increases the process window for vertical lamellae in CED asymmetric
   systems. This behavior is determined by the trade-off in energy due to
   three interfacial interactions: A-B interface, film-free surface
   interface, and film-underlayer interface. At the limits of very high CED
   asymmetry and low chi, there may be no underlayer compositions where
   vertical lamellae will form. A simplified model was also developed that
   can accurately predict these process windows for different CED asymmetry
   and chi values on the order of seconds and minutes compared to hours and
   days for the full simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Chemoepitaxial guidance of block copolymer (BCP) directed self-assembly
   (DSA) in thin films is explored. The underlayers studied are line-space
   patterns composed of repeating highly preferential pinning stripes
   separated by larger, more neutral, background regions. Studies have
   shown that varying the properties of such a chemical pattern can have a
   large effect on processing window, but the effect of changing the
   chemical pattern on many properties of interest such as footing of the
   BCP are hard to measure experimentally. This study uses a coarse-grained
   molecular dynamics model to study a 2x density multiplying underlayer by
   varying the pinning stripe width and background region chemical
   interactions and analyzing the effect on self-assembled BCP lines.
   Decreasing pinning stripe width or making the background region more
   neutral is found to increase the LER of the lines. An undersized pinning
   stripe width with a neutral background region is found to give the
   straightest sidewalls for the formed lines, while a larger pinning
   stripe causes the pinned line to foot (expand near the substrate) and a
   preferential background region causes the unpinned line to undercut
   (contract near the substrate). A simple model was developed to predict
   the optimal conditions to eliminate footing. Using this model,
   conditions are found that decrease footing of the pinned line but these
   conditions increase undercutting in the unpinned line. Deformations in
   either the pinned or unpinned line propagate to the other line. There
   exists a tradeoff between LER and the footing/undercutting, that is,
   decreasing LER increases footing/ undercutting and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{Directed self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) is a process that has
   received great interest in the field of nano-manufacturing in the past
   decade, and great strides towards forming high quality aligned patterns
   have been made. But state of the art methods still yield defectivities
   orders of magnitude higher than is necessary in semi-conductor
   fabrication even though free energy calculations suggest that
   equilibrium defectivities are much lower than is necessary for economic
   semi-conductor fabrication. This disparity suggests that the main
   problem may lie in the kinetics of defect removal. This work uses a
   coarse-grained model to study the rates, pathways, and dependencies of
   healing a common defect to give insight into the fundamental processes
   that control defect healing and give guidance on optimal process
   conditions for BCP-DSA. It is found that infinitely thick films yield an
   exponential drop in defect heal rate above chi N similar to 30. Below
   chi N similar to 30, the rate of transport was similar to the rate at
   which the transition state was reached so that the overall rate changed
   only slightly. The energy barrier in periodic simulations increased with
   0.31 chi N on average. Thin film simulations show no change in rate
   associated with the energy barrier below chi N similar to 50, and then
   show an increase in energy barrier scaling with 0.16 chi N. Thin film
   simulations always begin to heal at either the free interface or the
   BCP-underlayer interface where the increased A-B contact area associated
   with the transition state will be minimized, while the infinitely thick
   films must start healing in the bulk where the A-B contact area is
   increased. It is also found that cooperative chain movement is required
   for the defect to start healing.}},

Abstract = {{Bottom-up spatio-temporal saliency detection identifies perceptually
   important regions of interest in video sequences. The center-surround
   model proves to be useful for visual saliency detection. In this work,
   we explore using 3D FFT local spectra as features for saliency detection
   within the center-surround framework. We develop a spectral location
   based decomposition scheme to divide a 3D FFT cube into two components,
   one related to temporal changes and the other related to spatial
   changes. Temporal saliency and spatial saliency are detected separately
   using features derived from each spectral component through a simple
   center-surround comparison method. The two detection results are then
   combined to yield a saliency map. We apply the same detection algorithm
   to different color channels (YIQ) and incorporate the results into the
   final saliency determination. The proposed technique is tested with the
   public CRCNS database. Both visual and numerical evaluations verify the
   promising performance of our technique.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetric graphene tunneling field-effect transistors (SymFETs)
   consisting of two independently gated graphene layers separated by a
   potential barrier have been proposed as a room-temperature resonant
   tunneling device. In a SymFET, the inelastic-coherent length (L-phi) of
   the electrons is considered to be one of the important characteristic
   scattering lengths. Weak localization (WL) is a good tool to estimate
   L-phi. In this study, the surface of the chemical-vapor-deposited
   single-layer graphene was Ti cleaned after performing the conventional
   fabrication processes for graphene transistors. We found that the
   charge-neutral point (V-CNP) shifted to a lower back-gate voltage and
   the mobility increased owing to Ti cleaning. Ti-cleaned Hall bars were
   investigated at 0.3 K under magnetic fields of up to 14 T. Negative
   magnetoresistance (MR) appears because of the WL effect, and the MR
   increases as the back-gate voltage (V-G) approaches V-CNP. From a
   fitting analysis using the theoretical formulation of WL, we found that
   L-phi was greater than 100 nm and that L-phi decreased as V-G approached
   V-CNP because of electron-hole puddles and electron-electron

Abstract = {{A Monte Carlo electron scattering simulation tool that can create SEM
   images of 3D features with arbitrary geometry has been developed. This
   is combined with both a stochastic resist model and synthetic 3D
   features to probe the effect of the effect of roughness on SEM
   measurements. Sidewall roughness makes it difficult to precisely
   identify the true feature width of a line because the roughness
   increases the SEM signal non-proportionally to the amount of material
   with which it is interacting. LER generally under predicts sidewall
   surface roughness because the SEM has an averaging effect as the
   electron beam interacts with a volume of material. LER becomes a better
   measure of surface roughness as the correlation length of the surface
   roughness increases. Decreasing film thickness causes a decrease in the
   linewidth and increase in LER measured by SEM, especially for features
   35 nm thick and below. This occurs even if the true 3D feature width and
   roughness is approximately constant, meaning that the apparent change in
   linewidth and LER is a metrology effect. Threshold based estimations of
   line edges are difficult because the threshold choice that best matches
   the true feature width changes with the feature geometry. Model based
   library fits of linescans do not appear to provide a solution because
   sidewall roughness and sidewall angle have similar effects on the
   linescan meaning no unique linescan likely exists.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the photoinduced dynamics of fluorescent proteins is
   essential for their applications in bioimaging. Despite numerous studies
   on the ultrafast dynamics, the delayed response of these proteins, which
   often results in population of kinetically trapped dark states of
   various origins, is largely unexplored. Here, by using transient
   absorption spectroscopy spanning the time scale from picoseconds to
   seconds, we reveal a hidden reactivity of the bright blue-light emitting
   protein mKalama1 previously thought to be inert. This protein shows no
   excited-state proton transfer during its nanosecond excited-state
   lifetime; however, its tyrosine-based chromophore undergoes
   deprotonation coupled to non-radiative electronic relaxation. Such
   deprotonation causes distinct optical absorption changes in the broad
   UV-to-NIR spectral range (ca. 300-800 nm); the disappearance of the
   transient absorption signal has a complex nature and spans the whole
   microsecond-to-second time scale. The mechanisms underlying the
   relaxation kinetics are disclosed based on the X-ray structural analysis
   of mKalama1 and the high-level electronic structure calculations of
   proposed intermediates in the photocycle. We conclude that the
   non-radiative excited-state decay includes two major branches: internal
   conversion coupled to intraprotein proton transfer, where a conserved
   residue E222 serves as the proton acceptor; and ionization induced by
   two consecutive resonant absorption events, followed by deprotonation of
   the chromophore radical cation to bulk solvent through a novel
   water-mediated proton-wire pathway. Our findings open up new
   perspectives on the dynamics of fluorescent proteins as tracked by its
   optical transient absorption in the time domain extending up to seconds.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative methods for environmental and cost analyses of energy,
   industrial, and infrastructure systems are briefly introduced and
   surveyed, with the aim of encouraging broader utilization and
   development of quantitative methods in sustainable energy research.
   Material and energy flow analyses can provide an overall system
   overview. The methods of engineering economics and cost benefit
   analysis, such as net present value, are the most straightforward
   approach for evaluating investment options, with the levelized cost of
   energy being a widely used metric in electricity analyses. Environmental
   lifecycle assessment has been extensively developed, with both detailed
   process-based and comprehensive input-output approaches available.
   Optimization methods provide an opportunity to go beyond engineering
   economics to develop detailed least-cost or least-impact combinations of
   many different choices.}},

Abstract = {{Trapped laser-cooled atomic tons are a new tool for understanding cold
   molecular ions. The atomic ions not only sympathetically cool the
   molecular ions to millikelvin temperatures, but the bright atomic ion
   fluorescence can also serve as a detector of both molecular reactions
   and molecular spectra. We are working towards the detection of single
   molecular ion spectra by sympathetic heating spectroscopy. Sympathetic
   heating spectroscopy uses the coupled motion of two trapped ions to
   measure the spectra of one ion by observing changes in the fluorescence
   of the other ion. Sympathetic heating spectroscopy is a generalization
   of quantum logic spectroscopy, but does not require ions in the motional
   ground state or coherent control of the ion internal states. We have
   recently demonstrated this technique using two isotopes of Ca+ {[}Phys.

   imaging using conventional microscopy hardware}},

Abstract = {{Most quantitative phase microscopy methods require the use of
   custom-built or modified microscopic configurations which are not
   typically available to most bio/pathologists. There are, however, phase
   retrieval algorithms which utilize defocused bright-field images as
   input data and are therefore implementable in existing laboratory
   environments. Among these, deterministic methods such as those based on
   inverting the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) or a phase contrast
   transfer function (PCTF) are particularly attractive due to their
   compatibility with Kohler illuminated systems and numerical simplicity.
   Recently, a new method has been proposed, called multi-filter phase
   imaging with partially coherent light (MFPI-PC), which alleviates the
   inherent noise/resolution trade-off in solving the TIE by utilizing a
   large number of defocused bright-field images spaced equally about the
   focal plane. Despite greatly improving the state-of-the-art, the method
   has many shortcomings including the impracticality of high-speed
   acquisition, inefficient sampling, and attenuated response at high
   frequencies due to aperture effects. In this report, we present a new
   method, called bright-field quantitative phase microscopy (BFQPM), which
   efficiently utilizes a small number of defocused bright-field images and
   recovers frequencies out to the partially coherent diffraction limit.
   The method is based on a noise-minimized inversion of a PCTF derived for
   each finite defocus distance. We present simulation results which
   indicate nanoscale optical path length sensitivity and improved
   performance over MFPI-PC. We also provide experimental results imaging
   live bovine mesenchymal stem cells at sub-second temporal resolution. In
   all, BFQPM enables fast and accurate phase imaging with unprecedented
   spatial resolution using widely available bright-field microscopy
   hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Complete surgical removal of tumor tissue is essential for postoperative
   prognosis after surgery. Intraoperative tumor imaging and visualization
   are an important step in aiding surgeons to evaluate and resect tumor
   tissue in real time, thus enabling more complete resection of diseased
   tissue and better conservation of healthy tissue. As an emerging
   modality, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) holds great potential for
   comprehensive and objective intraoperative cancer assessment. In this
   paper, we explored the possibility of intraoperative tumor detection and
   visualization during surgery using HSI in the wavelength range of 450 nm
   - 900 nm in an animal experiment. We proposed a new algorithm for glare
   removal and cancer detection on surgical hyperspectral images, and
   detected the tumor margins in five mice with an average sensitivity and
   specificity of 94.4\% and 98.3\%, respectively. The hyperspectral
   imaging and quantification method have the potential to provide an
   innovative tool for image-guided surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound or echocardiography is one of the most
   widely used examinations for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases. However,
   it only supplies the geometric and structural information of the
   myocardium. In order to supply more detailed microstructure information
   of the myocardium, this paper proposes a registration method to map
   cardiac fiber orientations from three-dimensional (3D) magnetic
   resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) volume to the 2D ultrasound
   image. It utilizes a 2D/3D intensity based registration procedure
   including rigid, log-demons, and affine transformations to search the
   best similar slice from the template volume. After registration, the
   cardiac fiber orientations are mapped to the 2D ultrasound image via
   fiber relocations and reorientations. This method was validated by six
   images of rat hearts ex vivo. The evaluation results indicated that the
   final Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) achieved more than 90\% after
   geometric registrations; and the inclination angle errors (IAE) between
   the mapped fiber orientations and the gold standards were less than 15
   degree. This method may provide a practical tool for cardiologists to
   examine cardiac fiber orientations on ultrasound images and have the
   potential to supply additional information for diagnosis of cardiac
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report an electrostatic spray deposition method to prepare
   three-dimensional porous graphene electrodes for supercapacitor
   applications. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibits excellent specific
   capacitance (366 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH) and long cycle life
   (108\% capacitance retention up to 40 000 cycles). Moreover, the energy
   densities of the organic and aqueous electrolyte based supercapacitors
   reach 22.9 and 8.1 Wh kg(-1) when the power densities are 119.2 and 15.4
   kW kg(-1), respectively. Compared with the previously reported graphene
   based supercapacitors, the improved properties could be attributed to
   the excellent three-dimensional open porous electrode structure, which
   is favorable for the ion diffusion and electron transport. In addition,
   this method provides a simple electrode-fabrication route without the
   involvement of conducting additives and binders. It may find vast
   applications in thin and miniaturized energy storage scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Many different types of non-traditional resist designs have shown
   promise for future generations of patterning, but there is a greater
   need for understanding and developing additives and ancillary materials
   for these novel resists compared to traditional polymeric positive tone
   systems which are quite mature. With the goal of meeting some of these
   needs, we carried out multiple different studies of negative tone
   molecular resists based on epoxide cross-linking. We have developed
   methods for controlling cross-linking in these materials using
   photo-decomposable nucleophiles (PDNs) which have shown resolution
   improvements in one resist from 26 nm down to 18 nm so far. Aqueous base
   developed systems have been made by introducing phenol groups to these
   resists. Although the first molecule designed successfully patterns in
   aqueous base, its performance is limited compared to organic solvent
   development. A series of di-functional epoxide molecular resists have
   been made and generally show much worse sensitivity than a
   four-functional epoxide resist. Underlayers (ULs) have been designed
   specifically to leverage the high reactivity of epoxides to create ULs
   that can cross-link to the resist. These ULs improve the adhesion of
   some of these molecular resists, but also show significant sensitivity
   improvements compared to imaging on bare silicon. Sensitivity in one
   resist was improved by 5-12 mJ/cm(2) simply by using the UL.}},

   of an underlayer. A trend was observed where PEB conditions performed at
   temperatures much higher than the T-g of the molecular resist was found
   to induce propagation of polymerization outside of exposed regions.
   Di-functionalized resists were observed to have poor sensitivity due to
   their low degree of functionalization. A resist was synthesized

   approaches to testing effects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{544-558}},
Abstract = {{Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is associated with adverse health
   outcomes. There has long been a question as to whether some components
   of the PM mixture are of greater public health concern than others so
   that the sources that emit the more toxic components could be
   controlled. In this paper, we describe the National Particle Component
   Toxicity (NPACT) initiative, a comprehensive research program that
   combined epidemiologic and toxicologic approaches to evaluate this
   critical question, partly relying on information from a national network
   of air quality monitors that provided data on speciated PM2.5 (PM with
   an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m) starting in 2000. We also consider the
   results of the NPACT program in the context of selected research on PM
   components and health in order to assess the current state of the field.
   Overall, the ambitious NPACT research program found associations of
   secondary sulfate and, to a somewhat lesser extent, traffic sources with
   health effects. Although this and other research has linked a variety of
   health effects to multiple groups of PM components and sources of PM,
   the collective evidence has not yet isolated factors or sources that
   would be closely and unequivocally more strongly related to specific
   health outcomes. If greater success is to be achieved in isolating the
   effects of pollutants from mobile and other major sources, either as
   individual components or as a mixture, more advanced approaches and
   additional measurements will be needed so that exposure at the
   individual or population level can be assessed more accurately. Enhanced
   understanding of exposure and health effects is needed before it can be
   concluded that regulations targeting specific sources or components of
   PM2.5 will protect public health more effectively than continuing to
   follow the current practices of targeting PM2.5 mass as a
   whole.Implications:This paper describes a comprehensive epidemiologic
   and toxicologic research program to evaluate whether some components and
   sources of PM may be more toxic than others. This question is important
   for regulatory agencies in setting air quality standards to protect
   people's health. The results show that PM from coal and oil combustion
   and from traffic sources was associated with adverse health outcomes,
   but other components and sources could not definitively be ruled out.
   Thus, given current knowledge, the current practice of setting air
   quality standards for PM mass as a whole likely remains an effective
   approach to protecting public health.}},

Abstract = {{A waterborne polyurethane covalently bonded anthraquinone dye
   chromophore was successfully synthesized via incorporating micromolecule
   Disperse Red 91 into the polyurethane skeleton. The number- and

   absorption wavelengths are 260 nm, 520 nm and 555 nm, which show a
   hypsochromic effect compared with the corresponding micromolecule dye.
   Thermal stability and centrifugal stability can be distinctly enhanced
   after the micromolecule dyes are covalently bonded to the polyurethane
   skeleton. The solubility of waterborne polyurethane based polymeric dye
   also offers reversibility and good color stability at different pH
   values. Thermal migration properties of this polymeric dye are improved
   by 82.4\%, compared to that of a simple mixture of dye and polyurethane.
   The polymeric dye with enhanced color stability under centrifugation,

Journal = {{ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{397-424}},
Abstract = {{Physical spray models employed in engine computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations are not yet fully predictive; therefore, the breadth
   of conditions under which these simulations yield valid predictions
   depends strongly on the ``tuning{''} of these models against available
   spray measurements. Often, these models are validated and calibrated
   against spray images based on the elastic scattering of light, or Mie
   scattering, from liquid structures and droplet clouds. However, these
   measurements do not typically detect the absolute liquid boundary, so
   employed computational metrics used to define the liquid boundary in the
   modeled spray can be physically inconsistent with that detected in
   Mie-scatter images. To more robustly validate fuel spray model
   predictions against light scattering measurements, direct comparisons
   can be made between predicted and measured light scattering intensity
   signals. Such a comparison provides a more quantitative validation of
   the liquid phase fuel boundary and further offers the potential to
   validate local spray structure. In this work, we apply the Lorentz Mie
   solution to Maxwell's equations to predict extinction signals due to
   elastic light scattering, informed by droplet diameter and number
   density distributions, within a predicted diesel spray. The predicted
   extinction is compared to experimental results from diffused
   back-illumination and single line-of-sight extinction measurements to
   generate a calibrated model of the Engine Combustion Network ``Spray
   A{''} condition that replicates the measured centerline extinction
   profile. This spray model is used to inform liquid volume fraction
   thresholds to similarly define the detected liquid boundary from
   Mie-scatter images.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 adsorption on a barium oxide (BaO) surface saturated with a
   monolayer of H2O molecules was studied; a monolayer of H(2)Omolecules on
   the BaO surface exhibits nondissociative or dissociative adsorption.
   During the nondissociative reaction, a hydroxyl ion-terminated surface
   is produced, resulting in the formation of barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)(2))
   on the surface. The Ba(OH)(2) from the substrate associates with the
   tightly bound CO2 molecule, resulting in the formation of barium
   carbonate (BaCO3). In contrast, during the dissociative H2O adsorption,
   a hydrogen-terminated surface is produced, which strongly adsorbs CO2
   molecules. The H2O molecules on a fully saturated BaO surface
   (containing multiple layers of H2O molecules) readily aggregate, and Ba
   dissociation takes place on the hydrated surface, possibly resulting in
   a surface containing Ba defects.}},

Title = {{Data assimilation of GRACE terrestrial water storage estimates into a
   regional hydrological model of the Rhine River basin}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2079-2100}},
Abstract = {{The ability to estimate terrestrial water storage (TWS) realistically is
   essential for understanding past hydrological events and predicting
   future changes in the hydrological cycle. Inadequacies in model physics,
   uncertainty in model land parameters, and uncertainties in
   meteorological data commonly limit the accuracy of hydrological models
   in simulating TWS. In an effort to improve model performance, this study
   investigated the benefits of assimilating TWS estimates derived from the
   Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data into the
   OpenStreams wflow\_hbv model using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
   approach. The study area chosen was the Rhine River basin, which has
   both well-calibrated model parameters and high-quality forcing data that
   were used for experimentation and comparison. Four different case
   studies were examined which were designed to evaluate different levels
   of forcing data quality and resolution including those typical of other
   less well-monitored river basins. The results were validated using in
   situ groundwater (GW) and stream gauge data. The analysis showed a
   noticeable improvement in GW estimates when GRACE data were assimilated,
   with a best-case improvement of correlation coefficient from 0.31 to
   0.53 and root mean square error (RMSE) from 8.4 to 5.4 cm compared to
   the reference (ensemble open-loop) case. For the data-sparse case, the
   best-case GW estimates increased the correlation coefficient from 0.46
   to 0.61 and decreased the RMSE by 35 \%. For the average improvement of
   GW estimates (for all four cases), the correlation coefficient increases
   from 0.6 to 0.7 and the RMSE was reduced by 15 \%. Only a slight overall
   improvement was observed in streamflow estimates when GRACE data were
   assimilated. Further analysis suggested that this is likely due to
   sporadic short-term, but sizeable, errors in the forcing data and the
   lack of sufficient constraints on the soil moisture component. Overall,
   the results highlight the benefit of assimilating GRACE data into
   hydrological models, particularly in data-sparse regions, while also
   providing insight on future refinements of the methodology.}},

Title = {{Antecedent Disease Is Less Prevalent in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}},
Journal = {{NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{109-113}},
Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Recent studies suggest that antecedent disease could
   impact the pathophysiology of the motoneuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral
   Sclerosis (ALS). We performed a case-control study to examine the
   prevalence of 11 antecedent diseases in ALS. Methods: Prevalence of
   antecedent disease in a 1,288 patient ALS population (Emory University
   ALS Clinic, Atlanta, Ga., USA) is compared to an age, gender, and
   geography-matched 7,561 subject control population using a statistical
   odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval. Results: Association of
   ALS with odds of arthritis (OR = 0.14); non-ALS neurological disease (OR
   = 0.14); liver disease (OR = 0.19); chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disorder or COPD (OR = 0.23); kidney disease (OR = 0.32); adult asthma
   (OR = 0.39); diabetes (OR = 0.47); hypertension (OR = 0.56); obesity (OR
   = 0.6); hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia (OR = 0.62); and thyroid
   disease (OR = 0.78). Conclusions: The prevalence of antecedent disease
   was overall less in the ALS population. We present two potential lines
   of inquiry to explain these results: (1) `Other disease as ALS
   protection'-antecedent diseases infer biochemical neuroprotection to
   ALS; (2) `ALS as other disease protection' - the underpinnings of ALS
   could infer protection to other diseases, possibly via the mechanism
   hypervigilant regulation or `too-high' regulatory feedback gains. (C)

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3559-3565}},
Abstract = {{Binary diblock copolymers and corresponding ternary miktoarm stars are
   studied at oil-water interfaces. All polymers contain oil-soluble
   poly(propylene oxide) PPO, water-soluble poly(dimethylaminoethyl
   methacrylate) PDMAEMA and/or poly(ethylene oxide) PEO. The features of
   their Langmuir compression isotherms are well related to the ones of the
   corresponding homopolymers. Within the Langmuir-trough, PEO-b-PPO acts
   as the most effective amphiphile compared to the other PPO-containing
   copolymers. In contrast, the compression isotherms show a complexation
   of PPO and PDMAEMA for PPO-b-PDMAEMA and the star, reducing their
   overall amphiphilicity. Such complex formation between the blocks of
   PPO-b-PDMAEMA is prevented in bulk water but facilitated at the
   interface. The weakly-interacting blocks of PPO-b-PDMAEMA form a complex
   due to their enhanced proximity in such confined environments. Scanning
   force microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations with varying confinement
   support our results, which are regarded as compliant with the
   mathematical random walk theorem by Polya. Finally, the results are
   expected to be of relevance for e.g. emulsion formulation and
   macromolecular engineering.}},

Title = {{Regulation of Osteoblast Differentiation by Acid-Etched and/or
   Grit-Blasted Titanium Substrate Topography Is Enhanced by 1,25(OH)(2)D-3
   in a Sex-Dependent Manner}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{This study assessed contributions of micron-scale topography on
   clinically relevant titanium (Ti) to differentiation of osteoprogenitor
   cells and osteoblasts; the interaction of this effect with 1
   alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3); and if the effects
   are sex-dependent. Male and female rat bone marrow cells (BMCs) were
   cultured on acid-etched (A, R-a = 0.87 mu m), grit-blasted (GB,R-a =
   3.90 mu m), or grit-blasted/acid-etched (SLA,R-a = 3.22 mu m) Ti. BMCs
   were sensitive to surface topography and underwent osteoblast
   differentiation. This was greatest on SLA; acid etching and grit
   blasting contributed additively. Primary osteoblasts were also sensitive
   to SLA, with less effect from individual structural components,
   demonstrated by enhanced local factor production. Sex-dependent
   responses of BMCs to topography varied with parameter whereas male and
   female osteoblasts responded similarly to surface treatment. 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 enhanced cell responses on all surfaces similarly.
   Effects were sex-dependent and male cells grown on a complex
   microstructured surface were much more sensitive than female cells.
   These results indicate that effects of the complex SLA topography are
   greater than acid etching or grit blasting alone on multipotent BMCs and
   committed osteoblasts and that individual parameters are sex-specific.
   The effect of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 was sex dependent. The results also
   suggest that levels of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D(3) in the patient may be
   important in osseointegration.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},

Pages = {{1065-1078}},
Abstract = {{Thermal and electrolytic decomposition and ignition of water solutions
   of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN, {[}NH3OH](+){[}NO3](-)) are
   investigated. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility
   of electrolytic ignition for HAN-based ionic liquid propellants. As a
   consequence of electrolysis, the propellant decomposes to NH2OH, HNO3,
   HONO, HNO, N2O, N-2, NO, NO2, H2O, H-2(g), and O-2(g). These species
   then initiate a series of gas phase reactions, governed by the H-O-N
   kinetics scheme, and lead to ignition. Electrochemical mechanisms are
   established and incorporated into an existing chemical kinetics scheme
   for thermal decomposition of HAN-water solutions. The analysis treats
   the liquid and gas phases separately, and matches their respective
   processes at the interfacial boundary to determine the overall
   decomposition and ignition characteristics. Results are benchmarked
   against experimental data for the species evolution in the condensed
   phase, as well as laser-induced ignition delay of 13 M HAN-water
   solution. The effects of electric current (0-2.5 A), propellant volume
   (0.1-0.3 cc), initial temperature (300-450 K), and HAN concentration
   (9-13 M) on the ignition behaviors are investigated systematically. The
   ignition delay decreases with increasing electric current as a power-law
   function: tau(ign) = AI(-n), where A = 3.95 and n = 0.95 for a 0.1 cc 13
   M HAN-water solution at an initial condition of 300 K and 1 atm. The
   exponent n and coefficient A are decreasing functions of the initial
   temperature. For a given power, decreasing the initial volume of
   HAN-water solution increases the current density available for
   electrolysis, and expedites the ignition process. The work represents
   the first theoretical study of its kind on this topic.}},

Abstract = {{A physics-based impedance model of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell
   is developed, incorporating a coupled oxide growth-oxygen reduction
   reaction kinetic model. The oxide layer is shown to produce a low
   frequency inductive loop that agrees quantitatively with the
   experimental inductive loop at current densities as high as 800
   mA/cm(2), even when kinetic and mass-transfer parameters are fit from
   polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry instead of electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. The importance of the inductive loop in
   explaining both AC and DC results is discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{A new Cu-catalyzed air oxidation method was successfully developed to
   prepare Cu-loaded poly(m-phenylenediamine) (PmPD) with monomer
   conversion rates close to 100\%. The polymerization process was examined
   by the in situ tracking of open-circuit potential (OCP) and pH. The
   product was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). The results show that the Cu catalytic effect in the
   air oxidation was responsible for the great enhancement of monomers
   conversion rates. On increasing Cu addition, PmPD particles tended to
   form hollow microstructures, which may result from a dehydration effect.
   Furthermore, the as-obtained samples have superior arsenic(V) removal
   performance in aqueous solution. The adsorption equilibrium can be
   rapidly reached within 10 min. Higher loadings of Cu particles exhibited
   an improved arsenic(V) removal capability of 27.4 mg g(-1), much higher
   than in other reports. The adsorption behavior can be well described by
   Freundlich and pseudo-second-order models. The related possible
   mechanisms have been explored carefully.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{39}},
Pages = {{30631-30639}},
Abstract = {{Dye-bonded blocked waterborne polyurethanes were developed to
   synchronously realize coloring and finishing of textiles and improve
   colorfastness using an anthraquinone chromophore and a methyl ethyl
   ketoxime blocking agent. The number-average molecular weight of the
   dye-bonded blocked polyurethane is 2303 g mol(-1) and the polydispersity
   is 1.06, indicating a narrow molecular weight distribution. The maximum
   absorption wavelengths do not shift after the monomolecular chromophores
   are bonded to the polyurethane. The self-colored polyurethanes provide
   better centrifugal stability and water solubility than the dye-mixed
   blocked polyurethanes. The dye-bonded blocked polyurethane offers good
   thermal stability below 100 degrees C and undertakes de-blocking at
   about 150 degrees C. The covalent bonding of the anthraquinone moiety
   with the polyurethane chain and temporary blocking of the terminal
   isocyanate groups are conducive to enhancing the tinting strength and
   colorfastness of the treated cotton fabrics. The self-colored blocked
   polyurethanes with good elasticity and toughness can improve the
   recovery angle of the treated cotton up to 120 degrees, which can also
   endow the fabric with wrinkle resistance.}},

Pages = {{32819-32825}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Li adsorption on a
   graphene-C-60 nanobud system using density functional theory. Li
   adsorption on the hybrid system was enhanced compared to those using
   pure graphene and C-60. The Li adsorption energies ranged from -1.784 to
   -2.346 eV for the adsorption of a single Li atom, and from -1.905 to
   -2.229 eV for the adsorption of two Li atoms. Furthermore, adsorption
   energies were similar at most positions throughout the structure. The Li
   adsorption energy of an 18-Li adsorbed system was calculated to be
   -1.684 eV, which is significantly lower than Li-Li binding energy
   (-1.030 eV). These results suggest that Li atoms will be adsorbed
   preferentially (1) between C-60 and C-60, (2) between graphene and C-60,
   (3) on graphene, or (4) on C-60, rather than form Li clusters. As more
   Li atoms were adsorbed onto the graphene-C-60 nanobud system because of
   its improved Li adsorption capability, the metallic character of the
   system was enhanced, which was confirmed via analysis of band structure
   and electronic density of states.}},

Abstract = {{Aerospace radar operation requires robust target detection in the
   presence of strong ground clutter returns. Space-time adaptive
   processing (STAP) is a leading approach to cull weak target signals from
   a strong clutter background. A scene comprised of heterogeneous clutter
   degrades typical STAP implementation by corrupting training data,
   thereby leading to covariance estimation error, corresponding adaptive
   clutter filter mismatch, and loss of detection performance. In the
   knowledge-aided parametric covariance estimation (KAPE) method, the
   processor estimates the parameters of a validated clutter covariance
   model to tailor the clutter filter response to rapid changes in
   heterogeneous clutter environments. Computational burden and array
   manifold estimation, given antenna complex gain errors, are two primary
   concerns when implementing KAPE. This paper develops and characterizes
   an enhanced KAPE (E-KAPE) approach. Specifically, we develop a
   computationally efficient implementation via application of Gram-Schmidt
   orthonormalization to the modeled clutter manifold and discuss an
   iterative approach to estimate complex gain errors from
   channel-to-channel, leading to substantial improvement in model-based
   clutter cancellation potential. For the specific simulation results
   shown, we find a 9-dB improvement in signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio loss for our proposed approach relative to the original KAPE
   method. Furthermore, for these cases, we show that our E-KAPE method
   outperforms conventional STAP algorithms in the presence of homogeneous
   and heterogeneous clutter.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{By simultaneously transmitting multiple waveforms, a multiple-input,
   multiple-output (MIMO) radar retains transmit degrees of freedom, but
   the range-sidelobe performance will be degraded by the cross-correlation
   between waveforms. Techniques for providing low sidelobes are required
   for many MIMO radar applications such as MIMO synthetic aperture radar.
   This paper presents a new mismatched-filtering approach for designing
   optimal filters that minimize the integrated sidelobe ratio for MIMO
   radar. Unlike other approaches presented in the literature, this new
   method jointly applies pulse compression and spatial beamforming, which
   allows improved sidelobe control compared to techniques that apply these

   Microtubule-Dependent Mechanism}},
Journal = {{THERANOSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{656-666}},
Abstract = {{Noscapine is an orally administrable drug used worldwide for cough
   suppression and has recently been demonstrated to disrupt microtubule
   dynamics and possess anticancer activity. However, the molecular
   mechanisms regulating noscapine activity remain poorly defined. Here we
   demonstrate that cylindromatosis (CYLD), a microtubule-associated tumor
   suppressor protein, modulates the activity of noscapine both in cell
   lines and in primary cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Flow
   cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy reveal that CYLD increases
   the ability of noscapine to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis.
   Examination of cellular microtubules as well as in vitro assembled
   microtubules shows that CYLD enhances the effect of noscapine on
   microtubule polymerization. Microtubule cosedimentation and fluorescence
   titration assays further reveal that CYLD interacts with microtubule
   outer surface and promotes noscapine binding to microtubules. These
   findings thus demonstrate CYLD as a critical regulator of noscapine
   activity and have important implications for ALL treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomedicine is an interdisciplinary field of research at the interface
   of science, engineering, and medicine, with broad clinical applications
   ranging from molecular imaging to medical diagnostics, targeted therapy,
   and image-guided surgery. Despite major advances during the past 20
   years, there are still major fundamental and technical barriers that
   need to be understood and overcome. In particular, the complex behaviors
   of nanoparticles under physiological conditions are poorly understood,
   and detailed kinetic and thermodynamic principles are still not
   available to guide the rational design and development of nanoparticle
   agents. Here we discuss the interactions of nanoparticles with proteins,
   cells, tissues, and organs from a quantitative physical chemistry point
   of view. We also discuss insights and strategies on how to minimize
   nonspecific protein binding, how to design multistage and activatable
   nanostructures for improved drug delivery, and how to use the enhanced
   permeability and retention effect to deliver imaging agents for
   image-guided cancer surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Analogous to the way the Human Genome Project advanced an array of
   biological sciences by mapping the human genome, the Materials Genome
   Initiative aims to enhance our understanding of the fundamentals of
   materials science by providing the information we need to accelerate the
   development of new materials. This approach is particularly applicable
   to recently developed classes of nanoporous materials, such as
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are synthesized from a limited
   set of molecular building blocks that can be combined to generate a very
   large number of different structures. In this Perspective, we illustrate
   how a materials genome approach can be used to search for
   high-performance adsorbent materials to store natural gas in a vehicular
   fuel tank. Drawing upon recent reports of large databases of existing
   and predicted nanoporous materials generated in silico, we have
   collected and compared on a consistent basis the methane uptake in over
   650 000 materials based on the results of molecular simulation. The data
   that we have collected provide candidate structures for synthesis,
   reveal relationships between structural characteristics and performance,
   and suggest that it may be difficult to reach the current Advanced
   Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) target for natural gas storage.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement of the specific capacitance in electrochemical double layer
   capacitors (EDLCs) is of high interest due to the ever increasing demand
   for high power density energy storage devices. Zeolite templated carbon
   (ZTC) is a promising EDLC electrode material with large specific surface
   area and straight, ordered well-defined micropores. In this study, ZTC
   samples were synthesized,using a low pressure chemical vapor deposition
   (LP CVD) of carbon on sacrificial zeolite Y powder using acetylene gas
   as a precursor. We demonstrate for the first time how various
   post-treatments of the produced samples can affect the ZTC
   microstructure and porosity and how such modifications may significantly
   improve electrochemical performance characteristics of the ZTC-based
   EDLC electrodes. The effects of CO2 activation, ball milling and high
   temperature annealing process were systematically studied. The best
   performing samples achieved very large capacitance of over 240 Fg(-1) at
   1 mVs(-1) in 1 M solution of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in
   acetonitrile and stable performance in symmetric EDLC devices with no
   noticeable degradation for over 20,000 cycles at a very high current

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Bone metastasis is a frequent and life-threatening complication of
   breast cancer. The molecular mechanisms supporting the establishment of
   breast cancer cells in the skeleton are still not fully understood,
   which may be attributed to the lack of suitable models that interrogate
   interactions between human breast cancer cells and the bone
   microenvironment. Although it is well-known that integrins mediate
   adhesion of malignant cells to bone extracellular matrix, their role
   during bone colonization remains unclear. Here, the role of beta 1
   integrins in bone colonization was investigated using tissue-engineered
   humanized in vitro and in vivo bone models. In vitro, bone-metastatic
   breast cancer cells with suppressed integrin beta 1 expression showed
   reduced attachment, spreading, and migration within human bone matrix
   compared to control cells. Cell proliferation in vitro was not affected
   by beta 1 integrin knockdown, yet tumor growth in vivo within humanized
   bone microenvironments was significantly inhibited upon beta 1 integrin
   suppression, as revealed by quantitative in/ex vivo fluorescence imaging
   and histological analysis. Tumor cells invaded bone marrow spaces in the
   humanized bone and formed osteolytic lesions; osteoclastic bone
   resorption was, however, not reduced by beta 1 integrin knockdown. Taken
   together, we demonstrate that beta 1 integrins have a pivotal role in
   bone colonization using unique tissue-engineered humanized bone models.}},

Title = {{The Post-Disaster Debris Clearance Problem Under Incomplete Information}},
Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-85}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Debris management is one of the most time consuming and complicated
   activities among post-disaster operations. Debris clearance is aimed at
   pushing the debris to the sides of the roads so that relief distribution
   and search-and-rescue operations can be maintained in a timely manner.
   Given the limited resources, uncertainty, and urgency during disaster
   response, efficient and effective planning of debris clearance to
   achieve connectivity between relief demand and supply is important. In
   this paper, we define the stochastic debris clearance problem (SDCP),
   which captures post-disaster situations where the limited information on
   the debris amounts along the roads is updated as clearance activities
   proceed. The main decision in SDCP is to determine a sequence of roads
   to clear in each period such that benefit accrued by satisfying relief
   demand is maximized. To solve SDCP to optimality, we develop a partially
   observable Markov decision process model. We then propose a heuristic
   based on a continuous-time approximation, and we further reduce the
   computational burden by applying a limited look ahead on the search tree
   and heuristic pruning. The performance of these approaches is tested on
   randomly generated instances that reflect various geographical and
   information settings, and instances based on a real-world earthquake
   scenario. The results of these experiments underline the importance of
   applying a stochastic approach and indicate significant improvements
   over heuristics that mimic the current practice for debris clearance.}},

Abstract = {{In revenue management research and practice, demand models are used that
   describe how demand for a seller's products depends on the decisions,
   such as prices, of that seller. Even in settings where the demand for a
   seller's products also depends on decisions of other sellers, the models
   often do not explicitly account for such decisions. It has been
   conjectured in the revenue management literature that such monopoly
   models may incorporate the effects of competition, because the parameter
   estimates of the monopoly models are based on data collected in the
   presence of competition. In this paper we take a closer look at such a
   setting to investigate the behavior of parameter estimates and decisions
   if monopoly models are used in the presence of competition. We consider
   repeated pricing games in which two competing sellers use mathematical
   models to choose the prices of their products. Over the sequence of
   games, each seller attempts to estimate the values of the parameters of
   a demand model that expresses demand as a function only of its own price
   using data comprised only of its own past prices and demand
   realizations. We analyze the behavior of the sellers' parameter
   estimates and prices under various assumptions regarding the sellers'
   knowledge and estimation procedures, and we identify situations in which
   (a) the sellers' prices converge to the Nash equilibrium associated with
   knowledge of the correct demand model, (b) the sellers' prices converge
   to the cooperative solution, and (c) the sellers' prices have many
   potential limit points that are neither the Nash equilibrium nor the
   cooperative solution and that depend on the initial conditions. We
   compare the sellers' revenues at potential limit prices with their
   revenues at the Nash equilibrium and the cooperative solution, and we
   show that it is possible for sellers to be better off when using a
   monopoly model than at the Nash equilibrium.}},

   hybrid framework with a 3,6-c 2-nodal topology. The multiple
   coordination system originated from the branching out carboxylate groups
   in TCBA ligands results in the formation of the multi-stranded helical
   chains in the high-dimensional metal-organic frameworks of complexes
   1-3. The thermal stabilities of complexes 1-3, the photophysical
   properties of complexes 1 and 2 and the magnetic properties of complex 3

   an interesting partial spin-crossover has been observed.}},

Abstract = {{Most biological hairy adhesive systems involved in locomotion rely on
   spatula-shaped terminal elements, whose operation has been actively
   studied during the last decade. However, though functional principles
   underlying their amazing performance are now well understood, due to
   technical difficulties in manufacturing the complex structure of
   hierarchical spatulate systems, a biomimetic surface structure featuring
   true shear-induced dynamic attachment still remains elusive. To try
   bridging this gap, a novel method of manufacturing gecko-like attachment
   surfaces is devised based on a laser-micromachining technology. This
   method overcomes the inherent disadvantages of photolithography
   techniques and opens wide perspectives for future production of
   gecko-like attachment systems. Advanced smart-performance surfaces
   featuring thin-film-based hierarchical shear-activated elements are
   fabricated and found capable of generating friction force of several
   tens of times the contact load, which makes a significant step forward
   towards a true gecko-like adhesive.}},

   storage and reduction}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2478-2485}},
Abstract = {{The idea of rational design of perovskite catalysts for NOx storage and
   reduction (NSR) starts from DFT studies on Sr-doped LaMnO3 (001) plane
   models: a Mn-terminated plane (Mn-ter) has a higher activity than La- or
   Sr-ter planes; the number of A-site defects increases when Sr is doped
   on the surface; O-vacancy formation energies for both La- and Mn-ter
   gradually decrease with increased Sr loading, and the values for La-ter
   are always larger than for Mn-ter with the same Sr loading, indicating
   that the O-vacancy formation is facile on Mn-ter with Sr-doping. This
   model yields the highest reactivity for oxidation and the lowest energy
   barrier for O-vacancy formation. A surface tuning method for
   La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 is introduced. With the exception of the promotion of
   surface area and pore volume, the ratio of Sr/La and the number of
   surface-active oxygen atoms and Mn4+ cations exposed on the outermost
   layers are improved with an increased contact time between the raw
   materials and dilute HNO3. However, overtreatment leads to a less stable
   phase of MnO2 with a high reducibility but significantly restrained NOx
   adsorption. NSR performances under lean-burn/fuel-rich cycles are
   measured, and the results correspond well with the NO adsorption or
   oxidation behaviors and DFT calculations.}},

Abstract = {{La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) is considered a promising electrolyte
   material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs)
   because of its high ionic conductivity. However, a main challenge in the
   application of LSGM is how to fabricate dense and thin LSGM membranes on
   electrode substrates at relatively low temperature (it is difficult to
   sinter LSGM to full density below 1500 degrees C). In this study, we
   report our findings on the preparation of thin LSGM electrolyte
   membranes using the low-cost atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process.
   The phase composition, microstructure, and ionic conductivity of LSGM
   membranes deposited on an anode substrate depend sensitively on the
   particle size of LSGM powders because gallium (Ga) may evaporate during
   the APS process. When the particle size is <30 mm, Ga evaporation
   increases rapidly with the decrease in particle size, which may
   dramatically reduce the ionic conductivity of the LSGM deposits. For
   example, the ionic conductivity of an LSGM deposit was only similar to
   4.2\% of the bulk conductivity, even though the deposits may be well
   bonded (with >80\% inter-lamellar bonding ratio), as referred from the
   thermal conductivity measurement of the LSGM deposit (>80\% of the bulk
   thermal conductivity). Using LSGM powders with particle sizes >30 mu m,
   we have fabricated LSGM membranes having ionic conductivity of similar
   to 0.075 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, similar to 78\% of the bulk value.
   Test cells based on plasma sprayed LSGM electrolyte membranes show
   excellent performance at 600-800 degrees C, suggesting that atmospheric
   plasma spraying is a promising approach for large-scale manufacturing of
   high-performance IT-SOFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Multiferroic ErMn2O5 nanorods have been synthesized via a

   natural surfactant (Arabic gum) has been utilized as a template to
   prepare ErMn2O5 nanorods with a controllable morphology and size (i.e.,
   nanorods with various lengths and basically invariable diameter).
   ErMn2O5 nanorods show strong size-dependent magnetic properties that
   correlate with: (a) a critical length for magnetization, and (b)
   recognizable divagation between FC and ZFC curves at low temperature.
   The former could be ascribed to the competition between surface strain
   and uncompensated spin at the surface, and the latter to Er
   antiferromagnetic ordering.}},

Title = {{Tuning the painter's palette: subtle steric effects on spectra and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{3211-3218}},
Abstract = {{A series of vibrantly coloured p-conjugated electrochromic polymers
   (ECPs) were designed and synthesized with the goal of extracting
   structure-property relationships from subtle changes in steric strain or
   relaxation. These are soluble all donor, electron rich, alternating
   polymers based on repeat units of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT),
   3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT), and an acyclic dioxythiophene
   (AcDOT) in varying combinations to tune steric interactions and the
   subsequent optical absorption for fine colour control. Two families of
   polymers were formed where ProDOT(2)-EDOT, ProDOT-EDOT, and
   ProDOT(2)-EDOT2 constitute new shades of blues while AcDOT2-ProDOT,
   AcDOT-ProDOT, and AcDOT-EDOT yield new hues of magentas with the
   homopolymers of ProDOT and AcDOT and the copolymer AcDOT2-EDOT2 serving
   as comparisons. The polymers were synthesized using direct
   (hetero)-arylation polymerization. Examinations of the optoelectronic
   properties via cyclic voltammetry, spectro-electrochemistry, and
   colorimetry show that by subtly varying the level of steric relaxation
   or strain in the form of EDOT or AcDOT content, lower or higher energy
   absorption transitions are produced respectively. This increase in
   relaxation or strain allows more short or long wavelength light to
   transmit, giving new shades of blues or magentas respectively. Since
   these are all donating polymers, they exhibit changes in contrast no
   less than 70\% at the lambda(max) with the exception of AcDOT-EDOT. The
   most desirable electrochromic properties were achieved with
   ProDOT(2)-EDOT2 and AcDOT2-ProDOT, with band gaps (E-g) and neutral
   state L{*}a{*}b{*} colour values (-a{*} and +a{*} correspond to green
   and red and -b{*} and +b{*} correspond to blue and yellow respectively
   and L{*} represents the lightness) of 1.74 eV, 37, 12, -63 and 2.01 eV,
   56, 59, -16 respectively. The highly transmissive oxidized state colour
   values for ProDOT(2)-EDOT2 and AcDOT2-ProDOT are 92, -3, -3 and 91, -2,
   -1 respectively. These structure-property relationships grant a greater
   ability to tune light absorption across the visible, with colour
   properties similar to ECPs made through other methods without using
   donor-acceptor effects. This all donor steric tuning method leads to
   considerably higher levels of transparency when the polymers are fully
   oxidized.}},

Abstract = {{We fabricated monolayer coatings of a silver nanocube aggregation to
   create a step-wise optical strip by applying different surface pressures
   during slow Langmuir-Blodgett deposition. The varying amount of randomly
   distributed nanocube aggregates with different surface coverages in
   gradient manner due to changes in surface pressure allows for continuous
   control of the polarization sensitive absorption of the incoming light
   over a broad optical spectrum. Optical characterization under total
   internal reflection conditions combined with electromagnetic simulations
   reveal that the broadband light absorption depends on the relative
   orientation of the nanoparticles to the polarization of the incoming
   light. By using computer simulations, we found that the electric field
   vector of the s-polarized light interacts with the different types of
   silver nanocube aggregations to excite different plasmonic resonances.
   The s-polarization shows dramatic changes of the plasmonic resonances at
   different angles of incidence (shift of 64 nm per 10 degrees angle of
   incidence). With a low surface nanocube coverage (from 5\% to 20\%), we
   observed a polarization-selective high absorption of 80\% (with an
   average 75\%) of the incoming light over a broad optical range in the
   visible region from 400 nm to 700 nm. This large-area gradient material
   with location-dependent optical properties can be of particular interest
   for broadband light absorption, phase-sensitive sensors, and imaging.}},

Title = {{A critical evaluation of proxy methods used to estimate the acidity of

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2775-2790}},
Abstract = {{Given significant challenges with available measurements of aerosol
   acidity, proxy methods are frequently used to estimate the acidity of
   atmospheric particles. In this study, four of the most common aerosol
   acidity proxies are evaluated and compared: (1) the ion balance method,
   (2) the molar ratio method, (3) thermodynamic equilibrium models, and
   (4) the phase partitioning of ammonia. All methods are evaluated against
   predictions of thermodynamic models and against direct observations of
   aerosol-gas equilibrium partitioning acquired in Mexico City during the
   Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Objectives (MILAGRO)
   study. The ion balance and molar ratio methods assume that any deficit
   in inorganic cations relative to anions is due to the presence of H+ and
   that a higher H+ loading and lower cation / anion ratio both correspond
   to increasingly acidic particles (i.e., lower pH). Based on the MILAGRO
   measurements, no correlation is observed between H+ levels inferred with
   the ion balance and aerosol pH predicted by the thermodynamic models and
   NH3-NH4+ partitioning. Similarly, no relationship is observed between
   the cation / anion molar ratio and predicted aerosol pH. Using only
   measured aerosol chemical composition as inputs without any constraint
   for the gas phase, the E-AIM (Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model) and
   ISORROPIA-II thermodynamic equilibrium models tend to predict aerosol pH
   levels that are inconsistent with the observed NH3-NH4+ partitioning.
   The modeled pH values from both E-AIM and ISORROPIA-II run with gas +
   aerosol inputs agreed well with the aerosol pH predicted by the phase
   partitioning of ammonia. It appears that (1) thermodynamic models
   constrained by gas + aerosol measurements and (2) the phase partitioning
   of ammonia provide the best available predictions of aerosol pH.
   Furthermore, neither the ion balance nor the molar ratio can be used as
   surrogates for aerosol pH, and previously published studies with
   conclusions based on such acidity proxies may need to be reevaluated.
   Given the significance of acidity for chemical processes in the
   atmosphere, the implications of this study are important and far
   reaching.}},

Abstract = {{Forest burning, which emits large amounts of trace gases and particulate
   matter into the atmosphere, produces great impacts on air quality and
   climate change. In this study, the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer) burned area product (MCD45A1) and GlobCover
   land-cover product were integrated to estimate the forest burned areas
   in mainland China from 2001 to 2011. The results were compared with the
   official data from China Forestry Yearbooks and China Forestry
   Statistical Yearbooks. On the national scale, the MCD45A1 data were
   comparable with the official data. However, great gaps exist between the
   MCD45A1-derived provincial and regional forest burned areas and the
   corresponding values from the Forestry Statistical Yearbooks. In
   particular, the MCD45A1-derived areas were higher than the Forestry
   Statistical Yearbooks in north-east China and significantly lower in
   south-west China. Moreover, it was indicated that the MCD45A1 algorithm
   was unsuitable for retrieving the burned areas of small forest fires.
   Nevertheless, the MCD45A1 exhibited excellent performance in retrieving
   seasonal patterns of forest fire, with high fire occurrence in spring
   and autumn. On balance, more studies are required to assess and improve
   the MCD45A1 product and more precise data on forest burned areas in

Title = {{Fire emission uncertainties and their effect on smoke dispersion

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is practiced to benefit ecosystems but the resulting
   emissions can adversely affect air quality. A better understanding of
   the uncertainties in emission estimates and how these uncertainties
   affect smoke predictions is critical for model-based decision making.
   This study examined uncertainties associated with estimating fire
   emissions and how they affected smoke concentrations downwind from a
   prescribed burn that was conducted at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida,
   US. Estimated variables used in the modelled emission calculation were
   compared with field measurements. Fuel loadings, fuel consumption and
   emission factors were simulated using Photo Series, Consume, and
   previously published values. A plume dispersion model was used to study
   the effect of uncertainty in emissions on ground concentration
   prediction. The fire emission models predicted fuel loading, fuel
   consumption and emission factor within 15\% of measurements.
   Approximately 18\% uncertainty in field measurements of PM2.5 emissions
   and 36\% uncertainty attributed to variability in emission estimating
   models resulted respectively in 20\% and 42\% ground level PM2.5
   concentration uncertainties in dispersion modelling using Daysmoke.
   Uncertainty in input emissions influences the concentrations predicted
   by the smoke dispersion model to the same degree as does the model's
   inherent uncertainty due to turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the temperature dependence of the primary factors
   determining link performance-relative intensity noise (RIN), chromatic
   dispersion (CD), and the mode partition noise (MPN) of vertical cavity
   surface emitting laser (VCSEL)-based multimode fiber (MMF) links through
   an analysis of the bit error rate performance of the links and a
   comparison with our end-to-end analytic link model. The statistical
   fluctuations of VCSEL mode power depend on VCSEL temperature and may
   lead to link failure at specific temperatures due to MPN. We, therefore,
   examined the link performance for three 150-m OM4 grade MMFs for a wide
   range of VCSEL temperatures using automated methods. MPN was found to
   remain stable over temperature for the devices studied; furthermore, RIN
   and CD were found to be the dominant factors determining the link
   performance, while MPN was found to be insignificant for the links
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Highly-stretchable piezoelectric hemispheres composed composite thin
   film nanogenerators are fabricated as a self-powered, exceptionally
   sensitive sensor for providing sensitive motion information from a human
   body. The composite films are based on the highly-ordered piezoelectric
   hemispheres embedded in a soft matrix, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and
   generate large power output up to 6 V and 0.2 mu A/cm(2) under normal
   bending force. The electrical outputs increase by stacking such
   hemispheres layer-by-layer. The strain sensitivity of the films differs
   according to the bending direction, and the high sensitivity is achieved
   by convex bending for hemisphere composite due to the strong electric
   dipole alignment. The films are attached on the surface of a wrist and
   its output voltage/current density provides the information on the wrist
   motion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cu2O microspheres were successfully encapsulated by graphene oxide (GO)
   nano-sheets and used directly as the anode material for lithium ion
   batteries. The core-shell structured Cu2O@GO composite delivered a
   reversible capacity of 458 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA
   g(-1) after 50 cycles. Even at a high charge-discharge rate of 1000 mA
   g(-1), Cu2O@GO still demonstrated a reversible capacity of 240 mA h
   g(-1) after 200 cycles, significantly higher than those of the bare Cu2O
   microspheres (37 mA h g(-1)) and GO nano-sheets (11 mA h g(-1)). The
   rate capability evaluated by the ratio of capacity at 100 mA g(-1)/1000
   mA g(-1) current density was 49\%, 25\% and 9.8\% for Cu2O@GO, bare Cu2O
   and GO, respectively. The greatly enhanced performance for GO
   nano-sheets wrapped Cu2O microspheres composite mainly resulted from the
   synergistic effect of Cu2O microspheres and GO nano-sheets core-shell
   composite: the flexible in-situ electrochemically reduced GO nano-sheet
   coating layer functioning as an efficient three dimensional (3D)
   conductive network and lithium storage active material; the Cu2O
   microsphere core functioning as a skeleton to support multilayer GO
   sheets and avoid GO nano-sheets aggregation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the growth of ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on
   nickel foam at room temperature via a cost-effective and simple process,
   oxidizing fresh nickel foam in a wet environment followed by a
   morphology transformation in a mixed alkaline and oxidative solution
   without the need for any additional nickel sources, templates, or
   surfactants. When tested as electrode for a supercapacitor, the
   Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets grown on nickel foam displayed excellent
   performance, demonstrating specific capacitance of 2384.3 F g(-1) at a
   charge and discharge current density of 1 A g(-1) and 1288.1 F g(-1) at
   5 A g(-1) with a good cycling ability (similar to 75\% of the initial
   specific capacitance remained after 3000 cycles). The excellent
   electrochemical performance is attributed to its unique nanostructures,
   which may facilitate rapid ion transport near electrode surfaces, while
   allowing facile redox reactions associated with charge storage by the
   nanosheets. The demonstrated high specific capacity and the remarkable
   rate performance of the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, together with the
   flexibility of the nickel foam substrate, make the three-dimensional
   nanostructured electrodes ideally suited for low-cost, high-performance
   supercapacitor applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting mechanical energy from our living environment is an effective
   approach for self-powered electronics. One of the key issues is how to
   extract more electricity from one mechanical motion. Here, we report a
   hybrid energy cell that consists of a single-electrode based
   triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG) and an electromagnetic generator
   (EMG), which can be utilized to simultaneously scavenge mechanical
   energy from one mechanical motion. Due to the contact/separation between
   the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film and the polyamide (PA) film, the
   S-TENG delivers an open-circuit voltage (peak to peak) of about 600 V, a
   short-circuit current of about 3.5 mu A with a largest output power of
   about 0.25 mW (power per unit mass: 0.48 mW/g), which can directly light
   up tens of commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in series. From the
   same mechanical motion, the EMG can produce an open-circuit voltage of
   about 3 V, a short-circuit current of about 1 mA with a largest output
   power of 0.58 mW (power per unit mass: 5.31 mu W/g), which can directly
   light up tens of LEDs in parallel. Moreover, the hybrid energy cell
   exhibits a better charging performance than that of S-TENG or EMG for
   charging a capacitor. This work presents a hybrid energy cell technology
   to simultaneously scavenge mechanical energy from one mechanical motion
   for self-powered electronics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, an inorganic-organic CO2 sorbent was prepared by
   immobilizing tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) onto acid-modified
   nanosepiolite, a low cost and widely available clay. Nanosepiolite was
   pre-modified with acid treatment to enhance its surface area, increasing
   the surface area from 103.4 to 272.45 m(2)/g. The prepared sorbents were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller)
   analysis. At the optimal TEPA loading of 60 wt.\% on the modified
   nanosepiolite, the CO2 sorption capacity reached 3.8 mmol CO2/g-sorbent
   for 1 vol.\% CO2 in N-2 along with similar to 1 vol.\% H2O at 60 degrees
   C. Studies show that the sorbent has a high CO2 adsorption rate that is
   beneficial to the reduction of CO2 capture capital costs. The polymer
   composite has the potential to be applied as a solid sorbent for capture
   of ultra-dilute CO2 from gas mixtures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We introduce a single-electrode-based rotationary triboelectric
   nanogenerator (SR-TENG) formed by two wheels and a belt for harvesting
   mechanical energy. The fundamental working principle is studied by
   conjunction of experimental results with finite element calculation. The
   continuous discharging (CD) mode and the instantaneous discharging (ID)
   mode have been demonstrated for the SR-TENG. The systematical
   experiments indicate that the short-circuit current increases with the
   rotating speed for SR-TENG with CD mode, but the open-circuit voltage
   maintains constant. The short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage
   decrease nearly linearly with the friction contact area, which provides
   an application as a self-powered surface area sensor of transmission
   wheel and gear. For SR-TENG with ID mode, the electric outputs are
   greatly enhances. The current peak is about 20 mu A at variation
   rotating speeds even if the external load is 10 M Omega, which is 33
   times higher than that of the SR-TENG with CD mode without external
   load. The SR-TENG with ID mode has also been demonstrated as a
   self-powered misalignment sensor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{436-462}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The development of internet of things and the related sensor technology
   have been a key driving force for the rapid development of industry and
   information technology. The requirement of wireless, sustainable and
   independent operation is becoming increasingly important for sensor
   networks that currently could include thousands even to millions of
   sensor nodes with different functionalities. For these purposes,
   developing technologies of self-powered sensors that can utilize the
   ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves is highly
   desirable and mandatory. The realization of self-powered sensors
   generally has two approaches: the first approach is to develop
   environmental energy harvesting devices for, driving the traditional
   sensors; the other is to develop a new category of sensors -
   self-powered active sensors - that can actively generate electrical
   signal itself as a response to a stimulation/triggering from the ambient
   environment. The recent invention and intensive development of
   triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new technology for mechanical
   energy harvesting can be utilized as self-powered active mechanical
   sensors, because the parameters (magnitude, frequency, number of
   periods, etc.) of the generated electrical signal are directly
   determined by input mechanical behaviors. In this review paper, we first
   briefly introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including the four basic
   working modes. Then, the most updated progress of developing TENGs as
   self-powered active sensors is reviewed. TENGs with different working
   modes and rationally designed structures have been developed as
   self-powered active sensors for a variety of mechanical motions,
   including pressure change, physical touching, vibrations, acoustic
   waves, linear displacement, rotation, tracking of moving objects, and
   acceleration detection. Through combining the open-circuit voltage and
   the short-circuit current, the detection of both static and dynamic
   processes has been enabled. The integration of individual sensor
   elements into arrays or matrixes helps to realize the mapping or
   parallel detection for multiple points. On the other hand, the
   relationship between the amplitude of TENG-generated electrical signal
   and the chemical state of its triboelectric surface enables TENGs to
   function as self-powered active chemical sensors. Through continuous
   research on the TENG-based self-powered active sensors in the coming
   years to further improve the sensitivity and realize the self-powered
   operation for the entire sensor node systems, they will soon have broad
   applications in touch screens, electronic skins, healthcare,
   environmental/infrastructure monitoring, national security, and more.

Abstract = {{Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology to supply
   deionized water as liquid coolant for the thermal management in
   microelectronics. Graphene has been demonstrated as a promising
   candidate for CDI electrode. However, the performance of current
   graphene-based CD! is far below expectation due to the limited specific
   surface area (SSA) and electrical conductivity of the chemically reduced
   graphene. Here we presented a KOH-activated graphene that has ultrahigh
   SSA of 3513 m(2)/g and electrical conductivity of 104 S/m. With improved
   materials properties, an ultrahigh electrosorption capacity of 11.86
   mg/g and a significant adsorption rate of 20 min are achieved. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Phase transition of active electrode materials for pseudocapacitors
   always plays a pivotal role during the energy storage/release process.
   Here, large-scale hybrid CoCO3/CoO nanostructure arrays were obtained on
   carbon fiber paper substrate in a mild environment and tested as
   pseudo-capacitor electrode. After several cycles' activity, the
   as-prepared electrodes exhibited good energy storage performance with
   maximum specific capacitance of 0.77 F/cm(2) in area and 510 F/g in gram
   at a discharge current of 1 A/g, and 82\% of the capacity is retained
   when the discharge current increased to be 10 A/g from 0.2 A/g,
   indicating high power capability. Most interestingly, the electrode
   showed excellent cycling durability with gradually increased capacitance
   along with cyclic voltammetry at first 5,000 cycles and then maintained
   at least more than other 15,000 cycles. The initial phase transition of
   CoCO3/CoO to Co(OH)(2)/CoO induced by alkaline electrolyte was
   demonstrated to be the critical factor for the capacitance enhancement.
   The phase transition before and after long cycles was discussed through
   ex-situ X-ray diffraction, Raman and high resolution transmission
   electron microscope analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Parallel Framework for Dimensionality Reduction of Large-Scale Datasets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction refers to a set of mathematical techniques used
   to reduce complexity of the original high-dimensional data, while
   preserving its selected properties. Improvements in simulation
   strategies and experimental data collection methods are resulting in a
   deluge of heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, which often makes
   dimensionality reduction the only viable way to gain qualitative and
   quantitative understanding of the data. However, existing dimensionality
   reduction software often does not scale to datasets arising in real-life
   applications, which may consist of thousands of points with millions of
   dimensions. In this paper, we propose a parallel framework for
   dimensionality reduction of large-scale data. We identify key components
   underlying the spectral dimensionality reduction techniques, and propose
   their efficient parallel implementation. We show that the resulting
   framework can be used to process datasets consisting of millions of
   points when executed on a 16,000-core cluster, which is beyond the reach
   of currently available methods. To further demonstrate applicability of
   our framework we perform dimensionality reduction of 75,000 images
   representing morphology evolution during manufacturing of organic solar
   cells in order to identify how processing parameters affect morphology
   evolution.}},

Title = {{Photo-induced bending in a light-activated polymer laminated composite}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2673-2682}},
Abstract = {{Light activated polymers (LAPs) have attracted increasing attention
   since these materials change their shape and/or behavior in response to
   light exposure, which serves as an instant, remote and precisely
   controllable stimulus that enables non-contact control of the material
   shape and behavior through simple variation in light intensity,
   wavelength and spatially controlled exposure. These features distinguish
   LAPs from other active polymers triggered by other stimuli such as heat,
   electrical field or humidity. Previous examples have resulted in
   demonstrations in applications such as surface patterning, photo-induced
   shape memory behavior, and photo-origami. However, in many of these
   applications, an undesirable limitation has been the requirement to
   apply and maintain an external load during light irradiation. In this
   paper, a laminated structure is introduced to provide a pre-programmed
   stress field, which is then used for photo-induced deformation. This
   laminated structure is fabricated by bonding a stretched elastomer
   (NOA65) sheet between two LAP layers. Releasing the elastomer causes
   contraction and introduces a compressive stress in the LAPs, which are
   relaxed optically to trigger the desired deformation. A theoretical
   model is developed to quantitatively examine the laminated composite
   system, allowing exploration of the design space and optimum design of
   the laminate.}},

Title = {{Kerb and urban increment of highly time-resolved trace elements in PM10,

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{2367-2386}},
Abstract = {{Ambient concentrations of trace elements with 2 h time resolution were
   measured in PM10-2.5, PM2.5-1.0 and PM1.0-0.3 size ranges at kerbside,
   urban background and rural sites in London during winter 2012. Samples
   were collected using rotating drum impactors (RDIs) and subsequently
   analysed with synchrotron radiation-induced X-ray fluorescence
   spectrometry (SR-XRF). Quantification of kerb and urban increments
   (defined as kerb-to-urban and urban-to-rural concentration ratios,
   respectively), and assessment of diurnal and weekly variability provided
   insight into sources governing urban air quality and the effects of
   urban microenvironments on human exposure. Traffic-related elements
   yielded the highest kerb increments, with values in the range of 10.4 to
   16.6 for SW winds (3.3-6.9 for NE) observed for elements influenced by
   brake wear (e.g. Cu, Sb, Ba) and 5.7 to 8.2 for SW (2.6-3.0 for NE) for
   other traffic-related processes (e.g. Cr, Fe, Zn). Kerb increments for
   these elements were highest in the PM10-2.5 mass fraction, roughly twice
   that of the PM1.0-0.3 fraction. These elements also showed the highest
   urban increments (similar to 3.0), although no difference was observed
   between brake wear and other traffic-related elements. All elements
   influenced by traffic exhibited higher concentrations during morning and
   evening rush hours, and on weekdays compared to weekends, with the
   strongest trends observed at the kerbside site, and additionally
   enhanced by winds coming directly from the road, consistent with street
   canyon effects. Elements related to mineral dust (e.g. Al, Si, Ca, Sr)
   showed significant influences from traffic-induced resuspension, as
   evidenced by moderate kerb (3.4-5.4 for SW, 1.7-2.3 for NE) and urban
   (similar to 2) increments and increased concentrations during peak
   traffic flow. Elements related to regional transport showed no
   significant enhancement at kerb or urban sites, with the exception of
   PM10-2.5 sea salt (factor of up to 2), which may be influenced by
   traffic-induced resuspension of sea and/or road salt. Heavy-duty
   vehicles appeared to have a larger effect than passenger vehicles on the
   concentrations of all elements influenced by resuspension (including sea
   salt) and wearing processes. Trace element concentrations in London were
   influenced by both local and regional sources, with coarse and
   intermediate fractions dominated by traffic-induced resuspension and
   wearing processes and fine particles influenced by regional transport.}},

Title = {{Generalized periodic surface model and its application in designing
   fibrous porous media}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{7-36}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Fibrous porous media have a wide variety of applications in
   insulation, filtration, acoustics, sensing, and actuation. To design
   such materials, computational modeling methods are needed to engineer
   the properties systematically. There is a lack of efficient approaches
   to build and modify those complex structures in computers. The paper
   aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors generalize a
   previously developed periodic surface (PS) model so that the detailed
   shapes of fibers in porous media can be modeled. Because of its periodic
   and implicit nature, the generalized PS model is able to efficiently
   construct the three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) of
   randomly distributed fibers. A physics-based empirical force field
   method is also developed to model the fiber bending and deformation.
   Findings - Integrated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis
   tools, the proposed approach enables simulation-based design of fibrous
   porous media.
   Research limitations/implications - In the future, the authors will
   investigate robust approaches to export meshes of PS models directly to

Abstract = {{A circularly polarized radio frequency identification (RFID) reader
   antenna is presented for worldwide ultra-high frequency (UHF)
   applications. The antenna is composed of two coin-shaped patches, a
   ring-shaped strip, and a suspended feeding strip with open-circuited
   termination. The measurements show that the antenna has an impedance
   bandwidth (s(11) < -21 dB) of 22.4\% (768-962 MHz) and a stable gain
   with a peak value of 9.8 dBic. Moreover, it is immune to polarization
   mismatch with a 3-dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth of 15.9\% (816-957 MHz)
   and a 3-dB AR beamwidth of more than 66 degrees. The proposed antenna
   can be a candidate for universal RFID readers at the UHF band of 840-955
   MHz. Due to the fact that the square holes in the center of the
   coin-shaped patches can embed one additional small antenna, the proposed
   antenna has the potential to be a dual-or tri-band combined RFID reader
   antenna, spanning both the conventional UHF and the ISM band of 2.45 or
   5.8 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{To create highly maneuverable projectiles, some physical control
   mechanism is needed that is capable of altering the projectile
   trajectory in a desired manner. The work reported here considers a small
   flow control device, termed a microspoiler system, located between the
   rear stabilizing fins of a projectile. Such a mechanism relies on the
   boundary-layer shock interaction between the projectile body, rear
   stabilizing fins, and microspoilers to provide a multiplicative effect
   on controllable forces and moments. To investigate performance of the
   microspoiler control mechanism, projectile trajectories with
   microspoilers were generated both computationally using a coupled CFD
   and rigid-body dynamic simulation and experimentally from spark range
   testing. Using this computational and experimental trajectory
   information, aerodynamic coefficients both with and without
   microspoilers were estimated and found to be in good agreement where the
   major effect of the microspoiler system is the addition of trim forces
   and moments along with a slight increase in axial forces. Additionally,
   control authority of a basic finned projectile equipped with an active
   microspoiler system is investigated for a typical direct-fire shooting
   scenario.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism in
   research on neuroscience and development because of its stereotyped
   anatomy, relevance to human biology, and ease of culture and genetic
   manipulation. The first larval stage (L1) is of particular interest in
   many biological problems, including post-embryonic developmental
   processes and developmental decision-making, such as dauer formation.
   However, L1's small size and high mobility make it difficult to
   manipulate; particularly in microfluidic chips, which have been used to
   great advantage in handling larger larvae and adult animals, small
   features are difficult to fabricate and these structures often get
   clogged easily, making the devices less robust. We have developed a
   microfluidic device to overcome these challenges and enable
   high-resolution imaging and sorting of early larval stage C. elegans via
   encapsulation in droplets of a thermosensitive hydrogel. To achieve
   precise handling of early larval stage worms, we demonstrated on-chip
   production, storage, and sorting of hydrogel droplets. We also
   demonstrated temporary immobilization of the worms within the droplets,
   allowing high-resolution imaging with minimal physiological
   perturbations. Because of the ability to array hydrogel droplets for
   handling a large number of L1 worms in a robust way, we envision that
   this platform will be widely applicable to screening in various
   developmental studies.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Cell signaling events are orchestrated by dynamic external biochemical
   cues. By rapidly perturbing cells with dynamic inputs and examining the
   output from these systems, one could study the structure and dynamic
   properties of a cellular signaling network. Conventional experimental
   techniques limit the implementation of these systematic approaches due
   to the lack of sophistication in manipulating individual cells and the
   fluid microenvironment around them; existing microfluidic technologies
   thus far are mainly targeting adherent cells. In this paper we present
   an automated platform to interrogate suspension cells with dynamic
   stimuli while simultaneously monitoring cellular responses in a
   high-throughput manner at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate the use
   of this platform in an experiment to measure Jurkat T cells in response
   to distinct dynamic patterns of stimuli; we find cells exhibit highly
   heterogeneous responses under each stimulation condition. More
   interestingly, these cells act as low-pass filters, only entrained to
   the low frequency stimulus signals. We also demonstrate that this
   platform can be easily programmed to actively generate arbitrary dynamic
   signals. We envision our platform to be useful in other contexts to
   study cellular signaling dynamics, which may be difficult using
   conventional experimental methods.}},

Abstract = {{A novel core-shell structure of Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) attached on
   poly(amic acid) (PAA) fiber has been successfully developed by facile
   coaxial electrospinning technology for the first time. The as-prepared
   PAA fiber went through imidization to prepare the Al2O3@polyimide
   (Al2O3@PI) film. The resultant films with different Al2O3 contents are
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and dynamical
   mechanical analysis. The results indicated that the Al2O3 NPs could
   uniformly decorate the surface of fibers with a diameter of about 1 mu
   m, which enhanced the thermal and mechanical properties of the
   fiber-based films. In particular, the flexible film with a high content
   of Al2O3 of 59.3 wt\% presents a high storage modulus (2.11 GPa) and
   excellent thermal stability (474 degrees C at 5\% mass loss) as well as
   superior in plane thermal conductivity of 9.66 W m(-1) K-1. Finally,
   compared with pure PI film, the Al2O3@PI fiber-based film exhibits
   excellent thermal transfer ability in light emitting diode packaging.
   Therefore, the novel Al2O3@PI fiber-based film with integrated
   properties of insulation, thermal conductivity and flexibility can be
   used for wearable electronics and power devices.}},

Title = {{A decision model for kitting and line stocking with variable operator
   walking distances}},
Journal = {{ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a decision model to
   choose between kitting and line stocking at the level of single parts,
   while taking into account the variable operator walking distances.
   Different ways of feeding assembly lines, such as kitting and line
   stocking not only have an impact on in-plant logistics flows but also
   determine the amount of stock that is available at the line. This, in
   turn, has an impact on operator walking distances during assembly.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mixed integer linear programming model
   is developed for the assignment of parts to one of both methods, and to
   be able to extensively test the model, an algorithm is created for the
   construction of representative datasets.
   Findings - Parts are often kitted because of a space constraint at the
   line, but even without a space constraint, the shorter walking distances
   might give preference to kitting. An analysis is presented that
   demonstrates how specific part characteristics influence the chances of
   a part being kitted.
   Research limitations/implications - Our research model can be extended
   to include, e.g., the study of alternative in-plant logistic designs and
   the outsourcing of kitting to a third-party logistics provider (3PL) or
   to the suppliers.
   Practical implications - The objective assignment model and the insights
   obtained from it are valuable for logistics and production engineers
   that otherwise have to rely solely on intuition. In situations with
   thousands of components, intuition mostly falls far short.
   Originality/value - First, existing models do not consider variable
   walking distances, which are shown to have a crucial impact on the
   decision. Second, the data instances created allow for a systematic
   comparison of future research in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant naturally renewable organic
   resource for biofuel production. Because of its recalcitrance to
   enzymatic degradation, pretreatment is a crucial step before hydrolysis
   of the feedstock. A variety of pretreatment methods have been developed
   and intensively studied to achieve optimal yield without imposing
   significant adverse impact on the environment. Herein, we present a
   novel chemical pretreatment method using substituted heterocycles with
   low temperature and short residence time requirements. 1-Methylimidazole
   (MI) is a precursor to some imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In this
   study, its potential utilization as a biomass pretreatment agent is
   being investigated for the first time. At mild conditions, such as 25
   degrees C for 5 min at ambient pressure, a substantial increase in the
   hydrolysis rate throughout the entire course of conversion for cellulose
   substrate was obtained. Furthermore, the pretreatment effectiveness of
   MI on both untreated and steam-exploded lignocellulosic biomass
   including loblolly pine, switchgrass, and sugarcane bagasse has been
   studied and MI was found to be an efficient delignifier. Remarkable rate
   enhancement was also observed for the non-woody lignocellulosic
   substrates after a short period of MI pretreatment at ambient
   conditions. The mechanism of MI pretreatment is explored through
   analysis of cellulose physical properties including crystallinity index,
   degree of polymerization, accessibility, and lignin dissolution
   quantification. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{Technology holds promise in terms of providing support to older adults.
   To date, there have been limited robust systematic efforts to evaluate
   the psychosocial benefits of technology for older people and identify
   factors that influence both the usability and uptake of technology
   systems. In response to these issues, we developed the Personal Reminder
   Information and Social Management System (PRISM), a software application
   designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory,
   knowledge about topics, leisure activities and access to resources. This
   trail is evaluating the impact of access to the PRISM system on outcomes
   such as social isolation, social support and connectivity. This paper
   reports on the approach used to design the PRISM system, study design,
   methodology and baseline data for the trial. The trial is multi-site
   randomized field trial. PRISM is being compared to a Binder condition
   where participants received a binder that contained content similar to
   that found on PRISM. The sample includes 300 older adults, aged 65-98
   years, who lived alone and at risk for being isolated. The primary
   outcome measures for the trial include indices of social isolation and
   support and well-being. Secondary outcomes measures include indices of
   computer proficiency, technology uptake and attitudes towards
   technology. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12 months
   post-randomization. The results of this study will yield important
   information about the potential value of technology for older adults.
   The study also demonstrates how a user-centered iterative design
   approach can be incorporated into the design and evaluation of an
   intervention protocol. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Winds in the thermosphere are highly important for transporting mass,
   momentum, and energy over the globe. In the high-latitude region,
   observations show that ion and neutral motions are strongly coupled when
   the aurora is present but the coupling is less evident when there is no
   aurora. In this study, we investigate the ability of the Global
   Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) to simulate the mesoscale wind
   structure over Alaska during a substorm. Thirteen distinct numerical
   simulations of a substorm event that occurred between 02:00 and 17:00
   Universal Time on 24 November 2012 have been performed. Distinct drivers
   considered include the Weimer and SuperDARN potential patterns and the
   OVATION Prime and OVATION-SME auroral models. The effects of the
   boundary between the neutral wind dynamo calculation and the
   high-latitude imposed electric potential were also considered. Neutral
   wind velocities and thermospheric temperatures measured by the Scanning
   Doppler Imager instruments located at three locations in Alaska were
   compared to GITM simulation results, and electron densities within GITM
   were compared to data from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. It
   was found that the different drivers used between multiple simulations
   lead to various amounts of momentum coupling within the simulation,
   affecting the accuracy of the modeled neutral and ion flow patterns and
   the strength of electron precipitation at high latitudes. This affirms
   that better observations of auroral precipitation and electric fields
   are required to accurately understand and consistently reproduce the
   mesoscale neutral wind flow patterns and temperature structure in the
   high-latitude thermosphere.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of our team's research efforts over the
   past eight years focusing on providing innovative solutions for
   actionable and unobtrusive home health monitoring using a common
   household device: the weighing scale. By interfacing the mechanical and
   electrical sensors available in modern digital weighing scales to
   dedicated analog front end circuits, developing a customized toolkit of
   algorithms for processing and analyzing measured signals, and conducting
   targeted human subjects studies to elucidate relationships between
   underlying physiological changes and features of the signals, we have
   opened up a combination of new potential solutions to important health
   monitoring needs; additionally, we have uncovered new scientific
   questions to address in further studies. In particular, we have focused
   on better understanding longitudinal measurements of the
   ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal - representing the cardiogenic
   reactionary forces of the body - and how the BCG can complement other
   more well-known measures of cardiovascular performance. The key
   technological challenges and barriers we have attempted to address in
   this work, as well as the scientific questions that are currently at the
   forefront of our research, are outlined and discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{We report on investigations of the stability of inverted organic solar
   cells with ZnO electron collecting interlayer that are
   solution-processed from zinc acetate (ZnAc) or diethylzinc (deZn)
   precursors. Characterization of the respective solar cells suggests that
   the two materials initially function similarly in devices, however, we
   find that devices with ZnO from the deZn precursor are more stable under
   long-term illumination and load than devices with ZnO from the ZnAc
   precursor. A dipolar phosphonic acid that reduces the ZnO work function
   also improved device performance and stability when compared with
   unmodified ZnAc-based ZnO, but was problematic for deZn-based ZnO. The
   long-term device degradation analyses shows that the improved devices
   had increased and significantly more stable open-circuit voltage and
   fill factor characteristics. Chemical analyses suggests that defects in
   the ZnO films, most likely interstitial zinc, may be responsible for the
   observed disparities in stability within organic solar cells.}},

Title = {{Meta Aircraft Flight Dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-115}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{A meta aircraft is an air vehicle composed of a set of independent
   aircraft that are connected together in flight to form a larger
   composite aircraft. This paper explores the dynamics of meta aircraft
   systems with a focus on the changes in the aircraft flight dynamic modes
   and flexible modes of the system. Specifically, when aircraft are
   connected, basic flight dynamic modes such as the phugoid, short period,
   dutch roll, spiral, and roll modes change as a function of the number of
   connected aircraft. For aircraft connected in a wing-tip-to-wing-tip
   configuration, the longitudinal modes remain largely invariant with
   respect to the number of aircraft, whereas lateral modes are variable
   for both tip-to-tail and wing-tip-to-wing-tip connection configurations.
   In addition, connected aircraft exhibit complex flexible modes that
   change based on the characteristics of the connection joint and the
   number of connected aircraft. These conclusions are reached using a
   rigid six-degree-of-freedom representation for a single aircraft, where
   aircraft are connected through a set of linear and rotational elastic
   elements modeling the connection mechanism. Aerodynamic loads from all
   lifting surfaces are computed using a nonlinear lifting-line approach to
   enable aerodynamic wake interactions between connected aircraft.}},

Title = {{Systematic Review of the Relationship between Amyloid-beta Levels and
   Measures of Transgenic Mouse Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{787-795}},
Abstract = {{Amyloid-beta (A beta) is believed to directly affect memory and learning
   in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is widely suggested that there is a
   relationship between A beta(40) and A beta(42) levels and cognitive
   performance. In order to explore the validity of this relationship, we
   performed a meta-analysis of 40 peer-reviewed, published AD transgenic
   mouse studies that quantitatively measured A beta levels in brain tissue
   after assessing cognitive performance. We examined the relationship
   between A beta levels (A beta(40), A beta(42), or the ratio of A
   beta(42) to A beta(40)) and cognitive function as measured by escape
   latency times in the Morris water maze or exploratory preference
   percentage in the novel object recognition test. Our systematic review
   examined five mouse models (Tg2576, APP, PS1, 3xTg, APP(OSK)-Tg),
   gender, and age. The overall result revealed no statistically
   significant correlation between quantified A beta levels and
   experimental measures of cognitive function. However, enough of the
   trends were of the same sign to suggest that there probably is a very
   weak qualitative trend visible only across many orders of magnitude. In
   summary, the results of the systematic review revealed that mice bred to
   show elevated levels of A beta do not perform significantly worse in
   cognitive tests than mice that do not have elevated A beta levels. Our
   results suggest two lines of inquiry: 1) A beta is a biochemical ``side
   effect{''} of the AD pathology; or 2) learning and memory deficits in AD
   are tied to the presence of qualitatively ``high{''} levels of A beta
   but are not quantitatively sensitive to the levels themselves.}},

Title = {{Input-Shaping and Model-Following Control of a Helicopter Carrying a
   Suspended Load}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-105}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{When a heavy load is suspended from a helicopter, excessive load swing
   degrades helicopter control and can result in obstacle collisions. This
   work examines the benefits of combining input-shaping and
   model-following control to improve performance when carrying a suspended
   load. Model-following control architectures are used in modern
   helicopter flight control systems to make the helicopter respond like a
   prescribed model. On its own, model-following control is ineffective
   when carrying a suspended load because excessive load swing degrades
   tracking of the prescribed model dynamics and thus control of the
   helicopter. Therefore, reducing load swing improves tracking of the
   prescribed model and increases safety and productivity. Input shaping is
   a control technique that has been used to control vibration of flexible
   machines, such as robots, satellites, and cranes. By combining input
   shaping with model-following control, helicopter payload swing is
   reduced and tracking of the prescribed model is improved. The design of
   an attitude-command flight control system that combines input-shaping
   and model-following control is illustrated using dynamic models of a
   Sikorsky S-61 helicopter. Simulation results are shown for lateral and
   longitudinal repositioning movements. These results show that applying
   input shaping to simulated pilot commands greatly improves helicopter
   performance when carrying a suspended load.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{200-212}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent works in the safety literature report several fruitful attempts
   to introduce mathematically rigorous results from systems and control
   theory to bear upon accident prevention and system safety. Previously,
   we discussed the implications on safety of the systems theoretic
   principles of coordinability and consistency, and we identified the lack
   of coordinability and/or consistency as fundamental failure modes in
   hierarchical multilevel systems. In this work, we further develop system
   safety analysis techniques based on these principles. We demonstrate
   that these principles not only provide a domain-independent vocabulary
   for expressing the results of post-mortem accident analyses, but they
   can also be applied to guide design and operational choices for accident
   prevention and system safety. We develop these ideas with the help of an
   illustrative case study. This case study represents a broad class of
   systems where operational policies and procedures of individual
   stakeholders in the system interact with physical processes such that
   new system behaviors emerge, and unanticipated safety issues arise. We
   argue, and illustrate our arguments using this case study, that the
   coordinability and consistency principles can be developed to deliver a
   threefold impact on accident analysis and prevention: firstly, these
   principles provide domain-independent procedural templates and
   vocabulary for post-mortem accident analysis. Secondly, these principles
   provide theoretical safety specifications to be met during system design
   and operation. Finally, these safety specifications can precipitate the
   formulation of a series of questions directly related to safety-oriented
   choices in the design, operation, and control of systems. (C) 2014

   throttling downstream of the cavity during the engine startup stage are
   examined in detail. Successful ignition can only be achieved with the
   aid of air throttling under the present flow conditions. As a
   consequence of the backpressurization by the throttling air, a shock
   train is generated in the isolator, which then decelerates the
   high-speed main stream, enhances the fuel mixing efficiency, and
   increases the temperature and pressure in the combustor. Chemical
   reactions are intensified and produce sufficient heat release to
   maintain a flow environment conducive to flame stabilization. A
   self-sustaining mechanism is thus established between the flow and flame
   development. Stable flames are achieved even after the deactivation of
   air throttling. The predicted pressure distribution along the entire
   flowpath agrees well with experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We consider parallel computation for Gaussian process calculations to
   overcome computational and memory constraints on the size of datasets
   that can be analyzed. Using a hybrid parallelization approach that uses
   both threading (shared memory) and message-passing (distributed memory),
   we implement the core linear algebra operations used in spatial
   statistics and Gaussian process regression in an R package called bigGP
   that relies on C and MPI. The approach divides the covariance matrix
   into blocks such that the computational load is balanced across
   processes while communication between processes is limited. The package
   provides an API enabling R programmers to implement Gaussian
   process-based methods by using the distributed linear algebra operations
   without any C or MPI coding. We illustrate the approach and software by
   analyzing an astrophysics dataset with n = 67; 275 observations.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we report the fabrication and electrochemical
   performance of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on a reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) negative electrode and a cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4)
   positive electrode. The rGO and CoMoO4 electrode materials were

   Physico-chemical characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
   field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption
   isotherm analysis were used to characterize the electrode materials. The
   rGO nanosheets and CoMoO4 nanostructures delivered a specific
   capacitance of about 168.8 and 98.34 F g(-1), respectively measured in a
   three electrode system. The rGO parallel to CoMoO4 ASC device
   demonstrated a maximum specific capacitance of 26.16 F g(-1) (at a
   current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2)), an energy density of 8.17 W h kg(-1),
   and a maximum working voltage of 1.5 V. The fabricated device possessed
   excellent capacitance retention of about 85\% after 4000 cycles (at a
   current density of 1.0 mA cm(-2)) suggesting the superior cyclic
   stability of the fabricated ASC device.}},

Abstract = {{The computer keyboard is one of the most common, reliable, accessible,
   and effective tools used for human-machine interfacing and information
   exchange. Although keyboards have been used for hundreds of years for
   advancing human civilization, studying human behavior by keystroke
   dynamics using smart keyboards remains a great challenge. Here we report
   a self-powered, non-mechanical-punching keyboard enabled by contact
   electrification between human fingers and keys, which converts
   mechanical stimuli applied to the keyboard into local electronic signals
   without applying an external power. The intelligent keyboard (IKB) can
   not only sensitively trigger a wireless alarm system once gentle finger
   tapping occurs but also trace and record typed content by detecting both
   the dynamic time intervals between and during the inputting of letters
   and the force used for each typing action. Such features hold promise
   for its use as a smart security system that can realize detection,
   alert, recording, and identification. Moreover, the IKB is able to
   identify personal characteristics from different individuals, assisted
   by the behavioral biometric of keystroke dynamics. Furthermore, the IKB
   can effectively harness typing motions for electricity to charge
   commercial electronics at arbitrary typing speeds greater than 100
   characters per min. Given the above features, the IKB can be potentially
   applied not only to self-powered electronics but also to artificial
   intelligence, cyber security, and computer or network access control.}},

Abstract = {{In comparison to in-pane sliding friction, rolling friction not only is
   likely to consume less mechanical energy but also presents high
   robustness with minimized wearing of materials. In this work, we
   introduce a highly efficient approach for harvesting mechanical energy
   based on rolling electrification and electrostatic induction, aiming at
   improving the energy conversion efficiency and device durability. The
   rolling triboelectric nanogenerator is composed of multiple steel rods
   sandwiched by two fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) thin films. The
   rolling motion of the steel rods between the FEP thin films introduces
   triboelectric charges on both surfaces and leads to the change of
   potential difference between each pair of electrodes on back of the FEP
   layer, which drives the electrons to flow in the external load. As power
   generators, each pair of output terminals works independently and
   delivers an open-circuit voltage of 425 V, and a short-circuit current
   density of 5 mA/m(2). The two output terminals can also be integrated to
   achieve an overall power density of up to 1.6 W/m(2). The impacts of
   variable structural factors were investigated for optimization of the
   output performance, and other prototypes based on rolling balls were
   developed to accommodate different types of mechanical energy sources.
   Owing to the low frictional coefficient of the rolling motion, an
   instantaneous energy conversion efficiency of up to 55\% was
   demonstrated and the high durability of the device was confirmed. This
   work presents a substantial advancement of the triboelectric
   nanogenerators toward large-scope energy harvesting and self-powered
   systems.}},

Title = {{Multiwavelength observations of Mrk 501 in 2008}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Context. Blazars are variable sources on various timescales over a broad
   energy range spanning from radio to very high energy (>100 GeV,
   hereafter VHE). Mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at TeV energies
   and has been extensively studied since its first VHE detection in 1996.
   However, most of the gamma-ray studies performed on Mrk 501 during the
   past years relate to flaring activity, when the source detection and
   characterization with the available gamma-ray instrumentation was easier
   to perform.
   Aims. Our goal is to characterize the source gamma-ray emission in
   detail, together with the radio-to-X-ray emission, during the
   non-flaring (low) activity, which is less often studied than the
   occasional flaring (high) activity.
   Methods. We organized a multiwavelength (MW) campaign on Mrk 501 between
   March and May 2008. This multi-instrument effort included the most
   sensitive VHE gamma-ray instruments in the northern hemisphere, namely
   the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes MAGIC and VERITAS, as well
   as Swift, RXTE, the F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, and other collaborations and
   instruments. This provided extensive energy and temporal coverage of Mrk
   501 throughout the entire campaign.
   Results. Mrk 501 was found to be in a low state of activity during the
   campaign, with a VHE flux in the range of 10\%-20\% of the Crab nebula
   flux. Nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected with
   various instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy
   and a tentative correlation between the X-ray and VHE fluxes. The
   broadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission
   states of the campaign can be adequately described within the
   homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model, with the (slightly)
   higher state described by an increase in the electron number density.
   Conclusions. The one-zone SSC model can adequately describe the
   broadband spectral energy distribution of the source during the two
   months covered by the MW campaign. This agrees with previous studies of
   the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring
   states. We report for the first time a tentative X-ray-to-VHE
   correlation during such a low VHE activity. Although marginally
   significant, this positive correlation between X-ray and VHE, which has
   been reported many times during flaring activity, suggests that the
   mechanisms that dominate the X-ray/VHE emission during
   non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that are
   responsible for the emission during flaring activity.}},

Title = {{Oxidation of tetracycline antibiotics induced by Fe(III) ions without

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{1255-1261}},

Abstract = {{The presence of Fe(III) ions was found to induce degradation of three
   tetracycline antibiotics (TCs), tetracycline (TFC), oxytetracycline
   (OTC) and chlorotetracycline (CTC), in aqueous solutions without light.
   The presence of Fe(III) promoted the degradation of TCs in most
   experimental pH (5.0, 7.0 and 9.0) except at pH 9.0 for CTC. Degradation
   rate constants of TTC, OTC and CTC reached maximum ((6.2 0.5) x 10-3
   h-1, (10.6 Di) x 10-3 h-1 and (15.9 0.5) x 10-3 h-1 at pH 7.0, 20 C)
   when Fe(III):TC molar ratio was 1:1, 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. Such
   metal-to-ligand ratios agreed well with the most favorable complexation
   between Fe( III) and each TC. Compared to without metals, Fe(III)
   enhanced the degradation rate of Trc, OTC and CTC by up to 20.67, 7.07
   and 2.30 times, respectively, in clean water matrix, and also promoted
   degradation of TCs in real surface water and wastewater matrices. The
   promoted degradation likely occurred via complexation of TCs and
   subsequent oxidation by Fe(III). Degradation results of CTC versus
   4-epi-CTC suggested Fe(III) likely binds to TCs' C4 dimethylamino group.
   Toxicity of the complexes evaluated using Photobacterium phosphoreum T3
   was increased after several hours of reaction, suggesting the
   transformation products may exert a stronger toxicity than parent TCs.
   This study identifies new oxidative transformation of TCs induced by
   Fe(III) ions without light irradiation, further supporting the important
   role of iron species in the environmental fate of TCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{N3084-N3093}},
Abstract = {{Copper, silver, and gold share unique properties that offer numerous
   application possibilities. For instance, low resistivity and high
   electromigration resistance make them attractive as interconnect layers
   in integrated circuits and microelectronic devices, while the optical
   properties of their nano-scale structures allow fabrication of plasmonic
   devices. Etching or patterning techniques are required in order to
   fabricate nano-structures, devices, and circuits. Although liquid or
   vapor phase techniques can be applied, plasma or glow discharge methods
   are typically invoked due to the need to generate anisotropic nanometer
   pattern sizes. Group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) form few volatile
   compounds at temperatures below 150 degrees C, which limits the
   approaches that can be used to perform etching/patterning. Halogenated
   plasmas are widely used to etch metal layers; however, the low
   volatility of Cu, Ag, and Au halides precludes low temperature
   processes. Group 11 metals form hydrides readily in plasmas containing
   hydrogen species. Despite the thermodynamic instability of these metal
   hydrides, they appear to form at low (below room) temperature and can be
   desorbed from the etching surface by ion-or photon-assisted processes.
   Similarly, methylated metal etch products can be generated with
   hydrocarbon etching plasmas. As a result, etch rates above 12 +/- 1
   nm/min can be achieved, even when polymer forming plasmas (e.g., methane
   or other hydrocarbons) are used for patterning. These simple subtractive
   plasma etching approaches offer significant advantages relative to other
   vapor phase or liquid techniques in the manufacture of nano-scale
   devices and circuits. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All

Abstract = {{A low permittivity, positive tone, polynorbornene dielectric has been
   developed that exhibits excellent lithographic and electrical
   properties. The polymer resin is a random copolymer of a norbornene
   hexafluoroalcohol (NBHFA) and a norbornene tert-butyl ester (NBTBE).
   High optical sensitivity and contrast were achieved using a chemically
   amplified solubility switching mechanism through the acid-catalyzed
   deprotection of the tert-butyl ester functionality. After developing in
   aqueous base, the film was thermally cured through a Fischer
   esterification reaction, resulting in a cross-linked permanent
   dielectric. The effect of the photoacid generator (PAG) concentration on
   the lithographic patterning and curing reactions was studied. Higher PAG
   loading was favorable for both sensitivity and dielectric constant. The
   sensitivity of a formulation was measured as low as 8.09 mJ/cm(2). The
   molar ratio of the two monomers composing the polymer was varied. A
   higher NBHFA content was favorable because it resulted in a lower
   modulus, lower shrinkage, and lower dielectric constant and loss. A
   formulation with 70 mol\% of the NBHFA had a modulus of 2.60 GPa, a
   12.2\% volume decrease during cure, and a dielectric constant of 2.23.
   The direction-dependent coefficient of thermal expansion was measured,
   and it was found that the anisotropy of the PNB films decreased with
   higher NBTBE content. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All

   studied as a function of cure temperature, epoxy crosslinker loading and
   DNQ loading. Reduced modulus measurements showed that crosslinking of
   the polymer film occurred via reaction of the polymer with DNQ. The
   final modulus of the DNQ-crosslinked film was 4.0 GPa. Swelling
   measurements for a UV exposed film showed material leaching from the
   film. Residual solvent from swelling measurements was analysed by gel
   permeation chromatography which showed the indene carboxylic acid form
   of DNQ leached out of the polymer film. The unexposed film did not
   exhibit material loss through leaching. When developed, films showed a
   decline in modulus to 2.6 GPa, likely due to the reaction of DNQ with
   the aqueous base developer forming nonreactive byproducts that did not
   contribute to crosslinking. An epoxy crosslinker was added to the
   formulation which helped crosslink the polymer film by inhibiting uptake
   of the aqueous base during developing. The epoxy inhibition of the base
   uptake was confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance, where an increase
   in epoxy loading led to a decrease in base uptake of the film during
   developing. F-19-NMR results support the DNQ-PNB crosslinking through
   esterification. Electrical characterization of the cured PNB films
   showed a relative dielectric constant of 3.65 for a DNQ and epoxy
   containing film after curing at 220 degrees C. (C) The Author(s) 2014.

Abstract = {{Above certain temperatures, untreated PVC undergoes dehydrochlorination
   to produce conjugated polyenes in the polymer backbone. This is
   accompanied by formation of color in the polymer. In order to address
   both the thermally induced dehydrochlorination process and the
   accompanying color formation the dienophilic zinc and calcium salts of
   11-maleimidoundecanoic acid (Zn11M and Call M, respectively) were
   synthesized and employed as stabilizing additives. The stabilizing
   effect of the Zn11M and Call M on PVC was studied at 170 degrees C in
   air. Evidence is presented which shows that this combination of salts
   performs a dual role of reducing both the rates of dehydrochlorination
   and formation of color in plasticized PVC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Acoustic waves carry information about their source and collect
   information about their environment as they propagate. This article
   reviews how these information-carrying and -collecting features of
   acoustic waves that travel through fluids can be exploited for remote
   sensing. In nearly all cases, modern acoustic remote sensing involves
   array-recorded sounds and array signal processing to recover
   multidimensional results. The application realm for acoustic remote
   sensing spans an impressive range of signal frequencies (10(-2) to 10(7)
   Hz) and distances (10(-2) to 10(7) m) and involves biomedical ultrasound
   imaging, nondestructive evaluation, oil and gas exploration, military
   systems, and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty monitoring. In the past two
   decades, approaches have been developed to robustly localize remote
   sources; remove noise and multipath distortion from recorded signals;
   and determine the acoustic characteristics of the environment through
   which the sound waves have traveled, even when the recorded sounds
   originate from uncooperative sources or are merely ambient noise.}},

Abstract = {{Propionibacteria are actinobacteria consisting of two principal groups:
   cutaneous and dairy. Cutaneous propionibacteria are considered primary
   pathogens to humans, whereas dairy propionibacteria are widely used in
   the food and pharmaceutical industries. Increasing attention has been
   focused on improving the performance of dairy propionibacteria for the
   production of industrially important chemicals, and significant advances
   have been made through strain engineering and process optimization in
   the production of flavor compounds, nutraceuticals, and antimicrobial
   compounds. In addition, genome sequencing of several propionibacteria
   species has been completed, deepening understanding of the metabolic and
   physiological features of these organisms. However, the metabolic
   engineering of propionibacteria still faces several challenges owing to
   the lack of efficient genome manipulation tools and the existence of
   various types of strong restriction-modification systems. The emergence
   of systems and synthetic biology provides new opportunities to overcome
   these bottlenecks. In this review, we first introduce the major species
   of propionibacteria and their properties and provide an overview of
   their functions and applications. We then discuss advances in the genome
   sequencing and metabolic engineering of these bacteria. Finally, we
   discuss systems and synthetic biology approaches for engineering

Abstract = {{In this paper, a low-cost dual-tone radio interferometric positioning
   system using a single mobile anchor is proposed to locate multiple
   targets at the same time. We name it mDRIPS. In mDRIPS, each target
   continuously transmits a dual-tone signal with its dedicated
   frequencies, and the mobile anchor receives the signals at different
   positions along its trajectory. Neither time synchronization between the
   mobile anchor and the targets nor time synchronization among the targets
   is required. We take the instability of targets clocks into
   consideration and develop an ESPRIT-type algorithm to estimate
   frequencies of each dual-tone signal. Furthermore, the time of arrival
   (TOA) of each target signal is extracted from the phase estimates of the
   received dual-tone signals. After measuring several TOAs at different
   locations along the anchor's trajectory, each target can be located.
   Since the frequency difference of the two tones of each dualtone signal
   is designed to be smaller than the channel coherence bandwidth, the same
   fading effect on these two tones can be eliminated. Moreover, the
   integer ambiguity problem due to phase wrapping is investigated, and a
   localization algorithm to deal with a simplified ambiguity problem is
   proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   mDRIPS.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1307-1320}},
Abstract = {{Radiance spectroscopy was applied to the interstitial detection of
   localized inclusions containing Au nanocages or nanorods with various
   concentrations embedded in porcine muscle phantoms. The radiance was
   quantified using a perturbation approach, which enabled the separation
   of contributions from the porcine phantom and the localized inclusion,
   with the inclusion serving as a perturbation probe of photon
   distributions in the turbid medium. Positioning the inclusion at various
   places in the phantom allowed for tracking of photons that originated
   from a light source, passed through the inclusion's location, and
   reached a detector. The inclusions with high extinction coefficients
   were able to absorb nearly all photons in the range of 650-900 nm,
   leading to a spectrally flat radiance signal. This signal could be
   converted to the relative density of photons incident on the inclusion.
   Finally, the experimentally measured quantities were expressed via the
   relative perturbation and arranged into the classical Beer-Lambert law
   that allowed one to extract the extinction coefficients of various types
   of Au nanoparticles in both the transmission and back reflection
   geometries. It was shown that the spatial variation of perturbation
   could be described as 1/r dependence, where r is the distance between
   the inclusion and the detector. Due to a larger absorption cross
   section, Au nanocages produced greater perturbations than Au nanorods of
   equal particle concentration, indicating a better suitability of Au
   nanocages as contrast agents for optical measurements in turbid media.
   Individual measurements from different inclusions were combined into
   detectability maps.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with psychiatric disorders exhibit several neurobehavioral and
   neuropsychological alterations compared to healthy controls. However,
   signature endpoints of these behavioral manifestations have not yet been
   translated into clinical tests for diagnosis and follow-up measures.
   Recently, neuroproteomic approaches have been utilized to identify
   unique signature markers indicative of these disorders. Development of
   reliable biomarkers has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis,
   classification, and monitoring of clinical responses in psychiatric
   diseases. However, the lack of biological gold standards, the evolving
   nosology of psychiatric disorders, and the complexity of the nervous
   system are among the major challenges that have hindered efforts to
   develop reliable biomarkers in the field of neuropsychiatry and drug
   abuse. While biomarkers currently have a limited role in the area of
   neuropsychiatry, several promising biomarkers have been proposed in
   conditions such as dementia, schizophrenia, depression, suicide, and
   addiction. One of the primary objectives of this review is to discuss
   the role of proteomics in the development of biomarkers specific to
   neuropsychiatry. We discuss and evaluate currently available biomarkers
   as well as those that are under research for clinical use in the future.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plasma-assisted Ag and Au subtractive etching was investigated in CH4
   plasmas at 10 degrees C. The etch rate of Ag (2962 nm/min) was higher
   than that observed for Cu (17 nm/min), while the Au etch rate (12
   nm/min) was lower than that for both Ag and Cu. Etch rates of Ag and Au
   due to pressure variation decreased as pressure increased, analogous to
   Cu etch results. However, the specific plasma conditions under which
   hydrocarbon formation occurred on Cu, Ag, and Au depended upon the metal
   being etched as a result of variation in surface chemical reactivities.
   Comparison of etch results using glass slides and Si wafers as etch
   masks, confirmed the formation of volatile etch products for Cu and Au.
   Etch product removal for Au and Cu was enhanced by UV photons, while Ag
   etching showed no effect at wavelengths > 300 nm. These studies
   demonstrated that in CH4 plasmas, chemical components in the etch
   process are most important for Cu while Ag and Au etching is more
   dependent upon physical sputtering. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{This year we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the law of mass action.
   This law is often assumed to have been ``there'' forever, but it has its
   own history, background, and a definite starting point. The law has had
   an impact on chemistry, biochemistry, biomathematics, and systems
   biology that is difficult to overestimate. It is easily recognized that
   it is the direct basis for computational enzyme kinetics, ecological
   systems models, and models for the spread of diseases. The article
   reviews the explicit and implicit role of the law of mass action in
   systems biology and reveals how the original, more general formulation
   of the law emerged one hundred years later ab initio as a very general,
   canonical representation of biological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Ni(OH)(2) coated on Ni porous films are facilely fabricated by anode
   oxidation of 3D hierarchical porous Ni films which are prepared through
   a hydrogen bubble template electro-deposition method. The highly porous

   collectors and scaffolds to in situ form a thin layer of Ni(OH)(2)
   active material. The electrochemical capacitive performances are
   investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the galvanostatic
   charge-discharge technique in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The 3D porous
   Ni(OH)(2)/Ni integrated electrodes demonstrate a much higher specific
   capacity of 828 mF cm(-2) than 126 mF cm(-2) for the smooth Ni(OH)(2)/Ni
   electrode at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The 3D porous
   Ni(OH)(2)/Ni integrated electrodes also display a good capacity
   retention of 95\% after 1000 cycles. The superior capacitive properties
   of 3D porous Ni(OH)(2)/Ni electrodes might result from the thin layer

   metallic current collector with large surface area, low contact
   resistance between Ni(OH)(2) active material and Ni current collector,
   and fast electron/ion conduction.}},

Abstract = {{Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer significant hope to tetraplegic
   and paraplegic individuals. This technology relies on extracting and
   translating motor intent to facilitate control of a computer cursor or
   to enable fine control of an external assistive device such as a
   prosthetic limb. Intracortical recording interfaces (IRIs) are critical
   components of BCIs and consist of arrays of penetrating electrodes that
   are implanted into the motor cortex of the brain. These multielectrode
   arrays (MEAs) are responsible for recording and conducting neural
   signals from local ensembles of neurons in the motor cortex with the
   high speed and spatiotemporal resolution that is required for exercising
   control of external assistive prostheses. Recent design and
   technological innovations in the field have led to significant
   improvements in BCI function. However, long-term (chronic) BCI function
   is severely compromised by short-term (acute) IRI recording failure. In
   this review, we will discuss the design and function of current IRIs. We
   will also review a host of recent advances that contribute significantly
   to our overall understanding of the cellular and molecular events that
   lead to acute recording failure of these invasive implants. We will also
   present recent improvements to IRI design and provide insights into the
   futuristic design of more chronically functional IRIs.}},

Abstract = {{Light oil from pyrolysis, which accounts for similar to 10 \% carbon
   yield of the starting biomass, is a complex aqueous product that is
   difficult to utilize and usually discarded. This work presents the
   feasibility of light oil as a sole carbon source to support the growth
   of Rhodococcus opacus (R. opacus) that in turn accumulate
   triacylglycerols as biodiesel feedstock. Two types of bacteria (R.
   opacus PD630 and DSM 1069) were selected in this study. Research results
   showed that after short adaption periods both strains can grow well on
   this complex carbon source, as proved by the consumption of oligomers
   and monomers in light oil. Lipid content by R. opacus PD630 and DSM 1069
   was observed up to 25.8 \% and 22.0 \% of cell dry weight, respectively.
   Palmitic and stearic acids were found to be the predominant fatty acids
   in these bacterial cells. In addition, the light oil-based lipid
   production can be enhanced by reducing the pH value from 7 to 4,
   especially in case of DSM 1069.}},

Abstract = {{Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were recently identified as
   having significant clinical potential in reversing beta-cell functional
   inhibition caused by inflammation, a shared precursor of Type 1 and Type
   2 diabetes. However, HDACi are highly complex and little is known of
   their direct effect on important cell secretion pathways for blood
   glucose regulation. The aims of the present study were to investigate
   the effect of HDACi on insulin secretion from beta-cells, GLP-1
   secretion from L-cells, and recombinant insulin secretion from
   engineered L-cells. The beta-cell line beta TC-tet, L-cell line GLUTag,
   or recombinant insulin-secreting L-cell lines were exposed to
   Trichostatin A for 24 h. Effects on insulin or GLP-1 mRNA, intracellular
   protein content, processing efficiency, and secretion were measured by
   real-time PCR, ELISA, and radioimmunoassay. HDACi increased secretion
   per viable cell in a dose-dependent manner for all cell types. Effects
   on mRNA levels were variable, but enhanced intracellular polypeptide
   content and secretion were comparable among cell types. Enhanced
   recombinant insulin secretion was sustained for seven days in alginate
   microencapsulated L-cells. HDACi enhances beta- and L-cell secretion
   fluxes in a way that could significantly improve blood glucose
   regulation in diabetes patients and holds potential as a novel method
   for enhancing insulin-secreting non-beta or beta-cell grafts. (C) 2014

Title = {{Colocalization of outflow segmentation and pores along the inner wall of
   Schlemm's canal}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{87-96}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{All aqueous humor draining through the conventional outflow pathway must
   cross the endothelium of Schlemm's canal (SC), likely by passing through
   micron-sized transendothelial pores. SC pores are non-uniformly
   distributed along the inner wall endothelium, but it is unclear how the
   distribution of pores relates to the non-uniform or segmental
   distribution of aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork.
   It is hypothesized that regions in the juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT)
   with higher local outflow should coincide with regions of greater inner
   wall pore density compared to JCT regions with lower outflow.
   Three pairs of non-glaucomatous human donor eyes were perfused at 8 mmHg
   with fluorescent tracer nanospheres to decorate local patterns of
   outflow segmentation through the JCT. The inner wall was stained for
   CD31 and/or vimentin and imaged en face using confocal and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). Confocal and SEM images were spatially
   registered to examine the spatial relationship between inner wall pore
   density and tracer intensity in the underlying JCT. For each eye, tracer
   intensity, pore density (n) and pore diameter (D) (for both
   transcellular ``I{''} and paracellular ``B{''} pores) were measured in
   4-7 regions of interest (ROIs; 50 x 150 mu m each). Analysis of
   covariance was used to examine the relationship between tracer intensity
   and pore density, as well as the relationship between tracer intensity
   and three pore metrics (nD, nD(2) and nD(3)) that represent the local
   hydraulic conductivity of the outflow pathway as predicted by various
   hydrodynamic models.
   Tracer intensity in the JCf correlated positively with local pore
   density when considering total pores (p = 0.044) and paracellular B
   pores on their own (p = 0.016), but not transcellular I-pores on their
   own (p = 0.54). Local hydraulic conductivity as predicted by the three
   hydrodynamic models all showed a significant positive correlation with
   tracer intensity when considering total pores and B-pores (p < 0.0015
   and p < 10(-4)) but not I-pores (p > 0.38).
   These data suggest that aqueous humor passes through micron-sized pores
   in the inner wall endothelium of SC. Paracellular B-pores appear to have
   a dominant contribution towards transendothelial filtration across the
   inner wall relative to transcellular I-pores. Impaired pore formation,
   as previously described in glaucomatous SC cells, may thereby contribute
   to greater outflow heterogeneity, outflow obstruction, and IOP elevation
   in glaucoma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Membrane actions of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 are mediated by

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 regulates osteoblasts and chondrocytes via its
   membrane-associated receptor, protein disulfide isomerase A3 (Pdia3) in
   caveolae. 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 binding to Pdia3 leads to
   phospholipase-A(2) (PLA(2))-activating protein (PLAA) activation,
   stimulating cytosolic PLA2 and resulting in prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2))
   release and PKCa activation, subsequently stimulating differentiation.
   However, how PLAA transmits the signal to cPLA(2) is unknown.
   Ca2+/Vcalmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation
   is required for PLA2 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells,
   suggesting a similar role in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-dependent signaling.
   The aim of the present study is to evaluate the roles of CaM and CaMKII
   as mediators of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-stimulated PLAA-dependent
   activation of cPLA2 and PKCa, and downstream biological effects. The
   results indicated that 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 and PLAA-peptide increased
   CaMKII activity within 9 min. Silencing Cav-1, Pdia3 or Plaa in
   osteoblasts suppressed this effect. Similarly, antibodies against Plaa
   or Pdia3 blocked 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-dependent CaMKII. Caveolae
   disruption abolished activation of CaMKII by 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 or
   PLAA. CaMKII-specific and CaM-specific inhibitors reduced cPLA2 and PKC
   activities, PGE2 release and osteoblast maturation markers in response
   to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. Camk2 alpha-silenced but not Camk2b-silenced
   osteoblasts showed comparable effects. Immunoprecipitation showed
   increased interaction of CaM and PLAA in response to 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. The results indicate that membrane actions of 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 via Pdia3 triggered the interaction between PLAA and
   CaM, leading to dissociation of CaM from caveolae, activation of CaMKII,
   and downstream PLA2 activation, and suggest that CaMKII plays a major
   role in membrane-mediated actions of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The mixing of two co-directional, initially monochromatic Rayleigh
   surface waves in an isotropic, homogeneous, and nonlinear elastic solid
   is investigated using analytical, finite element method, and
   experimental approaches. The analytical investigations show that while
   the horizontal velocity component can form a shock wave, the vertical
   velocity component can form a pulse independent of the specific ratios
   of the fundamental frequencies and amplitudes that are mixed. This
   analytical model is then used to simulate the development of the
   fundamentals, second harmonics, and the sum and difference frequency
   components over the propagation distance. The analytical model is
   further extended to include diffraction effects in the parabolic
   approximation. Finally, the frequency and amplitude ratios of the
   fundamentals are identified which provide maximum amplitudes of the
   second harmonics as well as of the sum and difference frequency
   components, to help guide effective material characterization; this
   approach should make it possible to measure the acoustic nonlinearity of
   a solid not only with the second harmonics, but also with the sum and
   difference frequency components. Results of the analytical
   investigations are then confirmed using the finite element method and
   the experimental feasibility of the proposed technique is validated for
   an aluminum specimen. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Cancerous transformation may be dependent on correlation between
   electrical disruptions in the cell membrane and mechanical disruptions
   of cytoskeleton structures. Silicon nanotube (SiNT)-based electrical
   probes, as ultra-accurate signal recorders with subcellular resolution,
   may create many opportunities for fundamental biological research and
   biomedical applications. Here, we used this technology to electrically
   monitor cellular mechanosensing. The SiNT probe was combined with an
   electrically activated glass micropipette aspiration system to achieve a
   new cancer diagnostic technique that is based on real-time correlation
   between mechanical and electrical behaviour of single cells. Our studies
   demonstrated marked changes in the electrical response following
   increases in the mechanical aspiration force in healthy cells. In
   contrast, such responses were extremely weak for malignant cells.
   Confocal microscopy results showed the impact of actin microfilament
   remodelling on the reduction of the electrical response for aspirated
   cancer cells due to the significant role of actin in modulating the ion
   channel activity in the cell membrane.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the dynamics of non-premixed flames responding to
   bulk velocity fluctuations, and compares the dynamics of the flame sheet
   position and spatially integrated heat release to a similarly excited
   premixed flame. Bulk axial or transverse excitation, in either case,
   leads to the excitation of wrinkles on the flame that propagate axially.
   Inclusion of axial diffusion in the non-premixed case, and burning
   velocity stretch sensitivity in the premixed case, cause wrinkle
   dissipation and dispersion. There are important differences in spatially
   integrated unsteady heat release dynamics between premixed and
   non-premixed flames. For general Strouhal numbers, mass burning rate
   fluctuations are the dominant contributor to non-premixed flame heat
   release fluctuations, while area fluctuations are the dominant
   contributor to premixed flame heat release fluctuations. Moreover, the
   heat release response of non-premixed flames rolls off much slower with
   frequency, O(St(-1/2)) compared to O(St(-1)) for premixed flames, and,
   hence, are more sensitive to flow perturbations than premixed flames at
   high Strouhal numbers. The asymptotic tendencies of the non-premixed
   flame, however, are largely controlled by the near burner exit region
   with high transverse gradients and, thus, are expected to be quite
   sensitive to burner exit details and finite chemistry effects. (C) 2014

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{1313-1320}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have utilized leading points concepts to explain the
   sensitivity of turbulent burning rates to fuel/oxidizer composition,
   especially in negative Markstein length mixtures. Leading point theories
   suggest that the premixed turbulent flame speed is controlled by the
   flame front characteristics at the flame brush leading edge, or, in
   other words, by the flamelets that advance farthest into the unburned
   mixture (the so-called leading points). Furthermore, several authors
   have postulated that these leading edge flamelets have an inner
   structure similar to a critically perturbed laminar flame, i.e., the
   local stretch rate approaches the extinction value, near where the
   maximum possible laminar burning velocity is reached. In order to
   investigate these hypotheses for leading points burning rates, this
   paper analyzes the flame front structure at the leading edge of
   turbulent, lean (phi = 0.31) premixed H-2/Air flames, utilizing a
   database of direct numerical simulations (DNS) previously reported by
   Aspden et al. (2011). We calculate local flame front curvature,
   thickness, and burning velocity and compare these values to reference
   quantities obtained from stretched laminar flames computed numerically
   in different geometrical configurations (a counterflow twin flame, a
   tubular counterflow flame and an expanding cylindrical flame). These
   comparisons show that curvatures and burning velocities approach those
   of ``critically{''} stretched laminar flames for the highest turbulent
   intensity case, but not for the lower turbulence intensity cases. In all
   cases, however, the structure of the flame front at the leading edge
   seems to closely mirror laminar flame calculations. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The effect of nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges on a laminar, lean
   (phi = 0.5) premixed H-2/O-2/N-2 flame is studied at low pressure (25
   Torr) using a novel plasma-flame facility, non-intrusive laser
   diagnostics, and high-fidelity numerical simulations.
   Spatially-resolved, quantitative OH mole fraction and temperature
   measurements are performed with and without a burst of 200 discharge
   pulses using laser-induced fluorescence. Measured temperatures increase
   by similar to 20\% in both the pre-heat and post-flame zones with the
   use of the plasma discharge. In addition, OH mole fractions increase by
   as much as 500\% in the preheat zone and by 40\% in the post-flame
   gases. Simulations are conducted with a one-dimensional, multi-scale,
   pulsed-discharge model with detailed plasma-combustion kinetics to
   develop additional insight into the complex plasma and flame
   interactions. Good agreement between measured and predicted OH and
   temperature profiles provides confidence in the model framework. The
   reduced electric field, E/N, varies inversely with number density during
   each pulse. A significant fraction of the input energy is consumed
   during electron impact ionization processes in the high E/N (700-1000
   Td) regions downstream of the flame. Lower E/N values (100-700 Td) in
   the lower-temperature preheat zone promote efficient generation of
   radicals and excited species via electron impact processes, as well as
   by collisional quenching of excited states. The plasma action results in
   a significant increase in O and H atom density, with the peak values
   increasing by a factor of 6 and 4 respectively. In presence of the
   discharge, species and temperature profiles shift upstream (closer to
   the burner) by approximately 0.2 cm. Simulations show that electron
   impact dissociation and excitation processes in the plasma have a major
   impact on the observed temperature and species profile displacement,
   such that Joule heating alone does not account for the observed effects
   of the plasma. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The effect of pulsed nanosecond dielectric barrier plasma discharges on
   the ignition characteristics of n-heptane and air mixtures is
   investigated through self-consistent simulations in a plane-to-plane
   geometry at reduced pressures (20.3 kPa). The present work represents
   one of the first attempts in understanding the kinetic and thermal
   effects of nanosecond pulsed discharges on the two-stage ignition
   process of n-heptane. A plasma-fluid formulation is developed with ions
   and neutral species at gas temperature, and electrons in
   non-equilibrium. The work makes use of an optimized chemical kinetics
   mechanism consisting of 166 species and 611 reactions, obtained by
   combining a reduced n-heptane kinetic model, a non-equilibrium plasma
   chemistry scheme, and a NOx kinetic model. The catalytic effect from
   plasma-generated radicals on the first stage of the n-heptane ignition
   process has been identified. Production of radicals such as O, H and OH
   from the plasma initiates and accelerates the H abstraction of fuel
   molecules, and dramatically reduces the induction time of the exothermic
   cycle (RH -> R -> RO2 -> OROOH) by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the
   plasma action on low temperature chemistry is found to be nearly
   independent of the equivalence ratio and more pronounced at lower
   temperatures (550-650 K). A staggered application of nanosecond voltage
   pulses (2-4 pulses at the beginning and 20-30 pulses after the first
   stage heat release) is shown to be optimal, resulting in a reduction of
   the ignition delay by approximately a factor of 2. NO production from
   the plasma via electron impact and quenching processes at low
   temperatures plays an important role in promoting chain-branching
   reactions and contributes to shortening the ignition delay by
   approximately 10\%. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Ocular hypertension in glaucoma develops due to age-related cellular
   dysfunction in the conventional outflow tract, resulting in increased
   resistance to aqueous humor outflow. Two cell types, trabecular meshwork
   (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelia, interact in the
   juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) region of the conventional outflow tract
   to regulate outflow resistance. Unlike endothelial cells lining the
   systemic vasculature, endothelial cells lining the inner wall of SC
   support a transcellular pressure gradient in the basal to apical
   direction, thus acting to push the cells off their basal lamina. The
   resulting biomechanical strain in SC cells is quite large and is likely
   to be an important determinant of endothelial barrier function, outflow
   resistance and intraocular pressure. This review summarizes recent work
   demonstrating how biomechanical properties of SC cells impact glaucoma.
   SC cells are highly contractile, and such contraction greatly increases
   cell stiffness. Elevated cell stiffness in glaucoma may reduce the
   strain experienced by SC cells, decrease the propensity of SC cells to
   form pores, and thus impair the egress of aqueous humor from the eye.
   Furthermore, SC cells are sensitive to the stiffness of their local
   mechanical microenvironment, altering their own cell stiffness and
   modulating gene expression in response. Significantly, glaucomatous SC
   cells appear to be hyper-responsive to substrate stiffness. Thus,
   evidence suggests that targeting the material properties of SC cells
   will have therapeutic benefits for lowering intraocular pressure in
   glaucoma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gas separation membranes have been studied for several decades and are
   starting to find commercial acceptance. This review will focus on
   polymer functionalization to improve gas separation performance, namely,
   permeability, permselectivity, or both. The review will cover both
   ``diffusivity controlled{''} and ``solubility controlled{''}
   functionalization strategies; each strategy refers to the different mode
   of gas transport through the membrane. Diffusivity controlled
   functionalization strategies mainly involve control over free volume
   elements in amorphous polymers via promotion or inhibition of chain
   packing through functional groups. As such, the effects of this
   functionalization are typically confined to the well-known
   selectivity/permeability tradeoff. Solubility controlled modification
   strategies utilize functional groups that have strong chemical
   interactions with some of the penetrant molecules and offers an enhanced
   solution-diffusion or a non-solution-diffusion permeation pathway. This
   functionalization can potentially exceed the Robeson upper bound, but is
   often challenged by impurities and deactivation of the chemical
   functionality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Distributed extremum seeking and formation control for nonholonomic

Journal = {{SYSTEMS \& CONTROL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{27-34}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an integrated control and optimization problem is studied
   in the context of formation and coverage of a cluster of nonholonomic
   mobile robots. In particular, each communication channel is modeled by
   its outage probability, and hence, connectivity is maintained if the
   outage probability is less than a certain threshold. The objective of
   the communication network is to not only maintain resilient
   communication quality but also extend the network coverage. An
   information theory based performance index is defined to quantify this
   control objective. Unlike most of the existing results, the proposed
   cooperative control design does not assume the knowledge of any gradient
   (of the performance index). Rather, a distributed extremum seeking
   algorithm is designed to optimize the connectivity and coverage of the
   mobile network. The proposed approach retains all the advantages of
   cooperative control, and it can not only perform extremum seeking
   individually, but also ensures a consensus of estimates between any pair
   of connected systems. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of
   the proposed methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Local delivery of lipid mediators has become a promising new approach
   for therapeutic angiogenesis and regenerative medicine. In this study,
   we investigated how gradient stimulation (either abluminal/distal or
   luminal/proximal) of engineered microvessels with sphingosine
   1-phosphate (S1P) receptor-subtype-targeted molecules affects
   endothelial sprout growth using a microfluidic device. Our studies show
   that distal stimulation of microvessels with FTY720, an S1P1/3 selective
   agonist, promotes both arterial and venular sprout growth, whereas
   proximal stimulation does not. Using novel pharmacological antagonists
   of S1P receptor subtypes, we further show that S1P3 functionality is
   necessary for VEGF-induced sprouting, and confirmed these findings ex
   vivo using a murine aortic ring assay from S1P3-deficient mice. S1P3
   agonist stimulation enhanced vascular stability in both cell types via
   upregulation of the interendothelial junction protein VE-cadherin.
   Lastly, S1P3 activation under flow promoted endothelial sprouting and
   branching while decreasing migratory cell fate in the microfluidic
   device. We used an in vivo murine dorsal skinfold window chamber model
   to confirm S1P3's role in neovascular branching. Together, these data
   suggest that a distal transendothelial gradient of S1P1/3-targeted drugs
   is an effective technique for both enhancing and stabilizing capillary
   morphogenesis in angiogenic applications.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the dynamic traffic assignment problem on a
   two-alternative network with one alternative subject to a dynamic
   pricing that responds to real-time arrivals in a system optimal way.
   Analytical expressions for the assignment, revenue and total delay in
   each alternative are derived as a function of the pricing strategy. It
   is found that minimum total system delay can be achieved with many
   different pricing strategies. This gives flexibility to operators to
   allocate congestion to either alternative according to their specific
   objective while maintaining the same minimum total system delay. Given a
   specific objective, the optimal pricing strategy can be determined by
   finding a single parameter value in the case of HOT lanes. Maximum
   revenue is achieved by keeping the toll facility at capacity with no
   queues for as long as possible. Guidelines for implementation are
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many emission models have been developed for estimating the impact of
   transport policies on vehicle emissions. Macroscopic models, such as
   MOBILE and COPERT, are used for area analysis, while microscopic models,
   such as CMEM, are applied for corridor analysis. It is well known that
   driving dynamics are critical for estimating vehicle emissions. MOVES
   can be used for both macroscopic and microscopic emission analysis, and
   its advantage lies in the consideration of driving dynamics. Using a
   bottom-up approach, we study the impact of license plate restriction
   policy on vehicle emission reduction by localizing the emission rates in
   MOVES according to the vehicle emission standards in China. We implement
   the approach to evaluate the impact on the total vehicle emissions in
   Hangzhou, China before and after the implementation of license plate
   restriction policy. In the restricted region, the reductions of total
   Vehicle Kilometer Traveled (VKT) and total emissions are 9.6\% and
   6.9\%, respectively. The result shows that the license plate restriction
   policy is effective in achieving the targeted emission reduction. (C)

Abstract = {{Using computational modeling, we design a microscopic swimmer made of a

   is turned on, the responsive layer swells and causes the swimmer to
   deform. We demonstrate that when such stimulus-induced deformations
   occur periodically the gel swimmer effectively propels forward through
   the fluid. We show that the swimming speed depends on the relative
   stiffness of the two gel layers composing the swimmer, and we determine
   the optimal stiffness ratio that maximizes the swimming speed.}},

Abstract = {{Micro structured reactors are attractive candidates for further process
   intensification in heterogeneous catalysis. However, they require
   catalytic coatings with significantly improved space-time yields
   compared to traditional supported catalysts. We report the facile
   synthesis of homogeneous nanocrystalline Pt coatings with hierarchical
   pore structure by electrochemical dealloying of amorphous
   sputter-deposited platinum silicide layers. Thickness, porosity and
   surface composition of the catalysts can be controlled by the dealloying
   procedure. XPS analysis indicates that the catalyst surface is primarily
   composed of metallic Pt. Catalytic tests in gas-phase hydrogenation of
   butadiene reveal the typical activity, selectivity and activation energy
   of nanocrystalline platinum. However, space time yields are about 13 to
   200 times higher than values reported for Pt-based catalysts in
   literature. The highly open metallic pore structure prevents heat and
   mass transport limitations allowing for very fast reactions and
   reasonable stability at elevated temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A closed-loop strategy is developed for controlling batch cooling
   multicomponent crystallization. The strategy represents the sequential
   application of two established feedback control techniques: direct
   nucleation control followed by supersaturation control. Experimental
   results show that such a control scheme produces larger crystals
   (compared to linear cooling crystallization with the same batch time).
   In using this scheme to control the crystallization of a double salt
   from a solution containing sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate, we
   demonstrate the application of supersaturation control to a
   multicomponent salt crystallization-which requires knowledge of the
   solubility as a function of temperature, the ability to monitor
   concentrations in a multicomponent solution, and an appropriate
   expression for the driving force for crystallization of a salt. In this
   paper, a methodology for rapidly identifying the solubility of a solute
   in a multicomponent solution is presented and a new expression for
   supersaturation-termed the molar supersaturation-is advanced as a
   measure of the driving force for crystallization of salts.}},

   values up to 73 F/g normalized to electrode mass (MWCNT and titania) and
   1,364 F/g normalized to titania mass. Furthermore, the series resistance
   of the control supercapacitors (1.21 Omega) did not significantly
   increase with the addition of titania, until 300 atomic layer deposition

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of an aqueous developed, chemically amplified;
   polynorbornene-based permanent dielectric have been investigated. The
   previously reported hexafluoroisopropanol norbornene and tert-butyl
   ester norbornene copolymer has been modified via two routes to improve
   the mechanical properties of the polymer and enable thick-film
   deposition. First, a third monomer, butyl norbornene (ButylNB) was added
   to the polymer backbone: The inclusion of 24 mol\% ButylNB lowered the
   elastic modulus from 2.64 to 2.35 GPa and raised the dielectric constant
   from 2.78 to 3.48. The second approach added a low molecular weight,
   plasticizing additive in the copolymer formulation. Many additives were
   immiscible with the resin or did not affect the mechanical properties.
   Trimethyololproparte ethoxylate (TMPEO) was found to be a miscible
   additive that improved mechanical properties and could participate in
   crosslinking the final dielectric material. TMPEO interacted with the
   PAG, lowering its decomposition temperature. An optimal-formulation and
   processing scheme were determined. A formulation with 10 pphr TMPEO was
   measured to have a dielectric constant of 2.94, an elastic modulus of
   1.95 GPa, a sensitivity at 365 nm of 175 mJ/cm(2), and a contrast of
   4.36. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Correction on Coastal Heads for Groundwater Flow Models}},
Journal = {{GROUNDWATER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{164-170}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a simple correction to coastal heads for constant-density
   groundwater flow models that contain a coastal boundary, based on
   previous analytical solutions for interface flow. The results
   demonstrate that accurate discharge to the sea in confined aquifers can
   be obtained by direct application of Darcy's law (for constant-density
   flow) if the coastal heads are corrected to ((alpha + 1)/alpha)h(s) -
   B/2 alpha, in which hs is the mean sea level above the aquifer base, B
   is the aquifer thickness, and alpha is the density factor. For
   unconfined aquifers, the coastal head should be assigned the value
   h(s)root(1 + alpha) / alpha. The accuracy of using these corrections is
   demonstrated by consistency between constant-density Darcy's solution
   and variable-density flow numerical simulations. The errors introduced
   by adopting two previous approaches (i.e., no correction and using the
   equivalent fresh water head at the middle position of the aquifer to
   represent the hydraulic head at the coastal boundary) are evaluated.
   Sensitivity analysis shows that errors in discharge to the sea could be
   larger than 100\% for typical coastal aquifer parameter ranges. The
   location of observation wells relative to the toe is a key factor
   controlling the estimation error, as it determines the relative aquifer
   length of constant-density flow relative to variable-density flow. The
   coastal head correction method introduced in this study facilitates the
   rapid and accurate estimation of the fresh water flux from a given
   hydraulic head measurement and allows for an improved representation of
   the coastal boundary condition in regional constant-density groundwater
   flow models.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic communication at the nanoscale has, to date, been
   studied in either the very high frequency (VHF) (30-300 MHz) or in the
   TeraHertz band (0.1-10 THz). The main focus of this paper is on
   electromagnetic communication in the VHF band and determining the bit
   error rate (BER) performance of nanoscale receivers utilizing a carbon
   nanotube (CNT). To determine BER performance, statistical
   characterization of an average-level detector output is obtained for two
   different receiver configurations: nanotube receiver, and tunneling
   nanotube receiver. For the nanotube receiver, the linear component not
   considered in the previous studies is included and shown to
   significantly affect the variance of the detector output and, also,
   exact analysis is performed with some significant differences to
   previous approximations. The tunneling nanotube receiver, for which no
   statistical characterization has been done to date, is analyzed.
   Extensive simulation studies are presented to confirm the accuracy of
   the theoretical results provided for the distribution of the
   average-level detector output. The feasible communication distances are
   investigated based on the BER performance by using realistic system
   parameters. The results reveal the potential usage of the VHF band in
   nanonetworks and highlight the importance of maximizing the charge at
   the CNT tip.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an active electrical technique for dynamic tuning
   of MEMS resonators. The proposed technique is based on using the
   resonator output current to generate displacement or acceleration
   signals by integration or differentiation operations, respectively. The
   resulting signal is then scaled to generate an appropriate tuning
   signal. When applied to the resonator through additional signal ports,
   the tuning signal electrically modifies the equivalent mechanical
   stiffness or mass of the resonator, thereby tuning the resonance
   frequency in a bidirectional fashion depending on the polarity of the
   scaling. This tuning scheme has been applied to a piezoelectric
   AlN-on-Si BAW square resonator to tune its 14.2 MHz resonance frequency
   by 22 kHz, equivalent to 1550 ppm. The proposed tuning technique can be
   applied to a wide range of MEMS resonators and resonant sensors, e.g.,
   to compensate for temperature or process-induced variations in their

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic guided waves are one of the primary methods being
   investigated for structural health monitoring of plate-like components.
   A common practice is to collect measurements from a sparse transducer
   array using the pitch-catch method, which enables interrogation of
   defects from multiple directions. Thus, knowledge of how guided waves
   scatter from defects is very useful for detection, localization, and
   characterization of damage. One way to describe scattering patterns is
   with a matrix indexed by incident angle and scattered angle, and sparse
   array measurements essentially sample this matrix. A methodology is
   proposed in this paper to estimate the complete scattering matrix from
   these limited array measurements. First, recorded array signals are
   compensated for geometric spreading loss, wave packet spreading loss,
   and transducer differences. Initial scattering values are then extracted
   from the scattered wave packets after baseline subtraction and are
   augmented using transducer reciprocity and any a priori knowledge of
   defect geometric symmetry. Finally, radial basis function interpolation
   is performed on these values to obtain the complete scattering matrix.
   Scattering matrices are generated from experimental data by cutting
   notches of different lengths originating from a through-hole in an
   aluminum plate specimen that is instrumented with a sparse transducer
   array. The methodology is validated by laser vibrometry measurements
   performed on a nominally identical specimen for one notch length.}},

Abstract = {{The individual pursuit is a 4-km cycling time trial performed on a

   forward-integration model of pursuit performance explored the interplay
   between power loss and aerodynamic gains in parathletes with TTA. The
   model is calibrated to a 4-km pursuit time of 4:10.5 (baseline), then
   adjusted to account for a TTA. Conditions simulated were based on
   typical pedal asymmetry in TTA (AMP), if foot stiffness were decreased
   (FLEX), if pedaling asymmetries were minimized (ASYM), if the prosthesis
   were aerodynamically optimized (AERO), if the prosthesis had a cosmetic
   cover (CC), and if all variables were optimized (OPT). A random Monte
   Carlo analysis was performed to understand model precision.
   Four-kilometer pursuit performances predicted by the model were 4:10.5,
   4:20.4, 4:27.7, 4:09.2, 4:19.4, 4:27.9, and 4:08.2 for the baseline,
   AMP, FLEX, ASYM, AERO, CC, and OPT models, respectively. Model precision
   was +/- 3.7 s. While the modeled time decreased for ASYM and OPT modeled
   conditions, the time reduction fell within model precision and therefore
   was not significant. Practical application of these results suggests
   that parathletes with a TTA could improve performance by minimizing
   pedaling asymmetry and/or optimizing aerodynamic design, but, at best,
   they will have performance similar to that of intact cyclists. In
   conclusion, parathletes with TTA do not have a net advantage in the
   individual pursuit.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of a spark kernel ejected by a sunken fire igniter into a
   turbulent, fuel-air stratified crossflow was studied both experimentally
   and using a model in a configuration that is similar to the conditions
   found in turbine engine combustors. This study allows for variations in
   the transit time of the kernel across a uniform nonflammable region,
   before entering a second stream containing a flammable fuel-air mixture.
   High speed schlieren and emission imaging systems are used to visualize
   the evolution of the kernel and determine the probability of ignition
   based on measurements over many spark events. Experiments are performed
   for a range of mean velocities, transit times, inlet (preheat)
   temperatures, flammable zone equivalence ratios, and nonflammable zone
   equivalence ratios. In addition to the typical dependence of ignition on
   the equivalence ratio of the flammable mixture, the results indicate the
   strong influence of the kernel transit time and the inlet flow
   temperature on the probability of ignition. The entrainment between the
   kernel and the surrounding flow appears to be primarily controlled by
   the kernel ejection-induced flowfield. Reduced-order modeling suggests
   that the lowering of the kernel temperature associated with entrainment
   of the nonflammable mixture significantly reduces the ignition
   probability, and leads to the conclusion that the presence of fuel close
   to the igniter is necessary to ensure reliable ignition under adverse
   conditions.}},

   prepared via surface-initiated activators generated by electron transfer
   for atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-AGET-ATRP) in the CH3OH-H2O
   mixing solvent with different volume ratios. The successful grafting was
   supported by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) measurements. Gravimetric analysis plus H-1 NMR and gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements showed that there was an
   increase in the monomer conversion and molecular weight of polymer
   brushes with increasing H2O proportion of the solvent system. The
   variation trend of graft length was further evidenced by the gradual
   change of decomposition and glass transition temperatures of the
   surface-grafted CNCs. A large scale of chain transfer occurred on the
   surface of CNCs in view of the minute quantity of free polymers
   generated by a sacrificial initiator. Free polymers cannot be used as a
   substitute to characterize grafted polymers in terms of the big
   difference between their molecular weights. The obtained surface-grafted
   CNCs showed thermo-enhanced fluorescence owing to the thermal-driven
   chain dehydration of the grafted PNIPAAM brushes.}},

Abstract = {{Rhodium (Rh) is a critical component of many catalysts for a variety of
   chemical transformation processes. Controlling the shape of Rh
   nanocrystals offers an effective route to the optimization of their
   catalytic performance owing to a close correlation between the catalytic
   activity/selectivity and the surface atomic structure. It also helps to
   substantially reduce the loading amount and thus achieve a sustainable
   use of this scarce and precious metal. In this review article, we focus
   on recent progress in the shape-controlled synthesis of Rh nanocrystals
   with the goal of enhancing their catalytic properties. Both traditional
   and newly-developed synthetic strategies and growth mechanisms will be
   discussed, including those based on the use of surface capping agents,
   manipulation of reduction kinetics, control of surface diffusion rate,
   management of oxidation etching, and electrochemical alteration. We also
   use two examples to highlight the unique opportunities offered by
   shape-controlled synthesis for enhancing the use of this metal in
   catalytic applications. The strategies can also be extended to other
   precious metals in an effort to advance the production of cost-effective
   catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{UV is a high-energy electromagnetic radiation that has been widely used
   in industrial production and the scientific research domain. In this
   work, a deep UV light emission was obtained using triboelectrification
   induced plasma discharge without any extra power supply. By a mechanical
   friction between polymer and quartz glass, the triboelectric charges
   cause a changing electric field, which may bring plasma discharge of low
   pressure gas (Ar-Hg) and give out 253.7 nm irradiation. The UV light
   caused by continuous friction can excite a trichromatic phosphor and
   afford a bright white light emission. A UV sterilization experiment
   shows that similar to 98\% of Escherichia coli can be killed in 30 min
   by UV irradiation, which reveals that a self-powered sterilization
   apparatus with good sterilization effect was fabricated. This work
   provides a novel design to fabricate a self-powered UV light emitting
   device using low-frequency mechanical friction and realizes the coupling
   of triboelectrification and plasma luminescence, which may further
   expand the application of UV light in special circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Despite progress in bone tissue engineering, the healing of critically
   sized diaphyseal defects remains a clinical challenge. A stem cell-based
   approach is an attractive alternative to current treatment techniques.
   The objective of this study was to examine the ability of adult stem
   cells to enhance bone formation when co-delivered with the
   osteoinductive factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in a
   biologically functionalized hydrogel. First, adipose and bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs and BMMSCs) were screened
   for their potential to form bone when delivered in an RGD functionalized
   alginate hydrogel using a subcutaneous implant model. BMMSCs
   co-delivered with BMP-2 produced significantly more mineralized tissue
   compared with either ADSCs co-delivered with BMP-2 or acellular
   hydrogels containing BMP-2. Next, the ability of BMMSCs to heal a
   critically sized diaphyseal defect with a nonhealing dose of BMP-2 was
   tested using the alginate hydrogel as an injectable cell carrier. The
   effect of timing of therapeutic delivery on bone regeneration was also
   tested in the diaphyseal model. A 7 day delayed injection of the
   hydrogel into the defect site resulted in less mineralized tissue
   formation than immediate delivery of the hydrogel. By 12 weeks,
   BMMSC-loaded hydrogels produced significantly more bone than acellular
   constructs regardless of immediate or delayed treatment. For immediate
   delivery, bridging of defects treated with BMMSC-loaded hydrogels
   occurred at a rate of 75\% compared with a 33\% bridging rate for
   acellular-treated defects. No bridging was observed in any of the
   delayed delivery samples for any of the groups. Therefore, for this
   cell-based bone tissue engineering approach, immediate delivery of
   constructs leads to an overall enhanced healing response compared with
   delayed delivery techniques. Further, these studies demonstrate that
   co-delivery of adult stem cells, specifically BMMSCs, with BMP-2
   enhances bone regeneration in a critically sized femoral segmental
   defect compared with acellular hydrogels containing BMP-2.}},

   further increases at a slower rate as severity increases. Low
   temperature ammonia soaking at longer residence times dissolved a major
   portion of hemicellulose and exhibited higher cellulose accessibility
   than high temperature soaking. Moreover, the most significant reduction
   of degree of polymerization (DP) occurred for dilute sodium hydroxide
   (NaOH) and ammonia pre-treated Populus samples. The study thus
   identifies important cellulose structural features and relevant
   parameters related to biomass recalcitrance.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based
   noise reduction techniques, we propose a supervised method to enhance
   speech by means of finding a mapping function between noisy and clean
   speech signals based on deep neural networks (DNNs). In order to be able
   to handle a wide range of additive noises in real-world situations, a
   large training set that encompasses many possible combinations of speech
   and noise types, is first designed. A DNN architecture is then employed
   as a nonlinear regression function to ensure a powerful modeling
   capability. Several techniques have also been proposed to improve the
   DNN-based speech enhancement system, including global variance
   equalization to alleviate the over-smoothing problem of the regression
   model, and the dropout and noise-aware training strategies to further
   improve the generalization capability of DNNs to unseen noise
   conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
   can achieve significant improvements in both objective and subjective
   measures over the conventional MMSE based technique. It is also
   interesting to observe that the proposed DNN approach can well suppress
   highly nonstationary noise, which is tough to handle in general.
   Furthermore, the resulting DNN model, trained with artificial
   synthesized data, is also effective in dealing with noisy speech data
   recorded in real-world scenarios without the generation of the annoying
   musical artifact commonly observed in conventional enhancement methods.}},

Title = {{Low-Dimensional Learning for Complex Robots}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithm for learning the switching policy and
   the boundaries conditions between primitive controllers that maximize
   the translational movements of a complex locomoting system. The
   algorithm learns an optimal action for each boundary condition instead
   of one for each discretized state-action pair of the system, as is
   typically done in machine learning. The system is modeled as a hybrid
   system because it contains both discrete and continuous dynamics. With
   this hybridification of the system and with this abstraction of learning
   boundary-action pairs, the ``curse of dimensionality{''} is mitigated.
   The effectiveness of this learning algorithm is demonstrated on both a
   simulated system and on a physical robotic system. In both cases, the
   algorithm is able to learn the hybrid control strategy that maximizes
   the forward translational movement of the system without the need for
   human involvement.
   Note to Practitioners-As technological innovation in the field of
   robotics continues to advance forward at a steady rate, so does the
   complexity of the robotic systems that are the product of this
   innovation. Utilizing these robotic systems for a number of automated
   tasks in diverse situations requires an increased level of deep
   understanding of the inner workings of the system, which is a burden to
   the human operator and programmer. To attenuate this burden, the task of
   programming itself must move towards automation. This type of automation
   is the motivation for work presented here. This paper outlines an
   algorithm for which a complex robotic system can learn the task of
   locomoting all on its own. The practical application of this research is
   that more complex robotic systems can be incorporated into industry with
   less effort. This automation is accomplished with an innovative approach
   on what the robot needs to learn to achieve its goal. This paper focuses
   on robot locomotion but future work will focus on the high degree of
   freedom stationary robotic arms that are increasingly seen on factory
   floors.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{216-227}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Image and video sensors are increasingly being deployed in complex
   systems due to the rich process information that these sensors can
   capture. As a result, image data play an important role in process
   monitoring and control in different application domains such as
   manufacturing processes, food industries, medical decision-making, and
   structural health monitoring. Existing process monitoring techniques
   fail to fully utilize the information of color images due to their
   complex data characteristics including the high-dimensionality and
   correlation structure (i.e., temporal, spatial and spectral
   correlation). This paper proposes a new image-based process monitoring
   approach that is capable of handling both grayscale and color images.
   The proposed approach models the high-dimensional structure of the image
   data with tensors and employs low-rank tensor decomposition techniques
   to extract important monitoring features monitored using multivariate
   control charts. In addition, this paper shows the analytical
   relationships between different low-rank tensor decomposition methods.
   The performance of the proposed method in quick detection of process
   changes is evaluated and compared with existing methods through
   extensive simulations and a case study in a steel tube manufacturing
   process.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper, motivated by the problem of combustion
   monitoring in steel tube manufacturing, focuses on the development of
   effective methods for process monitoring based on image data. Existing
   process monitoring techniques cannot fully utilize the information of
   color images due to the high-dimensionality and complex correlation
   structure of such data. This paper addresses this problem by extracting
   essential monitoring features, while considering the spatial and
   spectral correlation of color images. This is accomplished by using
   various low-rank tensor decomposition methods along with multivariate
   control charts. The proposed approach can lead to a computer-aided
   online monitoring system for automatic detection of out-of-control
   situations in a process. Using simulation, the performance of the
   developed methods is compared under various scenarios. This can provide
   practitioners with useful guidelines for selecting an appropriate method
   for image-based process monitoring. In future research, we will study
   the development of image-based fault diagnosis techniques that can be
   integrated with the process monitoring approaches proposed in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{The Hall effect thruster is an electric propulsion device for space
   applications that efficiently reduces the propellant mass requirements
   on a spacecraft in comparison with chemical rockets. To date, the Hall
   effect thruster technology relies on the thermionic cathodes that
   consume up to 10\% of the total propellant used in the system to
   neutralize the ion beam of the thruster; however, such propellant usage
   does not contribute to thrust generation. An array of thin-film, carbon
   nanotube field emitters that emit electrons through field emission can
   potentially neutralize the ion beam without consuming any propellant.
   This paper examines the effects of 40 min exposure of carbon nanotube
   field emitter arrays to the plasma environment in the exit plane of a
   Hall effect thruster. The physical structures that enable field emission
   appear largely unaffected by placement in the plasma as well as
   operation in the plasma. This indicates that a refined design of this
   carbon nanotube field emitter array may potentially provide an
   alternative to the thermionic cathode used on contemporary Hall effect
   thrusters and verifies that no fundamental incompatibilities exist
   between these two technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have emerged as a promising
   solar architecture for next-generation solar cells. The QDSSCs exhibit a
   remarkably fast electron transfer from the quantum dot (QD) donor to the
   TiO2 acceptor with size quantization properties of QDs that allows for
   the modulation of band energies to control photoresponse and
   photoconversion efficiency of solar cells. To understand the mechanisms
   that underpin this rapid charge transfer, the electronic properties of
   CdSe and PbSe QDs with different sizes on the TiO2 substrate are
   simulated using a rigorous ab initio density functional method. This
   method capitalizes on localized orbital basis set, which is
   computationally less intensive. Quite intriguingly, a remarkable set of
   electron bridging states between QDs and TiO2 occurring via the strong
   bonding between the conduction bands of QDs and TiO2 is revealed. Such
   bridging states account for the fast adiabatic charge transfer from the
   QD donor to the TiO2 acceptor, and may be a general feature for strongly
   coupled donor/acceptor systems. All the QDs/TiO2 systems exhibit type II
   band alignments, with conduction band offsets that increase with the
   decrease in QD size. This facilitates the charge transfer from QDs
   donors to TiO2 acceptors and explains the dependence of the increased
   charge transfer rate with the decreased QD size.}},

Title = {{The estimation of changes in rail ridership through an onboard survey:
   did free Wi-Fi make a difference to Amtrak's Capitol Corridor service?}},

Abstract = {{Amtrak launched free Wi-Fi internet service ({''}AmtrakConnect{''}) on
   all trains of the California Capitol Corridor route (CC) on November 28,
   2011. In March 2012, an onboard survey was conducted to evaluate the
   impact of the Wi-Fi service on ridership. We develop descriptive
   statistics and estimate a linear regression model of the impact of Wi-Fi
   on passengers' trip frequency. As higher-frequency riders are
   overrepresented in the original sample, we weight cases to reflect the
   distribution of passengers, rather than person-trips, more accurately.
   We segment the linear regression model for three groups of travelers,
   based on their ridership frequency, to better understand the impact of
   selected variables on the expected number of trips in 2012. Several
   conventional factors (trip frequency in 2011, trip purpose,
   station-to-station distance and employment) as well as Wi-Fi have some
   impact on the self-reported projected trip frequency in 2012. Using the
   estimated parameters from the model, the expected number of trips on CC
   trains for 2012 is 2.7 \% higher than it would have been without free
   Wi-Fi. In particular, new riders expect to make 8.6 \% more trips than
   if Wi-Fi were not available, while the expected number of trips made by
   lower-frequency continuing riders (those using CC less than once a week
   in 2011) and higher-frequency continuing riders (those using CC once a
   week or more in 2011) increase by 6.2 and 1.0 \%, respectively.}},

Title = {{Ion-exchange selectivity of diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and
   naproxen in ureolyzed human urine}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{510-521}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This research advances the knowledge of ion-exchange of four
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - diclofenac (DCF),
   ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprofen (KTP), and naproxen (NPX) - and one
   analgesic drug paracetamol (PCM) - by strong-base anion exchange resin
   (AER) in synthetic ureolyzed urine. Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin
   -Astakhov, and Dubinin - Radushkevich isotherm models were fit to
   experimental equilibrium data using nonlinear least squares method.
   Favorable ion-exchange was observed for DCF, KTP, and NPX, whereas
   unfavorable ion-exchange was observed for IBP and PCM. The ion-exchange
   selectivity of the AER was enhanced by van der Waals interactions
   between the pharmaceutical and AER as well as the hydrophobicity of the
   pharmaceutical. For instance, the high selectivity of the AER for DCF
   was due to the combination of Coulombic interactions between quaternary
   ammonium functional group of resin and carboxylate functional group of
   DCF, van der Waals interactions between polystyrene resin matrix and
   benzene rings of DCF, and possibly hydrogen bonding between
   dimethylethanol amine functional group side chain and carboxylate and
   amine functional groups of DCF. Based on analysis of covariance, the
   presence of multiple pharmaceuticals did not have a significant effect
   on ion-exchange removal when the NSAIDs were combined in solution. The
   AER reached saturation of the pharmaceuticals in a continuous-flow
   column at varying bed volumes following a decreasing order of DCF > NPX
   approximate to KTP > IBP. Complete regeneration of the column was
   achieved using a 5\% (m/m) NaCl, equal-volume water methanol solution.
   Results from multiple treatment and regeneration cycles provide insight
   into the practical application of pharmaceutical ion-exchange in
   ureolyzed urine using AER. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fate and biotransformation of phytosterols during treatment of pulp and
   paper wastewater in a simulated aerated stabilization basin}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{589-600}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Pulp and paper wastewater (PPW) contains significant concentrations of
   phytosterols, suspected of inducing endocrine disruption in aquatic
   species. Aerated stabilization basins (ASBs) are commonly used for the
   treatment of PPW, but phytosterol removal varies among treatment
   systems. The objective of this study was to better understand the
   removal processes and biotransformation of phytosterols within an ASB
   treatment system fed with untreated PPW. PPW settled solids and
   supernatant fractions showed that phytosterols are primarily associated
   with settleable solids, which carry phytosterols to ASB sediment where
   anoxic/anaerobic conditions prevail. Bioassays with supernatant and
   settled PPW fractions of the raw wastewater conducted under aerobic and
   anaerobic conditions, respectively, showed that solids disintegration
   and hydrolysis results in phytosterol release in ASBs. A simulated ASB,
   fed with PPW and operated for 2.4 years at three hydraulic retention
   times (HRTs; 22.2, 11.1 and 5.6 d) with total phytosterol and solids
   loading rates from 10 to 42 mu g/L-d and 44-178 mg/L-d, respectively,
   was used to determine the steady-state effluent quality and sediment
   characteristics. Although effluent COD and phytosterol concentrations
   were relatively low and stable (84-88\% total COD removal; 82-94\% total
   phytosterol removal) across the range of HRTs tested, sediment COD and
   phytosterol concentrations increased with increasing loading rate. On
   average, 51\% of the phytosterols entering the ASB were removed via
   biotransformation, 40\% were retained in the sediment, and the remaining
   9\% exited with the effluent. This study demonstrates the role of
   sediment as a source of phytosterol release in ASBs and highlights the
   importance of HRT and the PPW characteristics for predicting phytosterol
   fate in ASBs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Wall shear stress (WSS) has been investigated as a potential prospective
   marker to identify rapidly progressing coronary artery disease (CAD) and
   potential for lesions to acquire vulnerable characteristics. Previous
   investigations, however, are limited by a lack of understanding of the
   focal association between WSS and CAD progression (i.e., data are
   notably spatially averaged). Thus, the aim of this investigation was
   toexamine the focal association between WSS and coronary atherosclerosis
   progression, and compare these results to those determined by spatial
   averaging. Five patients with CAD underwent baseline and 6-month
   follow-up angiographic and virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound
   imaging to quantify CAD progression. Patient-specific computational
   fluid dynamics models were constructed to compute baseline WSS values,
   which were either averaged around the entire artery circumference or
   examined in focal regions (sectors). Analysis of data within each sector
   (n = 3871) indicated that circumferentially averaged and sector WSS
   values were statistically different (p < 0.05) and exhibited poor
   agreement (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.69). Furthermore,
   differences were observed between the analysis techniques when examining
   the association of WSS and CAD progression. This investigation
   highlights the importance of examining spatially heterogeneous variables
   at a focal level to reduce the affect of data reduction and warrants
   implementation in a larger clinical study to determine the predictive
   power in prospectively identifying rapidly progressing and/or vulnerable
   coronary plaques.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the recent advances in 3D shape measurement and geometry
   reconstruction, simultaneously achieving fast-speed and high-accuracy
   performance remains a big challenge in practice. In this paper, a 3D

   number of advanced approaches, such as: composition of phase-shifted
   fringe patterns, externally triggered synchronization of system
   components, generalized system setup, ultrafast phase-unwrapping
   algorithm, flexible system calibration method, robust gamma correction
   scheme, multithread computation and processing, and
   graphics-processing-unit-based image display. Experiments have shown
   that the proposed system can acquire and display high-quality 3D
   reconstructed images and/or video stream at a speed of 45 frames per
   second with relative accuracy of 0.04\% or at a reduced speed of 22.5

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a framework of automatic object recognition and
   rapid surface modeling to aid the heavy equipment operation in rapidly
   perceiving 3D working environment at dynamic construction sites. A
   custom-designed data acquisition system was employed in this study to
   rapidly recognize the selected target objects in a 3D space by
   dynamically separating target object's point cloud data from a
   background scene for a quick computing process. A smart scanning method
   was also applied to only update the target object's point cloud data
   while keeping the previously scanned static work environments. Then the
   target's point cloud data were rapidly converted into a 3D surface model
   using the concave hull surface modeling algorithm after a process of
   data filtering and downsizing to increase the model accuracy and data
   processing speed. The performance of the proposed framework was tested
   with two different heavy equipment types at a steel frame building
   construction site. The generated surface model and the point cloud of
   static surroundings were wirelessly presented to a remote operator. The
   field test results show that the proposed rapid target surface modeling
   method would significantly improve productivity and safety in heavy
   construction equipment operations by distinguishing a dynamic target
   object from a surrounding static environment in 3D views in near real
   time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) is a well-known end member
   of NOM from an aquatic system, and is a reference material of the
   International Humic Substances Society (IHSS). In May 2012, an
   expedition to the Suwannee River to replenish this reference material
   yielded over 6 kg of freeze-dried NOM. The quantity of isolated NOM was
   unprecedented, easily exceeding the combined recoveries of the standard
   and reference samples that were collected by the IHSS from the Suwannee
   River in 1983, 1999, and 2003. The NOM was acquired from 36,890 L of
   filtered river water, which was concentrated 40-fold on-site using two
   portable reverse osmosis (RO) systems. After RO, the concentrated sample
   was desalted by cation exchange (CEX), freeze dried, and homogenized.
   Overall yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was 84.2\%, which is
   slightly lower than the yield of 88\% in 1999 when RO and CEX were used
   to isolate the first sample of SRNOM, which is designated 1R101N. The
   final NOM sample supplied to the IHSS, which is designated 2R101N,
   contains only 3.89\% inorganic ash, which reasonably allows most
   chemical analyses. Average river DOC concentration of 82.7 mg/L was
   higher than during prior sampling trips, which contributed to the
   historically high recovery of NOM. Increased DOC concentration may be
   related to the removal of water control structures from the river. This
   article describes the methods of isolation used in collecting the 2R101N
   reference sample as background for other articles in this special issue
   of Environmental Engineering Science and for future researchers who will
   use this IHSS sample.}},

Abstract = {{We present a large-eddy simulation based investigation of combustion
   instability in the Continuous Variable Resonance Combustor (CVRC); a
   high-pressure, shear-coaxial injector combustor studied experimentally
   at Purdue University. An important characteristic of the CVRC setup is
   the role that the oxidizer injector length plays in the stable/unstable
   combustion dynamics occurring within the combustor. We perform three
   simulations corresponding to different stability regions; one is a
   semi-stable case whereas the other two cases are unstable. The acoustic
   pressure fluctuation exhibits a limit cycle behavior in all cases. An
   abrupt change in the predicted amplitude between stable and unstable
   cases is also observed, consistent with the experimental trends. Further
   investigations to characterize the mechanism driving such abrupt change
   in the stability pattern when the oxidizer injector length is varied,
   show that acoustic interactions with the flow field lead to subtle
   changes in the vorticity (and mixing) dynamics, which significantly
   alters the distribution of species and heat release. In addition,
   aspects related to flame stabilization such as the mean flame anchoring
   location and the mode of burning, premixed or non-premixed, are also
   affected. The analysis of flame structures shows the presence of
   multi-mode burning regions where premixed and non-premixed flames appear
   to coexist. However, the dominant burning mode switches from premixed to
   non-premixed within an acoustic cycle, potentially playing an important
   role in flame stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{A power-efficient wireless switched-capacitor based stimulating (SCS)
   system for electrical/optical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is presented.
   The SCS system efficiently charges storage capacitors directly from an
   inductive link and delivers accurately balanced charge to the tissue,
   improving the overall stimulator efficiency. In addition, the decaying
   exponential stimulus pulses generated by SCS can be more effective than
   conventional rectangular and ramp stimuli in activating neural tissue
   when consuming the same amount of energy, leading to higher stimulus
   efficacy. A 4-channel wireless SCS system in 0.35 mu m CMOS process
   achieves stimulator efficiency of 80.4\% with capacitor pairs charged to
   +/- 2V, while the decaying exponential stimulus requires equal or less
   stimulus energy and injected charge than other stimuli depending on
   pulse width to activate the same tissue area. The SCS system has also
   been utilized for power-efficient wireless optogenetic stimulation by
   periodically discharging capacitors into high-current micro-LED arrays.
   Results from acute in vivo experiments have verified the utility of the
   SCS system prototype in both electrical and optical stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy,
   we shed light on the nature of the interaction between CO2 and the amine
   moieties in a hyperbranched aminosilica (HAS) material, a porous
   aminosilica composite with great potential for postcombustion carbon
   capture applications. We show that after dosing a pristine (annealed)
   HAS sample with CO2, the C K-edge NEXAFS spectrum presents a new pi{*}
   resonance at 289.9 eV, which can be attributed to the formation of a C=O
   (carbonyl) bond. Additional analyses of the O K-edge using model samples
   containing carbamate, carbonate, and bicarbonate functional groups as
   reference demonstrate a carbamate bonding mechanism for the chemical
   adsorption of CO2 by the HAS material under the conditions employed.
   These findings show the capability of the C and O K-edge NEXAFS
   technique to identify CO2-adsorbate species despite the high
   concentration of C and O atoms inherently present in the sample (prior
   to CO2 dosing) and the significant similarities between the possible
   adsorbates.}},

Abstract = {{Glass composites containing percolated segregated networks of conducting
   antimony tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles were fabricated through the use
   of a hot-pressing technique, which resulted in glass microspheres
   deforming into faceted polyhedra with the ATO located at the edges. Once
   the ATO percolated, it was shown that minor changes in the processing
   parameters could cause drastic differences in the electrical properties
   (as much as 4-5 orders of magnitude in some cases). This study aims to
   investigate how the hot-pressing processing conditions, that is,
   temperature and pressure, can influence the electrical properties of
   percolated glass/ATO composites. Glass composites containing 4.8wt\%
   ATO, which is a concentration higher than the percolation threshold,
   were hot pressed at several different temperatures (550 degrees C-675
   degrees C) and pressures (5.8-23.4MPa) and were examined using impedance
   spectroscopy. A comprehensive equivalent circuit model was developed
   based on the microstructure of the composites and the individual
   impedance behavior of the materials involved. It was found that the
   physical arrangement as well as the individual properties of the glass,
   the ATO nanoparticles, and the different interfaces between ATO (point
   contact vs partially sintered vs glass coated) all contributed to the
   measured response in a quantitative way. The equivalent circuit model
   was successful in fitting all of the impedance behaviors at different
   temperature and pressures thus revealing the influence of the processing
   conditions on the electrical properties of percolated ATO/glass
   composites.}},

Abstract = {{A continuum damage framework is developed and coupled with an existing
   crystal plasticity framework, to model failure initiation in irradiated
   bcc polycrystalline materials at intermediate temperatures. Constitutive
   equations for vacancy generation due to inelastic deformation, void
   nucleation due to vacancy condensation, and diffusion-assisted void
   growth are developed. The framework is used to simulate failure
   initiation at dislocation channel interfaces and grain boundaries ahead
   of a sharp notch. Evolution of the microstructure is considered in terms
   of the evolution of inelastic deformation, vacancy concentration, and
   void number density and radius. Evolution of the damage, i.e., volume
   fraction of the voids, is studied as a function of applied deformation.
   Effects of strain rate and temperature on failure initiation are also
   studied. The framework is used to compute the fracture toughness of
   irradiated specimens for various loading histories and notch geometries.
   Crack growth resistance of the irradiated specimens are computed and
   compared to that of virgin specimens. Results are compared to available
   experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrofluoric (HF)/nitric (HNO3)/acetic (CH3COOH) acid, normally referred
   to as the HNA method, is a widely utilized technique for performing
   isotropic etching on silicon (Si) in industrial Si-based processing and
   device construction. Here, we reported a novel etching strategy based on
   a HF/HNO3 process with the assistance of silver (Ag) nano-seeds,
   offering good controllability in preparing diversified Si nanostructure
   arrays with particularly smooth top surfaces. The involved mechanism was
   visualized by systematically investigating both the time and temperature
   dependencies on the etching kinetics with various ratios of HF to HNO3.
   Moreover, by testing different Ag+-ion containing oxidants on Si
   etching, we have re-examined the state-of-the-art metal-assisted
   chemical etching (MaCE) using HF/AgNO3 etchants. In contrast with
   previous reports, we found that the interplay of hole injections from
   Ag+ and NO3- ions to the valence band of Si collectively contributes to
   the unidirectional dissolution of Si. Finally, we explored the
   engineering of the Ag nano-seeds to regularize the orientation of the
   etched nanowires formed on non-Si (100) wafers, which further provides a
   reliable pathway for constructing the desired morphologies of
   one-dimensional Si nanostructures regardless of wafer orientation.}},

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries play an important role in the mechanical and physical
   properties of polycrystalline metals. While continuum macroscale
   simulations are appropriate for modeling grain boundaries in
   coarse-grained materials, only atornistic simulations provide access to
   the details of the grain boundary (GB) structure and energy. Hence, a
   multiscale description is required to capture these GB details. The
   objective of this paper is to consolidate various approaches for
   characterizing grain boundaries in an effort to develop a multiscale
   model of the initial GB structure and energy. The technical approach is
   detailed using various < 100 >, < 110 > and < 111 > symmetric tilt grain
   boundaries in copper and aluminum. Characteristic features are: (i) GB
   energies obtained from atomistic simulations and boundary period vectors
   from crystallography, (ii) structural unit and dislocation descriptions
   of the GB structure and (iii) the Frank Bilby equation to determine the
   dislocation content. The proposed approach defines an intrinsic net
   defect density scalar that is used to accurately compute the GB energy
   for these GB systems. The significance of the present work is that the
   developed atomistic-to-continuum approach is suitable for realistically
   inserting the initial GB structure and energy into continuum level
   frameworks. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The methylation of 4-methylbiphenyl (4-MBP) can yield
   4,4'-dimethylbiphenyl (4,4'-DMBP), an important precursor for advanced
   polymers. The reaction mechanism of the shape-selective methylation of

   using{''} our own-N-layered integrated molecular orbital+molecular
   mechanics{''}(ONIOM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods.
   Stepwise and concerted mechanisms were considered, with the former
   having a lower activation energy. 4,4'-DMBP is kinetically favored by
   both mechanisms. Transition state selectivity accounts for the
   preferential methylation to 4,4'-DMBP. The isomerization of 4-MBP to
   3-methylbiphenyl (3-MBP) is restricted within the zeolite. The
   isomerization of 4-MBP to 3-MBP is kinetically favored over methylation
   on the external zeolite surface, which causes a decrease in 4, 4'-DMBP
   selectivity. Passivating the external surface will suppress 4-MBP
   isomerization, therefore increasing 4,4'-DMBP selectivity by restricting
   reaction within the zeolite. The computational results of
   shape-selective and non-selective reactions over H-ZSM-5 zeolite well
   account for the experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbed blood flow (d-flow) occurring in branched and curved arteries
   promotes endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, in part, by
   altering gene expression and epigenomic profiles in endothelial cells.
   While a systemic metabolic change is known to play a role in
   atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether it can be regulated by local
   d-flow. Here, we tested this hypothesis by carrying out a metabolomics
   study using blood plasma samples obtained from ApoE(-/-) mice that
   underwent a partial carotid ligation surgery to induce d-flow. Mice
   receiving sham ligation were used as a control. To study early metabolic
   changes, samples collected from 1 wk after partial ligation when
   endothelial dysfunction occurs, but before atheroma develops, were
   analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. A metabolome-wide
   association study showed that 128 metabolites were significantly altered
   in the ligated mice compared with the sham group. Of these,
   sphingomyelin (SM; m/z 703.5747), a common mammalian cell membrane
   sphingolipid, was most significantly increased in the ligated mice. Of
   the 128 discriminatory metabolites, 18 and 41 were positively and
   negatively correlated with SM, respectively. The amino acids methionine
   and phenylalanine were increased by d-flow, while phosphatidylcholine
   and phosphatidylethanolamine were decreased by d-flow, and these
   metabolites were correlated with SM. Other significantly affected
   metabolites included dietary and environmental agents. Pathway analysis
   showed that the metabolic changes of d-flow impacted broad functional
   networks. These results suggest that signaling from d-flow occurring in
   focal regions induces systemic metabolic changes associated with
   atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background. As patients with a single-ventricle physiology age,
   long-term complications inherent to this population become more evident.
   Previous studies have focused on correlating anatomic and hemodynamic
   performance, but there is little information of how these variables
   change with time. Vessel growth and flow rate changes were quantified
   using cardiac magnetic resonance and their effects on hemodynamics were
   assessed, which could affect the long-term outcome.
   Methods. Forty-eight patients with a lateral tunnel or extracardiac
   conduit Fontan who underwent two cardiac magnetic resonance scans
   (average interval, 5.1 +/- 2.3 years) were studied. Total cavopulmonary
   connection anatomic and flow variables were reconstructed and normalized
   to body surface area(1/2). Total cavopulmonary connection hemodynamic
   efficiency (indexed power loss) was obtained through computational fluid
   dynamic modeling.
   Results. Absolute vessel diameters increased with time, normalized
   diameters decreased, and vessel mean flow rates remained unchanged.
   Indexed power loss changed significantly in the cohort, as well as in
   patients in whom the minimum normalized left pulmonary artery decreased.
   Age at first scan and connection type (lateral tunnel or extracardiac
   conduit) were not associated with changes in indexed power loss.
   Conclusions. We present the largest serial cardiac magnetic resonance
   Fontan cohort to date. Although flow rates increased proportionally to
   body surface area, vessel diameters did not match somatic growth. As a
   result, energy losses increased significantly with time in the cohort
   analyzed. (C) 2015 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Aortic root rupture is one of the most severe complications of
   transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The mechanism of this
   adverse event remains mostly unknown. The purpose of this study was to
   obtain a better understanding of the biomechanical interaction between
   the tissue and stent for patients with a high risk of aortic rupture. We
   simulated the stent deployment process of three TAVI patients with high
   aortic rupture risk using finite element method. The first case was a
   retrospective analysis of an aortic rupture case, while the other two
   cases were prospective studies, which ended with one canceled procedure
   and one successful TAVI. Simulation results were evaluated for the risk
   of aortic root rupture, as well as coronary artery occlusion, and
   paravalvular leak. For Case 1, the simulated aortic rupture location was
   the same as clinical observations. From the simulation results, it can
   be seen that the large calcified spot on the interior of the left
   coronary sinus between coronary ostium and the aortic annulus was pushed
   by the stent, causing the aortic rupture. For Case 2 and Case 3,
   predicated results from the simulations were presented to the clinicians
   at multidisciplinary pre-procedure meetings; and they were in agreement
   with clinician's observations and decisions. Our results indicated that
   the engineering analysis could provide additional information to help
   clinicians evaluate complicated, high-risk aortic rupture cases. Since a
   systematic study of a large patient cohort of aortic rupture is
   currently not available (due to the low occurrence rate) to clearly
   understand underlying rupture mechanisms, case-by-case engineering
   analysis is recommended for evaluating patient-specific aortic rupture
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Current predictions suggest that the target plate of a divertor, as one
   of the few solid surfaces directly exposed to the plasma of a magnetic
   fusion energy reactor, will be subject to steady-state heat fluxes as
   great as 10 MW/m(2) Developing appropriate methods for cooling these
   divertors with helium is therefore a major technological challenge for
   plasma-facing components. This paper reviews dynamically similar
   experimental studies and numerical simulations of the thermal-hydraulic
   performance of two helium-cooled divertor concepts, the helium-cooled
   divertor with multiple-jet cooling (HEMJ) and the helium-cooled flat
   plate divertor, as well as a variant of the HEMJ, the so-called
   finger-type divertor, performed as part of the ARIES study. The results
   from these studies are extrapolated to prototypical conditions and used
   to predict the maximum average heat flux and coolant pumping power
   requirements for these divertor concepts. These extrapolations can be
   used to estimate how changes in the operating conditions, such as the
   helium inlet temperature and the maximum temperature of the divertor
   pressure boundary, affect thermal performance. Finally, the correlations
   from these extrapolations are used in the system code developed by the
   ARIES study.}},

   values of BSRV and Rb are superior to a standard industrial full Al-BSF
   Si solar cell, where BSRV and Rb are usually >= 200 cm/s and similar to

Abstract = {{We present a general architecture for the acquisition of ensembles of
   correlated signals. The signals are multiplexed onto a single line by
   mixing each one against a different code and then adding them together,
   and the resulting signal is sampled at a high rate. We show that if the
   M signals, each band limited to W/2 Hz, can be approximated by a
   superposition of R < M underlying signals, then the ensemble can be
   recovered by sampling at a rate within a logarithmic factor of RW, as
   compared with the cumulative Nyquist rate of MW. This sampling theorem
   shows that the correlation structure of the signal ensemble can be
   exploited in the acquisition process even though it is unknown a priori.
   The reconstruction of the ensemble is recast as a low-rank matrix
   recovery problem from linear measurements. The architectures we are
   considering impose a certain type of structure on the linear operators.
   Although our results depend on the mixing forms being random, this
   imposed structure results in a very different type of random projection
   than those analyzed in the low-rank recovery literature to date.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{The fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth resistance of
   nanocrystalline materials are significantly affected by the thickness of
   the specimen. In this work we relate the mechanical properties of
   nanocrystalline platinum films to their texture and grain morphology.
   Tensile, creep and fatigue testing of annealed, similar to 1 mu m films
   resulted in mechanical properties similar to the as-received films
   (yield strength of similar to 1.2 GPa, fracture toughness similar to
   17.8 MPa root m, and a fatigue crack growth power law exponent of
   similar to 4.2). However, the breakdown of the initially columnar grain
   morphology had a marked effect on the transition point from an
   intergranular to transgranular fatigue cracking mode. Finite element
   modeling suggests that cyclic (fatigue) grain coarsening and the
   transition from inter- to transgranular cracking modes are a result of
   the relative importance of dislocation slip accommodation on in-plane
   and through-thickness oriented slip directions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Impact of maintenance on life cycle impact and cost assessment for
   residential flooring options}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-45}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most life cycle assessment (LCA) studies for flooring exclude the
   environmental and economic impacts incurred from the maintenance
   required due to uncertainty in average cleaning procedures, although
   some studies indicate that it may be the most significant component of
   the life cycle. This study investigates the impacts of maintenance on
   types of flooring and develops a single scoring system to compare floors
   based on both environmental and economic impacts.
   The focus of this study was on the impact of maintenance on the life
   cycle of flooring choices. Maintenance data was collected from trade
   association studies and manufacturer's recommendations. This data was
   compiled, along with data from previous flooring studies, to create a
   comprehensive life cycle inventory which was analyzed with the LCA
   software, SimaPro. A number of maintenance techniques and frequencies
   were tested in order to do a sensitivity analysis. An uncertainty
   analysis was completed using Monte Carlo simulations. A life cycle
   costing (LCC) analysis was used to evaluate the total present value cost
   of flooring including maintenance. Environmental and economic impacts
   were normalized to create a single score in order to compare the overall
   performance of flooring choices.
   Maintenance procedures may account for a significant portion of
   environmental and economic impacts of floorings. In the case of
   environmental scores, adding high maintenance to the life cycle can
   increase scores by anywhere from 31 \% (hardwood) to 114 \% (carpet). A
   sensitivity analysis of these scores shows that most of the score
   increase can be attributed to vacuuming. Maintenance costs considerably
   increase the total cost, accounting for 49 \% of hardwood's total cost
   and about 30 \% of costs for linoleum, vinyl, and carpet. The expected
   service life of the home greatly influences which flooring is best, as
   costs and environmental scores change dynamically over time. For the
   expected service life of a home of 61 years, carpet has the worst and
   linoleum has the best overall performance.
   Although averages for maintenance techniques are not currently known,
   ignoring maintenance as a part of the use phase presents a significant
   error in the comparison of flooring options environmentally and
   economically. Due in part to yearly maintenance effects, the flooring
   choice with the best overall performance changes dynamically depending
   on the expected service life remaining for the home.}},

   against the semi-analytical solution for the pressure and opening
   profile of a bi-wing hydraulic fracture propagating under conditions of

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Integration of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles shows promise
   for enabling facile deployment and expanding MOF applications. While
   MOFs deposited on flat substrates can show relatively smooth surface
   texture, most previous reports of MOFs integrated on fibers show poor
   conformality with many individual crystal domains. Here we report a new
   low-temperature (<70 degrees C) method to deposit uniform and smooth MOF
   thin films on fiber surfaces using an energy enhanced layer-by-layer
   (LbL) method with an ALD Al2O3 nucleation layer. Cross-sectional TEM
   images show a well-defined core@shell structure of the
   MOF-functionalized fiber, and SEM shows a flat MOF surface texture. We
   analyze the thickness and mass increase data of LbL HKUST-1 MOF thin
   films on ALD-coated polypropylene fibers and find the growth rate to be
   288-290 ng cm(-2) per LbL cycle. Unlike planar LbL MOF embodiments where
   adsorption capacities are difficult to quantify, the large volume
   quantity on a typical fiber mat enables accurate surface area
   measurement of these unique MOF morphologies. After 40 LbL cycles the
   MOFs on fibers exhibit N-2 adsorption BET surface areas of up to 93.6
   m(2) g(MOF+fiber)(-1) (similar to 535 m(2) g(MOF)(-1)) and breakthrough
   test results reveal high dynamic loadings for NH3 (1.37 molNH(3)
   kg(MOF+fiber)(-1)) and H2S (1.49 molH(2)S kg(MOF+fiber)(-1)). This
   synthesis route is applicable to many polymer fibers, and the
   fiber@ALD@MOF structure is promising for gas filtration, membrane
   separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and other applications.}},

Title = {{Structural stability of BTTB-based metal-organic frameworks under humid
   conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{1624-1631}},
Abstract = {{Stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under humid environments is
   of particular interest for their potential commercial and industrial
   uses. In this work, water vapor adsorption experiments and subsequent
   structural analysis on the newly synthesized BTTB-based MOFs (BTTB =
   4,4',4 `',4'''-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid) have been
   performed to investigate their stability under humid conditions. ZnBTTB
   and CdBTTB degrade completely after exposure to 90\% relative humidity
   (RH). The instability of ZnBTTB is due to the four-coordinated zinc
   carboxylate system similar to MOF-5. CdBTTB is aka unstable as Cd2+ ions
   have coordination number of 4 when the MOF is activated (desolvated).
   Unlike ZnBTTB and CdBTTB, the structure of ZnBTTBBDC has not degraded
   significantly upon exposure to 90\% RH. This partial structure retention
   is attributed to the higher nuclearity of metal in the SBU of ZnBTTBBDC
   and higher metal coordination number compared to ZnBTTB and CdBTTB.
   Water adsorption isotherms of CoBTTBAZPY and ZnBTTBAZPY show type V
   behavior due to free nitrogen sites. The crystal structures of
   AZPY-based pillared MOFs show partial Loss of crystallinity whereas
   BPY-based pillared MOFs remain stable after exposure to 90\% RH. The
   greater stability of BPY-based MOFs is attributed to the higher extent
   of catenation, higher rigidity of the BPY Linker, and absence of any
   hydrophilic sites.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Displacement cascade simulations were conducted for the gamma uranium
   system based on molecular dynamics. A recently developed modified
   embedded atom method (MEAM) potential was employed to replicate the
   atomic interactions while an embedded atom method (EAM) potential was
   adopted to help characterize the defect structures induced by the
   displacement cascades. The atomic displacement process was studied by
   providing primary knock-on atoms (PKAs) with kinetic energies from 1 key
   to 50 keV. The influence of the PKA incident direction was examined. The
   defect structures were analyzed after the systems were fully relaxed.
   The states of the self-interstitial atoms (SlAs) were categorized into
   various types of dumbbells, the crowdion, and the octahedral
   interstitial. The voids were determined to have a polyhedral shape with
   \{110) facets. The size distribution of the voids was also obtained. The
   results of this study not only expand the knowledge of the
   microstructural evolution in irradiated gamma uranium, but also provide
   valuable references for the radiation-induced defects in uranium alloy
   fuels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The processes of storage and dissipation of electromagnetic energy in

   In this paper, the distributions of local energy density and power
   dissipation in nanogratings are investigated using the rigorous
   coupled-wave analysis. It is demonstrated that the enhancement of
   absorption is accompanied by the enhancement of energy storage both for
   material at the resonance of its dielectric function described by the
   classical Lorentz oscillator and for nanostructures at the resonance
   induced by its geometric arrangement. The appearance of strong local
   electric field in nanogratings at the geometry-induced resonance is
   directly related to the maximum electric energy storage. Analysis of the
   local energy storage and dissipation can also help gain a better
   understanding of the global energy storage and dissipation in

Title = {{Uncertainty quantification of bacterial aerosol neutralization in shock
   heated gases}},
Journal = {{SHOCK WAVES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-90}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A potential method for the neutralization of bacterial endospores is the
   use of explosive charges since the high thermal and mechanical stresses
   in the post-detonation flow are thought to be sufficient in reducing the
   endospore survivability to levels that pose no significant health
   threat. While several experiments have attempted to quantify endospore
   survivability by emulating such environments in shock tube
   configurations, numerical simulations are necessary to provide
   information in scenarios where experimental data are difficult to
   obtain. Since such numerical predictions require complex, multi-physics
   models, significant uncertainties could be present. This work
   investigates the uncertainty in determining the endospore survivability
   from using a reduced order model based on a critical endospore
   temperature. Understanding the uncertainty in such a model is necessary
   in quantifying the variability in predictions using large-scale,
   realistic simulations of bacterial endospore neutralization by explosive
   charges. This work extends the analysis of previous large-scale
   simulations of endospore neutralization {[}Gottiparthi et al. in (Shock
   Waves, 2014. doi:10.1007/s00193-014-0504-9)] by focusing on the
   uncertainty quantification of predicting endospore neutralization. For a
   given initial mass distribution of the bacterial endospore aerosol,
   predictions of the intact endospore percentage using nominal values of
   the input parameters match the experimental data well. The uncertainty
   in these predictions are then investigated using the Dempster-Shafer
   theory of evidence and polynomial chaos expansion. The studies show that
   the endospore survivability is governed largely by the endospore's mass
   distribution and their exposure or residence time at the elevated
   temperatures and pressures. Deviations from the nominal predictions can
   be as much as 20-30 \% in the intermediate temperature ranges. At high
   temperatures, i.e., strong shocks, which are of the most interest, the
   residence time is observed to be a dominant parameter, and this coupled
   with the analysis resulting from the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence
   seems to indicate that achieving confident predictions of less than 1 \%
   endospore viability can only occur by extending the residence time of
   the fluid-particle interaction.}},

Title = {{Measurement of Evoked Potentials During Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-56}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) treats the symptoms of several
   movement disorders, but optimal selection of stimulation parameters
   remains a challenge. The evoked compound action potential (ECAP)
   reflects synchronized neural activation near the DBS lead, and may be
   useful for feedback control and automatic adjustment of stimulation
   parameters in closed-loop DBS systems.
   Objectives: Determine the feasibility of recording ECAPs in the clinical
   setting, understand the neural origin of the ECAP and sources of any
   stimulus artifact, and correlate ECAP characteristics with motor
   symptoms.
   Methods: The ECAP and tremor response were measured simultaneously
   during intraoperative studies of thalamic DBS, conducted in patients who
   were either undergoing surgery for initial lead implantation or
   replacement of their internal pulse generator.
   Results: There was large subject-to-subject variation in stimulus
   artifact amplitude, which model-based analysis suggested may have been
   caused by glial encapsulation of the lead, resulting in imbalances in
   the tissue impedance between the contacts. ECAP recordings obtained from
   both acute and chronically implanted electrodes revealed that specific
   phase characteristics of the signal varied systematically with
   stimulation parameters. Further, a trend was observed in some patients
   between the energy of the initial negative and positive ECAP phases, as
   well as secondary phases, and changes in tremor from baseline. A
   computational model of thalamic DBS indicated that direct
   cerebellothalamic fiber activation dominated the clinically measured
   ECAP, suggesting that excitation of these fibers is critical in DBS
   therapy.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrated that ECAPs can be recorded in the
   clinical setting and may provide a surrogate feedback control signal for
   automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters to reduce tremor
   amplitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   with the DNO in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. Each level
   consists of two stages. The first stage is to determine base generation
   setpoints based on the load and nondispatchable DG output forecasts and
   the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the
   realized scenarios. A scenario reduction method is applied to enhance a
   tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational
   burden. Case studies of a distribution system with multiple MGs of
   different types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   methodology. The centralized control, deterministic formulation, and
   stochastic formulation are also compared.}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates and solves the economic power dispatch (ED)
   problem with practical operation constraints using potential games. Each
   generator operates as an independent player in a self-optimizing manner
   with marginal contribution utility functions to minimize the total

   inequality constraints into feasible action sets, incorporates equality
   constraints by penalty functions, and extends to practical cases that
   exhibit non-convex or non-smooth objective functions. Two learning
   algorithms with guaranteed convergence to Nash equilibria and/or optima
   are applied to solve the proposed formulation. How generators react as
   best responses to others is analyzed to capture the reasoning of
   operations. As a numerical example, the solutions obtained using the
   proposed ED method in a benchmark system are analyzed. Examples are
   provided to emphasize how priority for renewable sources are

Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A new class of interval-based computational algorithms for parameter
   identification under uncertainty in structural engineering problems is
   presented. The iterative method allows passing directly from uncertain
   raw measurements to sharp (tight) bound estimates of the unknown
   parameters by exploiting interval FEMs and adjoint-based optimization
   techniques. Overestimation in interval width is handled successfully
   using the inclusion isotonicity property of interval arithmetic. First,
   an update of the iterative solution proceeds in a degenerated interval
   form until it becomes insignificant, and then the update is switched to
   full interval form, allowing uncertainty propagation and sensitivity
   analysis. A new containment-stopping criterion, which is intrinsic to
   intervals, is used. Example problems are then presented and discussed to
   show the effectiveness of the proposed inverse method in estimating the
   range of Young's moduli from given ranges in displacements. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on commercially viable screen printing (SP)

Abstract = {{We develop a method for finding optimal greenhouse gas reduction rates
   under ongoing uncertainty and re-evaluation of climate parameters over
   future decades. Uncertainty about climate change includes both overall
   climate sensitivity and the risk of extreme tipping point events. We
   incorporate both types of uncertainty into a stochastic model of climate
   and the economy that has the objective of reducing global greenhouse gas
   emissions at lowest overall cost over time. Solving this problem is
   computationally challenging; we introduce a two-step-ahead approximate
   dynamic programming algorithm to solve the finite time horizon
   stochastic problem. The uncertainty in climate sensitivity may narrow in
   the future as the behavior of the climate continues to be observed and
   as climate science progresses. To incorporate this future knowledge, we
   use a Bayesian framework to update the two correlated uncertainties over
   time. The method is illustrated with the DICE integrated assessment
   model, adding in current estimates of climate sensitivity uncertainty
   and tipping point risk with an endogenous updating of climate
   sensitivity based on the occurrence of tipping point events; the method
   could also be applied to other integrated assessment models with
   different characterizations of uncertainties and risks.}},

Abstract = {{In many practical combustion devices, short duration, high-energy spark
   kernels are used to ignite combustible gases in turbulent flows. Here we
   examine the development of a high energy (similar to 0.25 J) spark
   kernel created by a short duration (<1 mu s) breakdown discharge across
   two opposed electrodes situated in a uniform air flow. Measurements of
   electrical energy supplied to the electrodes compare well to thermal
   energy deposited in the flow with deposition efficiencies exceeding
   90\%. These spark energies are used as inputs to a numerical model that
   simplifies the computations by replacing the complex, finite duration,
   energy deposition process with an instantaneously created, uniform
   kernel. The evolution of the kernel shape and size predicted by the
   computational model agrees well with experimental data obtained from
   high-speed schlieren images, including development of an asymmetry of
   the kernel between its upstream and downstream regions at later times.
   The predicted kernel evolution is shown to be essentially independent of
   the initial size and the composition of the kernel for a fixed
   deposition energy. The numerical results also reveal the importance of
   rapid entrainment of ambient air into the central region of the kernel,
   which quickly reduces the maximum temperatures in the kernel. In
   addition, the predicted O atom concentrations are well above equilibrium
   values, especially in the lower temperature regions of the kernel. The
   higher temperatures and O mole fractions found in the leading portion of
   the kernel are expected to be an important contributor to ignition in
   non-premixed combustion flows. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{104-114}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many components used in signal processing and communication
   applications, such as power amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters,
   are nonlinear and have a finite dynamic-range. The nonlinearity
   associated with these devices distorts the input, which can degrade the
   overall system performance. Signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR)
   is a common metric to quantify the performance degradation. One way to
   mitigate nonlinear distortions is by maximizing the SNDR. In this paper,
   we analyze how to maximize the SNDR of the nonlinearities in optical
   wireless communication (OWC) systems. Specifically, we answer the
   question of how to optimally predistort a double-sided memory-less
   nonlinearity that has both a ``turn-on{''} value and a maximum
   ``saturation{''} value. We show that the SNDR-maximizing response given
   the constraints is a double-sided limiter with a certain linear gain and
   a certain bias value. Both the gain and the bias are functions of the
   probability density function (PDF) of the input signal and the noise
   power. We also find a lower bound of the nonlinear system capacity,
   which is given by the SNDR and an upper bound determined by dynamic
   signal-to-noise ratio (DSNR). An application of the results herein is to
   design predistortion linearization of nonlinear devices like light
   emitting diodes (LEDs). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time-cost-resources usage variation trade-off analysis is one of the
   most challenging tasks of construction project planners. Project
   planners face complicated multivariate, time-cost-resource optimization
   (TCRO) problems, which require simultaneous minimization of total
   project duration and total project cost, while considering issues
   related to optimal resource allocation and leveling. The authors present
   a shuffled frog-leaping model to solve complex TCRO problems in
   construction project planning. The proposed model is different from
   existing optimization models in construction project planning. The
   proposed shuffled frog-leaping model considers the simultaneous
   optimization of three important objective functions in project planning:
   (1) minimizing total project duration, (2) total project cost, and (3)
   total variation of resource allocation. This model finds optimal Pareto
   fronts of project planning solutions in the three-dimensional space of
   total project duration, total project cost, and total variation of
   resource allocation. The proposed model is flexible to allow for
   activity splitting in project planning. Project activities can be
   interrupted and project resources can be reallocated to find more
   appropriate project planning solutions. The shuffled frog-leaping model
   is applied to solve two optimization problems, which are found in the
   construction project planning literature. It is shown that the proposed
   shuffled frog-leaping model is superior to the existing optimization
   algorithms to find better project planning solutions with less total
   project duration, less total project cost, and less total variation of
   resource allocation. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of nano-sized particles on the surface of sand grains can
   significantly influence the mechanical, physical, and chemical behavior
   of the sand because of the effects of contacts between particles. This
   study quantified the change in small strain stiffness caused by the
   presence of iron oxide particles (hematite and goethite) that were
   chemically sorbed onto uncemented silica sand. Particularly, the change
   in contact mode between sand particles, caused by the presence of the
   nanoparticles, was studied. The iron oxide coating density of coated
   sands was controlled by changing the substrate sand particle size,
   ranging from 0.11 to 0.72 mm in diameter, with corresponding iron
   contents ranging from 0.13 mg iron oxide/g sand dgoethite to 6.4 mg iron
   oxide/g sand (hematite). The presence of the iron oxide nanoparticles
   altered the contact mode between particles and, correspondingly, the
   small strain stiffness as a function of the initial relative density,
   applied stress, iron content, and substrate particle size. The
   macroscale experimental results were analyzed via contact mechanics
   (i.e., Hertz and Mindlin contacts) to gain a more fundamental
   understanding of changes that iron oxide coatings make on the behavior
   of sand. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Scientific Discourse: Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sea-level rise (SLR) is one of the most damaging impacts of climate
   change. Rising sea levels lead to loss of coastal wetlands, coastal
   flooding, degradation of coastal ecosystems, and a general loss of
   quality of life. Due to its potential impacts on coastal management and
   on population health and safety, the impact of climate change on SLR has
   drawn significant attention in recent literature. SLR is associated with
   processes including glacial activity, ice-sheet melting, thermal
   expansion of sea water, hydrologic events such as increased or decreased
   land-based discharges, and local effects such as El Nino and La Nina,
   all of which are complexly linked to changes in global temperature.
   Unfortunately, many of these physical processes are not well understood
   in their relation to climate change, and the scientific knowledge
   required to represent them fully in predictive analysis is so complex
   that many current studies are shifting away from physical climate models
   to the application of empirical, semiempirical, and stochastic models.
   Another important aspect of these modeling studies is their
   characterization of the geographic pattern of SLR, which is used to
   evaluate the threat of SLR to specific geographic locations. In this
   application area, many of the current analysis techniques are also still
   in a fairly preliminary stage. The purpose of this study is to provide a
   review of this literature and to compare some of the successful attempts
   at modeling SLR. In closure, we also discuss a new dynamic system
   modeling approach that can successfully characterize the spatial
   variability of SLR. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional magnetite replicas of pollen particles with tailorable
   and predictable multimodal adhesion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{632-643}},
Abstract = {{The ability to synthesize large quantities of 3-D microparticles with
   tunable adhesion is critically important for a variety of mature and
   emerging technologies, such as for paints, inks, chemical/water
   purification, drug delivery, cell manipulation, and assembly of
   hierarchical structures. Nature provides impressive examples of
   sustainable, complex-shaped microparticles with chemistries and
   structures tailored for adhesion, among the most common of which are
   pollen grains. We have recently used a surface sol-gel (SSG) coating
   process to generate iron oxide replicas of sunflower pollen grains.
   While these replicas exhibited multimodal adhesion, the tailorability
   and predictability of such adhesion was not examined. In the present
   paper, the layer-by-layer SSG process has been used to carefully adjust
   the amount of iron oxide deposited onto the pollen grains.
   Controlled-atmosphere thermal treatments then yielded freestanding
   replicas with tailored hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4)
   contents. The 3-D morphology of the starting pollen was well-preserved
   in the all-oxide replicas, and the shrinkage upon firing could be
   controlled by increasing the number of Fe-O-bearing layers deposited on
   the pollen. While the short-range van der Waals (VDW) adhesion of the
   oxide replicas to a variety of surfaces was lower than for the larger
   starting pollen grains, this difference was not due to shrinkage of the
   replicas. Analyses with a simple Hamaker model indicated that VDW
   adhesion of the oxide replicas was governed by the contact of oxide
   nanocrystals located on the spine tips (as opposed to the curvature of
   the entire spine tip). The longer-range attraction to a magnetic
   substrate could be tailored independently of the short-range VDW
   attraction by controlling the magnetite content of the replicas, and a
   simple and effective model for describing such magnetic attraction was
   developed. This work demonstrates that sustainable pollen microparticles
   can be converted into high-fidelity 3-D oxide replicas with predictable
   and tailorable multimodal adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal modeling of lithium-ion batteries is important for assessing the
   impact of different thermal management strategies on electrochemical
   performance. Existing models either do not correctly couple the
   electrochemical and thermal fields, or require significant computational
   resources that preclude rapid investigation of various cooling methods
   in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) simulations. In this study, a fully
   coupled electrochemical-thermal model that utilizes temperature
   dependent experimental data is described for a single spirally wound
   lithium-ion cell within a larger battery pack. In the model,
   temperature, current, heat generation, and depth of discharge (DOD) are
   allowed to vary locally and with time. In Part I of this study, a two
   dimensional cross-section for two different cell designs (8 Ah and 20
   Ah) is simulated with both air and liquid surface cooling using a
   dynamic power profile. The results show that although liquid cooling
   reduces peak temperature significantly, it imposes a temperature
   difference across the cell. This causes the current and, subsequently,
   DOD to vary locally, which may adversely impact the life of the cell.
   Furthermore, as the cell increases in size and power level, the imposed
   temperature and DOD differences grow. Neither air nor liquid cooling
   allowed the pack size to be reduced beyond factors of 2 or 4,
   respectively. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A parameterized electrochemical model that predicts local reaction rate
   as a function of temperature, depth of discharge, and overpotential was
   developed in Part 1 of this study using temperature-dependent
   performance data. In Part 2, this model was extended to incorporate
   non-ideal current collection, which induces localized heating near the
   tabs, using a quasi-three-dimensional domain. This model was used to
   study the effect of edge cooling the cell, which was shown to impose
   substantial thermal gradients and temperature increases. The large
   temperature difference observed for this cooling method leads to
   significant non-uniform cycling, which can lead to premature aging. In
   addition, the performance of a cell with an innovative internal cooling
   system that utilized passive microchannel liquid-vapor phase change was
   also investigated. Because of the substantially reduced thermal
   resistance from the heat source to the cooling fluid, the charge and
   discharge energy extraction density was highest for the internal cooling
   system in spite of the cell-level volume increase. Furthermore, the
   saturation temperature of the phase change fluid can be optimized to
   balance capacity fade and energy extraction at elevated temperatures,
   yielding systems much smaller than the most compact conventional
   external cooling system. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All

   another leukemia cell line (HL60) as well as healthy leukocytes. These
   differences in cell trajectory can be utilized to enrich and sort K562
   cells from HL60 cells and leukocytes. The microfluidic device utilizes
   periodic, diagonal ridges to compress and translate the cells laterally
   perpendicular to channel axis. The ridge spacing is tuned to allow
   relaxation of the K562 cells but not the HL60 cells or leukocytes.
   Therefore, the periodic compression laterally translates weakly viscous
   cells, while highly viscous cells respond to hydrodynamic circulation
   forces generated by the slanted ridges. As a result, cell sorting has
   strong dependency on cell viscosity. We use atomic force microscopy and
   high-speed optical microscopy to measure cell stiffness, cell relaxation
   rate constant, and cell size for all cell types. With properly designed
   microfluidic channels, we can optimize the enrichment of K562 cells from
   HL60 and leukocytes.}},

Abstract = {{The rate coefficients for the reactions of Cl(P-2(J)) with methylamine
   (R1), dimethylamine (R2) and trimethylamine (R3) have been measured
   using the laser flash photolysis - resonance fluorescence technique as a
   function of temperature (274-435 K) and pressure (25-400 Torr N-2). The
   experimental data are well-represented by the following temperature- and
   pressure-independent rate coefficients (1010 x k/cm(3) molecule(-1)
   s(-1)): k(R1) = 2.90 +/- 0.44, k(R2) = 3.89 +/- 0.58, k(R3) = 3.68 +/-
   0.55; the uncertainties are estimates of accuracy at the 95\% confidence
   level. Potential energy surfaces (PES) for the reactions have been
   characterized at the MP2/cc-pVTZ level and improved single point
   energies of stationary points obtained in CCSD(T)-F12a calculations. The
   PES for all reactions are characterized by the formation of pre and post
   reaction complexes and submerged barriers. Rate coefficients for the
   reactions were calculated as a function of temperature and pressure
   using a master equation model based on the coupled cluster theory
   results. The calculated rate coefficients are in good agreement with
   experiment; the overall rate coefficients are relatively insensitive to
   variations of the barrier heights within typical chemical accuracy, but
   the predicted branching ratios vary significantly. The inclusion of
   tunnelling has no effect.}},

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{127-135}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of soil organic matter
   (SOM) decomposition has been widely studied, the estimate substantially
   depends on the methods used with specific assumptions. Here we compared
   several commonly used methods (i.e., one-pool (1P) model,
   two-discrete-pool (2P) model, three-discrete-pool (3P) model, and
   time-for-substrate (T4S) Qui method) plus a new and more process
   oriented approach for estimating Q(10) of SOM decomposition from
   laboratory incubation data to evaluate the influences of the different
   methods and assumptions on Q(10) estimation. The process-oriented
   approach is a three-transfer-pool (3PX) model that resembles the
   decomposition sub-model commonly used in Earth system models. The
   temperature sensitivity and other parameters in the models were
   estimated from the cumulative CO2 emission using the Bayesian Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated Q(10)s generally
   increased with the soil recalcitrance, but decreased with the incubation
   temperature increase. Our results indicated that the 1P model did not
   adequately simulate the dynamics of SOM decomposition and thus was not
   adequate for the Q(10) estimation. All the multi-pool models fitted the
   soil incubation data well. The Akaike information criterion (AIC)
   analysis suggested that the 2P model is the most parsimonious. As the
   incubation progressed, Q(10) estimated by the 3PX model was smaller than
   those by the 2P and 3P models because the continuous C transfers from
   the slow and passive pools to the active pool were included in the 3PX
   model. Although the T4S method could estimate the Q(10) of labile carbon
   appropriately, our analyses showed that it overestimated that of
   recalcitrant SOM. The similar structure of 3PX model with the
   decomposition sub-model of Earth system models provides a possible
   approach, via the data assimilation techniques, to incorporate results
   from numerous incubation experiments into Earth system models. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This research looked at the effect of crystallographic orientation and

   surface morphology in PWA1484 single crystal superalloy. Two groups of
   single edge notch tension specimens, one group with controlled secondary
   orientations and one group with uncontrolled secondary orientation, were
   tested at temperatures from 649 degrees C to 982 degrees C at R-ratios
   of 0.1 and 0.7. It was found that the effect of temperature on the crack
   growth rate becomes more pronounced as the crack driving force increases
   while the secondary orientation and R-ratio effects on the crack growth
   rate increase with increasing temperature. Two types of crack surface
   morphology were seen during fractography. The first was a precipitate
   avoidance (gamma' avoidance) morphology that was rolling but still
   predominantly flat when observed on a larger scale. In <001> primary
   oriented specimens, this fracture mode tended to follow the
   precipitate/matrix faces (microscopically cubic) while macroscopically
   staying essentially normal to the applied loads. The second mode was a
   form of cleavage (gamma' shearing) and occurred predominantly on
   octahedral crystallographic planes.}},

Abstract = {{In the adult heart, catalase (CAT) activity increases appropriately with
   increasing levels of hydrogen peroxide, conferring cardioprotection.
   This mechanism is absent in the newborn for unknown reasons. In the
   present study, we examined how the posttranslational modification of CAT
   contributes to its activation during hypoxia/ischemia and the role of
   c-Abl tyrosine kinase in this process. Hypoxia studies were carried out
   using primary cardiomyocytes from adult (>8 weeks) and newborn rats.
   Following hypoxia, the ratio of phosphorylated to total CAT and c-Abl in
   isolated newborn rat myocytes did not increase and were significantly
   lower (1.3- and 4.2-fold, respectively; P < .05) than their adult
   counterparts. Similarly, there was a significant association (P < .0005)
   between c-Abl and CAT in adult cells following hypoxia (30.9 +/- 8.2 to
   70.7 +/- 13.1 au) that was absent in newborn myocytes. Although
   ubiquitination of CAT was higher in newborns compared to adults
   following hypoxia, inhibition of this did not improve CAT activity. When
   a c-Abl activator (5-(1,3-diaryl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)hydantoin {[}DPH], 200
   mu mol/L) was administered prior to hypoxia, not only CAT activity was
   significantly increased (P < .05) but also phosphorylation levels were
   also significantly improved (P < .01) in these newborn myocytes.
   Additionally, ischemia-reperfusion (IR) studies were performed using
   newborn (4-5 days) rabbit hearts perfused in a Langendorff method. The
   DPH given as an intracardiac injection into the right ventricle of
   newborn rabbit resulted in a significant improvement (P < .002) in the
   recovery of developed pressure after IR, a key indicator of cardiac
   function (from 74.6\% +/- 6.6\% to 118.7\% +/- 10.9\%). In addition, CAT
   activity was increased 3.92-fold (P < .02) in the same DPH-treated
   hearts. Addition of DPH to adult rabbits in contrast had no significant
   effect (from 71.3\% +/- 10.7\% to 59.4\% +/- 12.1\%). Therefore, in the
   newborn, decreased phosphorylation of CAT by c-Abl potentially mediates
   IR-induced dysfunction, and activation of c-Abl may be a strategy to
   prevent ischemic injury associated with surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between strain-dependent macroscopic elastic behavior
   and the changes in microscopic structure of the smectic-C liquid crystal
   elastomer (LCE), C11MeHQSi8 were investigated using synchrotron X-ray
   studies. At very low strains epsilon < 0.2, the smectic layers are
   randomly oriented. As the strain increases beyond 0.2, the smectic
   layers reorient and become parallel to the direction of the applied
   strain. The polydomain to monodomain (P-M) transition accompanied by the
   formation of chevron structure ensues for epsilon > 0.2 and is nearly
   complete for epsilon = 0.7. The chevron structure relaxes after the
   applied strain changes, with a time constant tau(alpha) similar to 45
   min while the orientation order parameters of the mesogenic and
   elastomeric components gradually increase and saturate at 0.83 and 0.4,
   respectively at epsilon = 1.7 which is near the end of the plateau
   region. Relaxation rates tau(alpha) for the tilt angle and tau(d)
   corresponding to the smectic layer spacing both become about 10 times
   faster when the strain exceeds 0.7. The LCE remains ``locked{''} into
   the monodomain state and retains 90\% and 80\% values of alpha and S,
   respectively for 24 hours after the applied strain is removed. The
   viscoelastic properties of the liquid crystal appear to dominate the
   equilibration process at low strains while the elastomeric properties
   control the system's response at high strains.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing a simple improved electroless plating method, ca. 6 mu m sized
   monodisperse polystyrene/silver (PS/Ag) core-shell microspheres with a
   complete, homogeneous and compact coverage of Ag nanoparticles layer
   were successfully prepared. In this approach, modified lightly
   cross-linked PS (LCPS) microspheres with a uniform diameter of 5.6 mu m
   were used as templates. After the LCPS cores were removed by dissolving
   with dimethyl formamide (DMF), the outer silver shells assembled by
   amounts of Ag nanoparticles maintain good hollow spherical structure.
   The size and coverage degree of Ag nanoparticles on the PS/Ag
   microspheres could be easily tuned by changing the concentration of
   {[}Ag(NH3)(2)](+) ions in aqueous media. The electrical conductivity of
   the obtained PS/Ag core-shell microspheres changes from 3.76 x 10(4) S
   m(-1) to 3.33 x 10(5) S m(-1) as increasing the coverage density of Ag
   nanoparticles. Moreover, the catalytic assays indicate that the
   resultant monodisperse PS/Ag coreshell microspheres show excellent
   catalytic activity for the reduction of methylene blue (MB) by NaBH4. In
   particular, the corresponding hollow Ag spheres exhibit more outstanding
   catalytic activity due to their stable hollow structure and higher
   specific surface area.}},

Abstract = {{Patients suffering from traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries may
   benefit from neuroplasticity guided and reinforced by motor learning
   feedback through reorganization of the neural pathways in intact parts
   of the brain and spinal cord. An enhanced version of a tongue-operated
   robotic rehabilitation system is presented for accelerating the rate of
   improvement in the upper extremity motor functions for patients with
   severe hemiparesis following stroke. A new rehabilitation robot, called
   Hand Mentor ProTM (HM), was utilized by reading its pressure and joint
   angle sensors, combined with control commands from the Tongue Drive
   System (TDS) to enable both isometric and isotonic target-tracking tasks
   in a coordinated tongue-hand rehabilitation paradigm. Preliminary
   results in 3 healthy subjects who performed a sinusoidal target tracking
   task demonstrated the TDS-HM system functionality in hand-operated
   isometric, hand-operated isotonic, tongue-operated isotonic discrete
   control and tongue-operated isotonic proportional control modes with
   average normalized root-mean-square errors of 0.058 +/- 0.023, 0.043 +/-
   0.011, 0.184 +/- 0.087, and 0.148 +/- 0.075, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a joint power and thermal management method is developed
   for implantable devices to achieve three goals: sustainable operation,
   performance maximization, and thermal safety. The sustainable operation
   and performance maximization are guaranteed by designing an appropriate
   objective function. The thermal safety during operation is ensured by
   adding a constraint that limits the maximum temperature. The temperature
   of the implantable device is provided by a thermal model implemented for
   the device. Then the theory of model predictive control is used to solve
   the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
   through a simulation study that is based on a previously published
   platform. The platform is a wireless powered optogenetic stimulation
   device, and the optics module temperature is a major concern for this
   application. The highest average input power to the LED is 250 mW in the
   active mode. The results of the simulation indicate that the proposed
   method can potentially achieve 34 \% more operation time while
   satisfying the same thermal constraint.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique, called multi-cycle Q-modulation,
   which can be used in wireless power transmission (WPT) to modulate the
   quality factor (Q) of the receiver (Rx) and dynamically match the load
   impedance with that of the inductive link. A key advantage of the
   proposed Q-modulation method is that it can be easily implemented using
   off-the-shelf power management components without requiring any fast
   switching function at the carrier frequency, which is only feasible in
   integrated circuit implementation. The multi-cycle Q-modulation is
   analyzed theoretically by a lumped circuit model, and verified in
   simulation and measurement using an off-the-shelf receiver. In a
   conventional 2-coil link, the proposed method increases the power
   amplifier (PA) plus inductive link efficiency from 1.2\% to 12.8\% at

Abstract = {{Assistive technologies (ATs) play a crucial role in the lives of
   individuals with severe disabilities by enabling them to have greater
   autonomy in performing daily tasks. The Tongue Drive System (TDS)
   developed at the Georgia Tech Bionics Lab is such an AT, empowering
   people with severe Spinal Cord Injuries (SCIs) to be more independent.
   Earlier versions of the TDS have offered tongue motion and speech as
   means of driving mouse activity and keyboard input. In this paper, we
   introduce a new multi-modal Tongue Drive System (mTDS), which
   incorporates head tracking to deliver proportional control of a mouse
   cursor. The mTDS integrates this new capability while preserving tongue
   motion and speech from previous versions and offers a richer means of
   driving computing interfaces, than previously available to individuals
   with severe disabilities. In experimental trials, 3 able bodied subjects
   attempted to initiate, dictate and send an email using the mTDS. The
   mean task completion times of expert, intermediate and novice users with
   mTDS were 1.48, 4.46 and 6.02 times compared to them using a keyboard
   and mouse interface. We also observed improved user efficacy with
   repeated use of the mTDS.}},

Abstract = {{The Impulse Radio Ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) vital signs application is
   typically characterized by a periodic transmitted waveform and a
   periodic delay modulation caused by periodic chest displacement. We
   present closed-form spectral coefficients for the chest-reflected IR-UWB
   signal as it arrives at the radar receiver, assuming a planar chest
   model. We assume the chest displaces according to arbitrary periodic
   motion of the heart and lungs. Our base model assumes a periodic train
   of transmitted impulses. We call our approach a ``framework{''} because
   our model can be put with any burst waveform that is transmitted
   periodically (such as a pseudo-random binary sequence), any multi-layer
   model of the chest, and any receiver signal processing model, to provide
   a complete model of the post-processed radar received signal. We
   describe in the paper how each of these extensions can be done in a
   straightforward way with our model, without having to re-derive the
   coefficients of the base model. Our model is more general than existing
   models, which lack closed form expressions or have various constraints,
   such as sinusoidal chest displacement, zero phase, or unavoidable
   aliasing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a smart EnerCage-homecage (HC) system for
   optogenetic stimulation, equipped with magnetic resonance based wireless
   power transmission (WPT), closed-loop power control, and data
   communication via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The proposed system is
   encompassed with four rectangular slanted overlapping high-Q resonators
   and a wirewound driver coil, all tuned at 13.56 MHz. An optical
   headstage is implemented capable of driving 4 micro light-emitting
   diodes (mu-LEDs) based on stimulation commands received via the BLE link
   on-the-fly, while being wirelessly powered in a closed-loop fashion.
   Measurements show that the entire headstage unit was provided with up to
   51 mW throughout the homecage up to the maximum elevation of 10 cm,
   while the transmitter (Tx) power consumption changed from 1.5 W to 2.1 W
   (overall eta, 2.4-3.4\%).}},

Abstract = {{Unobtrusive, continuous, and convenient blood pressure (BP) measurement
   technologies are of high importance to control hypertension and allow
   titration of care. In this paper, we present novel technologies to
   facilitate development of an armband system to estimate BP using pulse
   transit time (PTT) obtained from Ballistocardiogram (BCG) and
   Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Specifically, a wearable, acceleration
   based BCG measurement positioned on the upper arm at the tricep (for
   proximal timing detection) is paired with a reflectance mode PPG
   measurement on the inner side of the same arm (for distal timing
   detection) to extract an estimate of PTT. This unconventional PTT
   estimate, derived from a relatively short segment of the arterial tree
   (from the aortic arch to the microvascular bed at the upper arm), was
   compared to a more established PTT measurement (from the aortic arch to
   the toe) in four subjects in a pilot study to evaluate feasibility. The
   PTT measurements were reasonably well correlated for all subjects (r(2)
   = 0.83) for the perturbations employed in this work (hand grip challenge
   and slow breathing). The results suggest that future investigation of an
   armband-deployed BCG-PPG based system for PTT measurement is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In ultrasound imaging catheter applications, gathering the data from
   multi-element transducer arrays is difficult as there is a restriction
   on cable count due to the diameter of the catheter. In such
   applications, CMUT-on-CMOS technology allows for 2D arrays with many
   elements to be designed and bonded directly onto CMOS circuitry. This
   allows for complex electronics to be placed at the tip of the catheter
   which leads to the possibility to include electronic multiplexing
   techniques to greatly reduce the cable count required for a large
   element array. Current approaches to cable reduction tend to rely on
   area and power hungry circuits to function, making them unsuitable for
   use in catheters. Furthermore the length requirement for catheters and
   lack of power available to on-chip cable drivers leads to limited signal
   strength at the receiver end. In this paper an alternative approach
   using Analogue Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is presented, which
   addresses the cable restrictions of the catheter and, using a novel
   digital demultiplexing technique, allows for a reduction in the number
   of analogue signal processing stages required.}},

Abstract = {{The electric power landscape is undergoing a profound change driven by a
   confluence of environmental concerns, economic forces, regulatory trends
   and significant advances in technology. The traditional electricity
   business model has been characterized by a centralized architecture
   where utilities deliver power from centrally coordinated generators and
   receive revenue based on volume of energy sales. The introduction of
   distributed generation and storage allows traditional consumers to not
   only consume, but also to produce, or store energy. The active
   participation of these so called ``prosumers{''} transforms the
   traditional electricity business model and allows them to participate in
   the value chain by offering new services. However, how these
   capabilities should be valued and integrated into the overall system
   operation is unclear. There is a need for cost benefit frameworks that
   provide stakeholders the insight they need to make informed investment
   decisions. This paper presents a prosumer-based, cost-benefit and
   business model innovation framework for valuation of distributed energy
   resources. The valuation framework is based on a decentralized, layered,
   architecture and multisided platform that continuously connects a
   network of prosumers and describes the value exchange among energy
   service providers and customers in business areas that will include not
   only traditional energy generation and delivery, but other related
   products and valued added services enabled by new technologies. The
   business innovation framework expands the prosumer-centered approach and
   includes grid objectives of ultra-reliability, economic optimization and
   sustainability. If properly implemented, the framework would provide
   electric utilities, energy service providers and prosumers the
   foundation to evaluate the net benefits of Distributed Energy Resources
   and how to maximize them.}},

Abstract = {{In this tutorial we discuss the use of a recently published statistical
   procedure for the validation of models that have their required model
   accuracy specified as a range, often called the acceptable range of
   accuracy. This new statistical procedure uses a hypothesis test of an
   interval, considers both Type I and Type II errors through the use of
   the operating characteristic curve, and provides the model builder's
   risk curve and the model user's risk curve. A detailed procedure for
   validating simulation models using this interval hypothesis test is
   given, computer software developed for this procedure is briefly
   described, and examples of simulation model validation using the
   procedure and software are presented.}},

Abstract = {{When we use simulations to estimate the performance of a stochastic
   system, simulations are often driven by input distributions that are
   estimated from real-world data. There is both input and simulation
   uncertainty in the performance estimates. Non-parametric sampling
   approaches, e.g., the bootstrap, could be used to generate samples of
   input distributions quantifying both input model and parameter
   uncertainty. In this paper, a sequential experiment design is proposed
   to efficiently propagate the input uncertainty to output mean and
   deliver a percentile confidence interval to quantify the impact of input
   uncertainty on the system performance. Compared to the classical equal
   allocation, it could assign more computational budget to samples of
   input distributions that contribute most to the percentile confidence
   interval estimation. Our approach is supported by rigorous theoretical
   and empirical study.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents Sequem, a fully sequential procedure for computing
   point estimators and confidence intervals (CIs) for extreme steady-state
   quantiles of a simulation output process. The method is an enhancement
   of the Sequest procedure proposed by Alexopoulos et al. in 2014 for
   estimating nonextreme steady-state quantiles. Sequem exploits a
   combination of batching, sectioning, and the maximum transformation
   technique to achieve the following: (a) reduction in point-estimator
   bias arising from initial conditions or inadequate simulation run
   length; and (b) adjustment of the CI half-length to compensate for the
   effects of skewness or correlation in the corresponding quantile point
   estimators obtained from nonoverlapping batches. The CIs delivered by
   Sequem satisfy user-specified requirements related to coverage
   probability and absolute or relative precision. A preliminary evaluation
   based on three ``stress-testing{''} processes revealed that Sequem
   exhibited good performance when used in challenging settings.}},

Abstract = {{When simulating a complex stochastic system, the behavior of the output
   response depends on the input parameters estimated from finite
   real-world data, and the finiteness of data brings input uncertainty to
   the output response. The quantification of the impact of input
   uncertainty on output response has been extensively studied. However,
   most of the existing literature focuses on providing inferences on the
   mean output response with respect to input uncertainty, including point
   estimation and confidence interval construction of the mean response. To
   the best of our knowledge, risk assessment of input uncertainty has been
   rarely considered. In the present paper, we will introduce risk measures
   for input uncertainty, study a nested Monte Carlo estimator and
   construct an asymptotically valid confidence interval for a specific
   risk measure-Conditional Value-at-Risk of the mean response. We further
   study the associated budget allocation problem for more efficient nested
   simulation of the estimator.}},

Abstract = {{The study of sustainable urban systems requires analysis of

   natural approach to modeling such systems-of-systems. Simulations
   interoperability requires a common structure and meaning of shared data
   represented in a Federation Object Model (FOM). Developing the FOM and
   modifying simulations to comply with the FOM requires a significant
   amount of time and effort. We describe a system to automate portions of
   this task. Specifically we present a workflow by which existing
   simulations can be integrated in a semi-automated process to reduce the
   manual labor required. We use SysML to describe entities of the
   federated distributed simulation. These descriptions are used for
   automatic generation of the FOM and code required for HLA integration.
   Finally we present a case study applying this methodology to create a
   federated distributed simulation to study sustainable urban growth.}},

   a mixture distribution over the solution space and updates the mixture
   distribution based on the sampled solutions' domination count such that
   the future search is biased towards the set of Pareto optimal solutions.
   The proposed algorithm seeks to find a mixture distribution on the
   solution space so that 1) each component of the mixture distribution is
   a degenerate distribution centered at a Pareto optimal solution and 2)
   each estimated Pareto optimal solution is uniformly spread across the
   Pareto optimal set by a threshold distance. We demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed algorithm on several benchmark problems.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic simulation is driven by the input model, which is a
   collection of distributions that model the randomness in the system. The
   input model is often constructed from data, and hence input uncertainty
   arises due to the finiteness of data. Simulation optimization has been
   mostly studied under the assumption of a known input model, without
   accounting for input uncertainty. We propose a new framework to study
   simulation optimization under input uncertainty, with the goal to
   balance the trade-off between optimizing under the estimated input model
   and hedging against the risk brought by input uncertainty. A simple
   numerical example illustrates different formulations under the new
   framework, compared with the usual formulation for simulation

Abstract = {{We consider stochastic optimization problems in which the input
   probability distribution is not fully known, and can only be observed
   through data. Common procedures handle such problems by optimizing an
   empirical counterpart, namely via using an empirical distribution of the
   input. The optimal solutions obtained through such procedures are hence
   subject to uncertainty of the data. In this paper, we explore techniques
   to quantify this uncertainty that have potentially good finite-sample
   performance. We consider three approaches: the empirical likelihood
   method, nonparametric Bayesian approach, and the bootstrap approach.
   They are designed to approximate the confidence intervals or posterior
   distributions of the optimal values or the optimality gaps. We present
   computational procedures for each of the approaches and discuss their
   relative benefits. A numerical example on conditional value-at-risk is
   used to demonstrate these methods.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling of detailed community interaction dynamics increases a public
   health organization's ability to contain a potential disease strain at
   an early stage. Due to its dense population and high levels of human
   movements and interactions, Hong Kong has suffered from various epidemic
   diseases. The use of nonmedical interventions is often efficacious in
   containing pandemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the
   effectiveness of various practical school-related non-medical
   intervention strategies to mitigate the effects of pandemic influenza
   under a realistic Hong Kong demographic scenario. We modelled the impact
   of a combination of various school closure modes, triggers, types, and
   lengths. The simulation results suggest that the strategy of closing all
   types of schools generally outperforms that of closing only a subset,
   especially if the closure period is substantial. We also discuss future
   research directions along with individual school closure and economic

Abstract = {{The pooling problem is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem (NLP)
   with applications in the refining and petrochemical industries, but also
   the coal mining industry. The problem can be stated as follows: given a
   set of raw material suppliers (inputs) and qualities of the supplies,
   find a cost-minimising way of blending these raw materials in
   intermediate pools and outputs so as to satisfy requirements on the
   output qualities. The blending in two stages (in pools and outputs)
   introduces bilinear constraints. The pooling problem can alternatively
   be described as a minimum cost network flow problem with additional
   bilinear constraints to capture the blending of raw materials.
   In this paper we study a variation of the pooling problem that arises
   naturally in the coal mining industry and is sometimes referred to as
   grade targeting. Coal is made-to-order according to customers' desired
   product qualities. Deviations from these target qualities result in
   contractually agreed bonuses and penalties. In the pooling problem
   variation we study, costs are associated with these bonuses and
   penalties instead of network flows. While in the original pooling
   problem we have hard bounds on the qualities and unmet demand is
   penalised in the objective function, in our coal mining variation we
   have hard demand constraints and deviations from target qualities are
   penalised. This makes finding a feasible solution easy, while in the
   pooling problem finding a nontrivial feasible solution that satisfies
   the quality requirements is already hard. An implication of this is that
   we are able to solve larger problem instances than those typically
   studied in the pooling problem literature.
   To model the coal blending process accurately, we define a time-expanded
   network where the intermediate pools represent coal stockpiles over
   time. Since coal is transported in large quantities, we study the
   trade-off between continuous and discretized flows in coal blending,
   i.e., solving a continuous flow problem where arbitrarily small flows
   are allowed versus solving a discretized flow problem where flows must
   be in multiples of some basic unit, e.g. trainloads. We also study two
   exact mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) linearizations of these
   mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs), which can be derived from
   unary and binary expansions of the flow integrality constraint. Such
   discretizations are typically studied as approximations to an originally
   continuous problem, however, in our application, a discretized
   formulation describes the original problem more accurately than a
   continuous formulation.
   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, we introduce the
   pooling problem and present a variant of the well-known PQ-formulation.
   In Section 1.2, we extend the pooling problem to model a simplified coal
   supply chain. After a short literature review on coal supply chains, we
   present four different problems: the continuous flow problem (a MINLP),
   in which arbitrarily small flows are allowed, and three discretized flow
   problems (a MINLP and two MILPs), in which flows must be in multiples of
   trainloads. The discretization can be achieved by adding integrality
   constraints for the flow variables. We then show how to overcome the
   nonlinearity which is inherent in the pooling problem with the use of
   unary and binary expansions of the integer flow variables, which yields
   exact MILP reformulations of the discretized MINLP. We conclude the
   paper with Section 2 where we provide computational results for the four
   different problems which we solve for a real-life industry setting.}},

Abstract = {{Effective methods for isolation and purification of glycoproteins and
   other glycoconjugates are important to biopharmaceutical industry and
   diagnostic industry. They are also critical to an emerging field of
   glycoproteomics. In this work, we applied the newly-developed affinity
   ligand, a fusion protein of elastic like polymer (ELP) and a bacterial
   lectin, in an affinity precipitation process to purify soybean
   peroxidase (SBP) based on the presence of fucoseon the protein surface.
   We addressed, in particular, the challenge of purifying a low abundant
   protein from a complex dilute crude plant extract. The novel affinity
   precipitation developed in this work was very promising. One step
   binding and precipitation resulted in >95\% recovery yield directly from
   crude extract and a 22.7 fold purification, giving a specific activity
   of 420 U/mg. The SBP isolated using this affinity precipitation meets or
   exceeds the quality specifications of reagent grade products by Sigma.
   We showed that the recovery yield had a strong dependence on the molar
   ratio of ligand to target fucosylated protein, with a ratio of three
   giving nearly full recovery, which could be predicted based on the total
   fucose content per protein molecule and the number of binding site per
   ligand molecule. We additionally developed a method of ligand
   regeneration and investigated its reuse. A simple wash with pH buffer
   was shown to be effective to regenerate the binding capacity for the
   ligand, and the ligand could be used for 10 times, giving an averaged
   80\% isolation yield based on initial input of soybean peroxidase. Taken
   together, an effective method of affinity precipitation was developed,
   which could be used to enrich a low abundant target glycoprotein from a
   complex mixture with a high recovery yield. The high selectivity for
   fucosylated protein and its ease of operation make this method
   particularly useful for purification of low abundant glycoprotein from
   natural sources. This work establishes a non-chromatography
   glycoform-specific purification method and extends the useful ELP-based
   affinity precipitation to glycoproteins.}},

Abstract = {{Though survival rates for women with stage I breast cancer have
   radically improved, treatment options remain poor for the 40\% of women

   chemotherapeutic treatment strategies are critical to eradicate any

   most ultimately fail in the clinic. One aspect often lost during testing
   is in vivo circulation half-lives rarely exceed 24 hours, whereas in
   vitro studies involve drug exposure for 2-3 days. Here, we show how
   mimicking these exposure times alters efficacy. Next, using this model
   we show how drug response is highly time-dependent by extending analysis
   of cell viability out to two weeks. Variations in response both with
   feeding and time were dependent on drug mechanism of action. Finally, we
   show that by implementing this temporal knowledge of drug effects to
   optimize scheduling of drug administration we are able to regain
   chemosensitivity in a Carboplatin-resistant cell line.}},

Abstract = {{On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are
   separated from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against
   malware and compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes,
   less clear is whether such isolation is effective against different kind
   of cross-app resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To
   better understand the problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we
   conducted a systematic security analysis on MAC OS X and iOS. Our
   research leads to the discovery of a series of high-impact security
   weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious app, approved by the
   Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps' sensitive data.
   More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services,
   including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS X and URL
   Scheme on OS X and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal
   such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and
   bank, and the secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the App
   sandbox on OS X was found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private
   directory to the sandboxed malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As
   a result, sensitive user data, like the notes and user contacts under
   Evernote and photos under WeChat, have all been disclosed.
   Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of app-to-app and
   app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts, we
   developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of OS X and
   iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their
   code. Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness
   of the weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not
   be easily fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts
   on OS X, helping protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be
   fully addressed. We further discuss the insights from this study and the
   lessons learnt for building a securer system.}},

   anisotropically-consolidated triaxial compression tests (CAUC). Shear
   wave velocities were measured in the field by downhole tests (DHT), in
   many cases via seismic piezocones (SCPTu). Analyses of the compiled
   database found approximate trends between undrained shear strength and
   shear wave velocity. Tentative correlations are explored by including
   other various parameters such as Atterberg limits, void ratio,
   overconsolidation ratio (OCR), and effective vertical stresses. The
   correlative trends may aid geotechnical engineers in helping to assess
   s(u) profiles in clay deposits in preliminary investigations and as an
   independent method in collaboration with sampling, lab testing, and
   other field data.}},

Title = {{High-Speed Spatial-Spectral Encoding with PEPSI and Spiral MRSI}},
Journal = {{EMAGRES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{587-600}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), also called
   spectroscopic imaging (SI) or chemical shift imaging (CSI), has become a
   valuable tool for mapping metabolites in human brain, prostate, breast,
   and other organs. However, commercially available phase-encoded MRSI
   methods require long acquisition times, which limit clinical
   applications. High-speed MRSI methods based on echo-planar and spiral
   encoding have become viable alternatives to conventional proton MRSI for
   clinical research applications that demand short scan times, large
   volume coverage, and high spatial resolution. This article describes the
   principles of proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) and
   spiral MRSI, with an emphasis on designing robust data acquisition and
   reconstruction methods for routine applications. Covered topics include:
   ramp sampling, gridding, off-resonance correction, even-odd echo editing
   of PEPSI data, sensitivity comparison with conventional phase-encoded
   MRSI, gradient and receiver hardware requirements, sensitivity to eddy
   currents and magnetic field inhomogeneity, and variable density k-space
   sampling. Advanced topics include: the integration of acceleration
   techniques, such as parallel imaging and compressed sensing that take
   advantage of using large-scale array coils; the selection of volume
   prelocalization techniques; and implementation at different field
   strengths. The article will conclude with selected research applications
   in human brain that highlight the advantages of high-speed MRSI.}},

   curves using thickness and camber for constraining the design space. The
   aimed objective of the exercise was easy computation, and incorporation
   of the scheme into the conceptual design phase of a low-reynolds number
   UAV for the SAE Aerodesign Competition. The 2D aerodynamic analyses and
   optimization routine are accomplished using the Xfoil code and MATLAB
   respectively. The effects of changing the number of design variables is
   presented. Also, the investigation shows better performance in the case
   of Teaching-Learning based optimization and Particle swarm optimization

Title = {{An efficient architecture for energy recovery in hydraulic elevators}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLUID POWER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{83-98}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces an efficient architecture for hydraulically
   counter-weighting an elevator system while controlling for cab speed. A
   physical model of the architecture is developed and posed as a
   single-input single-output system in which the ratio of two hydraulic
   pump/motor swash plate angles serve as the control input for regulating
   the output cab speed. Heuristic control rules based on efficiency
   considerations and elevator operation are posed for the swash plate
   angles. A high-fidelity simulation tool is then employed to assess the
   new architecture and control approach. Simulations demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the devised control strategy and the overall
   satisfactory operation of the elevator system. Simulations also provide
   comparisons of the new architecture's efficiency vs. an electrohydraulic
   elevator architecture employing a motor/generator for energy capture and
   return. It's shown that the introduced architecture yields up to a 13\%
   increase in actuation efficiency over the electrohydraulic system, and
   up to a 23\% reduction in input energy over a day's operation. It is
   anticipated that the gains in energy efficiency, and the reduced
   complexity and cost (vs. electrohydraulic systems), make the new
   architecture attractive for continued exploration.}},

Title = {{Growing Up: Not an Easy Transition-Perspectives of Patients and Parents
   regarding Transfer from a Pediatric Liver Transplant Center to Adult
   Care}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The transition from pediatric to adult care is a critical time when
   children with chronic illness sustain high morbidity and mortality.
   Transition services need to be focused on the adolescents' needs, which
   may differ from those perceived by healthcare providers. In this study,
   a survey of 31 patients with chronic liver disease and/or liver
   transplant who were ``transferred{''} to adult services within the last
   3 years was conducted. Patients were asked about their current health
   status and their perceptions of the overall transfer process. The mean
   age at transfer was 19.81 (18-21) years. Almost half the patients (47\%)
   were not seen at the adult facility until 2-6 months after leaving the
   Children's hospital and 20\% were not seen until 6-12 months. About 20\%
   had their first contact with adult services through an emergency room
   visit. About 19\% reported being out of medication during transition. Of
   the transplanted patients, 19\% were being evaluated for a retransplant.
   Themajority (82\%) felt that an increased emphasis on promoting
   independence and ``letting go{''} both by parents and by pediatric care
   providers was critical in their transition to independence and adult
   care services. This study provides thought-provoking insights, which are
   critical in designing the ideal transition program for children with
   chronic diseases.}},

Title = {{Effect of Uniaxial Deformation on Structure and Transport in Hydrated
   Nafion 117: Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{131-147}},
Abstract = {{The deformation of hydrated Nafion 117 was implemented using
   full-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation method to elucidate how the
   mechanical deformation affects the structure and transport of hydrated
   Nafion membrane. First, Nafion 117 membrane was equilibrated with 20 wt.
   \% water content through an annealing procedure. The simulated
   characteristic correlation length and the diffusion coefficient of water
   and hydronium ions were analyzed for comparison with those observed in
   experiments. Then, the equilibrated Nafion membrane was deformed
   uniaxially up to 300 \% of strain with a constant strain rate. The
   change in nanophase-segregation of hydrated Nafion during the
   deformation process was characterized using a directional structure
   factor as well as the pair correlation function in order to achieve
   fundamental understanding of the relationship of such structural change
   as a function of strain with the proton transport. It was found from the
   pair correlation analysis that the sulfonate distribution and
   sulfonate-hydronium correlation became stronger through the deformation
   while the hydronium ion solvation and the internal structure of water
   phase were not dependent on the deformation. From the directional
   structure factor profile, it was found that the long range correlation
   was developed in the perpendicular direction to the extension. The
   diffusions of water and hydronium ions were enhanced by 30 and 2 \%,
   respectively, after the deformation. From this study, we suggested that
   it is desirable to investigate the proton transport using simulation
   methods covering larger dimensions with a long time scale.}},

Title = {{Transient thermal response of micro-thermal conductivity detector (mu
   TCD) for the identification of gas mixtures: An ultra-fast and low power
   method}},
Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Micro-thermal conductivity detector (mu TCD) gas sensors work by
   detecting changes in the thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium
   and are used as detectors in many applications such as gas
   chromatography systems. Conventional TCDs use steady-state resistance
   (i.e., temperature) measurements of a micro-heater. In this work, we
   developed a new measurement method and hardware configuration based on
   the processing of the transient response of a low thermal mass TCD to an
   electric current step. The method was implemented for a 100-mu m-long
   and 1-mu m-thick micro-fabricated bridge that consisted of doped
   polysilicon conductive film passivated with a 200-nm silicon nitride
   layer. Transient resistance variations of the mu TCD in response to a
   square current pulse were studied in multiple mixtures of dilute gases
   in nitrogen. Simulations and experimental results are presented and
   compared for the time resolved and steady-state regime of the sensor
   response. Thermal analysis and simulation show that the sensor response
   is exponential in the transient state, that the time constant of this
   exponential variation was a linear function of the thermal conductivity
   of the gas ambient, and that the sensor was able to quantify the mixture
   composition. The level of detection in nitrogen was estimated to be from
   25 ppm for helium to 178 ppm for carbon dioxide. With this novel
   approach, the sensor requires approximately 3.6 nJ for a single
   measurement and needs only 300 mu s of sampling time. This is less than
   the energy and time required for steady-state DC measurements.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Extracellular matrix (ECM)-based implantable neural electrodes (NEs)
   were achieved using a microfabrication strategy on
   natural-substrate-based organic materials. The ECM-based design
   minimized the introduction of non-natural products into the brain.
   Further, it rendered the implants sufficiently rigid for penetration
   into the target brain region and allowed them subsequently to soften to
   match the elastic modulus of brain tissue upon exposure to physiological
   conditions, thereby reducing inflammatory strain fields in the tissue.
   Preliminary studies suggested that ECM-NEs produce a reduced
   inflammatory response compared with inorganic rigid and flexible
   approaches. In vivo intracortical recordings from the rat motor cortex
   illustrate one mode of use for these ECM-NEs.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the design, fabrication, and testing of
   biodegradable magnesium/ iron batteries featuring polycaprolactone (PCL)
   as a packaging and functional material. The use of PCL encapsulation
   minimized the electrochemical cell volume and supported longer discharge
   lifetimes and higher discharge rates than state-of-the-art biodegradable
   batteries. Specifically, the electrodes were separated and insulated by
   a 5 mu m- thick PCL layer that served as both a battery packaging
   material and a permeable coating for physiological solution to penetrate
   and activate the battery. A systematic investigation of the electrode
   size, discharge rates, electrolyte selection, and polymeric coating
   revealed the critical reactions and phenomena governing the performance
   of the Mg-based biodegradable batteries. Comparison with previous
   reports on biodegradable batteries and medical-grade non-degradable
   lithium-ion batteries demonstrated the superior performance of
   PCL-coated Mg/Fe batteries at these size scales, which exhibited an
   energy density of 694 Wh kg(-1) and a total volume of 0.02 cm(3).}},

Abstract = {{By laboratory flume tests of barrier dams, this article focuses on the
   erosion process and mechanism of dam breaking under the alternating
   action of hydraulic scour and gravitational erosion. The dam overtopping
   experiments under different conditions within a flume were conducted,
   including four influential factors: the dam height, dam slope, storage
   capacity and dam material, to observe and analyze the dam-break flow,
   the amount of dam erosion, interactional mechanism of vertical incised
   scouring process, transverse broadening process and retrogressive
   erosion process. Four synchronized high-speed cameras were used to
   record the profiles of the dam body and the transient stages of the
   water surface. A conclusion is drawn as follows: the dam height, dam
   slope, storage capacity, and the amount of silver sand are positively
   related to the maximum peak discharge and are negative to the peak time;
   the four factors have collaborative influence on the erosion ability,
   erosion duration and washing range of the flow, and can further
   influence the erosion processes and erosion rates in three directions;
   the collapse of slope and `scarp' retrocession can lead to periodic
   variation of the erosion volume of retrogressive process in the flushing
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of outfall discharges in coastal waters involves hydrodynamic
   phenomena that act over wide ranges of temporal and spatial scales. Near
   field mixing occurs within a few minutes and a few tens of meters after
   which the plume is either trapped by density stratification or reaches
   the water surface. It then drifts with the current and is diffused by
   oceanic turbulence in the far field by processes that occur on time
   scales of hours to days and length scales of hundreds of meters to
   kilometers. It is not feasible to encompass all these scales in one
   model, so separate models are needed for the near and far fields that
   must be coupled.
   Near field mixing depends on the wastewater flow rate, current speed and
   direction, and density stratification. These can vary rapidly, resulting
   in wide variations of plume rise height and dilution; they can be
   simulated by the model NRFIELD. Far field transport depends on
   large-scale circulation patterns driven by winds, tides, and local
   freshwater sources; these processes can be simulated by the hydrodynamic
   model Delft3D. In this paper we describe the coupling of NRFIELD and
   Delft3D to produce a state-of-the-art system for predicting the impacts
   of wastewater discharges in coastal waters.
   Three steps are involved. First, Delft3D-FLOW is run to generate time
   series of currents and density stratifications near the diffuser. These
   time series are then used as inputs to NRFIELD, producing a time series
   of plume behavior, especially its rise height, thickness, and dilution.
   This time series in turn becomes an input to the transport modules of
   Delft3D. Mass sources of, for example bacteria, are apportioned into the
   grid cells that overlap the plume with initial concentrations and
   volumes computed from the near field dilution. The far field advective
   transport is then predicted by a model that uses the currents from the
   FLOW module, and either the gradient-diffusion type water quality model
   WAQ, or the particle-tracking model PART. For bacteria, the particle
   tracking module is best as it does not suffer from high numerical
   diffusion that can considerably overestimate impacts at specific
   locations and decay models of bacterial mortality can be readily
   incorporated. In this paper we describe the procedure for coupling
   NRFIELD and Delft3D and give an example application to San Francisco,
   California.}},

Title = {{Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Pilot Study of
   D-Cycloserine in Chronic Stroke}},
Journal = {{REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the USA. Up to 60\%
   of patients do not fully recover despite intensive physical therapy
   treatment. N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors(NMDA-R) have been shown to
   play a role in synaptic plasticity when activated. D-Cycloserine
   promotes NMDA receptor function by binding to receptors with unoccupied
   glycine sites. These receptors are involved in learning and memory. We
   hypothesized that D-cycloserine, when combined with robotic-assisted
   physiotherapy (RAP), would result in greater gains compared with placebo
   + RAP in stroke survivors. Participants (n = 14) were randomized to
   Dcycloserine plus RAP or placebo plus RAP. Functional, cognitive, and
   quality-of-life measures were used to assess recovery. There was
   significant improvement in grip strength of the affected hand within
   both groups from baseline to 3 weeks (95\% confidence interval for mean
   change, 3.95 +/- 2.96 to 4.90 +/- 3.56 N for D-cycloserine and 5.72 +/-
   3.98 to 8.44 +/- 4.90 N for control). SIS mood domain showed improvement
   for both groups (95\% confidence interval for mean change, 72.6 +/- 16.3
   to 82.9 +/- 10.9 for D-cycloserine and 82.9 +/- 13.5 to 90.3 +/- 9.9 for
   control). This preliminary study does not provide evidence that
   D-cycloserine can provide greater gains in learning compared with
   placebo for stroke survivors.}},

   Cerebral Palsy Using Super Pop VR Evaluation Metrics: A Feasibility
   Study}},
Journal = {{REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether
   Super Pop VR, a low-cost virtual reality (VR) system, was a feasible
   system for documenting improvement in children with cerebral palsy (CP)
   and whether a home-based VR intervention was effective. Methods. Three
   children with CP participated in this study and received an 8-week VR
   intervention (30 minutes x 5 sessions/week) using the commercial EyeToy
   PlayVR system. Reaching kinematics measured by Super PopVR and two fine
   motor tools (Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency second
   edition, BOT-2, and Pediatric Motor Activity Log, PMAL) were tested
   before, mid, and after intervention. Results. All children successfully
   completed the evaluations using the Super Pop VR system at home where
   85\% of the reaches collected were used to compute reaching kinematics,
   which is compatible with literature using expensive motion analysis
   systems. Only the child with hemiplegic CP and more impaired arm
   function improved the reaching kinematics and functional use of the
   affected hand after intervention. Conclusion. Super Pop VR proved to be
   a feasible evaluation tool in children with CP.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades moderate/severe earthquakes often caused great
   damage to bridge decks due to their mutual collision and large residual
   deck offset due to yielding in the traditional steel restrainers. This
   issue raises a need of developing a smart expansion joint with a high
   recentering strength to prevent decks from collision and to restore the
   original configuration. Buckling restrained SMA can provide a much
   higher recentering strength than unconfined SMA (approximately 1.2
   similar to 1.5 times), which significantly reduces the amount of SMA and
   thereby the cost of the smart expansion joint proposed herein. The other
   important feature is that the proposed recentering mechanism always
   causes the confined SMA compressive, rather than tensile, when the
   expansion joint is in either tension or compression. This innovative
   recentering mechanism eliminates the issue of SMA's break due to tensile
   strain limitation (approximately 0.12 strain). To verify the proposed
   buckling-restrained SMA symmetrical expansion joint, an individual
   recentering bucking restrained SMA device was quasi-statically tested in
   a uniaxial MTS 810 testing machine. The observed hysteresis of the
   device under cyclic loading shows high strength symmetrical
   tension/compression loops, together with a relative large ductility. The
   obtained experimental results were used to calibrate a confined SMA
   model in OpenSees. Finally, a three-span simply supported steel bridge
   with the proposed buckling restrained SMA expansion joints that have a
   high recentering tension/compression strength was numerically
   investigated using incremental dynamic analysis. The results reveal the
   high recentering ability of the bridge.}},

Pages = {{12-24}},
Abstract = {{The development and application of decellularized extracellular matrices
   (ECM) has grown rapidly in the fields of cell biology, tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine in recent years. Similar to
   decellularized tissues and whole organs, cell-derived matrices (CDM)
   represent bioactive, biocompatible materials consisting of a complex
   assembly of fibrillar proteins, matrix macromolecules and associated
   growth factors that often recapitulate, at least to some extent, the
   composition and organization of native ECM microenvironments. The unique
   ability to engineer CDM de novo based on cell source and culture methods
   makes them an attractive alternative to conventional allogeneic and
   xenogeneic tissue-derived matrices that are currently harvested from
   cadaveric sources, suffer from inherent heterogeneity, and have limited
   ability for customization. Although CDM have been investigated for a

Abstract = {{In this study, a three-stage oxidoreduction potential (ORP) control
   strategy was developed to improve propionic acid (PA) production using
   engineered Propionibacterium jensenii ATCC 4868 (pZGX04-gldA) in a 3-L
   bioreactor. Specifically, ORP was controlled at -200 mV from 0 to 36 h,
   -300 mV from 36 to 156 h, and -400 mV after 156 h. The PA titer
   increased from 21.38 to 27.31 g/L. The effects of ORP regulation on key
   intracellular metabolites were studied, demonstrating that ORP can both
   regulate NADH/NAD(+) ratio and the activities of some enzymes involved
   in electron transport and redistribute metabolic flux. We integrated the
   ORP control strategy with a fed-batch culture method and increased PA
   production to 39.53 g/L. This new ORP control strategy may be useful in
   the optimization of other anaerobic processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A study of supercapacitor charge redistribution for applications in

Volume = {{273}},

Abstract = {{As an important energy storage device for wireless sensor nodes with
   energy harvesting capabilities, the characteristics of supercapacitors
   need to be taken into account in developing power management solutions.
   While supercapacitor self-discharge is usually considered because it
   causes voltage decay and energy loss, supercapacitor charge
   redistribution has not been well examined although this process may
   result in a greater voltage change than self-discharge. This paper
   studies the supercapacitor voltage change during charge redistribution.
   The supercapacitor voltage may increase, decrease, or remain almost
   constant during charge redistribution depending on the initial state.
   Three approaches are employed to investigate the supercapacitor voltage
   change during charge redistribution: analytical estimations, numerical
   simulations, and experimental measurements. Both the supercapacitor
   voltage change after a charge process and that after a discharge process
   are examined. Various parameters of the charge or discharge process such
   as charge current and discharge time that affect the initial state of
   supercapacitor charge redistribution are swept. The results obtained
   using different approaches are consistent. These results can be utilized
   by wireless sensor network application designers to estimate the
   supercapacitor voltage change during charge redistribution. (C) 2014

Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{245}},

Abstract = {{In the past two decades, multiple observations of Venus have been made
   at X-Band (3.6 cm) using the Jansky Very Large Array (VIA), and maps
   have been created of the 3.6 cm emission from Venus (see, e.g., Devaraj,
   K. {[}2011]. The Centimeter- and Millimeter-Wavelength Ammonia
   Absorption Spectra under Jovian Conditions. PhD Thesis, Georgia
   Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA). Since the emission morphology is
   related both to surface features and to deep atmospheric absorption from
   CO2 and SO2 (see, e.g., Butler, B.J., Steffes, P.G., Suleiman, S.H.,
   Kolodner, M.A., Jenkins, J.M. {[}2001]. Icarus 154,226-238), knowledge
   of the microwave absorption properties of sulfur dioxide in a carbon
   dioxide atmosphere under conditions for the deep atmosphere of Venus is
   required for proper interpretation. Except for a single measurement
   campaign conducted at a single wavelength (3.2 cm) over 40 years ago
   (Ho, W., Kaufman, LA., Thaddeus, P. {[}1966]. J. Geophys. Res. 71,
   5091-5108), no measurements of the centimeter-wavelength properties of
   any Venus atmospheric constituent have been conducted under conditions
   characteristic of the deep atmosphere (pressures from 10 to 92 bars and
   temperatures from 400 to 700 K). New measurements of the microwave
   properties of SO2 and CO2 at wavelengths from 3.7 to 20 cm have been
   conducted under simulated conditions for the deep atmosphere of Venus,
   using a new high-pressure system. Results from this measurement campaign
   conducted at temperatures from 430 K to 560 K and at pressures up to 92
   bars are presented. Results indicate that the model for the
   centimeter-wavelength opacity from pure CO2 (Ho, W., Kaufman, I.A.,
   Thaddeus, P. {[}1966]. J. Geophys. Res. 71, 5091-5108), is valid over
   the entire centimeter-wavelength range under simulated conditions for
   the deep atmosphere of Venus. Additionally, the laboratory results
   indicate that both of the models for the centimeter-wavelength opacity
   of SO2 in a CO2 atmosphere from Suleiman et al. (Suleiman, S.H.,
   Kolodner, M.A., Steffes, P.G. {[}1996]. J. Geophys. Res. 101, 4623-4635)
   and from Fand and Steffes (Fand, A.K., Steffes, P.G. {[}1992]. Icarus
   97, 200-210) can reliably be used under conditions of the deep

Abstract = {{Implant-associated inflammation and bacterial infection severely limit
   the functional performance of medical devices and are a major cause of
   implant failure. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methodologies to
   monitor/image implant-associated aseptic inflammation and bacterial
   infection in a minimally invasive manner. Here, we exploited
   near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecular probes injected locally at
   the implant site to perform minimally invasive, simultaneous imaging of
   inflammation, and infection associated with implanted polymer disks. The
   hydro-sulfo-Cy5 (H-s-Cy5) probe detected reactive oxygen species
   associated with inflammatory responses to both aseptic and
   biofilm-containing implants, whereas diaminocyanine sulfonate
   selectively detected nitric oxide associated with a biofilm on the
   biomaterial at acute time points (<4 days). This imaging modality also
   allows longitudinal monitoring because of high specificity and fast
   clearance rate of the fluorescent probes. Taken together, these NIRF
   molecular probes represent a useful tool to directly image inflammatory
   responses and infections associated with implanted devices for the
   diagnosis of device-associated inflammation and infection as well as the
   development of effective therapies. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{Given the central role of dendritic cells (DCs) in directing T-cell
   phenotypes, the ability of biomaterial-treated DCs to dictate autologous
   T-cell phenotype was investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that
   differentially biomaterial-treated DCs differentially directed
   autologous T-cell phenotype and polarization, depending on the
   biomaterial used to pretreat the DCs. Immature DCs (iDCs) were derived
   from human peripheral blood monocytes and treated with biomaterial films
   of alginate, agarose, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, or 75:25
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), followed by co-culture of these
   biomaterial-treated DCs and autologous T cells. When autologous T cells
   were co-cultured with DCs treated with biomaterial film/antigen
   (ovalbumin, OVA) combinations, different biomaterial films induced
   differential levels of T-cell marker (CD4, CD8, CD25, CD69) expression,
   as well as differential cytokine profiles {[}interferon (IFN)-,
   interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-10, IL-4] in the polarization of T helper
   (Th) types. Dendritic cells treated with agarose films/OVA induced
   CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ (T regulatory cells) expression, comparable to untreated
   iDCs, on autologous T cells in the DC-T co-culture system. Furthermore,
   in this co-culture, agarose treatment induced release of IL-12p70 and
   IL-10 at higher levels as compared with DC treatment with other
   biomaterial films/OVA, suggesting Th1 and Th2 polarization,
   respectively. Dendritic cells treated with PLGA film/OVA treatment
   induced release of IFN- at higher levels compared with that observed for
   co-cultures with iDCs or DCs treated with all other biomaterial films.
   These results indicate that DC treatment with different biomaterial
   films has potential as a tool for immunomodulation by directing
   autologous T-cell responses. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

   function. The additive blending can be performed in a static or a
   dynamic manner. We demonstrate that the method, which has been
   originally developed for wall-bounded flows, can be used to simulate
   flows in complex configurations without requiring any further
   adjustments to the model. In this study, three canonical flows are
   simulated, which are representative of free-shear and wake flows. These
   cases include a temporally evolving mixing layer, flow past a circular
   cylinder in a uniform flow and flow past a finite-span airfoil placed in
   a uniform flow at three different angle of attacks. We analyse the role
   of static and dynamic blending functions, large-scale grid resolution
   and the effect of small scales on the instantaneous flow features and
   turbulence statistics. The results obtained from these cases demonstrate
   robustness, accuracy and consistency of the multi-scale TLS-LES method
   and show that the method is suitable for investigation of turbulent
   flows that encompass features such as massive separation, reattachment,
   transition to turbulence and unsteady wake, which are challenging to
   model numerically.}},

Abstract = {{Convection in a layer of fluid with a free surface due to a combination
   of thermocapillary stresses and buoyancy has been studied extensively
   under atmospheric conditions. However, recent experimental results have
   shown that removing most of the air from a sealed cavity significantly
   alters the flow structure and, in particular, suppresses transitions
   between different convection patterns found at atmospheric conditions.
   On the other hand, removing air has a very small effect on the flow
   speed, while a simple analytical estimate predicts that complete removal
   of noncondensable gases such as air should reduce the flow speed by an
   order of magnitude. To understand these unexpected results, we have
   formulated and numerically implemented a detailed transport model that
   takes into account mass and heat transport in both phases in the absence
   of noncondensables. The model was used to investigate how the flow is
   affected by the magnitude of the (poorly defined) accommodation
   coefficient and by the temperature jump across the liquid-vapor
   interface predicted by some phase change models. Our results eliminate
   both effects as possible explanations for the unexpected experimental
   observations, suggesting that the small amount of air left in the cavity
   in the experiments is the most likely, albeit somewhat unexpected,
   explanation for the observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a process that can capture electrical
   energy from salinity gradients between seawater and river water through
   permselective ion exchange membranes. As ion exchange membranes are a
   key element in a RED system, enhancing their electrochemical
   characteristics is critical to maximizing system power performance. This
   study presents the preparation of porous nanocomposite cation exchange
   membranes via a two-step phase inversion technique. The phase inversion
   process controlled the structural variation (porosity) of the polymeric
   membranes in the presence of functionalized iron (III) oxide
   (Fe2O3-SO42-), which subsequently led to significantly improved
   electrochemical performance. A porous nanocomposite membrane containing
   an optimal amount of Fe2O3-SO42- (0.7 wt\%) at a thickness of 30 mu m
   performed best, as it had an area resistance of 0.82 Omega cm(2) and a
   permselectivity of 85.6\%. Application of this membrane in a RED system
   achieved gross power density of up to 1.4 W m(-2), which exceeds the
   power density obtained with the commercially available CSO (Selemion
   (TM), Japan) membranes. Thus, effective design of ion exchange membranes
   through structure optimization increases the feasibility of salinity
   gradient power generation by RED. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In Compressive Sensing, the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) ensures
   that robust recovery of sparse vectors is possible from noisy,
   undersampled measurements via computationally tractable algorithms. It
   is by now well-known that Gaussian (or, more generally, sub-Gaussian)
   random matrices satisfy the RIP under certain conditions on the number
   of measurements. Their use can be limited in practice, however, due to
   storage limitations, computational considerations, or the mismatch of
   such matrices with certain measurement architectures. These issues have
   recently motivated considerable effort towards studying the RIP for
   structured random matrices. In this paper, we study the RIP for block
   diagonal measurement matrices where each block on the main diagonal is
   itself a sub-Gaussian random matrix. Our main result states that such
   matrices can indeed satisfy the RIP but that the requisite number of
   measurements depends on certain properties of the basis in which the
   signals are sparse. In the best case, these matrices perform nearly as
   well as dense Gaussian random matrices, despite having many fewer
   nonzero entries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Block coherence of matrices plays an important role in analyzing the

   metrics: worst-case and average block coherence. First, we present lower
   bounds on worst-case block coherence, in both the general case and also
   when the matrix is constrained to be a union of orthobases. We then
   present deterministic matrix constructions based upon Kronecker products
   which obtain these lower bounds. We also characterize the worst-case
   block coherence of random subspaces. Finally, we present a flipping
   algorithm that can improve the average block coherence of a matrix,
   while maintaining the worstcase block coherence of the original matrix.
   We provide numerical examples which demonstrate that our proposed
   deterministic matrix construction performs well in block compressed

Abstract = {{As an industrial case study, esterification of acetic acid with
   1-methoxy-2-propanol using a cation exchange resin has been investigated
   using a well-stirred batch reactor and chromatographic reactor.
   Well-stirred batch reactor experiments were conducted over different
   operating conditions to analyze the reaction equilibrium and kinetics.
   It was found that the final conversion was limited by equilibrium, and
   temperature had no significant effect on increasing the final
   conversion. Parameters in a reaction rate model were obtained at
   different temperatures (50-90 degrees C). Since the well-stirred batch
   experiment alone was not enough to capture the adsorption behavior of
   the system, pulse injections of each component into the chromatographic
   column were conducted to obtain the adsorption parameters. The
   esterification reaction was performed systematically in a lab-scaled
   chromatographic reactor at different flow rates (0.2-1 ml/min),
   injection volumes (0.05 ml, 0.5 ml), and temperatures (70-110 degrees
   C). A mathematical model for isothermal equilibrium dispersive model was
   implemented and parameters were determined by fitting the model to the
   experimental data. It was observed that when the injection volume of
   single component was too large, two reaction sites were formed inside
   the column, resulting in a deformed peak shape of the product in the
   outlet chromatogram. Nearly 100\% of conversion, which was infeasible in
   the well-stirred batch reactor, was achieved when the flow rate was low
   and the injection volume was small. The results indicate that the
   chromatographic reactor enhanced the reaction beyond the equilibrium by
   separating the products from the reaction sites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Acoustic source tracking in long baseline microphone arrays}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{38-45}},

Abstract = {{Long baseline microphone arrays, where the distance between single
   microphones is large, is a cost-effective method to monitor activity in
   a large region of interest. The high range between source and sensors in
   a long baseline setup, generally leads to low signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNR). This affect the performance of localization. This paper
   investigates how energy based localization (EBL) can be used for
   localization and tracking of both single and multiple acoustic sources,
   within a long baseline array. Least-Squares (LS) optimization have been
   used for EBL-based localization, however the localization performance is
   sensitive to low SNR We propose a tracking scheme based on a cost
   reference particle filter (CRPF) to increase performance during low SNR.
   The CRPF is a new class of particle filters which is able to estimate
   the system state from the available observations without a priori
   knowledge of any probability density function. We present a modified
   cost function, for EBL based localization, which is incorporated in the
   CRPF framework to increase tracking performance during simulated wind
   gusts and background noise. The proposed method outperforms LS based
   localization in the case of low SNR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The article reports on the design of a novel class of transducers for
   structural health monitoring and strain sensing designed using a
   Fourier-based approach. The design procedure formulates the problem
   considering an arbitrarily shaped distribution of the sensing surface.
   Interrogation of the sensors is based on the generation of guided and
   surface acoustic waves generated in the region surrounding the
   transducers. The representation of the distribution of the sensing
   material is analyzed and designed in the spatial Fourier domain, where
   the emission characteristics of the transducer in relation to the
   interrogating wave can be tailored to a specific application. For
   structural health monitoring, the sensing material distribution can be
   defined to provide the transducers with frequency-dependent directional
   properties, which can be employed as part of an interrogation scheme
   based on generation and processing of guided waves in the structure. For
   strain sensing, one-dimensional and two-dimensional grating
   configurations monitor frequency shifts of radiation associated to local
   straining of the gratings. These frequency shifts can be related to the
   local strain components, so that a rosette-like configuration can be
   implemented. The article illustrates the commonalities of the design
   procedure, which leads to novel Lamb wave and strain transducers, and
   suggests the potential integration of the two sensing modalities as a
   single device for health and usage monitoring of structural components.}},

   Denoising}},
Journal = {{IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{115-119}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most existing patch-based image denoising algorithms filter overlapping
   image patches and aggregate multiple estimates for the same pixel via
   weighting. Current weighting approaches always assume the restored
   estimates as independent random variables, which is inconsistent with
   the reality. In this letter, we analyze the correlation among the
   estimates and propose a bias-variance model to estimate the Mean Squared
   Error (MSE) under various weights. The new model exploits the
   overlapping information of the patches; it then utilizes the
   optimization to try to minimize the estimated MSE. Under this model, we
   propose a new weighting approach based on Quadratic Programming (QP),
   which can be embedded into various denoising algorithms. Experimental
   results show that the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of algorithms
   like K-SVD and EPLL can be improved by around 0.1 dB under a range of
   noise levels. This improvement is promising, since it is gained
   independent to which image model is used, especially when the gain from
   designing new image models becomes less and less.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a denoising methodology in the wavelet
   domain based on a Bayesian hierarchical model using Double Weibull
   prior. We propose two estimators, one based on posterior mean (Double
   Weibull Wavelet Shrinker, DWWS) and the other based on larger posterior
   mode (DWWS-LPM), and show how to calculate them efficiently.
   Traditionally, mixture priors have been used for modeling sparse wavelet
   coefficients. The interesting feature of this article is the use of
   non-mixture prior. We show that the methodology provides good denoising
   performance, comparable even to state-of-the-art methods that use
   mixture priors and empirical Bayes setting of hyper-parameters, which is
   demonstrated by extensive simulations on standardly used test functions.
   An application to real-word dataset is also considered.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the vertical growth of citrate-free Ag nanoplates
   into truncated right bipyramids and twinned cubes with truncated corners
   in the presence of Cl- ions at low and high concentrations,
   respectively, with Au serving as a marker for electron microscopy
   analysis. Both the Cl- ions and Au atoms could be introduced through the
   use of HAuCl4 as a dual agent. When HAuCl4 was added into an aqueous
   mixture of citrate-free Ag nanoplates, ascorbic acid (AA), and
   poly(vinylpyrrolidone), Au would be immediately formed and deposited on
   the surfaces of the nanoplates due to the reduction by both Ag and AA.
   The deposited Au could be easily resolved under STEM to reveal the
   growth patterns of the nanoplates. We found that the presence of Au did
   not change the growth pattern of the original Ag nanoplates. In
   contrast, the Cl- ions could deterministically direct the formation of
   Ag nanoplates with a triangular or hexagonal shape, followed by their
   further growth into truncated right bipyramids or twinned cubes with
   truncated corners upon the introduction of AgNO3. This work

Abstract = {{A dual-polarization coherent heterodyne optical communication system
   using a simplified and low-cost demodulation scheme, for high-capacity
   UDWDM-PON access networks, is proposed and demonstrated. In this scheme,
   the signal light and reference light occupying each of the polarization
   modes are emitted simultaneously from the transmitter. The random phase
   fluctuations between the signal light and reference light are obviated
   completely by means of the application of the phase-correlated
   orthogonal lights. When the signal light in the each polarization mode
   is modulated with M-amplitude-shift keying (M-ASK) or M-2-quadrature
   amplitude modulation (M-2-QAM), the phase-stable intermediate frequency
   (IF) signal with M-ASK or M-2-QAM modulation in the corresponding
   polarization mode is available for conversion in the electrical domain
   by beating the modulated signal light with the un-modulated reference
   light. A new IF signal with M-2 or M-4-QAM can be synthesized by the IF
   signals in both modes as long as the power ratio and time delay between
   the two-modes optical signals are set at the proper values. This is
   achieved without using polarization demultiplexing and complicated
   algorithms and the synthesized IF signal can be received and demodulated
   directly. A proof-of-concept transmission link with dual-polarization
   2-ASK is demonstrated. The experimental results are consistent with
   theoretical predictions. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

   magnitude higher than the typical values of original silk LbL shells and
   shows a significant, three-fold reduction in pore size. Such strong

Abstract = {{Electrical percolation in nanocomposites consisting of poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PMMA) and antimony tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles was
   investigated experimentally using monosize and polydisperse polymer
   particles. The nanocomposites were fabricated by compression molding at
   170 degrees C. The matrix PMMA was transformed into space filling
   polyhedra while the ATO nanoparticles distributed along the sharp edges
   of the matrix, forming a 3D interconnected network. The measured
   electrical resistivity showed that percolation was achieved in these
   materials at a very low ATO content of 0.99 wt \% ATO when monosize PMMA
   was used, whereas 1.48 wt \% ATO was needed to achieve percolation when
   the PMMA was polydispersed. A parametric finite element approach was
   chosen to model this unique microstructure-driven self-assembling
   percolation behavior. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to solve the effects
   of phase segregation between the matrix and the filler using a 2D
   simplified model in the frequency domain of the AC/DC module. It was
   found that the percolation threshold (pc) is affected by the size ratio
   between the matrix and the filler in a systematic way. Furthermore,
   simulations indicate that small deviations from perfect interconnection
   result mostly in changes in the electrical resistivity while the minimum
   DC resistivity achievable in any given composite is governed by the
   electrical conductivity of the filler, which must be accurately known in
   order to obtain an accurate prediction. The model is quite general and
   is able to predict percolation behavior in a number of other similarly
   processed segregated network nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible strain-driven sensor is an essential component in the flexible
   electronics. Especially, high durability and sensitivity to strain are
   required. Here, we present an efficient and low-cost fabrication
   strategy to construct a highly sensitive and flexible pressure sensor
   based on a conductive, elastic aerogel with pyramid design. When
   pressure is loaded, the contact area between the interfaces of the
   conductive aerogel and the copper electrode as well as among the
   building blocks of the nitrogen-doped carbon-nanotube-supported Ag
   (N-CNTs/Ag) aerogel monoliths, changes in reversible and directional
   manners. This contact resistance mechanism enables the hybrid aerogels
   to act as strain-driven sensors with high sensitivity and excellent
   on/off swithching behavior, and the gauge factor (GF) is similar to 15
   under strain of 3\%, which is superior to those reported for other
   aerogels. In addition, robust, elastomeric and conductive nanocomposites
   can be fabricated by injecting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into
   alginate/N-CNTs/Ag aerogels. Importantly, the building blocks forming
   the aerogels retain their initial contact and percolation after
   undergoing large-strain deformation, PDMS infiltration, and
   cross-linking of PDMS, suggesting their potential applications as strain
   sensors.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-Keto-gamma-methylthiobutyric acid (KMTB), a keto derivative of
   L-methionine, has great potential for use as an alternative to
   L-methionine in the poultry industry and as an anti-cancer drug. This
   study developed an environment friendly process for KMTB production from
   L-methionine by an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst expressing an
   engineered L-amino acid deaminase (L-AAD) from Proteus vulgaris. We
   first overexpressed the P. vulgaris L-AAD in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and
   further optimized the whole-cell transformation process. The maximal
   molar conversion ratio of L-methionine to KMTB was 71.2\% (mol/mol)
   under the optimal conditions (70 g/L L-methionine, 20 g/L whole-cell
   biocatalyst, 5 mM CaCl2, 40 degrees C, 50 mM Tris-HCl {[}pH 8.0]). Then,
   error-prone polymerase chain reaction was used to construct P. vulgaris
   L-AAD mutant libraries. Among approximately 10(4) mutants, two mutants
   bearing lysine 104 to arginine and alanine 337 to serine substitutions
   showed 82.2\% and 80.8\% molar conversion ratios, respectively.
   Furthermore, the combination of these mutations enhanced the catalytic
   activity and molar conversion ratio by 1.3-fold and up to 91.4\% with a
   KMTB concentration of 63.6 g/L. Finally, the effect of immobilization on
   whole-cell transformation was examined, and the immobilized whole-cell
   biocatalyst with Ca2+ alginate increased reusability by 41.3\% compared
   to that of free cell production. Compared with the traditional
   multi-step chemical synthesis, our one-step biocatalytic production of
   KMTB has an advantage in terms of environmental pollution and thus has
   great potential for industrial KMTB production.}},

   spin-component-scaling (SCS) variations on second-order perturbation
   theory (MP2) {[}SCS, SCS(N), SCS(MI)] and coupled cluster singles and
   doubles (CCSD) {[}SCS, SCS(MI)]; also, method combinations designed to
   improve dispersion contacts {[}DW-MP2, MP2C, MP2.5, DW-CCSD(T)-F12];
   where available, explicitly correlated (F12) counterparts are also
   considered. Dunning basis sets augmented by diffuse functions are
   employed for all accessible zeta-levels; truncations of the diffuse
   space are also considered. After examination of both accuracy and
   performance for 394 model chemistries, SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pVQZ can be
   recommended for general use, having good accuracy at low cost and no
   ill-effects such as imbalance between hydrogen-bonding and
   dispersion-dominated systems or non-parallelity across dissociation
   curves. Moreover, when benchmarking accuracy is desirable but
   gold-standard computations are unaffordable, this work recommends
   silver-standard {[}DW-CCSD(T{*}{*})-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ] and bronze-standard
   {[}MP2C-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ] model chemistries, which support accuracies of

Abstract = {{The anisotropic assembly of P3HT nanocrystallites into longer
   nanofibrillar structures was demonstrated via sequential UV irradiation
   after ultrasonication to the pristine polymer solutions. The morphology
   of resultant films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
   quantitative analysis of intra- and intermolecular ordering of polymer
   chains was performed by means of static absorption spectroscopy and
   quantitative modeling. Consequently, the approach to treat the precursor
   solution enhanced intra- and intermolecular ordering and reduced the
   incidence of grain boundaries within P3HT films, which contributed to
   the excellent charge carrier transport characteristics of the
   corresponding films (mu approximate to 12.0 x 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for
   96\% RR P3HT).}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a new method of combining Imaging Differential
   Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (Imaging-DOAS) data and plume dispersion
   formulas for power plant emissions to determine the three-dimensional
   structure of a dispersing pollution plume and the spatial distributions
   of trace gas volume mixing ratios (VMRs) under conditions of negligible
   water droplet and aerosol effects on radiative transfer within the
   plume. This novel remote-sensing method, applied to a power plant stack
   plume, was used to calculate the two-dimensional distributions of sulfur
   dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) VMRs in stack emissions for the
   first time. High SO2 VMRs were observed only near the emission source,
   whereas high NO2 VMRs were observed at locations several hundreds of
   meters away from the initial emission. The results of this study
   demonstrate the capability of this new method as a tool for estimating
   plume dimensions and trace gas VNIRs in power plant emissions.}},

Title = {{Distinct metabolic responses of an ovarian cancer stem cell line}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cancer metabolism is emerging as an important focus area in
   cancer research. However, the in vitro cell culture conditions under
   which much cellular metabolism research is performed differ drastically
   from in vivo tumor conditions, which are characterized by variations in
   the levels of oxygen, nutrients like glucose, and other molecules like
   chemotherapeutics. Moreover, it is important to know how the diverse
   cell types in a tumor, including cancer stem cells that are believed to
   be a major cause of cancer recurrence, respond to these variations.
   Here, in vitro environmental perturbations designed to mimic different
   aspects of the in vivo environment were used to characterize how an
   ovarian cancer cell line and its derived, isogenic cancer stem cells
   metabolically respond to environmental cues.
   Results: Mass spectrometry was used to profile metabolite levels in
   response to in vitro environmental perturbations. Docetaxel, the
   chemotherapeutic used for this experiment, caused significant metabolic
   changes in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism in ovarian cancer
   cells, but had virtually no metabolic effect on isogenic ovarian cancer
   stem cells. Glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and the combination thereof
   altered ovarian cancer cell and cancer stem cell metabolism to varying
   extents for the two cell types. Hypoxia had a much larger effect on
   ovarian cancer cell metabolism, while glucose deprivation had a greater
   effect on ovarian cancer stem cell metabolism. Core metabolites and
   pathways affected by these perturbations were identified, along with
   pathways that were unique to cell types or perturbations.
   Conclusions: The metabolic responses of an ovarian cancer cell line and
   its derived isogenic cancer stem cells differ greatly under most
   conditions, suggesting that these two cell types may behave quite
   differently in an in vivo tumor microenvironment. While cancer
   metabolism and cancer stem cells are each promising potential
   therapeutic targets, such varied behaviors in vivo would need to be
   considered in the design and early testing of such treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based materials have been utilized as a promising approach in
   designing high-performance electrodes for energy storage devices. In
   line with this approach, functionalized graphene electrodes have been
   self-assembled from the dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) in water at a
   low temperature of 80 degrees C using tetrahydroxy1-1,4-benzoquinone
   (THQ) as both the reducing and redox-active functionalization agent. We
   correlated the electrochemical performance of the electrode with surface
   oxygen chemistry, confirming the role of THQ for the reduction and
   redox-active fiinctionalization process. The assembled graphene
   electrodes have a 3D hierarchical porous structure, which can facilitate
   electronic and ionic transport to support fast charge storage reactions.
   Utilizing the surface redox reactions introduced by THQ the
   functionalized graphene electrodes exhibit high gravimetric capacities
   of similar to 165 mA h/g in Li cells and similar to 120 mA h/g in Na
   cells with high redox potentials over similar to 3 V versus Li or Na,
   proposing promising positive electrodes for both Li and Na ion

Abstract = {{The influence of substituents on p-stacking interactions has previously
   been explained by two competing hypotheses: a nonlocal effect in which
   tuning of the p density by the substituent alters the interaction (the
   Hunter-Sanders picture) or a local effect in which the direct
   interaction of the added substituent and changed polarity of the
   phenyl-substituent sigma bond alter the interaction (the Wheeler-Houk
   picture). In this work, we applied the recently developed
   functional-group partition of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory
   (F-SAPT) to directly quantify these two effects in situ. The results
   show that both pictures contribute to the change in interaction energy
   but that the Wheeler-Houk picture is usually dominant.}},

Abstract = {{Motion tracking is of great importance in a wide range of fields such as
   automation, robotics, security, sports and entertainment. Here, a
   self-powered, single-electrode-based triboelectric sensor (TES) is
   reported to accurately detect the movement of a moving object/body in
   two dimensions. Based on the coupling of triboelectric effect and
   electrostatic induction, the movement of an object on the top surface of
   a polytetrafl uoroethylene (PTFE) layer induces changes in the
   electrical potential of the patterned aluminum electrodes underneath.
   From the measurements of the output performance (open-circuit voltage
   and short-circuit current), the motion information about the object,
   such as trajectory, velocity, and acceleration is derived in conformity
   with the preset values. Moreover, the TES can detect motions of more
   than one objects moving at the same time. In addition, applications of
   the TES are demonstrated by using LED illuminations as real-time
   indicators to visualize the movement of a sliding object and the walking
   steps of a person.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a facile synthesis of Pd-Cu bimetallic tripods with
   a purity over 90\%. Two requirements must be met in order to form
   tripods: i) formation of triangular, plate-like seeds during the
   nucleation step and ii) preferential deposition of atoms onto the three
   corners of a seed during the growth step. In this synthesis, these
   requirements are fulfilled by adding CuCl2 and KBr into an aqueous
   synthesis. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the Cu atoms resulting
   from underpotential deposition could greatly reduce the energy barrier
   involved in the formation of triangular seeds with planar defects
   because of the much lower stacking fault energy (41 mJ.m(-2) for Cu vs
   220 mJ.m(-2) for Pd). The Br- ions could strongly bind to the three
   \{100\} side faces of a triangular seed, forcing the Pd atoms to grow
   from the three corners of a seed to generate a tripod. When compared
   with commercial Pd black, the Pd-Cu tripods exhibited substantially
   enhanced catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of formic acid.
   This work offers a general strategy for the synthesis of nanocrystals
   with a tripod structure for catalytic applications.}},

Abstract = {{As the biomedical impact of small RNAs grows, so does the need to
   understand competing structural alternatives for regions of functional
   interest. Suboptimal structure analysis provides significantly more RNA
   base pairing information than a single minimum free energy prediction.
   Yet computational enhancements like Boltzmann sampling have not been
   fully adopted by experimentalists since identifying meaningful patterns
   in this data can be challenging. Profiling is a novel approach to mining
   RNA suboptimal structure data which makes the power of ensemble-based
   analysis accessible in a stable and reliable way. Balancing abstraction
   and specificity, profiling identifies significant combinations of base
   pairs which dominate low-energy RNA secondary structures. By design,
   critical similarities and differences are highlighted, yielding crucial
   information for molecular biologists. The code is freely available via

Abstract = {{Current knowledge of daytime HONO sources remains incomplete. A large
   missing daytime HONO source has been found in many places around the
   world, including polluted regions in China. Conventional understanding
   and recent studies attributed this missing source mainly to ground
   surface processes or gas-phase chemistry, while assuming aerosols to be
   an insignificant media for HONO production. We analyze in situ
   observations of HONO and its precursors at an urban site in Beijing,
   China, and report an apparent dependence of the missing HONO source
   strength on aerosol surface area and solar ultraviolet radiation. Based
   on extensive correlation analysis and process-modeling, we propose that
   the rapid daytime HONO production in Beijing can be explained by
   enhanced hydrolytic disproportionation of NO2 on aqueous aerosol
   surfaces due to catalysis by dicarboxylic acid anions. The combination
   of high abundance of NO2, aromatic hydrocarbons, and aerosols over broad
   regions in China likely leads to elevated HONO levels, rapid OH
   production, and enhanced oxidizing capacity on a regional basis. Our
   findings call for attention to aerosols as a media for daytime
   heterogeneous HONO production in polluted regions like Beijing. This
   study also highlights the complex and uncertain heterogeneous chemistry
   in China, which merits future efforts of reconciling regional modeling
   and laboratory experiments, in order to understand and mitigate the
   regional particulate and O-3 pollutions over China.}},

Abstract = {{Pulse-wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, is a known
   independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Patients with single
   ventricle who undergo aortic to pulmonary anastomosis (recon) have
   noncompliant patch material inserted into the neoaorta, possibly
   increasing vessel stiffness and afterload. The purpose of this study is
   to determine if PWV in patients with single ventricle differed between
   those who did and those who did not undergo aortic reconstruction
   (nonrecon). We retrospectively reviewed cardiac magnetic resonance
   anatomic, cine, and phase contrast evaluations in the ascending aorta
   and descending aorta (DAo) at the level of the diaphragm data from 126
   patients with single ventricle (8.6 +/- 8.0 years) from January 2012 to
   May 2013. Significance = p <0.05. Seventy-five patients underwent recon
   and 51 did not. PWV in recon was significantly higher than in nonrecon
   (3.9 +/- 0.9 m/s vs 3.2 1.0 m/s, p = 0.008); in recon, patients >13
   years old had a higher PWV than those <7 years (4.5 +/- 0.6 vs 3.5 +/-
   0.7 m/s, p = 0.004). Whether <7 or >13 years old, PWV of those with
   recon was higher than nonrecon DAo distensibility was similar between
   both groups. There was no difference in age, body surface area, or
   cardiac index between recon and nonrecon. No correlations between.
   various hemodynarnic and ventricular function parameters with PWV were
   noted. In conclusion, PWV in recon is higher than in nonrecon with
   shnilar DAo distensibility implicating the aortic reconstruction as a
   possible cause of increased afterload; older recon patients have stiffer
   aortas than younger.ones, possibly imposing an additional cardiovascular
   risk in the future. Other biomaterials may potentially moderate PWV if
   clinical outcome is adversely affected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

   sorption up to similar to 0.6 activity, after which the onset of

Abstract = {{Diffusion coefficients for water in amorphous poly(ethylene furanoate)
   (PEF) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) were studied at 35 degrees
   C over the entire water activity range. PEF exhibits a similar to 5x
   reduction in diffusion coefficient averaged over the entire
   concentration interval compared to PET. Fickian diffusion was observed
   for water in both polyesters up to similar to 0.6 activity, after which
   the presence of non-Fickian relaxations required treatment using the
   Berens-Hopfenberg modeling framework. Penetrant plasticization at high
   activity was found for both PEF and PET, as evidenced by a positive
   correlation between diffusion coefficient and increasing water
   concentration. Arrhenius interpretation of diffusion coefficients
   measured at 15, 25, 35, and 45 degrees C allowed calculation of the
   activation energies of diffusion for PEF and PET, which were similar at
   47.1 +/- 2.8 kJ/mol and 46.4 +/- 3.0 kJ/mol, respectively. This study
   complements prior work pertaining to the equilibrium water sorption

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) can exhibit electrical conductivity and introduce
   electric current into polymer. Using dry-jet-wet spin technology,
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/CNT composite fibers with 15 wt\% and 20 wt\% of
   CNT content were fabricated. The electrical conductivity of PAN/CNT
   fibers was enhanced by the annealing process at different temperatures
   and changed with time. These fibers could also respond to stretching,
   and the electrical conductivity decreased by 50\% when the elongation
   reached 3\%. In addition, electrical current can induce Joule heating
   effect and thermally transform PAN/CNT composite fibers. With the
   application of various electrical currents up to 7 mA at a fixed length,
   conductivity was enhanced from around 25 S/m to higher than 800 S/m, and
   composite fibers were stabilized in air. The temperature of composite
   fibers can increase from room temperature to several hundreds of degree
   Celsius measured by an infra-red (IR) microscope. Joule heating effect
   can also be estimated according to one-dimensional steady-state heat
   transfer equation, which reveals the temperature can be high enough to
   stabilize or carbonize fibers. As a result, this research provides a new
   idea of heating fabrics for thermal regulation, and a new approach for
   stabilizing and carbonizing PAN-based carbon fibers. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Semiconductor organic-inorganic nanocomposites have garnered much
   attention as they integrate the advantageous properties from conjugated
   polymers (CPs) and semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). Recent developments
   in interfacial engineering of CP-NC nanocomposites enabled the intimate
   contact between CPs and NCs, thereby facilitating charge separation
   between these two constituents. To capitalize on the use of CP-NC
   nanocomposites for hybrid solar cells, several issues need to be
   addressed, including materials design and engineering, light harvesting,
   and morphology of photoactive layer. In this Review, the general working
   principle of hybrid solar cells and the development of p-type and n-type
   CPs are briefly introduced, followed by the highlight of recent advances
   in synthesis of CP-NC nanocomposites in which CP and NC are in intimate
   contact for hybrid solar cells, and the discussion on various strategies
   for potentially improved power conversion efficiency. An outlook for
   future directions in this area is also presented. (C) 2014 Wiley

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Subcallosal cingulate white matter (SCC) deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) is an evolving investigational treatment for
   depression. Mechanisms of action are hypothesized to involve modulation
   of activity within a structurally defined network of brain regions
   involved in mood regulation. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to model
   white matter connections within this network to identify those critical
   for successful antidepressant response.
   Methods: Preoperative high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging data,
   including diffusion tensor imaging, were acquired in 16 patients with
   treatment-resistant depression, who then received SCC DBS. Computerized
   tomography was used postoperatively to locate DBS contacts. The
   activation volume around the contacts used for chronic stimulation was
   modeled for each patient retrospectively. Probabilistic tractography was
   used to delineate the white matter tracts traveling through each
   activation volume. Patient-specific tract maps were calculated using
   whole-brain analysis. Clinical evaluations of therapeutic outcome from
   SCC DBS were defined at 6 months and 2 years.
   Results: Whole-brain activation volume tractography demonstrated that
   all DBS responders at 6 months (n = 6) and 2 years (n = 12) shared
   bilateral pathways from their activation volumes to 1) medial frontal
   cortex via forceps minor and uncinate fasciculus; 2) rostral and dorsal
   cingulate cortex via the cingulum bundle; and 3) subcortical nuclei.
   Nonresponders did not consistently show these connections. Specific
   anatomical coordinates of the active contacts did not discriminate
   responders from nonresponders.
   Conclusions: Patient-specific activation volume tractography modeling
   may identify critical tracts that mediate SCC DBS antidepressant
   response. This suggests a novel method for patient-specific target and
   stimulation parameter selection.}},

Abstract = {{Earth-based telescope array receivers employing optical communications
   have the potential to fulfill the communication needs of technologically
   sophisticated, deep-space exploration missions. Atmospheric turbulence
   is the chief restrictive factor in an optical deep-space channel (ODSC).
   In this paper, investigation and design of adaptive optics (AO)
   subsystems are presented for the compensation of the coupled effects of
   optical turbulence and background noise in telescope array receivers. An
   end-to-end simulation platform for an ODSC between Mars and Earth is
   implemented, which incorporates pulse-position modulation (PPM),
   direct-detection receivers, and detectors with the capability of
   detection of single photon. The extreme conditions of atmospheric
   turbulence and background noise are also modeled in the analysis. AO
   subsystems are incorporated at individual telescopes in the array
   receiver to mitigate the turbulence effects. The performance of array
   receivers is evaluated in terms of the probability of error and
   communication throughput. The analysis in this research depicts that in
   worst-case turbulence and background noise conditions, inclusion of AO
   systems results in 8.5 dB performance improvement in communication data
   rates. The performance improvement of 5.6 dB is achievable in moderate
   channel conditions. Comparison of performance of array receivers with
   that of a large monolithic telescope shows that incorporation of AO
   systems is more feasible in arrays comprising telescopes with relatively
   smaller diameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A U-system approach for predicting metabolic behaviors and responses
   based on an alleged metabolic reaction network}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Progress in systems biology offers sophisticated approaches
   toward a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Yet,
   computational analyses are held back due to difficulties in determining
   suitable model parameter values from experimental data which naturally
   are subject to biological fluctuations. The data may also be corrupted
   by experimental uncertainties and sometimes do not contain all
   information regarding variables that cannot be measured for technical
   reasons.
   Results: We show here a streamlined approach for the construction of a
   coarse model that allows us to set up dynamic models with minimal input
   information. The approach uses a hybrid between a pure mass action
   system and a generalized mass action (GMA) system in the framework of
   biochemical systems theory (BST) with rate constants of 1, normal
   kinetic orders of 1, and -0.5 and 0.5 for inhibitory and activating
   effects, named Unity (U)-system. The U-system model does not necessarily
   fit all data well but is often sufficient for predicting metabolic
   behavior of metabolites which cannot be simultaneously measured,
   identifying inconsistencies between experimental data and the assumed
   underlying pathway structure, as well as predicting system responses to
   a modification of gene or enzyme. The U-system approach was validated
   with small, generic systems and implemented to model a large-scale
   metabolic reaction network of a higher plant, Arabidopsis. The dynamic
   behaviors obtained by predictive simulations agreed with actually
   available metabolomic time-series data, identified probable errors in
   the experimental datasets, and estimated probable behavior of
   unmeasurable metabolites in a qualitative manner. The model could also
   predict metabolic responses of Arabidopsis with altered network
   structures due to genetic modification.
   Conclusions: The U-system approach can effectively predict metabolic
   behaviors and responses based on structures of an alleged metabolic
   reaction network. Thus, it can be a useful first-line tool of data
   analysis, model diagnostics and aid the design of next-step experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We report our observation of changes to the crystallinity or morphology
   during seed-mediated growth of Au nanocrystals. When single-crystal Au
   seeds with a spherical or rod-like shape were treated with a chemical
   species such as S2O32 ions, twin defects were developed during the
   growth process to generate multiply twinned nanostructures. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that the S2O32 ions were
   chemisorbed on the surfaces of the seeds during the treatment. The
   chemisorbed S2O32 ions somehow influenced the crystallization of Au
   atoms added onto the surface during a growth process, leading to the
   formation of twin defects. In contrast to the spherical and rod-like Au
   seeds, the single-crystal structure was retained to generate a concave
   morphology when single-crystal Au seeds with a cubic or octahedral shape
   were used for a similar treatment and then seed-mediated growth. The
   different outcomes are likely related to the difference in spatial
   distribution of S2O32 ions chemisorbed on the surface of a seed. This
   approach based on surface modification is potentially extendable to
   other noble metals for engineering the crystallinity and morphology of
   nanocrystals formed via seed-mediated growth.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) offer distinct advantages over organic dyes and
   fluorescent proteins for biological imaging applications because of
   their brightness, photostability, and tunability. However, a major
   limitation is that single QDs emit fluorescent light in an intermittent
   on-and-off fashion called blinking. Here we report the development of
   blinking-suppressed, relatively compact QDs that are able to maintain
   their favorable optical properties in aqueous solution. Specifically, we
   show that a linearly graded alloy shell can be grown on a small CdSe
   core via a precisely controlled layer-by-layer process, and that this
   graded shell leads to a dramatic suppression of QD blinking in both
   organic solvents and water. A substantial portion (>25\%) of the
   resulting QDs does not blink (more than 99\% of the time in the bright
   or on state). Theoretical modeling studies indicate that this type of
   linearly graded shell not only can minimize charge carrier access to
   surface traps but also can reduce lattice defects, both of which are
   believed to be responsible for carrier trapping and QD blinking.
   Further, we have evaluated the biological utility of blinking-suppressed
   QDs coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based ligands and multidentate
   ligands. The results demonstrate that their optical properties are
   largely independent of surface coatings and solvating media, and that
   the blinking-suppressed QDs can provide continuous trajectories in
   live-cell receptor tracking studies.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental implementation of the surface code will be a significant
   milestone for quantum computing. We develop a circuit and a decoder
   targeted for near-term implementation of a distance-3 surface code. We
   simulate the code under amplitude and phase damping and compare the
   threshold to a Pauli-twirl approximation. We find that the approximation
   yields a pessimistic threshold estimate. From numerical Monte Carlo
   simulations, we identify the gate and measurement speeds required to
   achieve reliable error correction. For superconductor devices, a qubit
   encoded in a 17-qubit surface code demonstrates a lower error rate than
   an unencoded qubit assuming gate times of 5-40 ns and T1 times of at
   least 1-2 mu s. If T1 >= 10 ns, the difference is significant and can be
   experimentally measured, allowing near-term implementation and
   verification of a small surface code. For ion trap devices, gates times
   of 1 mu s and T1 >= 40 ms admit measurable differences in error rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the photophysical and photoelectrochemical
   characterization of a light harvesting polychromophore array featuring a
   polyfluorene backbone with covalently attached Ru(II) polypyridyl
   complexes (PF-Ru-A), adsorbed on the surface of mesostructured TiO2
   (PF-Ru-A//TiO2). The surface adsorbed polymer is characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared
   (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, providing evidence for the morphology of the
   surface adsorbed polymer and the mode of binding. Photoexcitation of the
   Ru(II) complexes bound to the metal oxide surface (proximal) results in
   electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, which is then
   followed by ultrafast hole transfer to the polymer to form oxidized
   polyfluorene (PF+). More interestingly, chromophores that are not
   directly bound to the TiO2 interface (distal) that are excited
   participate in site-to-site energy transfer processes that transport the
   excited state to surface bound chromophores where charge injection
   occurs, underscoring the antenna-like nature of the polymer assembly.
   The charge separated state is long-lived and persists for >100 mu s, a
   consequence of the increased separation between the hole and injected
   electron.}},

Abstract = {{Pd-Pt core-shell/frame bimetallic nanocrystal has attracted great
   interest in the applications of catalysis, plasmonics, and electronics.
   Controlling the shape, morphology, and chemistry of the outer Pt layer
   has been widely accepted as a critical factor to the realization of
   these applications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive study on
   the atomic structures, composition distribution, and 3D morphology of
   the shell layer in the bimetallic Pd-Pt nanocrystal with core-shell
   cubic and core-frame concave structures by using aberration-corrected
   high angle angular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy,
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electron tomography. The
   structure and chemistry characteristics of the shell layer in the
   core-shell cubic and core-frame concave Pd-Pt nanocrystals have been
   investigated at the atomic scale to reveal the deposition and growth
   mechanism of Pt adatoms on to Pd cubic seeds under various conditions.
   In core-shell Pd-Pt cubic nanocrystals, the most outset surface Pt layer
   is not fully covered, while the interfacial layer is a mixed Pt and Pd
   layer at the atomic scale due to the termination of growth steps under a
   two-dimensional growth mechanism. 3D electron tomography confirmed that
   the Pd-Pt core-frame concave nanocrystal has high index crystallography
   planes at the surfaces. The characterization methodology developed in
   this study provides important insights that will guide the analyses of
   catalytic, plasmonic, and electronic properties relevant to nano and
   atomic structures and the design of Pd-Pt nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an investigation of counterflow diffusion flames
   of oxygen and n-alkanes (CH4-C16H34) over the entire thermodynamic fluid
   regime and a wide range of flow strain rates. The formulation
   incorporates fundamental thermodynamics and transport theories, along
   with detailed chemistry. An improved two-point flame-controlling
   continuation method is employed to capture the complete flame response
   along the S-curve. Two selected members of the n-alkane family, methane
   and n-heptane, are studied in detail. The results confirm that the flame
   thickness (delta) and the global heat-release rate ((q) over dot) of
   oxygen/hydrocarbon systems are closely related to the pressure-weighted
   strain rate, delta similar to 1/root pa and (q) over dot similar to root
   pa. The latter correlation is further modified to account for the
   pressure effect on peak flame temperature, (q) over dot similar to
   p(0.536)root a for the oxygen/methane system, (q) over dot similar to
   p(0.534)root a for the oxygen/n-heptane system. The inlet temperature
   appears to have a negligible effect on flame characteristics. General
   similarities are developed in the mixture-fraction space in terms of
   flame temperature, species concentrations, flame thickness, and
   heat-release rate for all pressures under consideration. This suggests
   that the flame behaviors at high pressure can be evaluated by their
   counterpart at low pressure. The common features for the n-alkane family
   are identified. The flame properties of a given hydrocarbon fuel can be
   predicted from those of another hydrocarbon fuel at the same flow
   conditions. The results contribute to the establishment of a tabulated
   chemistry library for the modeling of supercritical combustion of oxygen
   and hydrocarbon fuels.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial electronic structure between oxide thin films and
   organic semiconductors remains a key parameter for optimum functionality
   and performance of next-generation organic/hybrid electronics. By
   tailoring defect concentrations in transparent conductive ZnO films, we
   demonstrate the importance of controlling the electron transfer barrier
   at the interface with organic acceptor molecules such as C-60. A
   combination of electron spectroscopy, density functional theory
   computations, and device characterization is used to determine band
   alignment and electron injection barriers. Extensive experimental and
   first principles calculations reveal the controllable formation of
   hybridized interface states and charge transfer between shallow donor
   defects in the oxide layer and the molecular adsorbate. Importantly, it
   is shown that removal of shallow donor intragap states causes a larger
   barrier for electron injection. Thus, hybrid interface states constitute
   an important gateway for nearly barrier-free charge carrier injection.
   These findings open new avenues to understand and tailor interfaces
   between organic semiconductors and transparent oxides, of critical
   importance for novel optoelectronic devices and applications in
   energy-conversion and sensor technologies.}},

   the frequency range of 760 MHz-820MHz, which is in agreement with our
   finite element simulations of the PnC bandgap. The results of

   Methods: CMR was compared to qualitative (QE) and semi-quantitative
   echocardiography (SQE) for classifying PVL and prognostic value at one
   year post-imaging in 23 symptomatic post-TAVR patients. The primary
   outcome was a composite of all-cause death, heart failure
   hospitalization, and intractable symptoms necessitating repeat invasive
   therapy; the secondary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and
   heart failure hospitalization. The difference in event-free survival
   according to greater than mild PVL versus mild or less PVL by QE, SQE,
   and CMR were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
   Results: Compared to QE, CMR reclassified PVL severity in 48\% of
   patients, with most patients (31\%) reclassified to at least one grade
   higher. Compared to SQE, CMR reclassified PVL severity in 57\% of
   patients, all being reclassified to at least one grade lower; SQE
   overestimated PVL severity (mean grade 2.5 versus 1.7, p = 0.001). The
   primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 48\% and 35\% of patients,
   respectively. Greater than mild PVL by CMR was associated with reduced
   event-free survival for the primary outcome (p < 0.0001), however
   greater than mild PVL by QE and SQE were not (p = 0.83 and p = 0.068).
   Greater than mild PVL by CMR was associated with reduced event-free
   survival for the secondary outcome, as well (p = 0.012).
   Conclusion: In symptomatic post-TAVR patients, CMR commonly reclassifies
   PVL grade compared with QE and SQE. CMR provides superior prognostic
   value compared to QE and SQE, as patients with greater than mild PVL by
   CMR (RF > 20\%) had a higher incidence of adverse events.}},

Abstract = {{Deactivation of Ni-YSZ (yttrium stabilized zirconia) anode of SOFCs
   operated on CH4 and CO, respectively, is investigated systematically.
   Experiments show that the rate of carbon deposition on Ni-YSZ substrate
   from CH4 increases with temperature in the whole testing temperature
   range (550-800 degrees C), while the rate from CO increases with
   temperature at lower temperatures but decreases at higher temperatures.
   Larger amount of carbon deposit results in more significant substrate
   deformation and destruction, which can be explained by the mechanism of
   carbon fiber growth on Ni exposed to carbon-containing gases. Carbon
   deposition can be avoided by oxygen ion flux through the electrolyte of
   SOFCs operated on either CH4 or CO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Traditional capacity sizing models based on production cost minimization
   do not consider the impact of facility construction and start-up time
   scale on the profitability of plant. For production facilities that link
   substantially different scales, such as biofuel production facilities
   that connect large numbers of small bioreactors to large scale
   processing equipment, the ramp-up to full production may be a
   significant consideration in the decision on facility scale. This paper
   presents a modified discounted cash flow method incorporating production
   growth during start-up, to determine the optimal production scale of
   systems that may operate at less than full capacity for a substantial
   period of time. For a case study of ethanol produced by blue-green
   algae, global sensitivity analysis using Sobols method indicates how
   exogenous and endogenous variables, including the ramp-up rate, affect
   the optimal scale and financial viability of the production system.
   Conditional-value-at-risk minimization shows how the optimal decision
   depends on the risk inclination of the decision-maker; a risk-neutral
   decision maker would choose a basic optimal production scale of 59
   million liters (ML) of ethanol per year, while a risk-averse
   decision-maker might prefer to choose a capacity 30\% less. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Metabolic time series data are being generated with increasing
   frequency, because they contain enormous information about the pathway
   from which the metabolites derive. This information is not directly
   evident, though, and must be extracted with advanced computational
   means. One typical step of this extraction is the estimation of slopes
   of the time courses from the data. Since the data are almost always
   noisy, and the noise is typically amplified in the slopes, this step can
   become a critical bottleneck. Several smoothers have been proposed in
   the literature for this purpose, but they all face the potential problem
   that smoothed time series data no longer correspond to a system that
   conserves mass throughout the measurement time period. To counteract
   this issue, we are proposing here a smoother that is based on wavelets
   and, through an iterative process, converges to a mass-conserving,
   smooth representation of the metabolic data. The degree of smoothness is
   user defined. We demonstrate the method with some didactic examples and
   with the analysis of actual measurements characterizing the glycolytic
   pathway in the dairy bacterium Lactococcus lactis. MATLAB code for the
   constrained smoother is available as a Supplement. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Three primary amine materials functionalized onto mesoporous silica with
   low, medium, and high surface amine coverages are prepared and evaluated
   for binary CO2/H2O adsorption under dilute conditions. Enhancement of
   amine efficiency due to humid adsorption is most pronounced for low
   surface amine coverage materials. In situ FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO2
   on these materials suggest this enhancement may be associated with the
   formation of bicarbonate species during adsorption on materials with low
   surface amine coverage, though such species are not observed on high
   surface coverage materials. On the materials with the lowest amine
   loading, bicarbonate is observed on longer time scales of adsorption,
   but only after spectral contributions from rapidly forming alkylammonium
   carbamate species are removed. This is the first time that direct
   evidence for bicarbonate formation, which is known to occur in liquid
   aqueous amine solutions, has been presented for CO2 adsorption on solid

Abstract = {{Fresh and arsenic-poisoned V2O5WO3/TiO2 catalysts are investigated by
   experiments and DFT calculations for SCR activity and the deactivation
   mechanism. Poisoned catalyst (1.40\% of arsenic) presents lower NO
   conversion and more N2O formation than fresh. Stream (5\%) could further
   decrease the activity of poisoned catalyst above 350 degrees C. The
   deactivation is not attributed to the loss of surface area or phase
   transformation of TiO2 at a certain arsenic content, but due to the
   coverage of the V2O5 cluster and the decrease in the surface acidity:
   the number of Lewis acid sites and the stability of Bronsted acid sites.
   Large amounts of surface hydroxyl induced by H2O molecules provide more
   unreactive AsOH groups and give rise to a further decrease in the SCR
   activity. N2O is mainly from NH3 unselective oxidation at high
   temperatures since the reducibility of catalysts and the number of
   surface-active oxygens are improved by As2O5. Finally, the reaction
   pathway seems unchanged after poisoning: NH3 adsorbed on both Lewis and
   Bronsted acid sites is reactive.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous phase advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) produce hydroxyl
   radicals (HO center dot) which can completely oxidize electron rich
   organic compounds. The proper design and operation of AOPs require that
   we predict the formation and fate of the byproducts and their associated
   toxicity. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a first-principles
   kinetic model that can predict the dominant reaction pathways that
   potentially produce toxic byproducts. We have published some of our
   efforts on predicting the elementary reaction pathways and the HO center
   dot rate constants. Here we develop linear free energy relationships
   (LFERs) that predict the rate constants for aqueous phase radical
   reactions. The LFERs relate experimentally obtained kinetic rate
   constants to quantum mechanically calculated aqueous phase free energies
   of activation. The LFERs have been applied to 101 reactions, including
   (1) HO center dot addition to 15 aromatic compounds; (2) addition of
   molecular oxygen to 65 carbon-centered aliphatic and cyclohexadienyl
   radicals; (3) disproportionation of 10 peroxyl radicals, and (4)
   unimolecular decay of nine peroxyl radicals. The LFERs correlations
   predict the rate constants within a factor of 2 from the experimental
   values for HO center dot reactions and molecular oxygen addition, and a
   factor of 5 for peroxyl radical reactions. The LFERs and the elementary
   reaction pathways will enable us to predict the formation and initial
   fate of the byproducts in AOPs. Furthermore, our methodology can be

Abstract = {{The performance of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in humid or aqueous
   environments is a topic of great significance for a variety of
   applications ranging from adsorption separations to gas storage. While a
   number of water-stable MOFs have emerged recently in the literature, the
   majority of MOFs are known to have poor water stability compared to
   zeolites and activated carbons, and there is therefore a critical need
   to perform systematic water-stability studies and characterize MOFs
   comprehensively after water exposure. Using these studies we can isolate
   the specific factors governing the structural stability of MOFs and
   direct the future synthesis efforts toward the construction of new,
   water-stable MOFs. In this work, we have extended our previous work on
   the systematic water-stability studies of MOFs and synthesized new,
   cobalt-, nickel-, copper-, and zinc-based, water-stable, pillared MOFs
   by incorporating structural factors such as ligand sterics and
   catenation into the framework. Stability is assessed by using water
   vapor adsorption isotherms along with powder X-ray diffraction patterns
   and results from BET modeling of N-2 adsorption isotherms before and
   after water exposure. As expected, our study demonstrates that unlike
   the parent DMOF structures (based on Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn metals), which
   all collapse under 60\% relative humidity (RH), their corresponding
   tetramethyl-functionalized variations (DMOF-TM) are remarkably stable,
   even when adsorbing more than 20 mmol of H2O/g of MOF at 80\% RH. This
   behavior is due to steric factors provided by the methyl groups grafted
   on the BDC (benzenedicarboxylic acid) ligand, as shown previously for
   the Zn-based DMOF-TM. Moreover,
   4,4',4?,4?-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid based, pillared MOFs
   (based on Co and Zn metals) are also found to be stable after 90\% RH
   exposure, even when the basicity of the bipyridyl-based pillar ligand is
   low. This is due to the presence of catenation in their frameworks,
   similar to MOF-508 (Zn-BDC-BPY), which has also been reported to be
   stable after exposure to 90\% RH.}},

Abstract = {{Flames in high swirl flow fields with vortex breakdown often stabilize
   aerodynamically in front of interior flow stagnation points. In contrast
   to shear layer stabilized flames with a nearly fixed, well-defined flame
   attachment point, the leading edge of aerodynamically stabilized flames
   can move around substantially as a result of both the inherent dynamics
   of the vortex breakdown region and externally imposed oscillations.
   Motion of this flame stabilization point relative to the flow field may
   have an important dynamical role during combustion instabilities, as it
   creates flame front wrinkles and heat release fluctuations. For example,
   a prior study has shown that nonlinear dynamics of the flame response at
   high forcing amplitudes were related to these leading edge dynamics.
   This heat release mechanism exists alongside other flame wrinkling
   processes, arising from such processes as shear layer rollup and swirl
   fluctuations. This article describes an experimental investigation of
   flow forcing effects on the dynamics of the leading edge of a swirl
   stabilized flame. Flame and flow dynamics were characterized using
   high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) and CH{*} chemiluminescence
   imaging. A range of forcing conditions was achieved by varying the
   forcing frequency, amplitude, and acoustic field symmetry. These results
   show that the flame leading edge motion is dominated by the natural flow
   instabilities, particularly the precession of the recirculation zone
   around the centerline. The fluctuations in leading edge motion at the
   excitation frequency are much smaller than these natural motions, but
   are still on the order of the fluid particle displacement associated
   with the external excitation, indicating that they exhibit an important
   influence on local flame wrinkling and heat release. Flame response
   modeling shows that the global, spatially integrated heat release
   response is controlled by three factors-vortical disturbances, acoustic
   flow disturbances, and flame leading edge motion. The vortical flow
   motions dominate the flame response, and the flame leading edge motion
   is a minor contributor to the overall heat release response. This is an
   important result, as it shows that the significant motions of the flame
   leading edge actually have little dynamical significance for
   understanding the spatially integrated, forced response of the flame.}},

Abstract = {{Studying NOx formation is essential for reducing nitric oxide emissions
   from gas-fired burners. In the case of laminar jet diffusion flames, the
   temperature profiles in the inner rich core, outer lean, and the plume
   regions can affect the extent of thermal NOx formation. The temperature
   and oxygen profiles in the plume region depend upon the extent of air
   entrained by the jet containing the fuel stream. In our previous works,
   the concept of excess air in jet diffusion flames was introduced and it
   was shown that excess air percentage for any fuel in the jet depends
   only upon the Schmidt number of the fuel jet, if one assumes equal
   diffusion coefficients for all species. In the current article, it is
   shown that NOx production is affected by excess air and, hence, Schmidt
   number. Thus, under identical flame temperatures of two different fuels,
   the difference in Schmidt number can cause differences in NOx emissions.
   A desired Schmidt number can be achieved by selecting a combination of
   fuels and inerts. Computational results from our model are compared with
   experimental data in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{An in-line hydraulic noise suppressor with a lossy, compressible liner
   made of foamed polyurethane liner is introduced which is intended to
   provide an alternative to current in-line silencing devices using
   compressed nitrogen gas volumes. The liner is engineered to be
   compressible at elevated pressures, such that it can provide effective
   noise abatement for practical hydraulic systems. In support of such
   work, a multimodal model is developed to characterize the device and the
   liner material. Because the hydraulic system is pressurized after
   insertion of the liner, the model must address liner compression and the
   corresponding small gaps introduced in the expansion volume;
   additionally, both compression and shear wave propagation must be
   considered in the liner. Several mode matching solutions are
   investigated, and a pseudoinverse mode matching method is found to
   provide good convergence characteristics. The multimodal model is
   validated against a finite element model, and also used in an
   optimization algorithm to estimate the material properties of a
   prototype liner using experimental transmission loss data. Experimental
   results show broadband transmission loss performance at 2.8 MPa system
   pressure; transmission loss decreases with increasing system pressure,
   and data at 4.1 MPa system pressure produces about 4 dB less
   transmission loss than a similarly sized commercial device. The
   multimodal model with estimated material properties at 2.8 MPa achieves
   a root mean squared error of 1.7 dB or less for two different length
   devices over a frequency range of 50-2000 Hz. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Increasing backscatter tag communication ranges is crucial for the
   development of low-power long-range wireless sensor networks. A major
   limitation for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RF
   identification tags lies in the fact that tag antennas are terminated
   with passive loads for modulation, which yields reflection-coefficient
   values less than unity. Recent work in the field has exploited
   reflection amplifiers that achieve reflection-coefficient values larger
   than unity to increase the communication range. However, most of these
   systems rely on increasing the reflection coefficient at one modulation
   state only, which is suboptimal. In this paper, an analysis is given for
   the optimal way to utilize a reflection amplifier and how this compares
   to suboptimal practices. To demonstrate the concept, a tag is designed
   that achieves reflection-coefficient values higher than unity for both
   states in the 900-930-MHz band. The two values are antipodal, thus
   maximizing the tag SNR for a given amplifier. The system comprises of an
   ultra-low-power reflection amplifier with up to 10.2-dB gain and
   sub-milliwatt power consumption, and a phase-shift modulator that
   selectively alternates the phase of the backscatter signal between 0
   degrees and 180 degrees. The reflection amplifier-phase modulator system
   is experimentally characterized in terms of gain, power consumption, and
   backscatter efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient conversion of ``mixing energy{''} to electricity through
   capacitive mixing (CapMix) has been limited by low energy recoveries,
   low power densities, and noncontinuous energy production resulting from
   intermittent charging and discharging cycles. We show here that a CapMix
   system based on a four-reactor process with flow electrodes can generate
   constant and continuous energy, providing a more flexible platform for
   harvesting mixing energy. The power densities were dependent on the
   flow-electrode carbon loading, with 5.8 +/- 0.2 mW m(-2) continuously
   produced in the charging reactor and 3.3 +/- 0.4 mW m(-2) produced in
   the discharging reactor (9.2 +/- 0.6 mW m(-2) for the whole system) when
   the flow-electrode carbon loading was 15\%. Additionally, when the
   flow-electrode electrolyte ion concentration increased from 10 to 20 g
   L-1, the total power density of the whole system (charging and
   discharging) increased to 50.9 +/- 2.5 mW m(-2).}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)
   into the environment can be partially attributed to discharges of human
   wastes, which is also relevant in swimming pool settings. Little or no
   information exists to address this issue in the literature. Therefore,
   experiments were conducted to examine the presence and behavior of PPCPs
   in swimming pools. Among 32 PPCPs amenable to analysis by an available
   method, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), caffeine, and
   tri(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP) were found to be present in
   measurable concentrations in pool water samples. Examination of the
   degradation of selected PPCPs by chlorination illustrated differences in
   their stability in chlorinated pools. These results, as well as
   literature information regarding other attributes of PPCPs, indicate
   characteristics of these compounds that could allow, for their
   accumulation in pools, including slow reaction with chlorine, little
   potential for liquid -> gas transfer, and slow metabolism by humans
   (among orally ingested PPCPs). The findings of this study also suggest
   the potential for accumulation of topically applied PPCP compounds in
   pools. More generally, the results of this study point to the importance
   of proper hygiene habits of swimmers. The potential for the accumulation
   of PPCPs in pools raises questions about their fate and the risks to
   swimming pool patrons.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Precise genome editing using engineered nucleases can significantly
   facilitate biological studies and disease treatment. In particular,
   clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with
   CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are a potentially powerful tool for
   modifying a genome by targeted cleavage of DNA sequences complementary
   to designed guide strand RNAs. Although CRISPR/Cas systems can have
   on-target cleavage rates close to the transfection rates, they may also
   have relatively high off-target cleavage at similar genomic sites that
   contain one or more base pair mismatches, and insertions or deletions
   relative to the guide strand. We have developed a bioinformatics-based
   tool, COSMID (CRISPR Off-target Sites with Mismatches, Insertions, and
   Deletions) that searches genomes for potential off-target sites
   (http://crispr.bme.gatech.edu). Based on the user-supplied guide strand
   and input parameters, COSMID identifies potential off-target sites with
   the specified number of mismatched bases and insertions or deletions
   when compared with the guide strand. For each site, amplification
   primers optimal for the chosen application are also given as output.
   This ranked-list of potential off-target sites assists the choice and
   evaluation of intended target sites, thus helping the design of
   CRISPR/Cas systems with minimal off-target effects, as well as the
   identification and quantification of CRISPR/Cas induced off-target
   cleavage in cells.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary aircraft design studies use structural weight models that
   are calibrated with data from existing aircraft. Computing weights with
   these models is a fast procedure that provides reliable weight estimates
   when the candidate designs lie within the domain of the data used for
   calibration. However, this limitation is too restrictive when we wish to
   assess the relative benefits of new structural technologies and new
   aircraft configurations early in the design process. To address this
   limitation, we present a computationally efficient aerostructural design
   framework for initial aircraft design studies that uses a full
   finite-element model of key structural components to better assess the
   potential benefits of new technologies. We use a three-dimensional panel
   method to predict the aerodynamic forces and couple the lifting surface
   deflections to compute the deformed aerodynamic flying shape. To be used
   early in the design cycle, the aerostructural computations must be fast,
   robust, and allow for significant design flexibility. To address these
   requirements, we develop a geometry parametrization technique that
   enables large geometric modifications, we implement a parallel
   Newton-Krylov approach that is robust and computationally efficient to
   solve the aeroelastic system, and we develop an adjoint-based derivative
   evaluation method to compute the derivatives of functions of interest
   for design optimization. To demonstrate the capabilities of the
   framework, we present a design optimization of a large transport
   aircraft wing that includes a detailed structural design
   parametrization. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can
   be used to make detailed structural design decisions to meet overall
   aircraft mission requirements.}},

Abstract = {{According to the Federal Highway Administration, more than a quarter of
   the bridge decks in the United States are obsolete or deficient and most
   of them are made of reinforced concrete (RC). Precise decisions for
   bridge maintenance are in high demand due to the limited budget. Among
   various nondestructive evaluation techniques, ground penetrating radar
   (GPR) has gained its popularity for reasons such as high speed and fine
   resolution. Migration is an important intermediate process for GPR data
   analysis and its accuracy depends on the velocity or dielectric
   permittivity estimation of the subsurface. Velocity analysis for
   commonly adopted bistatic GPR systems is based on an iterative
   trial-and-error process, which involves a human decision process to
   obtain the properly migrated data. Besides, for heavily polluted data,
   it can be hardly possible to perform the visual inspection. Autofocusing
   techniques are rarely discussed in the field of GPR. In this paper,
   potential autofocusing metrics are nominated and evaluated by both
   simulation and experimental data. The effects of noise, aperture width,
   and crossing rebar signals on the metric performance are investigated
   and the results demonstrate that the higher-order metrics are the most
   robust and sensitive autofocusing metrics for the migration of GPR data
   from RC bridge decks.}},

Abstract = {{An ultrathin layer of a polymer containing simple aliphatic amine

   back-gated field effect graphene device to form graphene p-n-p

   separate Dirac points, which confirms an energy separation of neutrality
   points within the complementary regions. This is a simple approach for
   making graphene p-n-p junctions without a need for multiple lithography
   steps or electrostatic gates and, unlike, the destructive techniques
   such as substitutional doping or covalent functionalization, it induces
   a minor defect, if any, as there is no discernible D peak in the Raman
   spectra of the graphene films after creating junctions and degradation
   in the charge carrier mobilities of the graphene devices. This method
   can be easily processed from dilute solutions in
   environmentally-friendly solvents such as water or methoxyethanol and
   does not suffer any change upon exposure to air or heating at

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing by laser sintering is able to produce high

   study, we used a human trabecular bone template to design and

   sintering. Characterization of constructs revealed interconnected
   porosities ranging from 15-70\% with compressive moduli of 2579-3693
   MPa. These constructs with macro porosity were further surface-treated
   to create a desirable multi-scale micro-/nano-roughness, which has been
   shown to enhance the osseointegration process. Osteoblasts (MG63 cells)
   exhibited high viability when grown on the constructs. Proliferation
   (DNA) and alkaline phosphatase specific activity, an early
   differentiation marker, decreased as porosity increased, while
   osteocalcin, a late differentiation marker, as well as osteoprotegerin,
   vascular endothelial growth factor and bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and
   4 increased with increasing porosity. Three-dimensional (3D) constructs
   with the highest porosity and surface modification supported the
   greatest osteoblast differentiation and local factor production. These
   results indicate that additively manufactured 3D porous constructs
   mimicking human trabecular bone and produced with additional surface
   treatment can be customized for increased osteoblast response. Increased
   factors for osteoblast maturation and differentiation on high porosity
   constructs suggest the enhanced performance of these surfaces for

Abstract = {{Although improving financial access is in the spotlight of the current
   U. S. health policy agenda, this alone does not address universal and
   comprehensive healthcare. Affordability is one barrier to healthcare,
   but others such as availability and accessibility, together defined as
   spatial accessibility, are equally important. In this paper, we develop
   a measurement and modeling framework that can be used to infer the
   impact of policy changes on disparities in spatial accessibility within
   and across different population groups. The underlying model for
   measuring spatial accessibility is optimization-based and accounts for
   constraints in the healthcare delivery system. The measurement method is
   complemented by statistical modeling and inference on the impact of
   various potential contributing factors to disparities in spatial
   accessibility. The emphasis of this study is on children's accessibility
   to primary care pediatricians, piloted for the state of Georgia. We
   focus on disparities in accessibility between and within two
   populations: children insured by Medicaid and other children. We find
   that disparities in spatial accessibility to pediatric primary care in
   Georgia are significant, and resistant to many policy interventions,
   suggesting the need for major changes to the structure of Georgia's

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the thermal challenges in conventional 3-D stacks
   and proposes a novel stacking structure that eases the thermal problem.
   The objective of this paper is first to define limits and opportunities
   for developing different 3-D chip stacks from a thermal perspective, and
   second to explore our proposed system as a function of microbumps,
   through silicon vias, die thickness, and other design parameters. In our
   proposed 3-D stack, the interposer integrated microfluidic heat sink
   serves as the main heat sink. To thermally decouple stacked dice, we
   propose air gap isolation between them and a thermal bridge on top of
   the stack to cool down the isolated die. To evaluate the thermal
   benefits of the stack, a thermal model is developed based on the finite
   difference method. Several chip stack scenarios are studied and the
   simulations are conducted with a processor power of 74.63 W/cm(2) and
   memory power of 2.82 W/cm(2). The proposed architecture yielded
   processor and memory temperatures of 64 degrees C and 40 degrees C,
   respectively, compared with 76 degrees C and 75 degrees C for the air
   cooled stack.}},

Abstract = {{Interconnections between integrated circuits and print circuit boards
   are primarily achieved currently with organic packages at high I/O
   pitch. Organic packages, however, are limited by poor thermal and
   dimension stabilities for them to act as fine pitch interposers. To
   address these challenges, silicon interposers are being developed.
   Current silicon interposers, based on through-silicon via (TSV)
   techniques, suffer from high production cost, because of expensive
   CMOS-grade silicon, expensive TSV process and smaller wafer sizes. They
   also suffer from high electrical loss in spite of thin SiO2 interfacial
   layers. This paper, for the first time, demonstrates a lower cost and
   higher performance silicon interposer. It is based on panel-based
   polycrystalline silicon with through-package vias (TPVs) and
   redistribution layers, and a simple and double-side process with thick
   polymer liner inside the TPV. Electrical modeling was carried out that
   shows the better electrical performance of polycrystalline silicon
   interposer compared with traditional single-crystalline silicon
   interposer. The polycrystalline silicon interposer test vehicles with up
   to four metal layers were demonstrated and characterized. The
   measurement results showed good electrical performance and matched well
   with the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneity of copper oxide supported on gamma-Al2O3 (10CuO-Al2O3)
   and TiO2 (10CuO-TiO2) precatalysts is assessed in the oxidative
   homocoupling of ethynylbenzene in piperidine, with a focus on the effect
   of temperature, support, and solvent on copper leaching and catalyst
   reactivity. It is demonstrated that for this alkyne homocoupling
   reaction, elevated temperature is needed to solubilize copper and
   activate it, likely by production of soluble molecular copper-piperidine
   complexes. Once this activation occurred, the reaction can occur at room
   temperature, giving good yields of the desired product. Copper oxide is
   shown to interact differently on the two supports; CuO supported on TiO2
   is more dispersed and accessible than CuO supported on gamma-Al2O3. Less
   copper leaches from 10CuO-TiO2 than from 10CuO-Al2O3 at room
   temperature. Nevertheless, copper species that leach from 10CuO-TiO2 are
   more active than the species leached from 10CuO-Al2O3, as some of the
   copper leached from alumina likely exists as fine, inactive CuO
   nanoparticles. Piperidine has multiple roles in this reaction: it acts
   as solvent, base, as well as an important ligand. The precatalyst
   10CuO-TiO2 is reused three times, with improved performance after each
   cycle. Nevertheless, it cannot be considered a recyclable catalyst, but
   rather a reusable solid precatalyst that produced new soluble active
   copper species in each cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Melt electrospinning and its additive manufacturing analogue, melt
   electrospinning writing (MEW), are two processes which can produce
   porous materials for applications where solvent toxicity and
   accumulation in solution electrospinning are problematic. This study
   explores the melt electrospinning of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)
   scaffolds, specifically for applications in tissue engineering. The
   research described here aims to inform researchers interested in melt
   electrospinning about technical aspects of the process. This includes
   rapid fiber characterization using glass microscope slides, allowing
   influential processing parameters on fiber morphology to be assessed, as
   well as observed fiber collection phenomena on different collector
   substrates. The distribution and alignment of melt electrospun PCL
   fibers can be controlled to a certain degree using patterned collectors
   to create large numbers of scaffolds with shaped macroporous
   architectures. However, the buildup of residual charge in the collected
   fibers limits the achievable thickness of the porous template through
   such scaffolds. One challenge identified for MEW is the ability to
   control charge buildup so that fibers can be placed accurately in close
   proximity, and in many centimeter heights. The scale and size of
   scaffolds produced using MEW, however, indicate that this emerging
   process will fill a technological niche in biofabricadon. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A major goal of nanotechnology is to develop the capability to arrange

   demonstrated the ability to arrange the basic building blocks of matter,

   of quantum confined geometries. The level of human interaction needed to
   physically locate the atom and bring it to the desired location limits
   this atom assembly technology. Here we report the use of autonomous atom
   assembly via path planning technology; this allows atomically perfect
   nanostructures to be assembled without the need for human intervention,
   resulting in precise constructions in shorter times. We demonstrate
   autonomous assembly by assembling various quantum confinement geometries

Abstract = {{A vibration sensor is usually designed to measure the vibration
   frequency but disregard the vibration amplitude, which is rather
   challenging to be quantified due to the requirement of linear response.
   Here, we show the application of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a
   self-powered tool for quantitative measurement of vibration amplitude
   based on an operation mode, the contact-mode freestanding triboelectric
   nanogenerator (CF-TENG). In this mode, the triboelectrically charged
   resonator can be agitated to vibrate between two stacked stationary
   electrodes. Under the working principle with a constant capacitance
   between two electrodes, the amplitudes of the electric signals are
   proportional to the vibration amplitude of the resonator (provided that
   the resonator plate is charged to saturation), which has been
   illuminated both theoretically and experimentally. Together with its
   capability in monitoring the vibration frequency, the CF-TENG appears as
   the triboelectrification-based active sensor that can give full
   quantitative information about a vibration. In addition, the CF-TENG is
   also demonstrated as a power source for electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygenation in tissue scaffolds continues to be a limiting factor in
   regenerative medicine despite efforts to induce neovascularization or to
   use oxygen-generating materials. Unfortunately, many established methods
   to measure oxygen concentration, such as using electrodes, require
   mechanical disturbance of the tissue structure. To address the need for
   scaffold-based oxygen concentration monitoring, a single-component,
   self-referenced oxygen sensor was made into nanofibers. Electrospinning
   process parameters were tuned to produce a biomaterial scaffold with
   specific morphological features. The ratio of an oxygen sensitive
   phosphorescence signal to an oxygen insensitive fluorescence signal was
   calculated at each image pixel to determine an oxygenation value. A
   single component boron dye-polymer conjugate was chosen for additional
   investigation due to improved resistance to degradation in aqueous media
   compared to a boron dye polymer blend. Standardization curves show that
   in fully supplemented media, the fibers are responsive to dissolved
   oxygen concentrations less than 15 ppm. Spatial (millimeters) and
   temporal (minutes) ratiometric gradients were observed in vitro
   radiating outward from the center of a dense adherent cell grouping on
   scaffolds. Sensor activation in ischemia and cell transplant models in
   vivo show oxygenation decreases on the scale of minutes. The nanofiber
   construct offers a robust approach to biomaterial scaffold oxygen
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present a universal, simple, efficient, and reliable way to add
   small BioBrick parts to any BioBrick via PCR that is compatible with
   BioBrick assembly standard 10. As a proof of principle, we have designed
   a universal primer, rbs\_B0034, that contains a ribosomal binding site
   (RBS; BBa\_B0034) and that can be used in PCR to amplify any coding
   BioBrick that starts with ATG. We performed test PCRs with rbs\_B0034 on
   31 different targets and found it to be 93.6\% efficient. Moreover, when
   supplemented with a complementary primer, addition of RBS can be
   accomplished via whole plasmid site-directed mutagenesis, thus reducing
   the time required for further assembly of composite parts. The described
   method brings simplicity to the addition of small parts, such as
   regulatory elements to existing BioBricks. The final product of the PCR
   assembly is indistinguishable from the standard or 3A BioBrick assembly.}},

Abstract = {{A time series generator is presented, employing a robust three-level
   multivariate scheme for stochastic simulation of correlated processes.
   It preserves the essential statistical characteristics of historical
   data at three time scales (annual, monthly, daily), using a
   disaggregation approach. It also reproduces key properties of
   hydrometeorological and geophysical processes, namely the long-term
   persistence (Hurst Kolmogorov behaviour), the periodicity and
   intermittency. Its efficiency is illustrated through two case studies in
   Greece. The first aims to generate monthly runoff and rainfall data at
   three reservoirs of the hydrosystem of Athens. The second involves the
   generation of daily rainfall for flood simulation at five rain gauges.
   In the first emphasis is given to long-term persistence a dominant
   characteristic in the management of large-scale hydrosystems, comprising
   reservoirs with carry-over storage capacity. In the second we highlight
   to the consistent representation of intermittency and asymmetry of daily
   rainfall, and the distribution of annual daily maxima. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{EPILEPSIA}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveIn recent decades intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings using
   increasing numbers of electrodes, higher sampling rates, and a variety
   of visual and quantitative analyses have indicated the presence of
   widespread, high frequency ictal and preictal oscillations (HFOs)
   associated with regions of seizure onset. Seizure freedom has been
   correlated with removal of brain regions generating pathologic HFOs.
   However, quantitative analysis of preictal HFOs has seldom been applied
   to the clinical problem of planning the surgical resection. We performed
   Granger causality (GC) analysis of iEEG recordings to analyze features
   of preictal seizure networks and to aid in surgical decision making.
   MethodsTen retrospective and two prospective patients were chosen on the
   basis of individually stereotyped seizure patterns by visual criteria.
   Prospective patients were selected, additionally, for failure of those
   criteria to resolve apparent multilobar ictal onsets. iEEG was recorded
   at 500 or 1,000Hz, using up to 128 surface and depth electrodes.
   Preictal and early ictal GC from individual electrodes was characterized
   by the strength of causal outflow, spatial distribution, and
   hierarchical causal relationships.
   ResultsIn all patients we found significant, widespread preictal GC
   network activity at peak frequencies from 80 to 250Hz, beginning 2-42s
   before visible electrographic onset. In the two prospective patients, GC
   source/sink comparisons supported the exclusion of early ictal regions
   that were not the dominant causal sources, and contributed to planning
   of more limited surgical resections. Both patients have a class 1
   outcome at 1year.
   SignificanceGC analysis of iEEG has the potential to increase
   understanding of preictal network activity, and to help improve surgical
   outcomes in cases of otherwise ambiguous iEEG onset.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores communication methods and frequencies for wireless
   intraoral electronic devices, by using an intraoral tongue drive system
   (iTDS) as a practical example. Because intraoral devices do not meet the
   operating conditions of the body channel communication, we chose radio
   frequency communication. We evaluated and compared three frequencies in
   industrial, scientific, and medical bands (27 MHz, 433.9 MHz, and 2.48
   GHz) in terms of their data link performance based on path loss and
   radiation patterns over horizontal and vertical planes. To do so, we
   dynamically minimize the impedance mismatch caused by the varying oral
   environment by applying the adaptive impedance matching technique to
   433.9 MHz and 2.48 GHz bands. Experimental results showed that 27 MHz
   has the smallest path loss in the near-field up to 39 cm separation
   between transmitter and receiver antennas. However, 433.9 MHz shows the
   best performance beyond 39 cm and offers a maximum operating distance of
   123 cm with 0 dBm transmitter output power. These distances were
   obtained by a bit error rate test and verified by a link budget analysis
   and full functionality test of the iTDS with computer access.}},

Abstract = {{The single-event transient (SET) response of a third-generation bulk
   C-SiGe (npn + pnp) BiCMOS platform is investigated for the first time.
   Pulsed-laser, two-photon absorption experiments show that the pnp SiGe
   heterojunction bipolar transistor (SiGe HBT) exhibits a significant
   reduction in sensitive area as well as an improved transient response
   compared with the npn SiGe HBT. Ion-strike simulations on 3-D TCAD,
   C-SiGe HBT models agree with experimental findings, showing a reduction
   in overall transient duration and collected charge for the pnp SiGe HBT.
   These improvements in device-level SETs are attributed to the n-well
   isolation layer present in the vertical material stack of the pnp HBT.
   These results suggest that precision analog, RF/mm-wave, and high-speed
   digital applications utilizing unhardened, high-performance bulk pnp
   SiGe HBTs should benefit from an inherently improved SEE response.}},

   improved SET response was verified with through-wafer two-photon

   reliability issues associated with the inverse-mode operation further
   suggests this new cascode structure can be a strong contender for
   space-based applications. The LNA with the inverse-mode-based cascode
   core was fabricated in a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS platform and has similar RF

Abstract = {{An 8-18 GHz receiver implemented in silicon-germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS
   technology is presented. The receiver is designed to enable built-in
   test (BIT) and consists of a low noise amplifier (LNA), an image-reject
   mixer, on-chip, automatic gain control (AGC), ring oscillator (RO)
   sources (used to provide test signals of a predefined amplitude), and
   digital-to-analog converters (DACs), used for DC bias control of the
   blocks. The voltage and current biases of both the LNA and the mixer
   circuit blocks are used as tuning knobs for radio frequency (RF)
   performance metrics to mitigate the negative effects of total ionizing
   dose (TID) radiation damage present in extreme environments such as
   space. Samples of the receiver die were exposed to 10 keV X-rays at 1,
   3, and 6Mrad(SiO2) doses. The BIT system was able to mitigate for TID
   damage in most cases, with improvements in the key RF metrics of gain,
   output third-order intercept point (OIP3), and noise figure (NF). The
   receiver was fabricated in an 0.18 mu m SiGe BiCMOS process technology
   with a peak f(T) of 150 GHz and nominally consumes 241-243 mA from a 4 V
   supply.}},

Abstract = {{Flows driven by surface tension are both ubiquitous and diverse,
   involving the drinking of birds and bees, the flow of xylem in plants,
   the impact of raindrops on animals, respiration in humans, and the
   transmission of diseases in plants and animals, including humans. The
   fundamental physical principles underlying such flows provide a unifying
   framework to interpret the adaptations of the microorganisms, animals,
   and plants that rely upon them. The symposium on ``Surface-Tension
   Phenomena in Organismal Biology'' assembled an interdisciplinary group
   of researchers to address a large spectrum of topics, all articulated
   around the role of surface tension in shaping biology, health, and
   ecology. The contributions to the symposium and the papers in this issue
   are meant to be a starting point for novices to familiarize themselves
   with the fundamentals of flows driven by surface tension; to understand
   how they can play a governing role in many settings in organismal
   biology; and how such understanding of nature's use of surface tension
   can, in turn, inspire humans to innovate.}},

Abstract = {{We report mosquito behaviors for removing accumulated drops of water
   which would otherwise increase the energy expended during takeoff and
   free flight. These techniques take advantage of the insect's small size
   and great structural strength. To dry their wings before takeoff,
   mosquitoes employ a flutter stroke, at double the wingbeat frequency of
   normal flight, generating nearly 2500 gravities of acceleration.
   Mosquitoes may also remove drops by the respective accelerations
   associated with takeoff and collision with the ground. We correlate the
   accelerations and size of drops ejected using a simple model involving
   the drop's inertial force and surface tension. We note mosquitoes may
   use similar techniques to remove synthetic drops, making our
   observations applicable for understanding the resistance of insects to
   insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase is regulated by shear
   stress. At elevated intraocular pressures when the Schlemm's canal (SC)
   begins to collapse, shear stress is comparable with that in large
   arteries. We investigated the relationship between NO production and
   shear stress in cultured human SC cells.
   METHODS. Schlemm's canal endothelial cells isolated from three normal
   and two glaucomatous human donors were seeded into Ibidi flow chambers
   at confluence, cultured for 7 days, and subjected to steady shear stress
   (0.1 or 10 dynes/cm(2)) for 6, 24, or 168 hours. Cell alignment with
   flow direction was monitored, and NO production was measured using
   4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) and Griess
   reagents. Human trabecular meshwork (TM) and umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVECs) were used as controls.
   RESULTS. Normal SC strains aligned with the direction of flow by 7 days.
   Comparing 0.1 vs. 10 dynes/cm(2), NO levels increased by 82\% at 24
   hours and 8-fold after 7 days by DAF-FM, and similar results were
   obtained with Griess reagent. Shear responses by SC cells at 24 hours
   were comparable with HUVECs, and greater than TM cells, which appeared
   shear-insensitive. Nitric oxide production by SC cells was detectable as
   early as 6 hours and was inhibited by 100 mu M nitro-L-arginine methyl
   ester. Two glaucomatous SC cell strains were either unresponsive or
   lifted from the plate in the face of shear.
   CONCLUSIONS. Shear stress triggers NO production in human SC cells,
   similar to other vascular endothelia. Increased shear stress and NO
   production during SC collapse at elevated intraocular pressures may in
   part mediate IOP homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{The rapidly increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs)
   from multiple heterogeneous sources has spearheaded the adoption of
   data-driven approaches for improved clinical research, decision making,
   prognosis, and patient management. Unfortunately. EHR data do not always
   directly and reliably map to medical concepts that clinical researchers
   need or use. Some recent studies have focused on EHR-derived
   phenotyping, which aims at mapping the EHR data to specific medical
   concepts; however, most of these approaches require labor intensive
   supervision from experienced clinical professionals. Furthermore,
   existing approaches are often disease-centric and specialized to the
   idiosyncrasies of the information technology and/or business practices
   of a single healthcare organization.
   In this paper, we propose Limestone, a nonnegative tensor factorization
   method to derive phenotype candidates with virtually no human
   supervision. Limestone represents the data source interactions naturally
   using tensors (a generalization of matrices). In particular, we
   investigate the interaction of diagnoses and medications among patients.
   The resulting tensor factors are reported as phenotype candidates that
   automatically reveal patient clusters on specific diagnoses and
   medications. Using the proposed method, multiple phenotypes can be
   identified simultaneously from data.
   We demonstrate the capability of Limestone on a cohort of 31,815 patient
   records from the Geisinger Health System. The dataset spans 7 years of
   longitudinal patient records and was initially constructed for a heart
   failure onset prediction study. Our experiments demonstrate the
   robustness, stability, and the conciseness of Limestone-derived
   phenotypes. Our results show that using only 40 phenotypes, we can
   outperform the original 640 features (169 diagnosis categories and 471
   medication types) to achieve an area under the receiver operator
   characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.720 (95\% CI 0.715 to 0.725). Moreover,
   in consultation with a medical expert, we confirmed 82\% of the top 50
   candidates automatically extracted by Limestone are clinically
   meaningful. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The crystalline structure of organic materials dictates their physical
   properties, but while significant research effort is geared towards
   understanding structure-property relationships in such materials, the
   details remain unclear. Many organic crystals exhibit transitions in
   their electrical properties as a function of temperature. One example is
   the 1:1 charge-transfer complex
   trans-stilbene-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane.
   Here we show that the mobility and resistivity of this material undergo
   a transition from being thermally activated at temperatures above 235 K
   to being temperature independent at low temperatures. On the basis of
   our experimental and theoretical results, we attribute this behaviour to
   the presence of a glass-like transition and the accompanied freezing-in
   of orientational disorder of the stilbene molecule.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{ObjectiveThis study aims to compare radiofrequency (RF) heat lesion size
   across electrodes and generator settings available for interventional
   pain management.
   MethodsMonopolar lesions are generated ex vivo in animal tissue using
   sharp cannulae with tip diameters 23, 22, 20, 18, 16 gauge; tip lengths
   5, 6, 10, 15mm; set temperatures 60, 70, 80, 90 degrees C; set times 1,
   1.5, 2, 3, 5, 10minutes. Lesions are generated using the RRE electrode,
   cooled RF, and parallel-tip bipolar RF for comparison. Lesion sizes are
   assessed by automated photographic temperature inference from over 400
   lesions, using multiple lesions per configuration.
   ResultsMonopolar lesion width and length increase with each factor
   (P<0.001). Increasing cannula diameter from 22 to 16 gauge increases
   average lesion width 58-65\% (3-4mm) at 80 degrees C and 2minutes.
   Increasing temperature from 60 degrees C to 90 degrees C increases
   lesion width 108-152\% at 2minutes. Although dimensions grow most
   rapidly over the first minute, average lesion width is 11-20\% larger at
   2minutes, and 23-32\% larger at 3minutes, compared with 1minute. Lesion
   length extends distal and proximal to the tip, and exceeds tip length by
   1-5mm at 80 degrees C and 2minutes. Conventional 16 gauge cannulae at
   80-90 degrees C for 2-3minutes generate lesions of average width similar
   to that produced by the cooled RF configuration proposed for sacroiliac
   joint denervation. Bipolar RF between parallel cannulae produces a
   rounded brick-shaped lesion of comparable shape to three sequential
   monopolar lesions generated using the same cannulae and generator
   settings.
   ConclusionsTip gauge, tip length, temperature, and time substantially
   affect RF lesion size.}},

Abstract = {{The MapReduce programming model, in which the data nodes perform both
   the data storing and the computation, was introduced for big-data
   processing. Thus, we need to understand the different resource
   requirements of data storing and computation tasks and schedule these
   efficiently over multi-core processors. In particular, the provision of
   high-performance data storing has become more critical because of the
   continuously increasing volume of data uploaded to distributed file
   systems and database servers. However, the analysis of the performance
   characteristics of the processes that store upstream data is very
   intricate, because both network and disk inputs/outputs (I/O) are
   heavily involved in their operations. In this paper, we analyze the
   impact of core affinity on both network and disk I/O performance and
   propose a novel approach for dynamic core affinity for high-throughput
   file upload. We consider the dynamic changes in the processor load and
   the intensiveness of the file upload at run-time, and accordingly decide
   the core affinity for service threads, with the objective of maximizing
   the parallelism, data locality, and resource efficiency. We apply the
   dynamic core affinity to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
   Measurement results show that our implementation can improve the file
   upload throughput of end applications by more than 30\% as compared with
   the default HDFS, and provide better scalability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Experimental study of the effect of noncondensables on
   buoyancy-thermocapillary convection in a volatile low-viscosity silicone
   oil}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The convective flow in a layer of volatile silicone oil with a kinematic
   viscosity of 0.65 cSt confined to a sealed cavity with a transverse
   aspect ratio of 3.2 was visualized using particle pathlines and
   quantified by particle-image velocimetry at dynamic Bond numbers
   estimated to be of order unity and laboratory Marangoni numbers as great
   as 3600. The effect of noncondensables (i.e., air) was studied by
   comparing convection in the liquid layer below a vapor space at
   pressures ranging from 4.8 kPa to 101 kPa, corresponding to air molar
   fractions ranging from 14\% to 96\%, respectively, and silicone-oil
   vapor, under otherwise identical conditions. The results for convection
   at 101 kPa are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, and
   clarify the time-dependent flow observed at high Marangoni numbers. The
   results show that decreasing the relative air concentration increases
   the critical Marangoni numbers for transition between different flow
   states, even though the air concentration does not appear to affect the
   speeds near the interface. Linear stability analysis shows that
   transitions are suppressed due to the latent heat generated or absorbed
   at the interface due to the enhancement of phase change. Furthermore,
   the experimental results suggest that air, even at relative
   concentrations as small as 14\%, or partial pressures of O(10(2) Pa),
   has a significant effect on the vapor flow, and that the fluid in the
   vapor space should be modeled as a binary mixture in many cases of
   practical interest. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Studies of motor control have almost universally examined firing rates
   to investigate how the brain shapes behavior. In principle, however,
   neurons could encode information through the precise temporal patterning
   of their spike trains as well as (or instead of) through their firing
   rates. Although the importance of spike timing has been demonstrated in
   sensory systems, it is largely unknown whether timing differences in
   motor areas could affect behavior. We tested the hypothesis that
   significant information about trial-by-trial variations in behavior is
   represented by spike timing in the songbird vocal motor system. We found
   that neurons in motor cortex convey information via spike timing far
   more often than via spike rate and that the amount of information
   conveyed at the millisecond timescale greatly exceeds the information
   available from spike counts. These results demonstrate that information
   can be represented by spike timing in motor circuits and suggest that
   timing variations evoke differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to establish a methodology to actively
   control a pneumatically driven robotic device that can induce specific
   muscle force patterns in target muscles during a subject's voluntary
   movement. In this paper, the generation of constant forces in the rectus
   femoris muscle throughout the knee extension, i.e., isotonic
   contractions, was studied. Due to a highly nonlinear nature of mapping
   the joint torque to muscle force, a simple application of constant
   torques to the knee joint would not realize isotonic contractions. The
   proposed robotic exercise accounted for nonlinear moment arms of muscles
   as functions of joint angles and nonlinear coordination of multiple
   muscles in the neuromuscular system to accomplish individual muscle
   control. A pneumatically powered one degree-of-freedom device that can
   impose active force feedback control has been designed and built. An
   exercise-planning algorithm has been developed that involved a
   musculoskeletal model of the lower body, and the dynamics of a pneumatic
   actuator. Five constant force profiles were tested for 20 healthy
   volunteers and electromyographic signals were collected while the device
   was applying calculated force profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon-based p-n junction photodetectors (PDs) play an essential role
   in optoelectronic applications for photosensing due to their outstanding
   compatibility with well-developed integrated circuit technology. The
   piezo-phototronic effect, a three-way coupling effect among
   semiconductor properties, piezoelectric polarizations, and photon
   excitation, has been demonstrated as an effective approach to
   tune/modulate the generation, separation, and recombination of
   photogenerated electron-hole pairs during optoelectronic processes in
   piezoelectric-semiconductor materials. Here, we utilize the
   strain-induced piezo-polarization charges in a piezoelectric n-ZnO layer
   to modulate the optoelectronic process initiated in a p-Si layer and
   thus optimize the performances of p-Si/ZnO NWs hybridized photodetectors
   for visible sensing via tuning the transport property of charge carriers
   across the Si/ZnO heterojunction interface. The maximum
   photoresponsivity R of 7.1 A/W and fastest rising time of 101 ms were
   obtained from these PDs when applying an external compressive strain of
   -0.10 on the ZnO NWs, corresponding to relative enhancement of 177\% in
   R and shortening to 87\% in response time, respectively. These results
   indicate a promising method to enhance/optimize the performances of
   non-piezoelectric semiconductor material (e.g., Si) based optoelectronic
   devices by the piezo-phototronic effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an extensive study of two thermal
   energy storage (TES) systems. The goal of the research is to make solar
   energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity. A small-scale
   TES system was first built. The inner to outer layers were made of
   firebrick (FB), autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) and reinforced
   concrete brick (CB). The experiments were conducted at temperatures of
   up to 1000 degrees C for sustained periods of time. AAC was found to be
   prone to cracking at temperatures exceeding 900 degrees C; as a result,
   AAC was eliminated from the second TES system. The second, larger-scale
   TES system was subsequently built of multiple layers of readily
   available materials, namely, insulating firebrick (IFB), perlite
   concrete (PC), expansion joint (EJ), and CB. All of the surfaces were
   instrumented with thermocouples to estimate the heat loss from the
   system. The temperature was maintained at approximately 800 degrees C to
   approximate steady state conditions closely. The steady state heat loss
   was determined to be approximately 4.4\% for a day. The results indicate
   that high-temperature TES systems can be constructed of readily
   available materials while meeting the heat loss requirements for a
   falling particle receiver system, thereby contributing to reducing the
   overall cost of concentrating solar power systems.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) feasiblity refers
   to whether it is possible to support specified numbers of streams
   allocated to the links of an MIMO network while canceling all
   interference. In unilateral interference cancellation, nodes account
   only for interfering links that they have been assigned to cancel and
   ignore other interfering links. We present several different
   formulations of the unilateral MIMO feasibility problem and use these
   formulations to analyze the problem's complexity and develop heuristic
   feasibility algorithms. We first prove that the general unilateral
   feasibility problem is NP-complete. We then identify several special
   cases where the problem is solvable in polynomial time. These include
   when only receiver-side interference cancellation is performed, when all
   nodes have two antenna elements, and when the maximum degree of the
   network's interference graph is two. Finally, we present several
   heuristic feasibility algorithms derived from different problem
   formulations and evaluate their accuracies on randomly generated MIMO
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) present a variety of new
   research challenges. Recently, a magnetoinductive (MI) waveguide
   technique has been proposed to cope with the very harsh propagation
   conditions in WUSNs. This relay-based approach allows for an extension
   of the transmission range, which can be quite limited if relays are not
   deployed. In this paper, tree-based WUSNs are considered. The objective
   of our work is to determine the optimal system parameters, topology, and
   deployment strategy in order to avoid bottlenecks in the system and
   achieve optimal network throughput. We compare two different deployment
   schemes: MI waveguides and direct MI transmission (no relays deployed)
   based connections between sensors. The two schemes are different in
   nature and propagation characteristics. Therefore, different
   optimization techniques are utilized. The optimal set of system
   parameters is chosen to maximize the channel capacity of the worst link
   and therefore optimize the available data rate. The bottleneck
   throughput of the direct MI transmission based network can be then
   compared with the respective results of the MI waveguides based network.
   In several cases, we observe a better performance of the direct MI
   transmission based networks.}},

Abstract = {{Random field models have been widely employed to develop a predictor of
   an expensive function based on observations from an experiment. The
   traditional framework for developing a predictor with random field
   models can fail due to the computational burden it requires. This
   problem is often seen in cases where the input of the expensive function
   is high dimensional. While many previous works have focused on
   developing an approximative predictor to resolve these issues, this
   article investigates a different solution mechanism. We demonstrate that
   when a general set of designs is employed, the resulting predictor is
   quick to compute and has reasonable accuracy. The fast computation of
   the predictor is made possible through an algorithm proposed by this
   work. This article also demonstrates methods to quickly evaluate the
   likelihood of the observations and describes some fast maximum
   likelihood estimates for unknown parameters of the random field. The
   computational savings can be several orders of magnitude when the input
   is located in a high-dimensional space. Beyond the fast computation of
   the predictor, existing research has demonstrated that a subset of these
   designs generate predictors that are asymptotically efficient. This work
   details some empirical comparisons to the more common space-filling
   designs that verify the designs are competitive in terms of resulting
   prediction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology that aids in the design of
   economically feasible Net Zero Energy (NZE) vaccine warehouses for the
   developing world. The methodology used a simulation-optimization
   approach to combine an optimization technique with two simulation
   software programs in order to determine the cost optimal design
   solution. To test its effectiveness, a case study building of a vaccine
   warehouse using typical Tunisian construction was analyzed for two
   construction techniques, five climates, and three photovoltaic panel
   prices in order to gain insights on the economic space of the optimal
   solution. The optimization results were used to provide generalized
   climatic recommendations for all of the building parameters studied and
   showed that by investing in better construction materials, the annual
   energy use can be cost-effectively reduced by 50\% compared to current
   construction practices. The proposed methodology can efficiently and
   effectively aid in the design of an economically feasible Net Zero
   Energy vaccine warehouse for the developing world. Its use in practice
   may be of great relevance as the results showed, on average, a \$42,000
   differences between an economically efficient and economically
   inefficient NZEB in terms of initial investment cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scaling continues to
   offer insurmountable challenges, questions about the performance

   Research has started in earnest to identify alternative computing
   paradigms that provide orders of magnitude improvement in
   power-performance for specific tasks such as graph traversal, image
   recognition, template matching, and so on. Further, post-CMOS device
   technologies have emerged that realize computing elements which are
   neither CMOS replacements nor suited to work as a binary switch. In this
   paper, we present the realization of coupled and scalable
   relaxation-oscillators utilizing the metal-insulator-metal transition of

   mobility transistors (HEMTs) made on Si, SiC, and diamond substrates
   were compared with devices on Si and SiC with integrated microchannel
   cooling. A device temperature limit of 200 degrees C was used to define
   the power density. The numerical model accounts for heat transfer from
   channel of the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs to the heat sink, fluid flow rates,
   pressure drop, and pumping power required for liquid cooling. The
   diamond substrate was shown to be superior in reducing the junction
   temperatures in conventional passive cooling methods employing high
   thermal conductivity substrates. However, single-phase liquid cooling
   with microchannels integrated into a SiC substrate showed that it is
   possible to operate the devices at power densities higher than that on
   200-mu m-thick diamond substrates, considering a maximum operational
   temperature of 200 degrees C. Microchannels integrated into the Si
   substrate also showed a slight increase in the power density compared

Abstract = {{A challenge for high-power millimeter-wave (mmw) traveling-wave tube
   (TWT) amplifiers is to realize high-power operation without incurring
   oscillation from backward-wave (BW) interaction. Conventional wisdom
   purports that contrawound (including ring bar) helix TWTs are superior
   to monofilar helix TWTs for stability against BW oscillations due to a
   zero or at least greatly suppressed BW interaction impedance (K-BW)
   compared with the forward-wave (FW) interaction impedance (K-FW). We use
   3-D electromagnetic (EM) field calculations of a ring-bar helix to
   compare the BW and FW interaction impedances. Using a sine/cosine basis
   set and a comparison at a fixed phase velocity (rather than fixed
   frequency assumed in previous analyses), we show that the BW interaction
   impedance is not always significantly suppressed in the
   ring-bar/contrawound helix. In spite of the lack of ubiquitous BW
   stability, we use EM simulations to illustrate that there remain
   specific, efficient, high-gain mmw ring-bar designs with K-BW < K-FW.
   The accuracy of the simulations is validated by experimental
   measurements that confirm simulation predictions of phase velocity and
   S-parameters.}},

   Angeles region (city and county). This quantification is being conducted
   to help policy-makers better target energy conservation and efficiency
   programs, pinpoint best locations for distributed solar generation, and
   support the development of policies for greater environmental
   sustainability. It provides a framework to which many more UM flows can
   be added to create greater understanding of the study area's resource
   dependencies. Going forward, together with policy analysis, UM can help
   untangle the complex intertwined resource dependencies that cities must
   address as they attempt to increase their environmental sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper's goal is to propose a set of perspectives on how mobile
   phones and computers might affect travel: by tapping into basic needs of
   travellers; by affecting some preconditions for its spatial
   configuration; and by altering its costs and benefits. In the age of
   ``digital nomadism,{''} mobile technology is likely to play an important
   role for the new mobility and work-life arrangements put into practice
   by a multitude of creative knowledge professionals. What emerges from
   our multi-perspective exploration is the realisation that mobile
   technology might offer people numerous new reasons to be mobile: by
   making them more informed; more capable of using a larger variety of
   physical spaces and re-negotiating obligations in real-time; and
   potentially more efficient in the allocation of their travel time and
   resources. On the other hand, it also appears that mobile technology can
   impose new burdens on travellers and make travel less appealing in some
   ways. Additional research is called for to improve our understanding of
   the circumstances under which each of these opposing outcomes occurs.
   The findings from such research could be used to better calibrate
   traffic simulation models, as well as to weigh the implications of
   emerging forms of travel behaviour for the environment. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{220-228}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{State and local agencies increasingly recognize the importance of
   bicycling activity and as the number of riders has grown over the past
   several years, the agencies are becoming more aware of the need to
   provide better bicycle infrastructure. This paper proposes a series of
   empirical models and applies them to the State of Maryland in the United
   States, using a spatial lag approach to explore land use, built
   environment, demographic, socio-economic, and traffic condition
   connections to bicycle ridership, defined as the number of bicycle trips
   generated by a given analysis zone per day. A set of models is proposed
   for three land-use typologies: urban, sub-urban and rural. The data that
   drives this analysis was obtained from a recently conducted Household
   Travel Survey (HTS) in the Baltimore Washington region in Maryland.
   Results show that some land uses, socio-economic and demographic
   characteristics, and transit accessibility are positively correlated
   with bicycle ridership. Other types of land use, transport system
   characteristics and income level have an inverse relationship with
   bicycle ridership. The contributing factors to bicycle ridership vary
   with land-use typology. This proposed approach could be used to evaluate
   factors relevant to bicycle demand. State and local agencies are advised
   to build designated bicycle paths according to traffic conditions and
   increase bicycle-parking capacity in specific establishments. (C) 2014

Title = {{Metal artifact correction for x-ray computed tomography using kV and
   selective MV imaging}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The overall goal of this work is to improve the computed
   tomography (CT) image quality for patients with metal implants or
   fillings by completing the missing kilovoltage (kV) projection data with
   selectively acquired megavoltage (MV) data that do not suffer from
   photon starvation. When both of these imaging systems, which are
   available on current radiotherapy devices, are used, metal streak
   artifacts are avoided, and the soft-tissue contrast is restored, even
   for regions in which the kV data cannot contribute any information.
   Methods: Three image-reconstruction methods, including two filtered
   back-projection (FBP)-based analytic methods and one iterative method,
   for combining kV and MV projection data from the two on-board imaging
   systems of a radiotherapy device are presented in this work. The
   analytic reconstruction methods modify the MV data based on the
   information in the projection or image domains and then patch the data
   onto the kV projections for a FBP reconstruction. In the iterative
   reconstruction, the authors used dual-energy (DE) penalized weighted
   least-squares (PWLS) methods to simultaneously combine the kV/MV data
   and perform the reconstruction.
   Results: The authors compared kV/MV reconstructions to kV-only
   reconstructions using a dental phantom with fillings and a hip-implant
   numerical phantom. Simulation results indicated that dual-energy
   sinogram patch FBP and the modified dual-energy PWLS method can
   successfully suppress metal streak artifacts and restore information
   lost due to photon starvation in the kV projections. The
   root-mean-square errors of soft-tissue patterns obtained using combined
   kV/MV data are 10-15 Hounsfield units smaller than those of the kV-only
   images, and the structural similarity index measure also indicates a
   5\%-10\% improvement in the image quality. The added dose from the MV
   scan is much less than the dose from the kV scan if a high efficiency MV
   detector is assumed.
   Conclusions: The authors have shown that it is possible to improve the
   image quality of kV CTs for patients with metal implants or fillings by
   completing the missing kV projection data with selectively acquired MV
   data that do not suffer from photon starvation. Numerical simulations
   demonstrated that dual-energy sinogram patch FBP and a modified kV/MV
   PWLS method can successfully suppress metal streak artifacts and restore
   information lost due to photon starvation in kV projections. Combined
   kV/MV images may permit the improved delineation of structures of
   interest in CT images for patients with metal implants or fillings. (C)

Abstract = {{We present ensembles of surface-ordered nanoparticle arrangements, which
   are formed by template-assisted self-assembly of monodisperse,
   protein-coated gold nanoparticles in wrinkle templates.
   Centimeter-squared areas of highly regular, linear assemblies with
   tunable line width are fabricated and their extinction cross sections
   can be characterized by conventional UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy. Modeling
   based on electrodynamic simulations shows a clear signature of strong
   plasmonic coupling with an interparticle spacing of 1-2 nm. We find
   evidence for well-defined plasmonic modes of quasi-infinite chains, such
   as resonance splitting and multiple radiant modes. Beyond elementary
   simulations on the individual chain level, we introduce an advanced
   model, which considers the chain length distribution as well as
   disorder. The step toward macroscopic sample areas not only opens
   perspectives for a range of applications in sensing, plasmonic light
   harvesting, surface enhanced spectroscopy, and information technology
   but also eases the investigation of hybridization and metamaterial
   effects fundamentally.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging applications in wearable technology, pervasive computing,
   human-machine interfacing, and implantable biomedical devices demand an
   appropriate power source that can sustainably operate for extended
   periods of time with minimal intervention (Wang, Z. L.; et al. Angew.
   Chem., Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 11700). Self-powered nanosystems, which
   harvest operating energy from its host (i.e., the human body), may be
   feasible due to their extremely low power consumption (Tian, B. Z.; et
   al. Nature 2007, 449, 885. Javey, A.; et al. Nature 2003, 424, 654. Cui,
   Y.; et al. Science 2001, 291, 851). Here we report materials and designs
   for wearable-on-skin piezoelectric devices based on ultrathin (2 mu m)
   solution-derived ZnO p-n homojunction films for the first time. The
   depletion region formed at the p-n homojunction effectively reduces
   internal screening of strain-induced polarization charges by free
   carriers in both n-ZnO and Sb-doped p-ZnO, resulting in significantly
   enhanced piezoelectric output compared to a single layer device. The p-n
   structure can be further grown on polymeric substrates conformable to a
   human wrist and used to convert movement of the flexor tendons into
   distinguishable electrical signals for gesture recognition. The ZnO
   homojunction piezoelectric devices may have applications in powering
   nanodevices, bioprobes, and self-powered human-machine interfacing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows that the formation and propagation of traffic
   oscillations in the absence of lane changes can be explained by the
   stochastic nature of drivers' acceleration processes. By adding a white
   noise to drivers' desired acceleration in free-flow, oscillations are
   produced that accord well with observation. This theory suggests that
   driver error is a function of roadway geometry, that it determines the
   average speed at the bottleneck, as well as oscillation period and
   amplitude. The model has been implemented with a single additional
   parameter compared to the kinematic wave model with bounded

Abstract = {{Chitin is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature and has
   tremendous potential in renewable materials for packaging, energy
   storage, reinforced composites, and biomedical engineering. Despite
   attractive properties, including biodegradability, antibacterial
   activity, and high strength, chitin is not utilized widely due to strong
   molecular interactions, which make solubilization and processing
   difficult. We report a high pressure homogenization route to produce
   pure chitin nanofibers (ChNFs) starting with a mildly acidic aqueous
   dispersion of purified crab alpha-chitin. The well-dispersed ChNFs with
   diameter similar to 20 nm do not form strong network structures under
   conditions explored herein and can be directly processed into useful
   materials, bypassing the need to dissolve the chitin. Dried ChNFs form
   pure self-standing chitin films with the lowest to-date reported O-2 and
   CO2 permeabilities of 0.006 and 0.018 barrer, respectively. Combined
   with high flexibility and optical transparency, these materials are
   ideal candidates for sustainable barrier packaging.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial separation processes comprise approximately 10\% of the
   global energy demand, driven largely by the utilization of thermal
   separation methods (e.g., distillation). Significant energy and cost
   savings can be realized using advanced separation techniques such as
   membranes and sorbents. One of the major barriers to acceptance of these
   techniques remains creating materials that are efficient and productive
   in the presence of aggressive industrial feeds. One promising class of
   emerging materials is zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), an
   important thermally and chemically stable subclass of metal organic
   frameworks (MOFs). The objectives of this paper are (i) to provide a
   current understanding of the synthetic methods that enable the immense
   tunability of ZIFs, (ii) to identify areas of success and areas for
   improvement when ZIFs are used as adsorbents, (iii) to identify areas of
   success and areas for improvement in ZIF membranes. A review is given of
   the state-of-the-art in ZIF synthesis procedures and novel ZIF formation
   pathways as well as their application in energy efficient separations.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to prepare nanolignin using a simple high shear homogenizer

   h of mechanical shearing. The C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
   P-31 NMR analysis showed that there were no major changes in the
   chemical composition between the starting kraft lignin particles and the
   nanolignin obtained after 4 h of mechanical treatment. The nanolignin
   particles did not show any change in molecular weight distribution and
   polydispersity compared to the original lignin particles. The nanolignin
   particles when used with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) increased the thermal
   stability of nanolignin/PVA blends more effectively compared to the
   original lignin/PVA blends.}},

Abstract = {{Through-silicon vias (TSVs) for passive interposer applications are
   being widely developed in industry and academia. This paper for the
   first time presents a double-side process to fabricate such TSVs. Such a
   process has many benefits, including not requiring carrier wafers for a
   wafer size between 150 and 200 mm and avoiding the chemical mechanical
   polishing processes after Cu plating. It thus significantly reduces the
   fabrication process steps compared with a traditional TSV. The
   reliability of TSVs formed this way has been studied by fabricating
   daisy chains and testing them for temperature cycling. Detailed
   mechanical failure mechanism analysis by a scanning electron microscope
   has been also carried out. In addition, finite-element models have been
   developed to analyze the fabrication-induced stresses and to estimate
   the thermomechanical reliability of the fabricated TSV structures.}},

Abstract = {{Use of high-kappa dielectric, atomic layer deposition (ALD) materials as
   an insulation layer material for capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducers (CMUTs) is investigated. The effect of insulation layer
   material and thickness on CMUT performance is evaluated using a simple
   parallel plate model. The model shows that both high dielectric constant
   and the electrical breakdown strength are important for the dielectric
   material, and significant performance improvement can be achieved,
   especially as the vacuum gap thickness is reduced. In particular, ALD
   hafnium oxide (HfO2) is evaluated and used as an improvement over
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon nitride
   (SixNy) for CMUTs fabricated by a low-temperature, complementary metal
   oxide semiconductor transistor-compatible, sacrificial release method.
   Relevant properties of ALD HfO2 such as dielectric constant and
   breakdown strength are characterized to further guide CMUT design.
   Experiments are performed on parallel fabricated test CMUTs with 50-nm
   gap and 16.5-MHz center frequency to measure and compare pressure output
   and receive sensitivity for 200-nm PECVD SixNy and 100-nm HfO2
   insulation layers. Results for this particular design show a 6-dB
   improvement in receiver output with the collapse voltage reduced by
   one-half; while in transmit mode, half the input voltage is needed to
   achieve the same maximum output pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Although many assistive devices have been developed and utilized to aid
   in daily living, the most general assistive means for individuals with
   visual impairments are the walking cane and guide dogs. These assistive
   means are effective in assisting the user in navigating within an
   environment; however, the navigation space is limited to the proximal
   environment of the user. Thus, in this paper, we discuss a method to
   increase the range of accessibility to a remote environment through
   robotic embodiment that enables teleoperation and teleperception through
   multi-modal feedback. In order to transform remote spatial information
   into a non-visual modality, we present a framework for utilizing an
   RGB-D-based depth camera, a mobile robot, and a haptic interface for 3D
   haptic rendering to accomplish the goal of haptic exploration of a
   remote environment. Experiments with three different control methods for
   robot interaction are designed for users with and without visual
   impairments. Several hypothesis are built to study the correlation
   between control/feedback modality and performance in telerobotic
   operations. Results show that users performed best when combining
   semi-autonomous navigation with 3D haptic exploration and also rated
   their experience with our system as fairly good. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Abstract = {{We examined the relationship between social rank and brain white matter
   (WM) microstructure, and socioemotional behavior, and its modulation by
   serotonin (5HT) transporter (5HTT) polymorphisms in prepubertal female
   macaques. Using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial
   statistics, social status differences were found in medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) WM and cortico-thalamic tracts, with subordinates showing
   higher WM structural integrity (measured as fractional anisotropy, FA)
   than dominant animals. 5HTT genotype-related differences were detected
   in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, where s-variants had
   higher FA than I/I animals. Status by 5HTT interaction effects were
   found in (1) external capsule (middle longitudinal fasciculus), (2)
   parietal WM, and (3) short-range PFC tracts, with opposite effects in
   dominant and subordinate animals. In most regions showing FA
   differences, opposite differences were detected in radial diffusivity,
   but none in axial diffusivity, suggesting that differences in tract
   integrity likely involve differences in myelin. These findings highlight
   that differences in social rank are associated with differences in WM
   structural integrity in juveniles, particularly in tracts connecting
   prefrontal, sensory processing, motor and association regions, sometimes
   modulated by 5HTT genotype. Differences in these tracts were associated
   with increased emotional reactivity in subordinates, particularly with
   higher submissive and fear behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Metatranscriptomics of environmental samples enables the identification
   of community activities without a priori knowledge of taxonomic or
   functional composition. However, several technical challenges associated
   with the RNA preparation protocols can affect the relative
   representation of transcripts and data interpretation. Here, seven
   replicate metatranscriptomes from planktonic freshwater samples (Lake
   Lanier, USA) were sequenced to evaluate technical and biological
   reproducibility of different RNA extraction protocols. Organic versus
   bead-beating extraction showed significant enrichment for low versus
   high G+C\% mRNA populations respectively. The sequencing data were best
   modelled by a negative binomial distribution to account for the large
   technical and biological variation observed. Despite the variation, the
   transcriptional activities of populations that persisted in year-round
   metagenomes from the same site consistently showed distinct expression
   patterns, reflecting different ecologic strategies and allowing us to
   test prevailing models on the contribution of both rare biosphere and
   abundant members to community activity. For instance, abundant members
   of the Verrucomicrobia phylum systematically showed low transcriptional
   activity compared with other abundant taxa. Our results provide a
   practical guide to the analysis of metatranscriptomes and advance
   understanding of the activity and ecology of abundant and rare members

Abstract = {{A difficulty in the field of gene therapy is the need to increase the
   susceptibility of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to ex vivo genetic
   manipulation. To overcome this obstacle a high-throughput screen was
   performed to identify compounds that could enhance the transduction of
   target cells by lentiviral vectors. Of the 1280 compounds initially
   screened using the myeloiderythroid- leukemic K562 cell line, 30 were
   identified as possible enhancers of viral transduction. Among the
   positive hits were known enhancers of transduction (camptothecin,
   etoposide and taxol), as well as the previously unidentified phorbol
   12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The percentage of green fluorescent
   protein (GFP)-positive-expressing K562 cells was increased more than
   fourfold in the presence of PMA. In addition, the transduction of K562
   cells with a lentiviral vector encoding fVIII was four times greater in
   the presence of PMA as determined by an increase in the levels of
   provirus in genetically modified cells. PMA did not enhance viral
   transduction of all cell types (for example, sca-1(+) mouse
   hematopoietic cells) but did enhance viral transduction of human bone
   marrow-derived CD34(+) cells. Notably, the percentage of GFP-positive
   CD34(+) cells was increased from 7\% in the absence of PMA to greater
   than 22\% in the presence of 1 nM PMA. PMA did not affect colony
   formation of CD34(+) cells or the expression of the hematopoietic
   markers CD34 and CD45. These data demonstrate that high-throughput
   screening can be used to identify compounds that increase the
   transduction efficiency of lentiviral vectors, identifying PMA as a
   potential enhancer of lentiviral HSC transduction.}},

Abstract = {{Although microsystems can replenish batteries and energize modules with
   ambient energy without having to store much energy on board, on-chip
   photovoltaic cells and thermoelectric generators generate 50-400 mV,
   which is usually not sufficiently high to operate transistors. Although
   stacking cells is possible, the tradeoff in power is ultimately
   unfavorable because small transducers output little power. Thankfully,
   transformers can boost millivolt voltages but not without a significant
   toll on space. Motion-propelled microelectromechanical system switches
   can also start a harvester but only in the presence of vibrations.
   Moreover, although 50-300-mV ring and LC oscillating networks can charge
   batteries, initialization requires 1-15 ms. The prototyped 0.18-mu m
   CMOS oscillating starter presented here draws power from 250-450 mV to
   charge 100 pF to 0.32-1.55 V in 44-92 mu s. In the steady state, the

Abstract = {{Static random access memory arrays designed in sub-90-nm technologies
   are highly vulnerable to process variation-induced read/write/access
   failures. In memory-based reconfigurable computing frameworks, which use
   large high-density memory array, such failures lead to incorrect
   execution of mapped applications. It causes loss in quality of service
   (QoS) for digital signal processing (DSP) applications. In this paper,
   we analyze the effect of parameter variations on QoS in a memory-based
   reconfigurable computing framework. Next, we propose a preferential
   design approach at both application mapping and circuit level, which can
   significantly improve QoS and yield under large parameter variations.
   The proposed application mapping process considers the reliability map
   of a memory array and maps the important components with respect to QoS
   to more reliable memory blocks under performance constraint. At circuit
   level, we exploit the read-dominant memory access pattern to skew the
   memory cells for better read stability leading to improved QoS. Such a
   architecture/circuit codesign approach can also tolerate increased
   failure rate at low operating voltage, thus facilitating low-power
   operation. The effect of the approach is studied for two common DSP
   applications, namely discrete cosine transform and finite-impulse
   response (FIR) filter. The simulation results for FIR application show
   45\% improvement in power at iso-QoS and 47\% in yield for a target peak
   signal to noise ratio at 45-nm technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents hardware results for a neuromorphic approach to path
   planning using a neuron array integrated circuit. The algorithm is
   explained and experimental results are presented showing 100\% correct
   and optimal performance for a large number of randomized maze
   environment scenarios. Based on neuron signal propagation speed, neuron
   integrated circuit (IC) path planning may offer a computational
   advantage over state-of-the-art wavefront planners implemented on
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Analytical time and space
   complexity metrics are developed in this paper for a neuron ICs planner,
   and these are verified against experimental data. Optimality and
   completeness are also addressed. The neuron structure allows one to
   develop sophisticated graphs with varied edge weights between nodes of
   the grid. Two interesting cases are presented. First, asymmetric edge
   costs are assigned to describe cases, which have a certain cost to
   travel a path in one direction, but a different cost to travel the same
   path but in the opposite direction. The application of this feature can
   translate to real world problems involving hills, traffic patterns, and
   so forth. Second, cases are presented where the nodes near an obstacle
   are given higher costs to visit these nodes. This is in an effort to
   keep the autonomous agent at a safe distance from obstacles. This grid
   weighting can also be used to differentiate among terrains such as sand,
   ice, gravel, or smooth pavement. Experimental results are presented for
   both cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents fabrication approaches for magnesium (Mg)
   microstructures embedded in biodegradable polymers using through-mold Mg
   electrodeposition and metal-transfer-molding. Biodegradable implantable
   electronics have garnered increasing interest from the medical community
   for the monitoring and treatment of transient diseases. Magnesium is a
   biodegradable metal with desirable properties, and the ability to
   micropattern Mg thick films (i.e., about >1 mu m) with direct
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) integration would support the
   development of more sophisticated and clinically relevant biodegradable
   devices and microsystems. Magnesium microstructures were electroplated
   through micropatterned water-soluble molds in a nonaqueous electrolyte
   and transfer molded into a biodegradable polymer. Electroplated Mg
   compared favorably with commercial Mg foil based on elemental
   composition, crystal orientation, electrical resistivity, and corrosion
   behavior. Magnesium electroplated to a thickness of up to 50 mu m showed
   a grain size of similar to 10 mu m, and minimum feature dimensions of
   100 mu m in width and spacing. Completely biodegradable Mg and
   poly-L-lactic acid constructs were demonstrated. The application of Mg
   thick films toward biodegradable energy sources was explored through the
   fabrication and testing of biodegradable Mg/Fe batteries. The batteries
   exhibited a capacity and power of up to 2.85 mAh and 39 mu W,
   respectively. Results confirmed the advantages of electrodeposited Mg
   microstructures for biodegradable MEMS applications.}},

   four papers deal with tsunami hydrodynamics in the far field or over the
   wider Pacific basin. In addition, a series of five papers presents
   studies of four new tsunami and earthquake events occurring over this
   time period. This includes tsunamis in El Salvador, the Philippines,

Abstract = {{Watermarks found during the post-event surveys of the 2011 Tohoku
   tsunami confirmed extreme runup heights at several locations along the
   central to northern part of the Sanriku coast, Japan. We measured the
   maximum height of nearly 40 m above mean sea level at a narrow coastal
   valley of the Aneyoshi district. Wave records by offshore GPS-buoys
   suggest that the remarkably high runup was associated with a leading,
   impulsive crest of the tsunami amplified by local bathymetry and
   topography. In order to elucidate the underlying amplification
   mechanism, we apply a numerical model to reproduce the measured
   distribution of tsunami heights along the target coastline. A series of
   numerical tests under different boundary conditions suggests that a
   spectral component with a dominant period of 4-5 min in the leading wave
   play a key role in generating the extreme runup. Further analyses
   focusing on the Aneyoshi district confirm that the short wavelength
   component undergoes critical amplification in a narrow inlet. Our
   findings highlight the importance of resolving offshore waveforms as
   well as local bathymetry and topography when simulating extreme runup
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Post-tsunami field surveys in the Minami-Soma exclusion zone in the
   Fukushima Prefecture were delayed for 15 months after the 2011 Tohoku
   tsunami. The area was subject to access restrictions until June 2012 due
   to high radiation levels caused by the meltdown at the Fukushima
   Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant. The distribution of the measured tsunami
   heights is presented in combination with observed infrastructure damage.
   The enhanced tsunami heights in the areas along the shoreline are
   attributed to wave reflection, funneling and splash-up at cliffs and
   seawalls, as well as the increased flow resistance as the tsunami plowed
   through coastal pine-tree forests. Consequently, large tsunami heights
   exceeding 10 m were limited to areas within 500 m from the shoreline.
   Onshore profiles of the maximum inundation levels were dependent on
   inland topography: tsunami heights increased inland in steep V-shaped
   valleys, while decaying with inundation distance along flat coastal
   plains. Tsunami flood levels in the coastal plains are affected by the
   extent of seawall damage: coastal flood levels are higher behind
   completely destroyed seawalls than behind partially damaged coastal
   defenses. Remnant seawalls provided valuable lessons to be implemented
   in future designs of tenacious structures based on the Japanese concept
   of `nebari' representing resiliency to endure tsunami overflow as the
   original design height is exceeded.}},

   section of coastline in eastern El Salvador. Less severe inundation was
   reported in northern Nicaragua. In the far-field, the tsunami was

Abstract = {{In robust parameter design, the quadratic loss function is commonly
   used. However, this loss function is not always realistic and the
   expected loss may not exist in some cases. This paper proposes the use
   of a general class of bounded loss functions that are cumulative
   distribution functions and probability density functions. New loss
   functions are investigated and the loss functions are shown to yield
   optimal settings different from those obtained with the quadratic loss.
   For the class of models that are linear in the noise factors, we give a
   numerical method based on characteristic function inversion for
   computing expected loss. The method is quick and accurate; thus, it
   eases computation of the expected loss and comparison of alternative
   control factor settings. This method is applicable as long as the
   distributions chosen to represent the loss function and noise factors
   have tractable characteristic functions.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid foams are familiar from beer, frothed milk, or bubble baths;
   foams in general also play important roles in oil recovery, lightweight
   packaging, and insulation. Here a new class of foams is reported,
   obtained by frothing a suspension of colloidal particles in the presence
   of a small amount of an immiscible secondary liquid. A unique aspect of
   these foams, termed capillary foams, is the particle-mediated spreading
   of the minority liquid around the gas bubbles. The resulting mixed
   particle/liquid coating can stabilize bubbles against coalescence even
   when the particles alone cannot. The coated bubbles are further
   immobilized by entrapment in a network of excess particles connected by
   bridges of the minority liquid. Capillary foams were prepared with a
   diverse set of particle/liquid combinations to demonstrate the
   generality of the phenomenon. The observed foam stability correlates
   with the particle affinity for the liquid interface formed by spreading
   the minority liquid at the bubble surface.}},

   the traditional gas-solid-surface heterogeneous reactions to
   liquid-catalysis reactions. With this design, raw biomasses, such as
   cellulose, starch, and even grass or wood powders can be directly
   converted into electricity. The power densities of the fuel cell with
   switchgrass (dry powder) and bush allamanda (freshly collected) are 44
   mWcm(-2) and 51 mWcm(-2) respectively. For the cellulose-based biomass
   fuel cell, the power density is almost 3000 times higher than that of
   cellulose-based microbial fuel cells. Unlike noble-metal catalysts, POMs
   are tolerant to most organic and inorganic contaminants. Therefore,
   almost any raw biomass can be used directly to produce electricity
   without prior purification.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium (Ti) and Ti alloys are used in orthopaedic/spine applications
   where biological implant fixation, or osseointegration, is required for
   long-term stability. These implants employ macro-scale features to
   provide mechanical stability until arthrodesis, features that are too
   large to influence healing at the cellular level. Micron-scale rough Ti
   alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) increases osteoblastic differentiation and osteogenic
   factor production in vitro and increases in vivo bone formation;
   however, effects of overall topography, including sub-micron scale and
   nanoscale features, on osteoblast lineage cells are less well
   appreciated. To address this, Ti6Al4V surfaces with
   macro/micro/nano-textures were generated using sand blasting and acid
   etching that had comparable average roughness values but differed in
   other roughness parameters (total roughness, profile roughness, maximum
   peak height, maximum valley depth, root-mean-squared roughness,
   kurtosis, skewness) (\#5, \#9, and \#12). Human mesenchymal stem cells
   (HMSCs) and normal human osteoblasts (NHOst) were cultured for 7 days on
   the substrates and then analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity and
   osteocalcin content, production of osteogenic local factors, and
   integrin subunit expression. All three surfaces supported osteoblastic
   differentiation of HMSCs and further maturation of NHOst cells, but the
   greatest response was seen on the \#9 substrate, which had the lowest
   skewness and kurtosis. The \#9 surface also induced highest expression
   of alpha 2 and beta 1 integrin mRNA. HMSCs produced highest levels of
   ITGAV on \#9, suggesting this integrin may play a role for early lineage
   cells. These results indicate that osteoblast lineage cells are
   sensitive to specific micro/nanostructures, even when overall macro
   roughness is comparable and suggest that skewness and kurtosis are
   important variables.}},

Abstract = {{2,4-Dinitroanisole (DNAN) is an insensitive munition ingredient used in

   Little is known about the environmental behavior of DNAN. There are

   bacteria with complete biodegradation capability have been reported.
   Nocardioides sp. strain JS1661 was isolated from activated sludge based
   on its ability to grow on DNAN as the sole source of carbon and energy.
   Enzyme assays indicated that the first reaction involves hydrolytic
   release of methanol to form 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP). Growth yield
   and enzyme assays indicated that 2,4-DNP underwent subsequent
   degradation by a previously established pathway involving formation of a
   hydride-Meisenheimer complex and release of nitrite. Identification of
   the genes encoding the key enzymes suggested recent evolution of the

Abstract = {{Focused-electron-beam-induced processing (FEBIP), a resist-free additive
   nanomanufacturing technique, is an actively researched method for
   ``direct-write{''} processing of a wide range of structural and
   functional nanomaterials, with high degree of spatial and time-domain
   control. This article attempts to critically assess the FEBIP
   capabilities and unique value proposition in the context of processing
   of electronics materials, with a particular emphasis on emerging carbon
   (i.e., based on graphene and carbon nanotubes) devices and interconnect
   structures. One of the major hurdles in advancing the carbon-based
   electronic materials and device fabrication is a disjoint nature of
   various processing steps involved in making a functional device from the
   precursor graphene/CNT materials. Not only this multi-step sequence
   severely limits the throughput and increases the cost, but also
   dramatically reduces the processing reproducibility and negatively
   impacts the quality because of possible between-the-step contamination,
   especially for impurity-susceptible materials such as graphene. The
   FEBIP provides a unique opportunity to address many challenges of carbon
   nanoelectronics, especially when it is employed as part of an integrated
   processing environment based on multiple ``beams{''} of energetic
   particles, including electrons, photons, and molecules. This avenue is
   promising from the applications' prospective, as such a multi-functional
   (electron/photon/molecule beam) enables one to define shapes
   (patterning), form structures (deposition/etching), and modify
   (cleaning/doping/annealing) properties with locally resolved control on
   nanoscale using the same tool without ever changing the processing
   environment. It thus will have a direct positive impact on enhancing
   functionality, improving quality and reducing fabrication costs for
   electronic devices, based on both conventional CMOS and emerging carbon
   (CNT/graphene) materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate Li adsorption mechanisms on the C-60-SWCNT
   hybrid system using density functional theory. It is found that the Li
   adsorption energy of the C-60-SWCNT hybrid system is increased in
   comparison to that of the pure SWCNT. The Li adsorption energy ranges
   from -1.917 eV to -2.642 eV for the single-Li adsorbed system and from
   -2.351 eV to -2.636 eV for the double-Li adsorbed system. It is also
   found that the adsorption energy becomes similar at most positions
   throughout the structure. In addition, the Li adsorption energy of 31-Li
   system is calculated to be -1.863 eV, which is significantly lower than
   the Li-Li binding energy (-1.030 eV). These results infer that Li atoms
   will be adsorbed on the space 1) between C-60 and C-60; 2) between SWCNT
   and C-60; 3) the rest of the space (e. g. between SWCNTs), rather than
   form Li clusters. As more Li atoms are adsorbed onto the C-60-SWCNT
   hybrid system due to such improved Li adsorption capability, the
   metallic character of the system is enhanced, which is confirmed via the
   band structure and electronic density of states. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   current practice without compromising system-level bit-error rate (while
   keeping the end-user experience unaffected). In contrast to traditional
   wireless circuits with limited tunability, such a zero-margin design is
   achieved by close loop adaptation of the wireless front-end circuits to
   ensure that they only consume the minimum power and deliver just enough

Abstract = {{Electromigration (EM) in power distribution networks (PDNs) is a major
   reliability issue in 3-D ICs. While the EM issues of local vias and
   through-silicon-vias (TSV) have been studied separately, the interplay
   of TSVs and conventional local vias in 3-D ICs has not been well
   investigated. This co-design is necessary when the die-to-die vertical
   power delivery is done using both TSVs and local interconnects. In this
   paper, we model EM for PDNs of 3-D ICs with a focus on multiscale via
   (MSV) structure, i.e., TSVs and local vias used together for vertical
   power delivery. We study the impact of structure, material, and
   preexisting void conditions on the EM-related lifetime of our MSV
   structures. We also investigate the transient IR-voltage change of
   full-chip level 3-D PDNs with MSVs with our model. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our EM modeling can effectively capture the EM
   reliability of the full-chip level 3-D PDNs with MSVs, which can be hard
   to achieve by the traditional EM analysis based on the individual local
   via or the TSV.}},

   solver and full-chip TSV-to-TSV coupling analysis in both the worst case
   and the average case show this model is accurate and efficient. It is
   found that 3-D nets receive more noise than their 2-D counterparts due
   to TSV-to-TSV coupling. To alleviate this coupling noise on TSV nets,
   two new optimization methods are investigated. One way is to utilize
   guard rings around the victim TSV so as to form a stronger discharging
   path, an alternative approach is to adopt differential signal
   transmission to improve noise immunity. These techniques have been
   implemented on 3-D IC designs with TSVs placed regularly or irregularly.

Abstract = {{The safe operation of gas-insulated switchgears (GIS) is crucial for
   modern power systems, since the breakdown or failure of GIS equipment
   would cause severe interruption of the power supply and even accidents.
   Among the problems that would potentially harm the operation conditions
   of GIS apparatus, partial discharge (PD) and its subsequent
   electromagnetic (EM) waves serve as the essential considerations. In
   order to investigate the propagation property of high-frequency EM waves
   excited by PD in typical GIS structures, experiments and corresponding
   numerical simulation were conducted with convincing results presented in
   this paper. The spectrum analyzer working in two-port insertion loss
   mode was applied to capture the attenuation characteristic of the EM
   wave from 100 MHz to 1 GHz through three representative types of
   structures: the spacer, L-shaped branch, and T-shaped branch. Besides,
   the corresponding simulation platforms have been built and the High
   Frequency Structure Simulator was adopted to numerically simulate the
   propagation of high-frequency EM wave in GIS. The simulation results
   follow substantial consistency with the experimental results. Based upon
   these results, major causes of the EM wave attenuation have been
   analyzed, namely, the reflection and the mode transformation. Taking the
   presented EM wave propagation properties into account, the optimal
   placement of PD ultra-high frequency sensors for online monitoring of
   GIS equipment is discussed to improve the monitoring sensitivity and
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Attachment of dissimilar materials is prone to failure due to stress
   concentrations that can arise their interface. A compositionally or
   structurally graded transition can dissipate these stress concentrations
   and thereby toughen an attachment. The interface between compliant
   tendon and stiff bone utilizes a monotonic change in hydroxylapatite
   mineral ({''}mineral{''}) content to produce a gradient in mechanical
   properties and mitigate stress concentrations. Previous efforts to mimic
   the natural tendon-to-bone attachment have included electrospun
   nanofibrous polymer scaffolds with gradients in mineral. Mineralization
   of the nanofiber scaffolds has typically been achieved using simulated
   body fluid (SBF). Depending on the specific formulation of SBF, mineral
   morphologies ranged from densely packed small crystals to platelike
   crystal florets. Although this mineralization of scaffolds produced
   increases in modulus, the peak modulus achieved remained significantly
   below that of bone. Missing from these prior empirical approaches was
   insight into the effect of mineral morphology on scaffold mechanics and
   on the potential for the approach to ultimately achieve moduli
   approaching that of bone. Here, we applied two mineralization methods to
   generate scaffolds with spatial gradations in mineral content, and
   developed methods to quantify the stiffening effects and evaluate them
   in the context of theoretical bounds. We asked whether either of the
   mineralization methods we developed holds potential to achieve adequate
   stiffening of the scaffold, and tested the hypothesis that the smoother,
   denser mineral coating could attain more potent stiffening effects.
   Testing this hypothesis required development of and comparison to
   homogenization bounds, and development of techniques to estimate mineral
   volume fractions and spatial gradations in modulus. For both
   mineralization strategies, energy dispersive X-ray analysis demonstrated
   the formation of linear gradients in mineral concentration along the
   length of the scaffolds, and Raman spectroscopic analysis revealed that
   the mineral produced was hydroxylapatite. Mechanical testing showed that
   the stiffness gradient using the new method was significantly steeper.
   By analyzing the scaffolds using micromechanical modeling techniques and
   extrapolating from our experimental results, we present evidence that
   the new mineralization protocol has the potential to achieve levels of
   stiffness adequate to contribute to enhanced repair of tendon-to-bone

Abstract = {{Commercial pure titanium sheets were deformed by shear rolling at 400
   degrees C with subsequent annealing to investigate microstructure and
   texture evolution along with its effects on the mechanical properties. A
   four sheet multilayer rolling scheme was used to isolate shear strains
   within the outer sheets, termed isolated shear rolling (ISR), thus
   allowing for direct comparison between shear strained material (outer
   sheets) and plane-strained material under similar conditions.
   Microstructure and texture evolution were investigated by electron
   backscatter diffraction analysis, while mechanical properties were
   evaluated through tensile testing aided by digital image correlation
   (DIC). Texture was seen to evolve from a +/- 30 degrees transverse
   direction (TD) split basal texture to primarily basal texture
   ((0001)//Normal Direction) for the shear-strained sheets, in comparison
   with a slight rotation to a +/- 20 degrees TD-split for the
   plane-strained sheets. After short-term annealing at 600 degrees C for
   15 min, texture remained similar to that of the as-processed material
   yet at lower intensity levels. Compared to the base material,
   shear-rolled material showed much higher Lankford Coefficient values,
   with a significant boost attributed to shear deformation. The greater
   stretch formability is achieved in the shear-rolled material by rotation
   of the basal poles to become parallel to the sheet thickness. The
   results obtained here with ISR in regards to the effects of inducing
   higher shear strains on the rolled material are comparable to those
   reported in the literature by differential speed rolling (DSR). (C) 2014

Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1108-1114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Efforts to create platelet-like structures for the augmentation of
   haemostasis have focused solely on recapitulating aspects of platelet
   adhesion(1); more complex platelet behaviours such as clot
   contraction(2) are assumed to be inaccessible to synthetic systems.
   Here, we report the creation of fully synthetic platelet-like particles
   (PLPs) that augment clotting in vitro under physiological flow
   conditions and achieve wound-triggered haemostasis and decreased
   bleeding times in vivo in a traumatic injury model. PLPs were
   synthesized by combining highly deformable microgel particles with
   molecular-recognition motifs identified through directed evolution. In
   vitro and in silico analyses demonstrate that PLPs actively collapse
   fibrin networks, an emergent behaviour that mimics in vivo clot
   contraction. Mechanistically, clot collapse is intimately linked to the
   unique deformability and affnity of PLPs for fibrin fibres, as evidenced
   by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Our findings should inform
   the future design of a broader class of dynamic, biosynthetic composite
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally derived biomaterials have emerged as modulators of cell
   function and tissue substitutes. Here, we developed crosslinked
   glutaraldehyde (GTA) scaffolds for the expansion and differentiation of
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The mechanical and architectural
   properties of the scaffolds were altered by varying the concentration of
   gelatin and GTA. Higher GTA concentrations were associated with an
   increase in more confined pores and osteogenic differentiation. In
   addition, myogenic potential varied with crosslinking degree, although
   bulk mechanical properties were unaltered. Correlation analysis revealed
   that ALP activity of differentiated MSCs on higher gelatin concentration
   scaffolds was dependent on traditional effectors, including environment
   elasticity and spread area. In contrast, the differentiation capacity of
   cells cultured on lower gelatin concentration scaffolds did not
   correlate with these factors, instead it was dependent on the hydrated
   pore structure. These results suggest that scaffold composition can
   determine what factors direct differentiation and may have critical
   implications for biomaterial design.}},
