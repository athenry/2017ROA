Abstract = {{The effect of variance of particle size plays a dominant role in the
   wear rate of materials. In the present research, such effect is
   investigated using computer simulation, in which Monte Carlo method has
   been combined to calculate the wear rate of the materials. Abrasive wear
   rates of materials with the same particle average size exhibited a rapid
   increase with increasing variance of particle sizes distribution from
   small variance. Then wear rates maximize and decrease slightly with
   further increase of variance. The relationship between particle
   variances and hardness is also investigated. The particle size effect is
   explained via comparison of wear pattern of different particle sizes.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{366-373}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aromatic organosulfates are identified and quantified in fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5) from Lahore, Pakistan, Godavari, Nepal, and
   Pasadena, California. To support detection and quantification, authentic
   standards of phenyl sulfate, benzyl sulfate, 3- and 4-methylphenyl
   sulfate and 2-, 3-, and 4-methylbenzyl sulfate were synthesized.
   Authentic standards and aerosol samples were analyzed by
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to negative
   electrospray ionization (ESI) quadrupole time-of-flight (ToF) mass
   spectrometry. Benzyl sulfate was present in all three locations at
   concentrations ranging from 4 to 90 pg m(-3). Phenyl sulfate,
   methylphenyl sulfates and methylbenzyl sulfates were observed
   intermittently with abundances of 4 pg m(-3), 2-31 pg m(-3), 109 pg
   m(-3), respectively. Characteristic fragment ions of aromatic
   organosulfates include the sulfite radical (center dot SO(3) over bar,
   m/z 80) and the sulfate radical (center dot SO(4) over bar, m/z 96).
   Instrumental response factors of phenyl and benzyl sulfates varied by a
   factor of 4.3, indicating that structurally-similar organosulfates have
   significantly different instrumental responses and highlighting the need
   to develop authentic standards for absolute quantitation organosulfates.
   In an effort to better understand the sources of aromatic organosulfates
   to the atmosphere, chamber experiments with the precursor toluene were
   conducted under conditions that form biogenic organosulfates. Aromatic
   organosulfates were not detected in the chamber samples, suggesting that
   they form through different pathways, have different precursors (e.g.
   naphthalene or methylnaphthalene), or are emitted from primary sources.

Title = {{Sensitivity of air quality to potential future climate change and

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{552-563}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Simulated present and future air quality is compared for the years
   2006-2010 and 2048-2052 over the contiguous United States (CONUS) using
   the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Regionally
   downscaled present and future climate results are developed using GISS
   and the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model. Present and future
   emissions are estimated using MARKAL 9R model. O-3 and PM2.5
   sensitivities to precursor emissions for the years 2010 and 2050 are
   calculated using CMAQ-DDM (Direct Decoupled Method). We find major
   improvements in future U.S. air quality including generally decreased
   MDA8 (maximum daily 8-hr average O-3) mixing ratios and PM2.5
   concentrations and reduced frequency of NAAQS O-3 standard exceedances
   in most major U.S. cities. The Eastern and Pacific U.S. experience the
   largest reductions in summertime seasonal average MDA8 (up to 12 ppb)
   with localized decreases in the 4th highest MDA8 of the year, decreasing
   by up to 25 ppb. Results from a Climate Penalty (CP) scenario isolate
   the impact of climate change on air quality and show that future climate
   change tends to increase O-3 mixing ratios in some regions of the U.S.,
   with climate change causing increases of over 10 ppb in the annual 4th
   highest MDA8 in Los Angeles. Seasonal average PM2.5 decreases (2-4 mu g
   m(-3)) over the Eastern U.S. are accounted for by decreases in sulfate
   and nitrate concentrations resulting from reduced mobile and point
   source emissions of NOx and SOx. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Bone metastasis is a complication that occurs in 80 \% of women with
   advanced breast cancer. Despite the prevalence of bone metastatic
   disease, the avenues for its clinical management are still restricted to
   palliative treatment options. In fact, the underlying mechanisms of
   breast cancer osteotropism have not yet been fully elucidated due to a
   lack of suitable in vivo models that are able to recapitulate the human
   disease. In this work, we review the current transplantation-based
   models to investigate breast cancer-induced bone metastasis and
   delineate the strengths and limitations of the use of different grafting
   techniques, tissue sources, and hosts. We further show that humanized
   xenograft models incorporating human cells or tissue grafts at the
   primary tumor site or the metastatic site mimic more closely the human
   disease. Tissue-engineered constructs are emerging as a reproducible
   alternative to recapitulate functional humanized tissues in these murine
   models. The development of advanced humanized animal models may provide
   better platforms to investigate the mutual interactions between human
   cancer cells and their microenvironment and ultimately improve the
   translation of preclinical drug trials to the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most tantalizing applications of piezoelectricity is to
   harvest energy from ambient mechanical vibrations for powering micro and
   nano devices. However, piezoelectricity is restricted only to certain
   materials and is severely compromised at high temperatures. In this
   article, we examine in detail, the possibility of using the phenomenon
   of flexoelectricity for energy harvesting. The flexoelectric effect is
   universally present in all dielectrics and exhibits a strong scaling
   with size. Using a simple beam-based paradigmatical design, we
   theoretically and computationally examine flexoelectric energy
   harvesting under harmonic mechanical excitation. We find that the output
   power density and conversion efficiency increase significantly when the
   beam thickness reduces from micro to nanoscale and
   flexoelectricity-based energy harvesting can be a viable alternative to
   piezoelectrics. Specifically, the conversion efficiency in flexoelectric
   transduction at sub-micron thickness levels is observed to increase by
   two orders of magnitude as the thickness is reduced by an order of
   magnitude. The flexoelectric energy harvester works even for a single
   layer beam with a symmetric cross section which is not possible in
   piezoelectric energy harvesting. Our results also pave the way for
   exploration of high temperature energy harvesting since unlike
   piezoelectricity, flexoelectricity persists well beyond the Curie
   temperatures of the high electromechanical coupling ferroelectrics that
   are often used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present sublinear-time (randomized) algorithms for finding simple
   cycles of length at least k3 and tree-minors in bounded-degree graphs.
   The complexity of these algorithms is related to the distance of the
   graph from being C-k-minor free (resp., free from having the
   corresponding tree-minor). In particular, if the graph is (1)-far from
   being cycle-free (i.e., a constant fraction of the edges must be deleted
   to make the graph cycle-free), then the algorithm finds a cycle of
   polylogarithmic length in time O</mml:mover>(<mml:msqrt>N</mml:msqrt>),
   where N denotes the number of vertices. This time complexity is optimal
   up to polylogarithmic factors. The foregoing results are the outcome of
   our study of the complexity of one-sided error property testing
   algorithms in the bounded-degree graphs model. For example, we show that
   cycle-freeness of N-vertex graphs can be tested with one-sided error
   within time complexity O</mml:mover>(poly(1/E)<mml:msqrt>N</mml:msqrt>),
   where denotes the proximity parameter. This matches the known
   (<mml:msqrt>N</mml:msqrt>) query lower bound for one-sided error
   cycle-freeness testing, and contrasts with the fact that any minor-free
   property admits a two-sided error tester of query complexity that only
   depends on . We show that the same upper bound holds for testing whether
   the input graph has a simple cycle of length at least k, for any k3. On
   the other hand, for any fixed tree T, we show that T-minor freeness has
   a one-sided error tester of query complexity that only depends on the
   proximity parameter . Our algorithm for finding cycles in bounded-degree
   graphs extends to general graphs, where distances are measured with
   respect to the actual number of edges. Such an extension is not possible
   with respect to finding tree-minors in o<mml:mo
   stretchy={''}false{''}>(<mml:msqrt>N</mml:msqrt><mml:mo

Title = {{Capacity and throughput analysis of nanoscale machine communication

Abstract = {{The expectedly very limited communication distance of nanoscale machines
   in the Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) is one of the main factors narrowing
   the scope of the nanonetworking applications. In this paper, the use of
   the transparency windows in the THz Band, which provide
   molecular-absorption-free transmission, is proposed as a way to extend
   the communication distance of nanomachines. The trade-offs between the
   signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, channel capacity, transmission bandwidth
   and communication distance for these windows are identified. The results
   suggest that, by focusing on the first transparency window (0.1-0.54
   THz), reliable communication up to 10 m is feasible when using just 0.1
   aJ per symbol to achieve a capacity of up to 10 Mbps. For the same
   energy per symbol, when using the entire THz Band, the capacity is up to
   2 Tbps, but only for distances below a few centimeters. Motivated by
   these results, the achievable link throughput of a simple binary digital
   modulation scheme based on the transmission of width-adaptive pulses is
   investigated. The results show that, due to the relaxation time of
   molecular absorption noise, additional pauses between pulse
   transmissions are required, but reliable communication is possible even
   for very small SNR values. These results extend the application scope of
   nanonetworks and illustrate that they are not limited to small coverage
   areas but can also be used to carry traffic generated by both low-rate
   transactional and bandwidth-greedy applications at small-to-medium
   distances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an in-depth view of Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz)
   communication, which is envisioned as a key technology to satisfy the
   increasing demand for higher speed wireless communication. THz Band
   communication will alleviate the spectrum scarcity and capacity
   limitations of current wireless systems, and enable new applications
   both in classical networking domains as well as in novel nanoscale
   communication paradigms. In this paper, the device design and
   development challenges for THz Band are surveyed first. The limitations
   and possible solutions for high-speed transceiver architectures are
   highlighted. The challenges for the development of new ultra-broadband
   antennas and very large antenna arrays are explained. When the devices
   are finally developed, then they need to communicate in the THz band.
   There exist many novel communication challenges such as propagation
   modeling, capacity analysis, modulation schemes, and other physical and
   link layer solutions, in the THz band which can be seen as a new
   frontier in the communication research. These challenges are treated in
   depth in this paper explaining the existing plethora of work and what
   still needs to be tackled. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death worldwide and phase
   I clinical trials utilizing cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have shown
   promising outcomes. Notch1 signaling plays a critical role in cardiac
   development and in the survival, cardiogenic lineage commitment, and
   differentiation of cardiac stem/progenitor cells. In this study, we
   functionalized self-assembling peptide (SAP) hydrogels with a peptide
   mimic of the Notch1 ligand Jagged1 (RJ) to evaluate the therapeutic
   benefit of CPC delivery in the hydrogels in a rat model of myocardial
   infarction. The behavior of CPCs cultured in the 3D hydrogels in vitro
   including gene expression, proliferation, and growth factor production
   was evaluated. Interestingly, we observed Notch1 activation to be
   dependent on hydrogel polymer density/stiffness with synergistic
   increase in presence of RJ. Our results show that RJ mediated Notch1
   activation depending on hydrogel concentration differentially regulated
   cardiogenic gene expression, proliferation, and growth factor production
   in CPCs in vitro. In rats subjected to experimental myocardial
   infarction, improvement in acute retention and cardiac function was
   observed following cell therapy in RJ hydrogels compared to unmodified
   or scrambled peptide containing hydrogels. This study demonstrates the
   potential therapeutic benefit of functionalizing SAP hydrogels with RJ
   for CPC based cardiac repair. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The optimal length and format for concept generation is largely unknown.
   One experiment compares a 50-min session to a 2-h session, observing
   that senior undergraduates generate more ideas and a greater variety of

   developed within the first 50 min. A second study finds that more novel
   solutions are generated after an incubation period, although it is at
   the expense of feasibility. Comparing the two studies shows that
   incubation generates a greater quantity of ideas, while extended time
   aids in high quality and novelty. Since the 50-min and 2-h groups
   generate similar numbers of high quality and high novelty solutions, a
   50-min ideation period is effective for developing high quality, novel

Abstract = {{Turbulent premixed flames exhibit different structural and propagation
   characteristics with increasing upstream turbulence intensity starting
   from thin wrinkled flames in the Corrugated Flamelet regimes to a flame
   with a thicker preheat zone in the Thin Reaction Zone Regime (TRZ) and
   finally, becoming more disorganized or broken in the Distributed or
   Broken Reaction Zone (D/BRZ) regimes under intense turbulence. A single
   comprehensive predictive model that can span all regimes does not
   currently exist, and in this study we explore the ability of the
   stand-alone one-dimensional linear-eddy mixing (LEM) model to simulate
   the flames in all these regimes. Past applications of this 1DLEM model
   have demonstrated reasonable predictions in the flamelet and TRZ regimes
   and here, new experiments in the TRZ regime are specifically addressed
   to evaluate the predictive capability of this model. Additional
   simulations in the D/BRZ regimes (where no data is currently available)
   are performed to determine if the model can be extended to the high
   turbulence regime. Comparison with the data in the TRZ regime shows
   satisfactory agreement. Analysis suggests varying levels of preheat zone
   broadening in all the TRZ and D/BRZ cases. While the average heat
   release distribution for the TRZ cases is nearly identical to the
   laminar unstrained baseline, changes to the species and heat release
   distribution are observed only at a high Karlovitz Number K a > 10(3).
   In the D/BRZ regime it is shown that the transition is related to
   enhanced turbulent diffusion that dominates molecular diffusion effects
   causing deviations from the laminar baseline.}},

   polycrystalline aluminum}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{118-144}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A thermoelastic-viscoplastic constitutive model has been developed to
   model high strain rate deformation in single crystal metals. The
   thermoelastic formulation employs a material Eulerian strain measure,
   which has recently been shown to converge more rapidly than traditional
   Lagrangian strain measures for material undergoing large compression.
   The viscoplastic formulation is based on the physics of dislocation
   glide and generation as well as their interaction. This model has been
   implemented into a one-dimensional, extended finite-difference
   formulation for anisotropic materials and is used to model shock wave
   propagation in aluminum single crystals, polycrystals, and pre-textured
   polycrystals for peak shock pressures ranging from 2 to 110 GPa. The
   model was able to reproduce experimentally measured particle velocity
   profiles from both plate impact and laser shock experiments performed on
   single crystals and polycrystals. Simulations showed that the
   orientation distribution in vapor-deposited polycrystalline samples can
   affect the observed elastic precursor decay by a factor of two, as well
   as change the observed response in laser shock experiments from a dual
   to single-wave shock structure. Simulations performed on cold rolled
   aluminum samples showed that an increase in the cold rolling reduction
   caused a decrease in the number of active slip systems, as well as a
   decrease in the heterogeneity of total accumulated slip. Finally, a
   coarse-grained analytical model was developed from results of plane wave
   simulations and was shown to effectively reproduce plastic heterogeneity
   induced by single crystal orientations. Simulations in this work showed
   that single crystal effects play a key role in dictating the
   macroscopically observed response, which suggests high strain rate
   experiments that omit detailed initial microstructural characterization
   do not provide sufficient information for complete mechanistic
   understanding or model validation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Normal bone mineral is a carbonated-apatite, but there are limited data
   on the effect of mineral containing carbonate on cell response. We
   characterized surface chemical compositions of three experimental
   carbonated hydroxyapatite (CO(3)(2-)HA) substrates and investigated
   their effect on osteoblast differentiation. Carbonate was incorporated
   into the hydroxyapatite powders while phosphate and hydroxyl groups were
   shown to be reduced by analyzing the chemical composition of the
   substrate surfaces. CO(3)(2-)HA powders with increasing carbonate
   concentrations designated as C1 (3.88\%), C2 (4.85\%), and C3 (5.82\%)
   were molded, pressed, and fired into 14 mm discs. We observed that
   calcium phosphate ratios increased monotonically with increasing
   carbonate content, whereas differentiation of MG63 cells decreased.
   CO(3)(2-)HA surfaces also affected factor production. Addition of
   carbonate caused a 70\% reduction in osteoprotegerin (OPG) compared to
   cultures on pure HA, but the effect of carbonate was not dose-dependent.
   Low carbonate content reduced VEGF-A by 80\%, but higher levels of
   carbonate reversed this effect in a concentration dependent manner, with
   the C3 VEFG-A levels approximately twice that of C1 levels. These
   observations collectively indicate that bone cells are sensitive to
   carbonate content in bone mineral and the effects of carbonate
   substitution vary with the outcome being measured. Overall, this study
   provides a preliminary understanding of how carbonate substitution
   within hydroxyapatite modulates cellular behavior. (C) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{Despite the large amount of research that has been performed to quantify
   the high strain rate response of Aluminum, few studies have addressed
   effects of crystal orientation and subsequent crystal-level
   microstructure evolution on its high strain rate response. To study
   orientation effects in single crystal Al, both a constitutive model and
   novel numerical method have been developed. A plane wave formulation is
   developed so that materials undergoing anisotropic viscoplastic
   deformation can be modeled in a thermodynamically consistent framework.
   Then, a recently developed high strain rate viscoplastic model is
   extended to include single crystal effects by incorporating higher order
   crystal-based thermoelasticity, anisotropic plasticity kinetics, and
   distinguishing influences of forest and parallel dislocation densities.
   Steady propagating shock waves are simulated for {[}100], {[}110], and
   {[}111] oriented single crystals and compared to existing experimental
   wave profile and strength measurements. Finally, influences of initial
   orientation and peak pressure ranging from 0 to 30 GPa are quantified.
   Results indicate that orientation plays a significant role in dictating
   the high rate response of both the wave profile and the resultant
   microstructure evolution of Al. The plane wave formulation can be used
   to evaluate microstructure-sensitive constitutive relations in a
   computationally efficient framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Development of a simple analytical model to quantify the PV module cost
   premium associated with module efficiency and cell technology}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{A simple analytical model and corresponding analytical equations were
   developed to rapidly determine the module cost premium associated with
   module efficiency, temperature coefficient (gamma), irradiance weighted
   operating cell temperature (T-iwoct), and balance of system (BOS) cost.
   The model provides guidelines for selecting the most appropriate
   photovoltaic (PV) module for a given application and establishes the
   price of various modules without affecting the LCOE. Analytical
   calculations in this paper were verified with the more elaborate PV
   system analysis program called the System Advisor Model (SAM) from
   National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). For example, it is shown
   that 16\% efficient \$1/W module with area-related BOS cost=\$1/W, total
   BOS cost=\$2/W, gamma= -0.45\%/degrees C, and T-iwoct=47.3 degrees C is
   equivalent to a 20\% \$1.20/W module if BOS, gamma, and T-iwoct remain
   the same. This corresponds to a premium of \$0.20/W due to a higher
   efficiency. If the 20\% efficient module has gamma of -0.40\%/degrees C
   instead of -0.45\%/degrees C, then it will produce more energy, so the
   module cost can be increased to \$1.24/W without altering levelized cost
   of electricity (LCOE). This corresponds to an additional price premium
   of \$0.04/W due to gamma. If T-iwoct is reduced to 42.3 degrees C
   instead of 47.3 degrees C by cooling or changing location, then another
   \$0.06/W premium can be added on the module cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work presents a multiple time scales perturbation analysis for
   analyzing weakly nonlinear wave interactions in multi-degree of freedom
   periodic structures. The perturbation analysis is broadly applicable to
   (discretized) periodic systems in any dimensional space and with a wide
   range of constitutive nonlinearities. Specific emphasis is placed on
   cubic nonlinearity, as dispersion shifts typically arise from the cubic
   components in nonlinear restoring forces. The procedureis first
   presented in general. Then, application to the diatomic chain and
   monoatomic two-dimensional lattice demonstrates, individually, the
   treatment of multiple degree of freedom systems and higher dimensional
   spaces. The dispersion relations are modified by weakly nonlinear wave
   interactions and lead to additional opportunities to control wave
   propagation direction, band gap size, and group velocity. Numerical
   simulations validate the expected dispersion shifts. An
   amplitude-tunable focus device demonstrates the viability of utilizing
   dynamically-introduced dispersion to produce beam steering that may,
   ultimately, lead to a phononic superprism effect as well as
   multiplexing/demultiplexing behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Heart valve disease is an increasing clinical burden for which there is
   no effective treatment outside of prosthetic replacement. Over the last
   20 years, clinicians have increasingly preferred the use of biological
   prosthetics to mechanical valves despite their superior durability
   because of the lifelong anticoagulation therapy that is required.
   Mechanical valve surface engineering has largely focused on being as
   non-thrombogenic as possible, but despite decades of iteration has had
   insufficient impact on the anticoagulation burden. In this study, we
   systematically evaluate the potential for endothelialization of the
   pyrolytic carbon surface used in mechanical valves. We compared adsorbed
   adhesion ligand type (collagen I, fibronectin, laminin, and purified
   adhesion domain fragments GFOGER and FN7-10) and concentration on
   endothelial adhesion rates and adhesion strength on Medtronic-Hall
   prosthetic valve surfaces. Regardless of ligand type or concentration,
   endothelial adhesion strengthening was insufficient for their intended
   ultra-high shear stress environment. We then hypothesized that
   microfabricated trenches would reduce shear stress to tolerable levels
   while maintaining endothelial access to the flow stream, thereby
   promoting a confluent and anticoagulant endothelial monolayer.
   Computational fluid dynamics simulations predicted an empirical
   relationship of channel width, depth, and spacing that would maintain
   interior surface shear stress within tolerable levels. Endothelial cells
   seeded to confluence in these channels retained a confluent monolayer
   when exposed to 600 dyn/cm(2) shear stress for 48 h regardless of
   applied adhesive ligand. Furthermore, sheared EC expressed a mature
   anti-coagulant profile, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase
   (eNOS), VE-cadherin, and significantly downregulated plasminogen
   activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). As a final test, channeled pyrolytic
   carbon surfaces with confluent EC reduced human platelet adhesion
   1000-fold over pyrolytic carbon alone. These results advance a promising
   biohybrid approach to enable active moderation of local coagulative
   response in mechanical heart valves, which could significantly extend
   the utility of this important treatment for heart valve disease. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{97-105}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Investigation of blast loading using mechanical devices is a viable
   alternative to field testing with live explosives. Using impact to
   simulate blast-like loads has been shown to generate repeatable loading
   similar to field testing with live explosives, and impact loading has
   the advantage of high speed camera data that is not obscured by a
   fireball. It is demonstrated that the UCSD Blast Simulator has the
   capability of generating blast-like loading on civil structures by using
   hydraulic rams, in which the loading is tailored in two ways. First, the
   careful regulation of the hydraulic pressures and valve opening/closing
   allows the impact to be adjusted so that the peak loads and duration of
   the load can be controlled. Secondly, the presence of a polyurethane
   material at the front of hydraulic rams determines the shape of the
   loading that is applied to the test specimens. These two key
   characteristics of the Blast Simulator, which govern the pulse duration,
   shape, and impulse associated with impact, are referred to as the punch
   and the programmer. The experimental data processing methodology
   relating to the punch of the hydraulic rams is described, along with a
   brief description of the rubber programmer material. The results of a
   major Blast Simulator test are shown, as well as the description of a
   method for incorporating all relevant aspects of the punch and the
   programmer into a corresponding high fidelity computer simulation.
   Finally, the results of this Blast Simulator test are compared to a
   corresponding field test using live explosives in order to demonstrate
   the capability of the Blast Simulator to generate blast-like loading.

Abstract = {{Purpose: To systematically examine the effect of virtual reality (VR) on
   upper extremity (UE) function in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and
   assess the association among VR effects and children's characteristics
   and an intervention protocol. Method: A systematic literature search was
   conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, and PsycINFO up to June 2013.
   Research studies involving children with CP that used VR as the
   intervention method and UE outcome measures were included. Results: The
   search yielded 14 research articles, including 3 randomized controlled
   trials and 11 case series. Overall, VR provided a strong effect size (d
   = 1.00) when comparing pre- and postintervention. In subgroup analyses,
   younger children receiving home-based or laboratory-based VR and using
   an engineer-built VR system showed better improvement. Conclusions and
   Implications: Virtual reality is a viable tool to improve UE function in
   children with CP. However, a more vigorous research design is needed to
   make a conclusive recommendation.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a novel pre-pyrolysis treatment is developed to restrict
   the morphology collapse in asymmetric carbon molecular sieve (CMS)
   hollow fiber membranes. The technique is referred as V-treatment, due to
   the use of a sol-gel crosslinking reaction between an organic-alkoxy
   silane (vinyltrimethoxysilane) and moisture. The V-treatment technique
   enables restricting the microscale morphology collapse in asymmetric CMS
   membranes without having a chemical reaction with the polymer precursor
   material. The effect of V-treatment is reported on two different
   polyimide precursors: Matrimid (R) and 6FDA:BPDA-DAM. For both the CMS
   V-treated Matrimid (R) and 6FDA:BPDA-DAM hollow fibers, a significant
   reduction up to 5-6-fold in apparent membrane skin thickness is observed
   compared to the CMS from untreated precursors. This improvement
   translates to an increase in gas separation productivities for both pure
   and mixed gas feeds in CMS V-treated Matrimid (R) and 6FDA:BPDA-DAM
   hollow fiber membranes. Moreover, several characterization analyses and
   transport results for V-treatment method using 100\% VTMS are reported
   herein. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{894-904}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This article addresses a new class of picker-to-goods order picking
   systems, in which item retrieval is decoupled from order assembly by a
   pick-to-buffer technology. This decoupling of item retrieval and order
   assembly dramatically changes the dynamics of the pick process. Picking
   to buffers means that the picker is limited by the number of available
   buffers, rather than by the number of items or orders that may be
   transported simultaneously, so that order assembly must be carefully
   synchronized, in real-time, so the picker is not blocked by already
   filled buffers. This synchronization requirement forces consideration of
   the stochastic nature of the picking process in designing such systems,
   in particular, estimating the variance of pick times. This is in sharp
   contrast with traditional picker-to-goods systems, where estimates of
   mean pick times are sufficient for evaluating design performance. In
   this article, models for both expected value and variance of picker
   travel time are proposed and evaluated. The approximate analytic results
   are compared with results from detailed simulation and are sufficiently
   accurate to support design. The real-time synchronization of order
   assembly with picking is a topic of further research.}},

Abstract = {{A new general formulation that is applicable to the damaged, linear
   elastic structures `unified framework' is used to obtain analytical
   expressions for natural frequencies and mode shapes. The term mode
   shapes is used to mean the displacement modes, the section rotation
   modes, the sectional bending strain modes and sectional shear strain
   modes. The formulation is applicable to damaged elastic self-adjoint
   systems. The formulation has two unique aspects: First, the theory is
   mathematically rigorous since no assumptions are made regarding the
   physical behavior at a damage location, therefore there is no need to
   substitute the damage with a hypothetical elastic element such as a
   spring. Since the beam is not divided at the damage location, rather
   than an 8 by 8, only a 4 by 4 matrix is solved to obtain the natural
   frequencies and mode shapes. Second, the inertia effects due to damage
   which have till now been neglected by researchers are accounted for. The
   formulation uses a geometric damage model, perturbation of mode shapes
   and natural frequencies, and a modal superposition technique to obtain
   and solve the governing differential equation. Timoshenko beam theory is
   then taken as an example, and its results are compared with results
   using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and finite element models. The range
   of applicability of the two theories is ascertained for damage
   characteristics such as depth and extent of damage and beam
   characteristics such as slenderness ratio and Poisson's ratio. The paper
   considers rectangular notch like non-propagating damage as an example of
   the damage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Post-combustion carbon dioxide capture from power plant flue gas can
   play an important role in addressing current CO2 emission concerns. Air
   Liquide is developing a sub-ambient membrane process to remove CO2 from
   flue gas by careful process engineering and heat integration. We have
   successfully validated enhanced low temperature membrane performance
   reported by Air Liquide using Matrimid (R) 5218. Asymmetric hollow fiber
   membranes with a CO2/N-2 selectivity of 209 and CO2 permeance of 227 GPU
   at -50 degrees C have been fabricated. The CO2/N-2 mixed gas transport
   properties at -20 degrees C, -30 degrees C, -40 degrees C and -50
   degrees C are measured in an effort to better understand fundamentals of
   the enhanced low temperature performance. The permeance of CO2 is
   minimally affected by temperature while comparatively large increases in
   CO2/N-2 selectivity are observed. The permeance of CO2 increases with
   increasing pressure while minimal changes in CO2/N-2 selectivity are
   observed. High productivity and high selectivity are achievable with
   laboratory spun Matrimid (R) hollow fibers. A hypothesis regarding the
   fiber's fused-nodular skin morphology is proposed and supported by

Abstract = {{A 6FDA based polyamide-imide, 6F-PAI-1, is compared to Pebax (R), a
   commercially available rubbery polyether/polyamicle block copolymer, for
   the simultaneous separation of CO2 and H2S from CH4. Feed streams of
   20/20/60 and 5/45/50H(2)S/CO2/CH4 were used to compare the effect of
   acid gas concentration on the separation efficiency of 6F-PAI-1 and
   Pebae (R) under industrially relevant conditions. 6F-PAI-1 showed
   CO2/CH4 selectivities at 850 psia total feed pressure of 30 and 40 for
   the 20/20/60 and 5/45/50 Iced streams, respectively, while selectivity
   for H2S/CH4 was approximately 20 for both feeds. Pebax showed
   selectivities of 40 and 10 for H2S/CH4 and CO2/CH4, respectively. Both
   selectivities were mostly independent of acid gas concentration in the
   feed, an unsurprising trend considering the non-glassy nature of this
   material. The selectivities in 6F-PAI-1 translated to less than 6\% CH4
   lost in the permeate stream for both feeds, while for the 5/45/50 feed,
   CH4 fraction in the permeate at 850 psia was less than 4\%. These
   promising results suggest that glassy polymers possessing favorable

Abstract = {{The strategic design of a robust supply chain has to determine the
   configuration of the supply chain so that its performance remains of a
   consistently high quality for all possible future conditions. The
   current modeling techniques often only consider either the efficiency or
   the risk of the supply chain. Instead, we define the strategic robust
   supply chain design as the set of all Pareto-optimal configurations
   considering simultaneously the efficiency and the risk, where the risk
   is measured by the standard deviation of the efficiency. We model the
   problem as the Mean-Standard Deviation Robust Design Problem (MSD-RDP).
   Since the standard deviation has a square root expression, which makes
   standard maximization algorithms based on mixed-integer linear
   programming non-applicable, we show the equivalency to the Mean-Variance
   Robust Design Problem (MV-RDP). The MV-RDP yields an infinite number of
   mixedinteger programming problems with quadratic objective (MIQO) when
   considering all possible tradeoff weights. In order to identify all
   Pareto-optimal configurations efficiently, we extend the
   branchand-reduce algorithm by applying optimality cuts and upper bounds
   to eliminate parts of the infeasible region and the non-Pareto-optimal
   region. We show that all Pareto-optimal configurations can be found
   within a prescribed optimality tolerance with a finite number of
   iterations of solving the MIQO. Numerical experience for a metallurgical
   case is reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An inductive boost regulator is presented that can harvest energy over a
   wide input voltage range. The wide input range is enabled by a
   current-based analog oscillator capable of providing very high duty
   cycle. The analog control circuits are designed to operate at
   subthreshold voltage to enable low voltage all electronic autonomous
   startup. A test chip designed in 130-nm CMOS demonstrates energy
   harvesting from as low as 12-mV input while biased by an external 1-V
   battery and autonomous (without using any additional device or battery)
   startup above 305 mV at output. The design typically consumes 3.5-mu A
   standby current, achieves peak efficiency of 82\%, and can regulate
   output from 0.66 to 3.3 V. The booster is coupled with a thermoelectric
   generator and the integrated system delivers output power of 6 mu W at
   similar to 2 degrees C temperature difference to a maximum of 12 mW at
   similar to 50 degrees C temperature difference.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the collective behavior of complex systems from their
   basic components is a difficult yet fundamental problem in science.
   Existing model reduction techniques are either applicable under limited
   circumstances or produce ``black boxes{''} disconnected from the
   microscopic physics. We propose a new approach by translating the model
   reduction problem for an arbitrary statistical model into a geometric
   problem of constructing a low-dimensional, submanifold approximation to
   a high-dimensional manifold. When models are overly complex, we use the
   observation that the model manifold is bounded with a hierarchy of
   widths and propose using the boundaries as submanifold approximations.
   We refer to this approach as the manifold boundary approximation method.
   We apply this method to several models, including a sum of exponentials,
   a dynamical systems model of protein signaling, and a generalized Ising
   model. By focusing on parameters rather than physical degrees of
   freedom, the approach unifies many other model reduction techniques,
   such as singular limits, equilibrium approximations, and the
   renormalization group, while expanding the domain of tractable models.
   The method produces a series of approximations that decrease the
   complexity of the model and reveal how microscopic parameters are
   systematically ``compressed{''} into a few macroscopic degrees of
   freedom, effectively building a bridge between the microscopic and the
   macroscopic descriptions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed an innovative, flexible, organic-inorganic
   hybrid composite nanogenerator, which was used to drive a self-powered
   microwire-based pH sensor. The hybrid composite nanogenerator was
   fabricated using ZnO nanowire and piezoelectric polymer poly(vinylidene
   fluoride), through a simple, inexpensive solution-casting technique. The
   fabricated hybrid composite nanogenerator delivered a maximum
   open-circuit voltage of 6.9 V and a short-circuit current of 0.96 mu A,
   with an output power of 6.624 mu W under uniaxial compression. This
   high-performance, electric poling free composite nanogenerator opens up
   the possibility of industrial-scale fabrication. The hybrid
   nanogenerator demonstrated its ability to drive five green LEDs
   simultaneously, without using an energy-storage device. Additionally, we
   constructed a self-powered pH sensor, using a ZnO microwire powered with
   our hybrid nanogenerator. The output voltage varied according to changes
   in the pH level. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a
   hybrid nanogenerator as a self-powered device that can be extended for
   use as a biosensor for environmental monitoring and/or as a smart,
   wearable, vibration sensor in future applications.}},

Abstract = {{To date, quite a few wearable electronics have entered the market, which
   are changing the life pattern of consumers. However, the limited
   lifetime and energy storage capacity have made rechargeable batteries
   the bottleneck in wearable technology, especially with the increase of
   number of wearable devices and their large distribution. To solve this
   problem, we demonstrate a woven-structured triboelectric nanogenerator
   (W-TENG) using commodity nylon fabric, polyester fabric, and conductive
   silver fiber fabric. With the advantage of being flexible, washable,
   breathable, wearable, and able to be triggered by a freestanding
   triboelectric layer, this W-TENG can move freely without any constraint
   and is suitable for wearable electronics. To demonstrate the potential
   applications of the W-TENG, the W-TENG is integrated into shoes, coats,
   and trousers to harvest different kinds of mechanical energy from human
   motion. This work presents a new approach in applying triboelectric
   nanogenerator to wearable devices.}},

Abstract = {{Motion tracking is a key area of sensor systems for security,
   transportation, and high-tech industry. In this work, a self-powered
   motion tracking system is developed to monitor moving speed, direction,
   acceleration, starting and ending positions, and even the moving path of
   a moving object. Such a system is based on a set of triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs) that are composed of two friction layers with
   opposite triboelectric polarities (Kapton and Aluminum) and operates in
   the sliding mode. Velocities of a moving object are monitored from -0.1
   m s(-1) to +0.1 m s(-1) at a step of 0.01 m s(-1), and accelerations
   from -0.1 m s(-2) to +0.1 m s(-2) at a step of 0.02 m s(-2).
   Furthermore, an 8 x 8 two-dimensional coordinates system with 16 groups
   of TENGs is created, and the moving path of an object is obtained. This
   study opens up a new area of TENGs as active sensors with great
   potential in self-powered systems, positioning detecting, motion
   tracking, environmental and infrastructure monitoring, and security.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates that photochemical doping of CVD-grown graphene
   can be easily achieved using photoacid (PAG) and photobase (PBG)
   generators such as triphenylsulfonium perfluoro-1-butanesufonate
   (TPS-Nf) and 2-nitrobenzyl N-cyclohexylcarbamate (NBC). The TPS-Nf ionic
   onium salt photoacid generator does not noticeably dope or alter the
   electrical properties of graphene when coated onto the graphene surface,
   but is very effective at inducing p-doping of graphene upon exposure of
   the PAG-coated graphene sample. Likewise, the neutral NBC photobase
   generator does not significantly affect the electrical properties of
   graphene when coated, but upon exposure to ultraviolet light produces a
   free amine, which induces n-doping of the graphene. Electrical
   measurements show that the doping concentration can be modulated by
   controlling the deep ultraviolet (DUV) light exposure dose delivered to
   the sample. The interaction between both dopants and graphene is also
   investigated. The photochemical doping process is able to tune the work
   function of the single-layer graphene samples used in this work from 3.4
   eV to 5.3 eV. Finally, a p-n junction is fabricated and analyzed,
   showing that it is possible to control the position of the two current
   minima (two Dirac points) in the ambipolar p-n junction.}},

Abstract = {{Combination of two physical phenomena, capillary pressure gradient and
   wettability gradient, allows a simple two-step fabrication process that
   yields a reliable hydrophobic self-cleaning condenser surface. The
   surface is fabricated with specific microscopic topography and further
   treatment with a chemically inert low-surface-energy material. This
   process does not require growth of nanofeatures (nanotubes) or
   hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterning of the surface. Trapezoidal geometry
   of the microfeatures facilitates droplet transfer from the Wenzel to the
   Cassie state and reduces droplet critical diameter. The geometry of the
   micropatterns enhances local coalescence and directional movement for
   droplets with diameter much smaller than the radial length of the
   micropatterns. The hydrophobic self-cleaning micropattemed condenser
   surface prevents liquid film formation and promotes continuous dropwise
   condensation cycle. Upon dropwise condensation, droplets follow a
   designed wettability gradient created with micropatterns from the most
   hydrophobic to the least hydrophobic end of the surface. The surface has
   higher condensation efficiency, due to its directional self-cleaning
   property, than a plain hydrophobic surface. We explain the self-actuated
   droplet collection mechanism on the condenser surface and demonstrate
   experimentally the creation of an effective wettability gradient over a
   6 mm radial distance. In spite of its fabrication simplicity, the
   fabricated surface demonstrates self-cleaning property, enhanced
   condensation performance, and reliability over time. Our work enables
   creation of a hydrophobic condenser surface with the directional
   self-cleaning property that can be used for collection of biological
   (chemical, environmental) aerosol samples or for condensation
   enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{A series of conjugated polymers were designed and synthesized to extract
   structure property relationships with the goal of yielding
   yellow-to-transmissive switching electrochromes. The polymers are based
   on repeat units of propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) in alternation with
   a variety of arylenes including 1,4-phenylene (ProDOT-Ph), 2,7-fluorene
   (ProDOT-Fl), 2,7-carbazole (ProDOT-Cbz), 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene
   (ProDOT-Ph(MeO)(2)), and 2,7-pyrene (ProDOT-Py). Additionally, a random
   copolymer containing ProDOT and two different arylene units was
   produced: ProDOT-phenylene-ProDOT-dimethoxyphenylene
   (R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)(2)) and two polymers with a ProDOT dimer in
   alternation with pyrene and phenylene composed ProDOT(2)-pyrene
   (ProDOT(2)-Py) and ProDOT(2)-phenylene (ProDOT(2)-Ph), respectively. The
   polymers were synthesized using Suzuki polycondensation. Examinations of
   the optoelectronic properties via UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, differential
   pulse voltammetry, and spectroelectrochemistry show that varying the
   electron richness of the polymer by utilizing more electron rich
   arylenes, dimers of ProDOT, or less electron rich arylenes, the
   oxidation potential could be decreased or increased, respectively,
   ranging from 270 to 650 mV. Through subtle C H ortho interactions from

   L{*} values above 84.0, a{*} values ranging from -11.6 to 24.8, and b{*}
   values greater than 47.6. In the oxidized states, the most transmissive
   forms had L{*} values above 70.0, a{*} values ranging from -2.1 to 2.0,
   and b{*} values ranging from -6.8 to -0.1. These structure property

Abstract = {{Metal-oxide nanostructure-decorated extrinsic semiconductor interfaces
   modified through in situ nitridation greatly expand the range of sensor
   interface response. Select metal-oxide sites, deposited to an n-type
   nanopore-coated microporous interface, direct a dominant
   electron-transduction process for reversible chemical sensing, which
   minimizes chemical-bond formation. The oxides are modified to decrease
   their Lewis acidity through a weak interaction to form metal oxynitride
   sites. Conductometric and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measure-ments
   demonstrate that in situ treatment changes the reversible interaction
   with the analytes NH3 and NO. The sensor range is extended, which
   creates a distinct new family of responses determined by the Lewis
   acidity/basicity of a given analyte relative to that of the
   nanostructures chosen to decorate the interface. The analyte response,
   broadened in a substantial and predictable way by nitridation, is
   explained by the recently developing inverse hard/soft acid/base model
   (IHSAB) of reversible electron transduction.}},

Title = {{The Combined Structural and Kinetic Characterization of a Bacterial
   Nitronate Monooxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Establishes NMO
   Class I and II}},

Abstract = {{Background: The annotation of >4,900 genes for nitronate monooxygenase,
   which detoxifies a deadly toxin, is inaccurate due to the lack of
   functional data. Results: The protein PA4202 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   is characterized structurally and biochemically as the first bacterial
   nitronate monooxygenase. Conclusion: Four conserved motifs are
   identified in PA4202. Significance: New classes of enzymes are
   established based on the functional annotation of PA4202.
   Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO) oxidizes the mitochondrial toxin
   propionate 3-nitronate (P3N) to malonate semialdehyde. The enzyme has
   been previously characterized biochemically in fungi, but no structural
   information is available. Based on amino acid similarity 4,985 genes are
   annotated in the GenBank(TM) as NMO. Of these, 4,424 (i.e. 89\%) are
   bacterial genes, including several Pseudomonads that have been shown to
   use P3N as growth substrate. Here, we have cloned and expressed the gene
   pa4202 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, purified the resulting protein,
   and characterized it. The enzyme is active on P3N and other alkyl
   nitronates, but cannot oxidize nitroalkanes. P3N is the best substrate
   at pH 7.5 and atmospheric oxygen with k(cat)(app)/K-m(app) of 12 x 10(6)
   m(-1) s(-1), k(cat)(app) of 1300 s(-1), and K-m(app) of 110 m. Anerobic
   reduction of the enzyme with P3N yields a flavosemiquinone, which is
   formed within 7.5 ms, consistent with this species being a catalytic
   intermediate. Absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray
   crystallography demonstrate a tightly, non-covalently bound FMN in the
   active site of the enzyme. Thus, PA4202 is the first NMO identified and
   characterized in bacteria. The x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme was
   solved at 1.44 , showing a TIM barrel-fold. Four motifs in common with
   the biochemically characterized NMO from Cyberlindnera saturnus are
   identified in the structure of bacterial NMO, defining Class I NMO,
   which includes bacterial, fungal, and two animal NMOs. Notably, the only
   other NMO from Neurospora crassa for which biochemical evidence is
   available lacks the four motifs, defining Class II NMO.}},

Title = {{Contractile Force Is Enhanced in Aortas from Pendrin Null Mice Due to
   Stimulation of Angiotensin II-Dependent Signaling}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Pendrin is a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger expressed in the apical regions of
   renal intercalated cells. Following pendrin gene ablation, blood
   pressure falls, in part, from reduced renal NaCl absorption. We asked if
   pendrin is expressed in vascular tissue and if the lower blood pressure
   observed in pendrin null mice is accompanied by reduced vascular
   reactivity. Thus, the contractile responses to KCl and phenylephrine
   (PE) were examined in isometrically mounted thoracic aortas from
   wild-type and pendrin null mice. Although pendrin expression was not
   detected in the aorta, pendrin gene ablation changed contractile protein
   abundance and increased the maximal contractile response to PE when
   normalized to cross sectional area (CSA). However, the contractile
   sensitivity to this agent was unchanged. The increase in contractile
   force/cross sectional area observed in pendrin null mice was due to
   reduced cross sectional area of the aorta and not from increased
   contractile force per vessel. The pendrin-dependent increase in maximal
   contractile response was endothelium- and nitric oxide-independent and
   did not occur from changes in Ca2+ sensitivity or chronic changes in
   catecholamine production. However, application of 100 nM angiotensin II
   increased force/CSA more in aortas from pendrin null than from wild type
   mice. Moreover, angiotensin type 1 receptor inhibitor (candesartan)
   treatment in vivo eliminated the pendrin-dependent changes contractile
   protein abundance and changes in the contractile force/cross sectional
   area in response to PE. In conclusion, pendrin gene ablation increases
   aorta contractile force per cross sectional area in response to
   angiotensin II and PE due to stimulation of angiotensin type 1
   receptor-dependent signaling. The angiotensin type 1 receptor-dependent
   increase in vascular reactivity may mitigate the fall in blood pressure
   observed with pendrin gene ablation.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past several decades, many modifications have been proposed in
   SMB chromatography in order to effectively separate a binary mixture.
   However, the separation of a multi-component mixture using SMB is still
   one of the major challenges. Recently, a computational study was
   performed which compared various existing isocratic ternary separation
   operating schemes (including the JO process) in terms of the maximum
   throughput attained, and Generalized Full Cycle strategy was proposed
   based on a systematic design, which was found to have significant
   improvement over existing strategies {[}Agrawal and Kawajiri (2012)].
   Nevertheless, the operating strategies were not experimentally
   validated. In this study, we validate both JO and Generalized Full Cycle
   SMB systems experimentally. A simultaneous optimization and model
   correction scheme has been implemented to arrive at the optimal
   operating condition which satisfies the optimal productivity as well as
   the desired purity and recovery of products experimentally. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Scaling relationships are identified between NMR longitudinal relaxation
   times and clay dispersion quality in polymer paramagnetic clay
   nanocomposites. Derived from a previously published analytical
   relationship developed from a lamella-based model, the scaling
   relationships are based on the enhancement of NMR relaxation rates with
   increasing exfoliation and dispersion homogeneity. The paramagnetic
   contribution to the NMR relaxation rate is inversely proportional to the
   square of the clay interparticle spacing, and directly proportional to
   the square of the clay weight fraction. These scaling relationships
   allow the prediction of relative exfoliation of clay particles for a
   given series of polymer clay nanocomposites. With independent knowledge
   of clay exfoliation in a single sample (e.g., from transmission electron
   microscopy), NMR relaxometry data may be converted into absolute
   measures of exfoliation. These scaling relations are confirmed with
   samples of fully exfoliated poty(vinyl alcohol) montmorillonite
   nanocomposites, and then used to reveal exfoliation and dispersion
   quality in a series of nylon-6-montmorillonite nanocomposites. This
   characterization route is advantageous because NMR relaxometry can more
   rapidly provide clay dispersion information that is averaged over larger
   sample volumes than transmission electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{A kind of switchable and spacing-tunable dual-wavelength thulium-doped
   silica fiber laser based on a nonlinear amplifier loop mirror is
   presented and experimentally demonstrated. By adjusting the polarization
   controllers (PCs), stable dual-wavelength operation is obtained at the 2
   mu m band. The optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) is better than 56
   dB. The wavelength tuning is performed by applying static strain into
   the fiber Bragg grating. A tuning range from 0 to 5.14 nm is achieved
   for the dual-wavelength spacing. By adjusting the PCs properly, the
   fiber laser can also operate in single-wavelength state with the OSNR
   for each wavelength more than 50 dB. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometric differentiation of dissolved

Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A high-recovery technique of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolation -
   reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis (RO/ED) - was used to
   isolate DOM from the North Atlantic Senegal-Mauritanian upwelling area
   surface water (5 m), North Atlantic oxygen minimum water (415 m) and
   deep water (3000 m), North Pacific subtropical gyre surface water (5 m),
   and North Pacific intermediate water (674 m) and deep water (3500 m).
   Samples were characterized by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (ES!
   FTICR-MS). RO/ED isolated DOM samples share a significant number of
   common formulas accounting for 54-79\% of formulas in each sample. Total
   dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO) concentrations in RO/ED isolated DOM were
   specifically measured using a colorimetric method, and were found to
   have higher contribution to DOC than estimated by FTICR-MS data.
   Percentages of TCHO-C in DOC are in the range of 3.7-19.6\% in all
   samples, with the North Pacific deep (3500 m) water having the lowest \%
   and the North Atlantic upwelling core surface water having the highest
   \%. Principal component analysis (PCA) using the relative magnitudes of
   MS peaks facilitated identification of specific peaks that are enriched
   in different samples. Peaks enriched in surface samples have higher H/C
   values than peaks enriched in deep samples, in both the North Atlantic
   DOM and the North Pacific DOM. This enrichment pattern is likely due to
   the selective photo-degradation of aromatic compounds and the
   bio-production of aliphatic and carbohydrate-like compounds in surface
   waters, and the selective bio-degradation of aliphatic and
   carbohydrate-like compounds with increasing depth. In further support of
   a photo-degraded signature for DOM in surface waters, photo-resistant
   and photo-produced molecular formulas were present in the highest
   numbers in the surface North Pacific subtropical gyre DOM. Peaks
   enriched in the North Pacific intermediate and deep DOM have
   significantly higher O/C values than the North Atlantic oxygen minimum
   layer and deep DOM, for both CHO formula compounds and CHON formula
   compounds. This difference in O/C values observed for the deep Pacific
   vs. Atlantic suggests oxidation of DOM, possibly via microbial activity
   during the ageing of DOM or the preferential remineralization of DOM
   from sinking particles at depth in the Pacific. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Atmospheric selenium (Se) in aerosols was investigated using X-ray
   absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF) microscopy. These techniques were used to determine
   the oxidation state and elemental associations of Se in common primary
   emission sources and ambient aerosols collected from the greater Atlanta
   area. In the majority of ambient aerosol and primary emission source
   samples, the spectroscopic patterns as well as the absence of elemental
   correlations suggest Se is in an elemental, organic, or oxide form. XRF
   microscopy revealed numerous Se-rich particles, or hotspots, accounting
   on average for,similar to 16\% of the total Se in ambient aerosols.
   Hotspots contained primarily Se-0/Se(-II). However, larger, bulk
   spectroscopic characterizations revealed Se(IV) as the dominant
   oxidation state in ambient aerosol, followed by Se-0/Se(-II) and Se(VI).
   Se(IV) was the only observed oxidation state in gasoline, diesel, and
   coal fly ash, while biomass burning contained a combination of
   Se-0/Se(-II) and Se(IV). Although the majority of Se in aerosols was in
   the most toxic form, the Se concentration is well below the California
   Environmental Protection Agency chronic exposure limit (similar to 20000
   ng/m(3)).}},

Abstract = {{Many urological studies rely on models of animals, such as rats and
   pigs, but their relation to the human urinary system is poorly
   understood. Here, we elucidate the hydrodynamics of urination across
   five orders of magnitude in body mass. Using high-speed videography and
   flow-rate measurement obtained at Zoo Atlanta, we discover that all
   mammals above 3 kg in weight empty their bladders over nearly constant
   duration of 21 +/- 13 s. This feat is possible, because larger animals
   have longer urethras and thus, higher gravitational force and higher
   flow speed. Smaller mammals are challenged during urination by high
   viscous and capillary forces that limit their urine to single drops. Our
   findings reveal that the urethra is a flow-enhancing device, enabling
   the urinary system to be scaled up by a factor of 3,600 in volume
   without compromising its function. This study may help to diagnose
   urinary problems in animals as well as inspire the design of scalable
   hydrodynamic systems based on those in nature.}},

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{4468-4477}},

Abstract = {{A series of model polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) networks were synthesized
   via end-linking reactions of alpha, omega-allyl PTHF oligomers with a
   stoichiometric tetrafunctional crosslinker. The telechelic PTHF
   oligomers were synthesized by living cationic ring-opening
   polymerization of tetrahydrofuran followed by a termination reaction
   with allyl alcohol. Networks thus prepared have well-controlled
   architecture in terms of the inter-crosslink chain length (M-c) and
   chain length distribution: resulting in unimodal, bimodal and clustered
   structures. Unimodal network was prepared by using polymer chains of
   same molecular weight, bimodal networks were synthesized by using two
   groups of polymer chains with different average molecular weights, and
   the clusters are prepared by incorporating clusters of networks with
   small molecular weight chains in a network matrix made of longer chains.
   Thermal characteristics of these model networks were investigated as a
   function of crosslink density, as well as inhomogeneities of crosslink
   distribution using DSC. We demonstrate that glass transition temperature
   (T-g) and crystallization behavior (melting temperature and
   crystallinity) of the networks are both strongly influenced by crosslink
   density (M-c). By comparing the unimodal, bimodal and clustered networks
   with similar average M-c, the effects of inhomogeneities in the
   crosslink distribution on the thermal properties were also investigated.
   Results show that inhomogeneities have trivial influence on T-g, but
   strongly affects the crystallization behavior. Moreover, the effects of
   the content ratio and length ratio between long and short chains, and
   the effects of cluster size and size distribution on the thermal
   characteristics were also studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{Cutaneous vaccination with microneedle patches offers several advantages
   over more frequently used approaches for vaccine delivery, including
   improved protective immunity. However, the involvement of specific APC
   subsets and their contribution to the induction of immunity following
   cutaneous vaccine delivery is not well understood. A better
   understanding of the functions of individual APC subsets in the skin
   will allow us to target specific skin cell populations in order to
   further enhance vaccine efficacy. Here we use a Langerin-EGFP-DTR
   knock-in mouse model to determine the contribution of langerin(+)
   subsets of skin APCs in the induction of adaptive immune responses
   following cutaneous microneedle delivery of influenza vaccine. Depletion
   of langerin(+) cells prior to vaccination resulted in substantial
   impairment of both Th1 and Th2 responses, and decreased post-challenge
   survival rates, in mice vaccinated cutaneously but not in those
   vaccinated via the intramuscular route or in non-depleted control mice.
   Our results indicate that langerin(+) cells contribute significantly to
   the induction of protective immune responses following cutaneous
   vaccination with a subunit influenza vaccine.}},

   martensitic phase transformation in nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory
   alloys. Three-dimensional phase-field simulations show the nucleation
   and growth of monoclinic B19' multivariants that form a polytwinned
   martensitic microstructure. Parametric studies demonstrate that
   mechanical constraints and crystallographic orientation govern the
   patterning of martensitic twin variants in the formation of
   strain-accommodating microstructures. Pairing of twin variants is
   studied by comparing the phase-field simulation results with the
   crystallographic solutions of compatible twins. The phase-field method
   developed in this work is generally applicable to simulate the dynamic
   microstructure evolution of metals and alloys that produce low-symmetry
   phases through martensitic transformation. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Sparse Recovery of Streaming Signals Using l(1)-Homotopy}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Pages = {{4209-4223}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Most of the existing sparse-recovery methods assume a static system: the
   signal is a finite-length vector for which a fixed set of measurements
   and sparse representation are available and an l(1) problem is solved
   for the reconstruction. However, the same representation and
   reconstruction framework is not readily applicable in a streaming
   system: the signal changes over time, and it is measured and
   reconstructed sequentially over small intervals. This is particularly
   desired when dividing signals into disjoint blocks and processing each
   block separately is infeasible or inefficient. In this paper, we discuss
   two streaming systems and a new homotopy algorithm for quickly solving
   the associated l(1) problems: 1) recovery of smooth, time-varying
   signals for which, instead of using block transforms, we use lapped
   orthogonal transforms for sparse representation and 2) recovery of
   sparse, time-varying signals that follows a linear dynamic model. For
   both systems, we iteratively process measurements over a sliding
   interval and solve a weighted l(1)-norm minimization problem for
   estimating sparse coefficients. Since we estimate overlapping portions
   of the signal while adding and removing measurements, instead of solving
   a new l(1) program as the system changes, we use available signal
   estimates as starting point in a homotopy formulation and update the
   solution in a few simple steps. We demonstrate with numerical
   experiments that our proposed streaming recovery framework provides
   better reconstruction compared to the methods that represent and
   reconstruct signals as independent, disjoint blocks, and that our
   proposed homotopy algorithm updates the solution faster than the current
   state-of-the-art solvers.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology and physical properties of a pentablock copolymer (PBC)
   were investigated as a function of sulfonation or ion-exchange capacity
   (IEC). This material is comprised t-butylstyrene (tBS), hydrogenated
   isoprene (HI), sulfonated polystyrene (sPS), and polystyrene (PS).
   Thermally reversible crosslinks are created with tBS, which is dispersed
   within a rubbery phase of HI, sPS, and PS. A morphology change was
   observed upon sulfonating PBC. This created abrupt material changes such
   as water swelling, proton conductivity, and methanol transport at an IEC
   greater than one. Water, proton, and methanol transport are associated
   with sPS domains. Gas transport occurs mainly through more permeable HI
   and tBS phases that were disrupted with increasing IEC. The permeability
   (P) was modeled using a lamellar morphology. Ion and methanol transport
   occurred via sulfonated domains. Finally, a structure-property and
   transport property correlation of this multi-block PBC ionomer is
   discussed within this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium residues on the surface of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 have been removed
   by adding (NH4)(2)HPO4 dissolved in ethanol. Upon precipitating the
   unmeasurable lithium residue with different amounts of (NH4)(2)HPO4, the
   performance of the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode materials show marked
   changes. Under the optimized condition, the modified materials exhibit
   enhanced cycling performance, although X-ray powder diffraction and
   transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that the
   precipitated Li3PO4 is not coated on the surface of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2.
   The modified material exhibits 66.9\% retention after 100 cycles at 2 C,
   while the pristine material shows only 48.1\% retention. The results
   demonstrate that the removal of lithium residues from the surface of
   LiNiO2-based materials is effective in decreasing side reactions. This
   property will be valuable for increasing the available choices of
   coating methods and materials because the enhancement of the coating
   will be maximized if the lithium residue can be removed after coating.}},

Abstract = {{Novel hierarchical architectures of porous copper (Cu) microspheres
   assembled with nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by
   ingeniously selecting the precursor and complexant through a facile wet

   synergistic effect between the precursor of slightly soluble copper
   hydroxide and the complexants of polyacrylic acid and ethanol amine
   exactly induces the generation of unique porous hierarchical
   architectures. The obtained porous Cu microspheres were applied to
   reduce and degrade different organic dyes with high concentrations
   (4-nitrophenol, methylene blue, and rhodamine B) in the presence of
   NaBH4. Compared with solid Cu particles that have the same size, these
   porous Cu microspheres exhibit more excellent catalytic activity due to
   their hierarchical structures. Moreover, the catalyst with universal
   applicability could be easily separated from the catalytic system and
   sustainedly possess high stability in recycled reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a
   promising cell source for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and
   drug discovery, all of which require enriched cardiomyocytes, ideally
   ones with mature phenotypes. However, current methods are typically
   performed in 2D environments that produce immature cardiomyocytes within
   heterogeneous populations. Here, we generated 3D aggregates of
   cardiomyocytes (cardiospheres) from 2D differentiation cultures of hPSCs
   using microscale technology and rotary orbital suspension culture.
   Nearly 100\% of the cardiospheres showed spontaneous contractility and
   synchronous intracellular calcium transients. Strikingly, from starting
   heterogeneous populations containing similar to 10\%-40\%
   cardiomyocytes, the cell population within the generated cardiospheres
   featured similar to 80\%-100\% cardiomyocytes, corresponding to an
   enrichment factor of up to 7-fold. Furthermore, cardiomyocytes from
   cardiospheres exhibited enhanced structural maturation in comparison
   with those from a parallel 2D culture. Thus, generation of cardiospheres
   represents a simple and robust method for enrichment of cardiomyocytes
   in microtissues that have the potential use in regenerative medicine as
   well as other applications.}},

Title = {{Effect of Crystal Size on Framework Defects and Water Uptake in Fluoride
   Mediated Silicalite-1}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4368-4376}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between framework defects and crystal size in fluoride
   mediated silicalite-1 was investigated through nitrogen physisorption,
   X-ray diffraction, and vapor adsorption of ethanol and water on samples
   with crystal sizes ranging from 0.4 to 30 pm in the b direction of the
   silicalite-1 crystals. X-ray diffraction reveals a shift in the lattice
   system from a predominantly monoclinic phase in smaller crystals to an
   orthorhombic phase in the larger crystals. Si-29 MAS studies reveal
   minimal differences in framework silanol defect concentration. An H-4
   type hysteresis in 77 K N-2 adsorption isotherm and BdB-FHH pore size
   analysis reveal the presence of slit-like pores and a larger average
   pore size as well as a larger volume fraction of ``microfissures{''} in
   the larger crystals. Pure vapor adsorption measurements show more than a
   2-fold increase in water uptake from 0.21 mmol/g to 0.51 mmol/g from the
   smallest to largest samples at 308 K near unit activity, while ethanol
   uptake remains on the order of 2.4 mmol/g for all samples. An increase
   in desorption hysteresis with crystal size and negligible differences in
   isosteric heats of adsorption of water lend support to the presence of
   microfissure defects in the larger samples. IAST predications for binary
   adsorption of ethanol and water in the silicalite-1 samples reveal a
   2-fold ethanol/water selectivity enhancement for dilute (<5 wt \% EtOH)
   solutions when crystal size is reduced. This systematic study of N-2
   physisorption, framework composition, and ethanol/water adsorption
   highlights the critical role that crystal size plays in the adsorption
   process, which can have significant implications for biofuel processes
   that produce dilute aqueous ethanol as a raw product.}},

Abstract = {{Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated on recyclable and
   biodegradable substrates are a step towards the realization of a
   sustainable OLED technology. We report on efficient OLEDs with an
   inverted top-emitting architecture on recyclable cellulose nanocrystal
   (CNC) substrates. The OLEDs have a bottom cathode of Al/LiF deposited on
   a 400 nm thick N, N'-Di-{[}(1-naphthyl)-N,
   N'-diphenyl]-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (alpha-NPD) layer and a top
   anode of Au/MoO3. They achieve a maximum luminance of 74 591 cd/m(2)
   with a current efficacy of 53.7 cd/A at a luminance of 100 cd/m(2) and
   41.7 cd/A at 1000 cd/m(2). It is shown that the alpha-NPD layer on the
   CNC substrate is necessary for achieving high performance OLEDs. The
   electroluminescent spectra of the OLEDs as a function of viewing angle
   are presented and show that the OLED spectra are subject to microcavity
   effects. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Li-oxide garnet-related structures are promising solid-state Li-ion
   electrolytes in Li-ion batteries. However, garnet-type structures are
   susceptible to carbonate and hydroxide formation in environments
   containing gaseous CO2 and H2O. Therefore, in considering garnets for
   Li-ion conducting applications, chemical stability is an important
   issue. We examine the chemical stability of Li7La3Zr2O12, Li7La3Sn2O12,
   and Li7La3Hf2O12 with respect to carbonate and hydroxide formation
   reactions using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. From these
   studies, we rank the chemical stability of Li-oxide garnet-related
   structures against CO2 and H2O. The ranking of these materials by their
   chemical stability with respect to carbonate and hydroxide formation
   changes at higher partial pressures of CO2 and H2O.}},

Abstract = {{A spin-cast method is presented for the formation of phosphonic acid
   functionalized small molecule layers on solution-processed ZnO
   substrates for use as electron collecting interlayers in organic
   photovoltaics. Phosphonic acid interlayers modify the ZnO work function
   and the charge carrier injection barrier at its interface, resulting in
   systematic control of V-OC in inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells.
   Surface modification is shown to moderate the need for UV light-soaking
   of the ZnO contact layers. Lifetime studies (30 days) indicate stable
   and improved OPV performance over the unmodified ZnO contact, which show
   significant increases in charge extraction barriers and series
   resistance. Results suggest that enhanced stability using small molecule
   modifiers is due to partial passivation of the oxide surface to
   molecular oxygen adsorption. Surface passivation while maintaining work
   function control of a selective interlayer can be employed to improve
   net efficiency and lifetime of organic photovoltaic devices. The
   modified cathode work function modulates V-OC via static energetic
   barriers and modulates contact conductivity by creating reversible and
   irreversible S-shape current-voltage characteristics as a result of
   kinetic barriers to charge transport.}},

Abstract = {{Iridium nanoparticles have only been reported with roughly spherical
   shapes and sizes of 1-5 nm, making it impossible to investigate their
   facet-dependent catalytic properties. Here we report for the first time
   a simple method based on seed-mediated growth for the facile synthesis
   of Ir nanocrystals with well-controlled facets. The essence of this
   approach is to coat an ultrathin conformal shell of Ir on a Pd seed with
   a well-defined shape at a relatively high temperature to ensure fast
   surface diffusion. In this way, the facets on the initial Pd seed are
   faithfully replicated in the resultant Pd@Ir core shell nanocrystal.
   With 6 nm Pd cubes and octahedra encased by \{100\} and \{111\} facets,
   respectively, as the seeds, we have successfully generated Pd@Ir cubes
   and octahedra covered by Ir\{100\} and Ir\{111\} facets. The Pd@Ir cubes
   showed higher H-2 selectivity (31.8\% vs 8.9\%) toward the decomposition
   of hydrazine compared with Pd@Ir octahedra with roughly the same size.}},

Abstract = {{Over decades, the theoretical and applied mechanics community has
   developed sophisticated approaches for analysing the behaviour of
   complex engineering systems. Most of these approaches have targeted
   systems in the transportation, materials, defence and energy industries.
   Applying and further developing engineering approaches for
   understanding, predicting and modulating the response of complicated
   biomedical processes not only holds great promise in meeting societal
   needs, but also poses serious challenges. This report, prepared for the
   US National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, aims to
   identify the most pressing challenges in biological sciences and
   medicine that can be tackled within the broad field of mechanics. This
   echoes and complements a number of national and international
   initiatives aiming at fostering interdisciplinary biomedical research.
   This report also comments on cultural/educational challenges.
   Specifically, this report focuses on three major thrusts in which we
   believe mechanics has and will continue to have a substantial impact.
   (i) Rationally engineering injectable nano/microdevices for imaging and
   therapy of disease. Within this context, we discuss nanoparticle carrier
   design, vascular transport and adhesion, endocytosis and tumour growth
   in response to therapy, as well as uncertainty quantification techniques
   to better connect models and experiments. (ii) Design of biomedical
   devices, including point-of-care diagnostic systems, model organ and
   multi-organ microdevices, and pulsatile ventricular assistant devices.
   (iii) Mechanics of cellular processes, including mechanosensing and
   mechanotransduction, improved characterization of cellular constitutive
   behaviour, and microfluidic systems for single-cell studies.}},

   alpha,omega-disulfooligo(ethylene oxide)s, alpha-carboxy- and
   alpha-sulfooligo(ethylene oxide monomethyl ether)s, and
   di{[}alpha-carboxyoligo(ethylene oxide monomethyl ether)] were
   synthesized using reaction of oligo(ethylene oxide diol) (MW 1000) and
   its monomethyl ether (MW 750) with phthalic-, 2-sulfobenzoic anhydride
   and pyromellitic dianhydride. Di- and mono-substituted anionic OlLs were
   prepared by neutralizing these compounds with N-methylimidazole. Aprotic
   anionic OlLs were synthesized by reaction of sodium salts of the
   prepared oligomeric di- and monoacids with 1,3-dimethyl imidazolium
   iodide. Hyperbranched protic and aprotic anionic OILS were prepared in a
   similar manner. The structure, thermal stability and ionic conductivity
   of the synthesized compounds in the range of 20-120 degrees C in
   anhydrous conditions is governed by the molecular architecture of the
   oligomeric chains and the type of the cation/anion moieties. OILS under
   study are amorphous at room temperature but some protic and aprotic
   linear-chain Ms prone to form a low melting temperature crystalline
   phase. The ionic conductivity of the synthesized OILS can be varied in
   broad range reaching 10(-3) S/cm value at temperatures over 100 degrees
   C under anhydrous conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The polymer composites of magnetic nanoparticles can be possibly used in
   a bulk form by preserving all the novel characteristics of magnetic
   nanoparticles such as superparamagnetic behavior. By introducing
   magnetic properties of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into polymer fibers, novel
   magnetic properties combine with the advantages of composite fibers such
   as light-weight and ease-of-use. Using dry-jet-wet fiber spinning
   technology, we have successfully fabricated iron oxide/polyacrylonitrile

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations based on a united atom method are
   employed to study the molecular response of semi-crystalline
   polyethylene structures with unidirectional and bidirectional molecular
   orientation. The initial structures are generated from isothermal
   crystallization at 375 K of pre-oriented melts. Deformation simulations
   are conducted at a constant strain rate of 1.24 nm/ns at both constant
   volume (NVT) and constant lateral stress (NLz sigma(x)sigma T-y)
   conditions. In order to connect characterization results at various
   length scales two-point statistics are introduced to capture the
   morphological changes in semi-crystalline structures during the
   deformation, based on the density and orientational differences of the
   amorphous and crystalline regions. In this new approach, molecular
   conformational changes are well captured in the two-point auto- and
   cross-correlation spectra, to understand the morphological evolution of
   different domains consisting of macromolecular chains on a statistical
   level. The pseudo-laminar semi-crystalline structures are preserved for
   both structures up to a strain level of 0.5, with the rotation and
   orientation of chains in the crystalline region facing towards the
   uniaxial deformation direction. A laminar to fibrillar transition is
   observed for the bidirectional oriented semi-crystalline structure at
   higher strain levels. Recovery tests confirm the stability of the
   laminar and fibrillar structures at certain stages of the deformation.

Abstract = {{The oxide growth on stainless steel (SS) 310S and 316L, used as a
   cathode current collector material of molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC),
   were examined in the mixture of 62 mol\% Li2CO3-38 mol\% K2CO3 at 650
   degrees C by measuring the change in corrosion potential and
   potentiodynamic response of the alloys and also in terms of impedance
   analysis on the alloy vertical bar oxide layer vertical bar electrolyte
   system. The corrosion potential of SS 316L was in an active region for
   12 h-immersion, whereas that of SS 310S drastically increased after 6
   h-immersion due to an active to passive transition. The corrosion rate
   of the two SSs decreased with immersion due to the growth of protective
   oxide. However, the decrease in the corrosion rate of SS 310S is much
   greater than that of SS 316L. The oxide formed on the two SSs was found
   to be duplex layer, composed of inner Cr enriched oxide and outer Fe
   enriched oxide. However, the inner Cr enriched layer of 310S is more
   clearly separated from the outer Fe enriched layer than that of SS 316L
   due primarily to the higher Cr content in SS 310S. The drastic increase
   in the corrosion potential of SS 310S after 6 h-immersion is closely
   associated with the growth of the inner Cr enriched oxide layer. The
   corrosion resistance of SS depends dominantly on the resistance of the
   inner Cr enriched oxide that is determined form the impedance analysis
   on the alloy vertical bar oxide layer vertical bar electrolyte system.
   The higher corrosion resistance of SS 310S compared with SS 316L results
   from the more protective inner Cr enriched oxide layer, as confirmed by
   its higher resistance associated with the higher Cr content in SS 310S.

Abstract = {{Multivariate CUSUM charts formed over spatial clusters have been used
   over the last several years to detect emerging disease clusters in
   spatiotemporal biosurveillance. The control limits for the CUSUM charts
   are typically calibrated by trial-and-error simulation, but this task
   can be time-consuming and challenging when the monitoring area is large.
   This article introduces an analytical method that approximates the
   control limits and average run length when spatial correlation is not
   strong. In addition, the practical range of the scan radius in which the
   approximation method works well is investigated. Also studied is how the
   outbreak radius and spatial correlation impact the scheme's outbreak
   detection performance with respect to two metrics: detection delay and
   identification accuracy. Experimental results show that the
   approximation method performs well, making the design of the
   multivariate CUSUM chart convenient; and higher spatial correlation does
   not always yield faster detection but often facilitates accurate
   identification of outbreak clusters.}},

Abstract = {{In model reference adaptive control (MRAC) the modelling uncertainty is
   often assumed to be parameterised with time-invariant unknown ideal
   parameters. The convergence of parameters of the adaptive element to
   these ideal parameters is beneficial, as it guarantees exponential
   stability, and makes an online learned model of the system available.
   Most MRAC methods, however, require persistent excitation of the states
   to guarantee that the adaptive parameters converge to the ideal values.
   Enforcing PE may be resource intensive and often infeasible in practice.
   This paper presents theoretical analysis and illustrative examples of an
   adaptive control method that leverages the increasing ability to record
   and process data online by using specifically selected and online
   recorded data concurrently with instantaneous data for adaptation. It is
   shown that when the system uncertainty can be modelled as a combination
   of known nonlinear bases, simultaneous exponential tracking and
   parameter error convergence can be guaranteed if the system states are
   exciting over finite intervals such that rich data can be recorded
   online; PE is not required. Furthermore, the rate of convergence is
   directly proportional to the minimum singular value of the matrix
   containing online recorded data. Consequently, an online algorithm to
   record and forget data is presented and its effects on the resulting
   switched closed-loop dynamics are analysed. It is also shown that when
   radial basis function neural networks (NNs) are used as adaptive
   elements, the method guarantees exponential convergence of the NN
   parameters to a compact neighbourhood of their ideal values without
   requiring PE. Flight test results on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial
   vehicle demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.}},

Abstract = {{The consensus problem appears frequently in coordination of multi-agent
   systems in aerospace science and engineering, and involves the agreement
   of networked agents upon certain quantities of interest. In this paper,
   we focus on a new consensus protocol for networked multi-agent systems
   using a resetting control architecture. Specifically, the control
   protocol consists of a delayed feedback, quasi-resetting control law
   such that controller resettings occur when the relative state
   measurements (i.e., distance) between an agent and its neighbouring
   agents approach zero. In contrast to standard impulsive resetting
   controllers, the proposed resetting is uniformly continuous, and hence,
   our approach does not require any well-posedness assumptions imposed by
   impulsive resetting controllers. In addition, using a
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the multi-agent system
   reaches asymptotic state equipartitioning, where the system steady state
   is uniformly distributed over the system initial conditions. Finally, we
   develop transient performance guarantees while accounting for system
   overshoot and excessive control effort.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, anaerobic granular sludge with sulphate-reducing bacteria
   (SRB) was applied to treat Cu (2+)-, -containing wastewater in an
   expanded granular sludge bed reactor. The migration and enrichment of
   copper in anaerobic granular sludge were envaluated. By analysing the
   sludge with X-ray diffraction, copper was determined to be present as
   covellite (CuS) in the sludge. Observations at the microscopic level
   showed that CuS precipitates were absorbed onto granules and gradually
   migrated from the outer to the interior layer of the granule over time
   and finally accumulated in the core of the granular sludge. Because of
   the migration of the CuS precipitates and the protection of the
   extracellular polymeric substances matrix, SRB were able to tolerate
   copper concentrations up to 10mg/L. A copper removal efficiency of about
   96\% was observed at a steady state for 3 months, and copper was
   enriched in the granular sludge.}},

   to analyse the effect of chamber temperature T-1, nozzle temperature T-2
   on deformation of PEEK 3D printing samples. The results prove that the
   warping deformation is minimal with the chamber temperature at 130
   degrees C, the nozzle temperature at 350 degrees C. The PEEK parts were

Title = {{Model-Based Annealing Random Search with Stochastic Averaging}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The model-based methods have recently found widespread applications in
   solving hard nondifferentiable optimization problems. These algorithms
   are population-based and typically require hundreds of candidate
   solutions to be sampled at each iteration. In addition, recent
   convergence analysis of these algorithms also stipulates a sample size
   that increases polynomially with the number of iterations. In this
   article, we aim to improve the efficiency of model-based algorithms by
   reducing the number of candidate solutions generated per iteration. This
   is carried out through embedding a stochastic averaging procedure within
   these methods to make more efficient use of the past sampling
   information. This procedure not only can potentially reduce the number
   of function evaluations needed to obtain high-quality solutions, but
   also makes the underlying algorithms more amenable for parallel
   computation. The detailed implementation of our approach is demonstrated
   through an exemplary algorithm instantiation called Model-based
   Annealing Random Search with Stochastic Averaging (MARS-SA), which
   maintains the per iteration sample size at a small constant value. We
   establish the global convergence property of MARS-SA and provide
   numerical examples to illustrate its performance.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   on magnetite, Fe3O4, which has been recently considered as electrode in
   the emerging field of organic spintronics. Given the nature of the
   potential applications, we evaluated the magnetite room-temperature
   cubic Fd (3) over barm phase in terms of structural, electronic, and
   magnetic properties. We considered GGA (PBE), GGA+ U (PBE + U), and
   range-separated hybrid (HSE06 and HSE(15\%)) functionals. Calculations
   using HSE06 and HSE(15\%) functionals underline the impact that
   inclusion of exact exchange has on the electronic structure. While the
   modulation of the band gap with exact exchange has been seen in numerous
   situations, the dramatic change in the valence band nature and states
   near the Fermi level has major implications for even a qualitative
   interpretation of the DFT results. We find that HSE06 leads to highly
   localized states below the Fermi level while HSE(15\%) and PBE + U
   result in delocalized states around the Fermi level. The significant
   differences in local magnetic moments and atomic charges indicate that
   describing room-temperature bulk materials, surfaces and interfaces may
   require different functionals than their low-temperature counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{For a discrete or a continuous source model, we study the problem of
   secret-key generation with one round of rate-limited public
   communication between two legitimate users. Although we do not provide
   new bounds on the wiretap secret-key (WSK) capacity for the discrete
   source model, we use an alternative achievability scheme that may be
   useful for practical applications. As a side result, we conveniently
   extend known bounds to the case of a continuous source model.
   Specifically, we consider a sequential key-generation strategy, that
   implements a rate-limited reconciliation step to handle reliability,
   followed by a privacy amplification step performed with extractors to
   handle secrecy. We prove that such a sequential strategy achieves the
   best known bounds for the rate-limited WSK capacity (under the
   assumption of degraded sources in the case of two-way communication).
   However, we show that, unlike the case of rate-unlimited public
   communication, achieving the reconciliation capacity in a sequential
   strategy does not necessarily lead to achieving the best known bounds
   for the WSK capacity. Consequently, reliability and secrecy can be
   treated successively but not independently, thereby exhibiting a
   limitation of sequential strategies for ratelimited public
   communication. Nevertheless, we provide scenarios for which reliability
   and secrecy can be treated successively and independently, such as the
   two-way rate-limited SK capacity, the one-way rate-limited WSK capacity
   for degraded binary symmetric sources, and the one-way rate-limited WSK
   capacity for Gaussian degraded sources.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the important advances achieved in the field of adult
   electrocardiography signal processing, the analysis of the non-invasive
   fetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) remains a challenge. Currently no gold
   standard database exists which provides labelled FECG QRS complexes (and
   other morphological parameters), and publications rely either on
   proprietary databases or a very limited set of data recorded from few
   (or more often, just one) individuals. The PhysioNet/Computing in
   Cardiology Challenge 2013 enables to tackle some of these limitations by
   releasing a set of NI-FECG data publicly to the scientific community in
   order to evaluate signal processing techniques for NI-FECG extraction.
   The Challenge aim was to encourage development of accurate algorithms
   for locating QRS complexes and estimating the QT interval in
   non-invasive FECG signals. Using carefully reviewed reference QRS
   annotations and QT intervals as a gold standard, based on simultaneous
   direct FECG when possible, the Challenge was designed to measure and
   compare the performance of participants' algorithms objectively.
   Multiple challenge events were designed to test basic FHR estimation
   accuracy, as well as accuracy in measurement of inter-beat (RR) and QT
   intervals needed as a basis for derivation of other FECG features.
   This editorial reviews the background issues, the design of the
   Challenge, the key achievements, and the follow-up research generated as
   a result of the Challenge, published in the concurrent special issue of
   Physiological Measurement.}},

Title = {{An ECG simulator for generating maternal-foetal activity mixtures on

Abstract = {{Accurate foetal electrocardiogram (FECG) morphology extraction from
   non-invasive sensors remains an open problem. This is partly due to the
   paucity of available public databases. Even when gold standard
   information (i.e derived from the scalp electrode) is present, the
   collection of FECG can be problematic, particularly during stressful or
   clinically important events.
   In order to address this problem we have introduced an FECG simulator
   based on earlier work on foetal and adult ECG modelling. The open source
   foetal ECG synthetic simulator, fecgsyn, is able to generate
   maternal-foetal ECG mixtures with realistic amplitudes, morphology,
   beat-to-beat variability, heart rate changes and noise. Positional
   (rotation and translation-related) movements in the foetal and maternal
   heart due to respiration, foetal activity and uterine contractions were
   also added to the simulator.
   The simulator was used to generate some of the signals that were part of
   the 2013 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge dataset and has
   been posted on Physionet. org (together with scripts to generate
   realistic scenarios) under an open source license. The toolbox enables
   further research in the field and provides part of a standard for
   industry and regulatory testing of rare pathological scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To determine whether dexamethasone (DEX)-induced ocular
   hypertension (OHT) in mice mimics the hallmarks of steroid-induced
   glaucoma (SIG) in humans, including reduced conventional outflow
   facility (C), increased extracellular matrix (ECM), and myofibroblasts
   within the outflow pathway.
   METHODS. Osmotic mini-pumps were implanted subcutaneously into C57BL/6J
   mice for systemic delivery of DEX (3-4 mg/kg/d, n = 31 mice) or vehicle
   (n = 28). IOP was measured weekly by rebound tonometry. After 3 to 4
   weeks, mice were euthanized and eyes enucleated for ex vivo perfusion to
   measure C, for electron microscopy to examine the trabecular meshwork
   (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC), or for immunohistochemistry to examine
   type IV collagen and a-smooth muscle actin. The length of basement
   membrane material (BMM) was measured along the anterior-posterior extent
   of SC by electron microscopy. Ultrastructural changes in BMM of
   DEX-treated mice were compared against archived human SIG specimens.
   RESULTS. Dexamethasone increased IOP by 2.6 +/- 1.6 mm Hg (mean +/- SD)
   over 3 to 4 weeks and decreased C by 52\% +/- 17\% versus controls.
   Intraocular pressure elevation correlated with decreased C.
   Dexamethasone treatment led to increased fibrillar material in the TM,
   plaque-like sheath material surrounding elastic fibers, and
   myofibroblasts along SC outer wall. The length of BMM underlying SC was
   significantly increased in mice with DEX and in humans with SIG, and in
   mice decreased C correlated with increased BMM.
   CONCLUSIONS. Dexamethasone-induced OHT in mice mimics hallmarks of human
   SIG within 4 weeks of DEX treatment. The correlation between reduced C
   and newly formed ECM motivates further study using DEX-treated mice to
   investigate the pathogenesis of conventional outflow obstruction in
   glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a conventional spin-valve configuration combined with
   spin-torque-driven switching is used as an energy efficient interconnect
   structure for all-spin logic. Both Cu and Al interconnect materials are
   analyzed based on physical models for spin injection, spin transport,
   and magnetization dynamics. The results indicate proposed metallic
   interconnects dissipate less energy as compared with all-spin logic
   interconnects based on the nonlocal spin-valve configuration. Compared
   with a similar spin interconnect with an Si channel, the spin currents
   and injection efficiencies are predicted to be higher when a metal like
   Cu or Al is used due to no Schottky barrier at the interface. Because of
   the longer spin relaxation length (SRL) in Al as compared with Cu, the
   delay and energy dissipation are lower when Al is used especially at
   longer lengths where signal loss becomes important. While metallic spin
   interconnects are faster and more energy efficient in short lengths
   because of their smaller resistances and higher spin injection
   efficiencies, they are outperformed by spin interconnects with Si
   channels at long lengths because the SRLs in Si can be as long as many
   micrometers, whereas in metals they are limited to a few hundred

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of a two-layer system consisting
   of a thin liquid film and an overlying gas layer driven by the Marangoni
   instability induced by thermal waves propagating along the solid
   substrate. In the case of a stationary thermal wave with sufficiently
   large amplitude and Marangoni number, liquid film rupture takes place
   with a flattish wide trough. For sufficiently small but not too small
   frequencies of the thermal wave, a periodic structure consisting of
   localized drops interconnected by thin liquid bridges emerges. This
   train of drops travels unidirectionally along the heated substrate
   following the thermal wave. For larger thermal wave frequencies, the
   thickness of the bridges increases enabling fluid flow between the
   neighboring drops. The drop-train regimes may be utilized in
   microfluidic applications for directed transport of liquid content
   enclosed in drops formed by thermocapillary forces. (c) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{An extensive direct numerical simulation database over a wide range of
   Reynolds and Schmidt numbers is used to examine the Schmidt number
   dependence of the structure function of passive scalars and the
   applicability of the so-called Yaglom's relation in isotropic turbulence
   with a uniform mean scalar gradient. For the moderate Reynolds numbers
   available, the limited range of scales in scalar fields of very low
   Schmidt numbers (as low as 1/2048) is seen to lead to weaker
   intermittency, and weaker alignment between velocity gradients and
   principal strain rates. Strong departures from both Obukhov-Corrsin
   scaling for second-order structure functions and Yaglom's relation for
   the mixed velocity-scalar third-order structure function are observed.
   Evaluation of different terms in the scalar structure function budget
   equation assuming statistical stationarity in time shows that, if the
   Schmidt number is very low, at intermediate scales production and
   diffusion terms (instead of advection) aremajor contributors in the
   balance against dissipation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Onset of unsteady flow in wavy walled channels at low Reynolds number}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Using computational modeling, we examine the development of an unsteady
   laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a channel with sinusoidal walls.
   The flow is driven by a constant pressure gradient. The simulations
   reveal two types of unsteady flows occurring in sinusoidal channels.
   When the amplitude of the wavy walls is relatively small, vortices
   forming in the channel furrows are shed downstream. For larger wall wave
   amplitudes, vortices remain inside the furrows and exhibit periodic
   oscillations and topological changes. We present a phase diagram in
   terms of wall amplitude and driving pressure gradient separating
   different flow regimes. Our simulations establish the optimum wall
   amplitude and period leading to an unsteady flow at the minimum pressure
   gradient. The results are important for designing laminar heat/mass
   exchangers utilizing unsteady flows for enhancing transport processes.

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{7000-7019}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A key element of hydrologic routing models is that the discharge-storage
   relationship is assumed to follow a certain mathematical form, usually a
   linear or a power function, with parameters calibrated based on existing
   inflow-outflow data. This assumption simplifies the model calibration
   process but also constrains model operation throughout the flow range,
   potentially introducing biases. We present a new nonlinear hydrologic
   river routing approach where functions are only required to be
   nondecreasing. River reaches are modeled as conceptual reservoir
   cascades, with discharge-storage and loss/gain functions identified by
   the data. A novel parameter estimation approach is developed to identify
   these functions and other model parameters within a dynamical
   optimization framework. It is shown that hydrologic routing functions
   indeed exhibit different mathematical forms at different regions of
   their active range, and that the new approach is reliable, efficient,
   and robust under observational uncertainty. The model is demonstrated in
   lake and river routing applications for the Nile River, and it is also
   applicable for the estimation of nonlinear, nondecreasing functional
   relationships of general dynamic systems in state-space form.}},

Abstract = {{A multilayer background modeling technique is presented for video
   surveillance. Rather than simply classifying all features in a scene as
   either dynamically moving foreground or long-lasting, stationary
   background, a temporal model is used to place each scene object in time
   relative to each other. Foreground objects that become stationary are
   registered as layers on top of the background layer. In this process of
   layer formation, the algorithm deals with ``fake objects{''} created by
   moved background, and noise created by dynamic background and moving
   foreground objects. Objects that leave the scene are removed based on
   the occlusion reasoning among layers. The technique allows us to
   understand and visualize a scene with multiple objects entering,
   leaving, and occluding each other at different points in time. This
   scene understanding leads to a richer representation of temporal scene
   events than traditional foreground/background segmentation. The
   technique builds on a low-cost background modeling technique that makes
   it suitable for embedded, real-time platforms.}},

Abstract = {{As a promising communication paradigm, Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs)
   have paved a road for Secondary Users (SUs) to opportunistically exploit
   unused licensed spectrum without causing unacceptable interference to
   Primary Users (PUs). In this paper, we study the distributed data
   collection problem for asynchronous CRNs, which has not been addressed
   before. We study the Proper Carrier-sensing Range (PCR) for SUs. By
   working with this PCR, an SU can successfully conduct data transmission
   without disturbing the activities of PUs and other SUs. Subsequently,
   based on the PCR, we propose an Asynchronous Distributed Data Collection
   (ADDC) algorithm with fairness consideration for CRNs. ADDC collects a
   snapshot of data to the base station in a distributed manner without the
   time synchronization requirement. The algorithm is scalable and more
   practical compared with centralized and synchronized algorithms. Through
   comprehensive theoretical analysis, we show that ADDC is order-optimal
   in terms of delay and capacity, as long as an SU has a positive
   probability to access the spectrum. Furthermore, we extend ADDC to deal
   with the continuous data collection issue, and analyze the delay and
   capacity performances of ADDC for continuous data collection, which are
   also proven to be order-optimal. Finally, extensive simulation results
   indicate that ADDC can effectively accomplish a data collection task and
   significantly reduce data collection delay.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Comprehensive laboratory experiments on multiport diffusers for dense
   effluents such as brine into stationary receiving waters are reported.
   Tracer concentration fields were mapped in three dimensions by
   laser-induced fluorescence (3DLIF). The effect of port spacing is
   described by s/dF where s is the port spacing, d the nozzle diameter,
   and F the jet densimetric Froude number. For s/dF > similar to 2, the
   jets did not merge, and the results followed expected asymptotic
   solutions for single jets. For s/dF <2 the jets merged, but did not
   follow expected asymptotic line source solutions. As the port spacing
   was reduced, the rise height and other geometrical variables decreased.
   The dilutions also decreased, but much more rapidly than predicted.
   These were caused by Coanda effects and merging. The Coanda effect
   caused an under pressure on the interior jet surfaces which caused them
   to curve more sharply inwards. This shortened their trajectories,
   reducing the external surface area available for entrainment. Jet
   merging restricted entrainment of clear water to the inner surfaces and
   exacerbated the Coanda effect. The implications for numerical modeling
   are discussed. Integral entrainment models that assume unrestricted
   entrainment water, neglect reentrainment, and neglect dynamic
   interaction (Coanda effect) between jets may significantly overestimate
   dilution. Insight into port spacing effects can be obtained from studies
   on positively buoyant jets. To prevent reduction in dilution
   attributable to restricted entrainment, it is recommended to maintain
   adequate port spacing so that s/dF > similar to 2. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the throughput and delay in wireless cognitive
   social networks. Specifically, we consider a common scenario for
   cognitive radio networks (CRNs) where the primary and secondary networks
   operate at the same time and space and share the spectrum. On this
   basis, we integrate a social relationship into the CRN where each source
   node selects its destination upon a rank-based model, which captures the
   social characteristic well. By applying a cellular time-division
   multiple-access scheduling scheme, we first characterize the distinct
   traffic pattern caused by the social relationships between nodes. Then,
   we derive the achievable throughput and delay for both primary and
   secondary networks under the new network setting. In addition, we also
   study the cognitive social networks with infrastructure where l = O-1
   (n) base stations are regularly deployed within the primary network.
   Given a probabilistic routing strategy, throughput of the proposed
   network is recalculated. Particularly, due to the social relationships
   between nodes, we reveal that a larger l is required if we expect a
   significant capacity gain within the primary network compared with
   previous works.}},

Abstract = {{One commonly cited factor that contributes to the recalcitrance of
   biomass is cellulose crystallinity. The present study aims to establish
   the effect of several pretreatment technologies on cellulose
   crystallinity, crystalline allomorph distribution, and cellulose
   ultrastructure. The observed changes in the cellulose ultrastructure of
   poplar were also related to changes in enzymatic hydrolysis, a measure
   of biomass recalcitrance. Hot-water, organo-solv, lime, lime-oxidant,
   dilute acid, and dilute acid-oxidant pretreatments were compared in
   terms of changes in enzymatic sugar release and then changes in
   cellulose ultrastructure measured by 13 C cross polarization magic angle
   spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and wide-angle X-ray diffraction.
   Pretreatment severity and relative chemical depolymerization/
   degradation were assessed through compositional analysis and
   high-performance anionexchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric
   detection. Results showed minimal cellulose ultrastructural changes
   occurred due to lime and limeoxidant pretreatments, which at short
   residence time displayed relatively high enzymatic glucose yield. Hot
   water pretreatment moderately changed cellulose crystallinity and
   crystalline allomorph distribution, yet produced the lowest enzymatic
   glucose yield. Dilute acid and dilute acid-oxidant pretreatments
   resulted in the largest increase in cellulose crystallinity,
   para-crystalline, and cellulose-Ib allomorph content as well as the
   largest increase in cellulose microfibril or crystallite size. Perhaps
   related, compositional analysis and Klason lignin contents for samples
   that underwent dilute acid and dilute acid-oxidant pretreatments
   indicated the most significant polysaccharide depolymerization/
   degradation also ensued. Organo-solv pretreatment generated the highest
   glucose yield, which was accompanied by the most significant increase in
   cellulose microfibril or crystallite size and decrease in relatively
   lignin contents. Hot-water, dilute acid, dilute acid-oxidant, and
   organo-solv pretreatments all showed evidence of cellulose microfibril
   coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{A hollow polymer microneedle array with tips and lumens that mimic
   conventional hypodermic needles, fabricated using UV lithography, and a
   single-step micromolding technique, is presented for drug delivery into
   skin. This 6 x 6 needle array consists of 1-mm tall high-aspect ratio
   hollow microneedles with sharp beveled tips and 150-mu m diameter
   side-opened lumens. A 2-D lithographic mask pattern and the topography
   of the micromold are utilized simultaneously to define the geometry of
   the beveled tip and the position of the lumen. Mechanical insertion and
   fluidic injection characterization of these hypodermic-needle-like (HNL)
   microneedles (MNs) were performed using excised porcine skin as a
   substrate. The required insertion force of an HNL MN is 0.275 N, which
   is comparable with that of a 26-gauge hypodermic needle, 0.284 N. These
   results are an order of magnitude reduction in insertion force over
   pyramidal-tip MNs of comparable diameter previously reported by us. This
   insertion force reduction confirms that the tip geometry is an important
   factor in utilization of MNs in these applications. No needle fracture
   was observed under an optical microscope following the pressing of an
   HNL MN against excised porcine skin with application force of 50 N.
   Preliminary manual injection of dye through an HNL MN from a syringe
   into excised porcine skin verified the injection functionality of HNL
   MNs. {[}2013-0219]}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: The field of polymeric biomaterials has received much
   attention in recent years due to its potential for enhancing the
   biocompatibility of systems and devices applied to drug delivery and
   tissue engineering. Such applications continually push the definition of
   biocompatibility from relatively straightforward issues such as
   cytotoxicity to significantly more complex processes such as reducing
   foreign body responses or even promoting/recapitulating natural body
   functions. Hydrogels and their colloidal analogues, microgels, have been
   and continue to be heavily investigated as viable materials for
   biological applications because they offer numerous, facile avenues in
   tailoring chemical and physical properties to approach biologically
   harmonious integration. Mechanical properties in particular are recently
   coming into focus as an important manner in which biological responses
   can be altered.
   In this Account, we trace how mechanical properties of microgels have
   moved into the spotlight of research efforts with the realization of
   their potential impact in biologically integrative systems. We discuss
   early experiments in our lab and in others focused on synthetic
   modulation of particle structure at a rudimentary level for fundamental
   drug delivery studies. These experiments elucidated that microgel
   mechanics are a consequence of polymer network distribution, which can
   be controlled by chemical composition or particle architecture. The
   degree of deformability designed into the microgel allows for a defined
   response to an imposed external force. We have studied deformation in
   packed colloidal phases and in translocation events through confined
   pores; in all circumstances, microgels exhibit impressive deformability
   in response to their environmental constraints.
   Microgels further translate their mechanical properties when assembled
   in films to the properties of the bulk material. In particular, microgel
   films have been a large focus in our lab as building blocks for
   self-healing materials. We have shown that their ability to heal after
   damage arises from polymer mobility during hydration. Furthermore, we
   have shown film mobility dictates cell adhesion and spreading in a
   manner that is fundamentally different from previous work on
   mechanotransduction. In total, we hope that this Account presents a
   broad introduction to microgel research that intersects polymer
   chemistry, physics, and regenerative medicine. We expect that research
   intersection will continue to expand as we fill the knowledge gaps
   associated with soft materials in biological milieu.}},

Abstract = {{Rare-earth activated upconversion materials are receiving renewed
   attention for their potential applications in bioimaging and solar
   energy conversion. To enhance the upconversion efficiency, surface
   plasmon has been employed but the reported enhancements vary widely and
   the exact enhancement mechanisms are not clearly understood. In this
   study, we synthesized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) coated with
   amphiphilic polymer which makes UCNPs water soluble and negatively
   charged. We then designed and fabricated a silver nanograting on which
   three monolayers of UCNPs were deposited by polyelectrolyte-mediated
   layer-by-layer deposition technique. The final structures exhibited
   surface plasmon resonance at the absorption wavelength of UCNP. The
   green and red photoluminescence intensity of UCNPs on nanograting was up
   to 16 and 39 times higher than the reference sample deposited on flat
   silver film, respectively. A thorough analysis of rate equations showed
   that the enhancement was due entirely to absorption enhancement in the
   strong excitation regime, while the enhancement of both absorption and
   Forster energy transfer contribute in the weak excitation regime. The
   Purcell factor was found to be small and unimportant because the fast
   nonradiative decay dominates the relaxation process. From the
   experimentally observed enhancements, we concluded 3.1 x and 1.7 x
   enhancements for absorption and Forster energy transfer, respectively.
   This study clearly shows the plasmon enhancement mechanism and its
   excitation power dependence. It provides the basis for comparison of the
   enhancements of various plasmonic UCNP systems in the literature. It
   also lays the foundation for rational design of optical plasmonic
   structures for upconversion enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing the coupled metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
   and triboelectric nanogenerator, we demonstrate an external force
   triggered/controlled contact electrification field-effect transistor
   (CE-FET), in which an electrostatic potential across the gate and source
   is created by a vertical contact electrification between the gate
   material and a ``foreign{''} object, and the carrier transport between
   drain and source can be tuned/controlled by the contact induced
   electrostatic potential instead of the traditional gate voltage. With
   the two contacted frictional layers vertically separated by 80 mu m, the
   drain current is decreased from 13.4 to 1.9 mu A in depletion mode and
   increased from 2.4 to 12.1 mu A in enhancement mode at a drain voltage
   of 5 V. Compared with the piezotronic devices that are controlled by the
   strain induced piezoelectric polarization charged at an
   interface/junction, the CE-FET has greatly expanded the sensing range
   and choices of materials in conjunction with semiconductors. The CE-FET
   is likely to have important applications in sensors, human silicon
   technology interfacing, MEMS, nanorobotics, and active flexible
   electronics. Based on the basic principle of the CE-FET, a field of
   tribotronics is proposed for devices fabricated using the electrostatic
   potential created by triboelectrification as a ``gate{''} voltage to
   tune/control charge carrier transport in conventional semiconductor
   devices. By the three-way coupling among triboelectricity,
   semiconductor, and photoexcitation, plenty of potentially important
   research fields are expected to be explored in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 {[}1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3] regulates
   growth zone chondrocytes (GC) via classical steroid hormone
   receptor-mediated gene transcription and by initiating rapid
   membrane-mediated signaling pathways. 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 initiates its
   membrane effects via its specific membrane-associated receptor (Pdia3)
   in caveolae. 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 binding to Pdia3 leads to
   phospholipase-A(2) (PLA(2))-activating protein (PLAA) activation,
   stimulating PLA(2), resulting in prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) release and
   protein kinase C activation. Recently, we reported that 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 rapidly activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
   kinase II (CaMKII) in GC cells. However, the roles of Pdia3, PLAA and
   caveolae in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3-dependent rapid activation of CaMKII
   are not clear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the roles of
   Pdia3, PLAA and caveolae in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 membrane-stimulated
   CaMKII activation. Pre-treating chondrocytes from the growth zone of the
   rat costochondral cartilage with antibodies against PLAA or Pdia3
   blocked activation of CaMKII by 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. PLAA peptide
   rapidly activated CaMKII in GC cells. Caveolae disruption abolished
   CaMKII activation in response to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 or PLAA peptide
   treatment. Immunoprecipitation studies showed increased CaM binding to
   PLAA in response to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3. The results indicated that
   Pdia3, PLAA and caveolae are required for rapid 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3
   membrane-mediated activation of CaMKII. 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 signaling
   via Pdia3 receptor triggered the interaction between PLAA and CaM
   suggesting that CaM may play a major role linking PLAA to CaMKII in
   membrane-mediated actions of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3.}},

Journal = {{CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of new surface modifications that superimpose
   well-defined nanostructures on microrough implants, thereby mimicking
   the hierarchical complexity of native bone, report synergistically
   enhanced osteoblast maturation and local factor production at the
   protein level compared to growth on surfaces that are smooth, nanorough,
   or microrough. Whether the complex micro/nanorough surfaces enhance the
   osteogenic response by triggering similar patterns of integrin receptors
   and their associated signaling pathways as with well-established
   microrough surfaces, is not well understood. Human osteoblasts (hOBs)
   were cultured until confluent for gene expression studies on tissue
   culture polystyrene (TCPS) or on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) disks with
   different surface topographies: smooth, nanorough, microrough, and
   micro/nanorough surfaces. mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related
   markers such as osteocalcin (BGLAP) and bone sialoprotein (BSP), bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), BMP4, noggin (NOG) and gremlin 1 (GREM1)
   were all higher on microrough and micro/nanorough surfaces, with few
   differences between them, compared to smooth and nanorough groups.
   Interestingly, expression of integrins alpha 1 and alpha 2, which
   interact primarily with collagens and laminin and have been commonly
   associated with osteoblast differentiation on microrough Ti and Ti6Al4V,
   were expressed at lower levels on micro/nanorough surfaces compared to
   microrough ones. Conversely, the alpha v subunit, which binds ligands
   such as vitronectin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein among others,
   had higher expression on micro/nanorough surfaces concomitantly with
   regulation of the beta 3 mRNA levels on nanomodified surfaces. These
   results suggest that the maturation of osteoblasts on micro/nanorough
   surfaces may be occurring through different integrin engagement than
   those established for microrough-only surfaces.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{5144-5157}},

Abstract = {{High-pressure biomass gasification is poorly understood at heating rates
   of practical significance. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by
   performing pyrolysis of pine at high temperatures (600-1000 degrees C)
   and high pressures (5-20 bar) in an entrained flow reactor. Heating
   rates of 10(3)-10(4) degrees C/s are achieved with solids residence time
   ranging from 4 to 28 s. The pyrolysis chars, gases, and tars are
   characterized using several techniques: N-2 and CO2 physisorption,
   elemental analyses, SEM, XRD, micro-GC, FTIR-MS, and GCxGC-TOF-MS. The
   evolution of gases at high pressure is studied by pyrolyzing pine in
   PTGA at 800 degrees C between 5 and 30 bar. Pyrolysis pressure,
   temperature, heating rate, and residence time dramatically influence the
   physical and chemical properties of char, mainly through differences in
   the release of volatiles, evolution of char morphology, and
   carbonization of the char skeleton. The surface area and pore properties
   of chars correlate with the development of graphite-like structures in
   the carbon matrix. The gas composition from both the PTGA and PEFR shows
   that CO, CO2, H-2, and CH4 are the major light gases evolved, whereas
   C-2-C-4 hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and benzene are the minor light gas
   species observed. The formation of polynuclear aromatic tars at the
   longest residence times appears to occur via gas phase molecular weight
   growth reactions. The knowledge of char structure evolution developed in
   this paper will help us better understand char gasification kinetics
   which is important for the design of gasifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of flow control comprised of arrays of active (synthetic jets)
   and passive (vanes) control elements, and its effectiveness for
   suppression of total-pressure distortion is investigated experimentally
   in an offset diffuser, in the absence of internal flow separation. The
   experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel inlet model at speeds up to M
   = 0.55 using approach flow conditioning that mimics boundary layer
   ingestion on a Blended-Wing-Body platform. Time-dependent distortion of
   the dynamic total-pressure field at the `engine face' is measured using
   an array of forty total-pressure probes, and the control-induced
   distortion changes are analyzed using triple decomposition and proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD). These data indicate that an array of the
   flow control small-scale synthetic jet vortices merge into two
   large-scale, counter-rotating streamwise vortices that exert significant
   changes in the flow distortion. The two most energetic POD modes appear
   to govern the distortion dynamics in either active or hybrid flow
   control approaches. Finally, it is shown that the present control
   approach is sufficiently robust to reduce distortion with different
   inlet conditions of the baseline flow.}},

Abstract = {{The most significant task in the solar cell industry today is to
   minimize the cost of solar cell development, thereby establishing grid
   parity early. One way to achieve this goal is to reduce the thickness of
   silicon solar cell, which would subsequently result in reduction in raw
   silicon material costs. The most commonly used tabbing process in solar
   cell production today is the heating bar process. This process utilizes
   electric heating bars to heat the ribbons on solar cells. In this study,
   a laser tabbing machine was developed to overcome the problems of
   tabbing process of heating bar technique for a thin crystalline silicon
   solar cell. An electric test and peeling test were executed on soldering
   ribbon on solar cells. The results indicate that the bonding force of
   ribbon does not affect electrical output of the solar cell. The electric
   power of soldered solar cell was decreased around 5\% in output as
   compared to the original unsoldered solar cell. The electric powers of
   the laser soldered module and the heating-bar soldered module were very
   close. The decline in efficiency of both modules was about 1.13\%. As a
   result of this study, it was confirmed that the laser tabbing system
   developed in this research can be applied in module manufacturing
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), based on the well-known
   triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction effect, has been proven
   to be a simple, cost effective approach for self-powered systems to
   convert ambient mechanical energy into electricity. We report a flexible
   and transparent paper-based triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG)
   consisting of an indium tin oxide (ITO) film and a polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) film as the triboelectric surfaces, which not only
   acts as an energy supply but also as a self-powered active sensor. It
   can harvest kinetic energy when the sheets of paper come into contact,
   bend or slide relative to one another by a combination of vertical
   contact-separation mode and lateral sliding mode. In addition, we also
   integrate grating-structured PTENGs into a book as a self-powered
   anti-theft sensor. The mechanical agitation during handling the book
   pages can be effectively converted into an electrical output to either
   drive a commercial electronic device or trigger a warning buzzer.
   Furthermore, different grating-structures on each page produce different
   numbers of output peaks by sliding relative to one another, which can
   accurately act as a page mark and record the number of pages turned.
   This work is a significant step forward in self-powered paper-based
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials have not only enabled unprecedented flexibility in
   producing unconventional optical properties that are not found in
   nature, they have also provided exciting potential to create customized
   nonlinear media with high-order properties correlated to linear
   behaviour. Two particularly compelling directions are active
   metamaterials, whose optical properties can be purposely tailored by
   external stimuli in a reversible manner, and nonlinear metamaterials,
   which enable intensity-dependent frequency conversion of light waves.
   Here, by exploring the interaction of these two directions, we leverage
   the electrical and optical functions simultaneously supported in
   nanostructured metals and demonstrate electrically controlled nonlinear
   optical processes from a metamaterial. Both second harmonic generation
   and optical rectification, enhanced by the resonance behaviour in the
   metamaterial absorber, are modulated externally with applied voltage
   signals. Our results reveal an opportunity to exploit optical
   metamaterials as self-contained, dynamic electro-optic systems with
   intrinsically embedded electrical functions and optical nonlinearities.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two different models of photopolymerization of
   multifunctional monomers are developed. The first is a kinetic model and
   is based on first order nonlinear ordinary differential equations
   describing the rates of photoinitiator, monomer, and live and dead
   radicals of different chain lengths. In the second model, a stochastic
   Monte Carlo approach is used to predict the time evolution of the
   photopolymerization process. In this model the chain affects are
   incorporated both in the propagation and termination rate constants. The
   simulations of these models for the predictions of gelation times are
   compared with the experimental values measured in the absence of oxygen
   in the reaction volume by using passive microrheology technique. The
   nonlinear decrease of gelation time with increasing photoinitator
   concentration and number of acrylate fragments on each monomer is best
   captured with the second model. Furthermore, the second model is
   successfully verified with kinetic data generated from FTIR and DSC
   experiments. (C) 2013 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Abstract = {{This study tests the hypothesis that high-density particle-stabilized
   emulsion droplets (PEDs) can be designed to use gravity to target
   specific locations in the eye via suprachoroidal space injection. PEDs
   contain a core of high-density perfluorodecalin measuring <= 35 mu m in
   diameter surrounded and stabilized by fluorescein-tagged, polystyrene
   nanoparticles that simulate polymeric drug carriers. A hollow
   microneedle infuses PEDs into the suprachoroidal space of rabbit eyes in
   vivo, which are later dissected and imaged to quantify distribution of
   fluorescent nanoparticles within the suprachoroidal space. With cornea
   oriented upward, such that gravity should move PEDs toward the back of
   the eye, up to 50\% of nanoparticles are in the most posterior quadrant
   near the macula immediately after injection and 5 d later. With cornea
   oriented downward, to promote PED movement toward the front of the eye,
   approximately 60\% of injected nanoparticles are targeted to the most
   anterior quadrant of the posterior segment near ciliary body. Injection
   of approximately neutral-density particles of the same size shows
   approximately equal distribution throughout the posterior segment. This
   study demonstrates for the first time that high-density PEDs can be used
   to deliver nanoparticles to specific locations in the back of the eye,

Abstract = {{Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be responsible for the
   long-term growth of a tumor, as well as its metastasis and recurrence
   after conventional therapies. Here, it is demonstrated that the sigma-2
   receptor is overexpressed on the surface of breast CSCs, and thus could
   serve as a biomarker for the purpose of targeting. Breast CSCs are
   targeted with Au nanocages (AuNCs) by functionalizing their surfaces
   with SV119, a synthetic small molecule capable of binding to the sigma-2
   receptor with high specificity. The interiors of the AuNCs could also be
   loaded with an anticancer drug to be selectively delivered to breast
   CSCs and released in a controllable fashion. The results demonstrate
   that the SV119-AuNC conjugate can serve as a new platform to carry out
   photothermal and chemo therapies simultaneously, eradicating breast CSCs
   more effectively through a synergetic effect.}},

Abstract = {{We report novel hierarchical TiO2 nanorod (NR)/porous Co(OH)(2) nanowall
   array electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors fabricated using a
   two-step process that involves hydrothermal and electrodeposition
   techniques. Field-emission scanning electron microscope images reveal a
   bilayer structure consisting of TiO2 NR arrays with porous Co(OH)(2)
   nanowalls. Compared with the bare TiO2 NRs, the hierarchical TiO2
   NRs/Co(OH)(2) electrodes showed improved pseudocapacitive performance in
   a 2-M KOH electrolyte solution, exhibiting an areal specific capacitance
   of 274.3 mF cm(-2) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1). The electrodes
   exhibited good stability, retaining 82.5\% of the initial capacitance
   after 4000 cycles. The good pseudocapacitive performance of the
   hierarchical nanostructures is mainly due to the porous structure, which
   provides fast ion and electron transfer, a large surface area, short ion
   diffusion paths, and a favourable volume change during the cycling
   process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, analysis, and demonstration of an
   ultra-thin wireless local area network (WLAN) RF receiver module with
   chip-last embedded actives and embedded passives in a low-loss organic
   substrate using system-on-package approach. The overall thickness of the
   module, including the embedded dies, is 160 mu m- more than 3x thickness
   reduction compared to current wire-bond and flip-chip packages. The
   receiver module consists of gallium arsenide low-noise amplifier (LNA)
   dies, chip-last embedded in an ultrathin, low-loss organic substrate,
   and connected to a substrate-embedded three-metal-layer band-pass filter
   (BPF) in close proximity. Full-wave electromagnetic simulation was
   performed on a 3-D model of the designed receiver module to obtain its
   two-port scattering parameters (S-parameters) and to study noise
   coupling between the power-supply network and the signal path. The
   receiver module was then fabricated, tested for yield of the BPF,
   assembled and characterized, and the measured results were correlated
   with simulation. The BPF dimensions in the package were 1.5 mm x 2.9 mm
   x 0.15 mm, and its measured pass-band insertion loss was 2.3 dB with
   more than 15 dB return loss. The receiver module (LNA + BPF) dimensions
   were 5.5 mm x 2 mm x 0.16 mm, and it had a measured peak gain of 11 dB
   with more than 30 dB attenuation in the adjacent-band, indicating
   excellent performance in a miniaturized form-factor.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency and time domain models are developed for backplane (BP),
   printed circuit board (PCB), and silicon interposer (SI) links using
   six-port transfer matrices (ABCD matrices) for bumps, vias and
   connectors, and coupled multiconductor transmission lines for traces.
   The six-port transfer matrix approach enables easy computation of the
   transfer function, as well as near-end and far-end crosstalk. The
   intersymbol interference is accounted for by computing the pulse
   response for the worst case bit pattern. Furthermore, the models
   developed here are used to optimize the data-rate and trace width for
   each of the links, so that the aggregate bandwidth obtained per joule of
   energy supplied to the link is maximized. The modeling and optimization
   approach developed here serves as a good platform to compare the air-gap
   interconnects against BP, PCB, and SI interconnects on lossy
   dielectrics. It is shown that air-gap interconnects can provide an
   aggregate bandwidth improvement of 3x-4x for BP links at a comparable
   energy per bit, and a 5x-9x improvement in aggregate bandwidth of PCB
   links at the expense of 20\% higher energy per bit. For SI links,
   air-gap interconnects are shown to provide a 2x-3x improvement in
   aggregate bandwidth and a 1x-1.5x improvement in energy per bit.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In order to incorporate both affective and cognitive factors in the
   decision-making process, a user experience (UX) evaluation function
   based on cumulative prospect theory is proposed for three different
   affective states and two different types of products (affect-rich versus
   affect-poor). In order to tackle multiple parameters involved in the UX
   evaluation function, a hierarchical Bayesian model is proposed with a
   technique called ``Markov chain Monte Carlo.{''} It estimates parameters
   that represent different cognitive tendencies and affective influences
   for customers at the individual and group levels by generating posterior
   probability density functions of the parameters to incorporate inherent
   uncertainty. An experiment with four hypotheses was designed to test the
   proposed model. We found that: 1) anxious participants tend to be more
   risk-averse than those in joy and excitement; 2) joyful and excited
   participants tend to be more risk-seeking than those in anxiety in
   UX-related choice decision making; 3) all participants tend to be averse
   to unpleasant UX; and 4) participants tend to value by feeling for
   affect-rich products and value by calculation for affect-poor products.
   Furthermore, the models of five different types can predict choice
   decision making between product profiles with around 80\% accuracy. In
   summary, the results explain affective-cognitive decision-making
   behavior in the complex domain of UX design and, thus, illustrate the
   potential and feasibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for fabricating protein-based capsules

   the use of a simple fluidic device to generate water-in-oil emulsion

   interface to generate a semipermeable surface barrier. The capsules can
   be readily fabricated with uniform and controllable sizes and, more
   importantly, show selective permeability toward molecules with different
   molecular weights: small molecules like fluorescein sodium salt can
   freely diffuse through the surface barrier while macromolecules such as
   proteins can not. The proteins, however, can be released by digesting
   the surface barrier with an enzyme such as pepsin. Taken together, the
   capsules hold great potential for applications in controlled release, in
   particular, for the delivery of protein drugs.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{We estimate flight-level price elasticities using a database of online
   prices and seat map displays. In contrast to market-level and
   route-level elasticities reported in the literature, flight-level
   elasticities can forecast responses in demand due to day-to-day price
   fluctuations. Knowing how elasticities vary by flight and booking
   characteristics and in response to competitors' pricing actions allows
   airlines to design better promotions. It also allows policy makers the
   ability to evaluate the impacts of proposed tax increases or time-of-day
   congestion pricing policies. Our elasticity results show how airlines
   can design optimal promotions by considering not only which departure
   dates should be targeted, but also which days of the week customers
   should be allowed to purchase. Additionally, we show how elasticities
   can be used by carriers to strategically match a subset of their
   competitors' sale fares. Methodologically, we use an approach that
   corrects for price endogeneity; failure to do so results in biased
   estimates and incorrect pricing recommendations. Using an instrumental
   variable approach to address this problem we find a set of valid
   instruments that can be used in future studies of air travel demand. We
   conclude by describing how our approach contributes to the literature,
   by offering an approach to estimate flight-level demand elasticities
   that the research community needs as an input to more advanced
   optimization models that integrate demand forecasting, price
   optimization, and revenue optimization models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A Variable Response Phosphine Sensing Matrix Based on Nanostructure
   Treated p and n-type Porous Silicon Interfaces}},
Journal = {{IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{We study the dynamic interplay as PH3 interacts at room temperature to
   contribute electrons to nanostructure modified p and n-type porous
   silicon (PS) interfaces. A nanopore coated microporous interface is
   treated to form TiO2, SnOx, CuxO, and AuxO (x >> 1) nanostructured
   centers deposited in fractional coverage on the PS interface. Relative
   sensitivities of the surface sites are measured under 2-5 and 10 ppm PH3
   exposure. The interaction with two p-type nanostructure decorated
   boron-doped interfaces demonstrates enhancement of sensitivity relative
   to undecorated PS. The results are explained using the inverse hard/soft
   acid/base (IHSAB) principle, combining the tenants of acid/base
   chemistry and semiconductor physics. Analyte coupling to the majority
   charge carriers of the extrinsic semiconductor determines the nature of
   directed electron transduction as it induces a change in conductance. As
   applied, the nanostructured metal oxides serve as gateways, forcing a
   dominant electron transduction (versus chemisorption) at the decorated
   extrinsic semiconductor interface. A study of gold clustered oxide
   depositions on p-type (1-3 Omega-cm) PS demonstrates that an optimal
   fractional deposition can be attained and should not be exceeded to
   avoid crosstalk between the deposited nanoparticles. It appears that
   phosphine can be converted on interaction with phosphorous doped n-type
   PS. A reversal of the response signal observed with increased PH3
   concentration, considered within the IHSAB model, suggests that the
   conductance might be associated with the formation of the electron
   withdrawing PH2 radical.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows that electromagnetic (EM) information leakage from
   modern laptops and desktops (with no peripherals attached) is indeed
   possible and is relatively easy to achieve. The experiments are
   performed on three laptop systems and one desktop system with different
   processors (Intel Centrino, Core 2, Core i7, and AMD Turion), and show
   that both active (program deliberately tries to cause emanations at a
   particular frequency) and passive (emanations at different frequencies
   happen as a result of system activity) EM side-channel attacks are
   possible on all the systems we tested. Furthermore, this paper shows
   that EM information leakage can reliably be received at distances that
   vary from tens of centimeters to several meters including the signals
   that have propagated through cubicle or structural walls. Finally, this
   paper shows how activity levels and data values used in accessing
   different parts of the memory subsystem (off-chip memory and each level
   of on-chip caches) affect the transmission distance.}},

Abstract = {{Toeplitz-structured linear systems arise often in practical engineering
   problems. Correspondingly, a number of algorithms have been developed
   that exploit Toeplitz structure to gain computational efficiency when
   solving these systems. Early ``fast{''} algorithms required operations,
   but recent ``superfast{''} algorithms are more efficient. In this work,
   we present a superfast algorithm for Tikhonov regularization of Toeplitz
   systems. Using an ``extension-and-transformation{''} technique, our
   algorithm translates a Tikhonov-regularized Toeplitz system into a type
   of specialized polynomial problem known as tangential interpolation.
   Under this formulation, we can compute the solution in only operations,
   where is the number of regularizers and is on the order of the number of
   parameters defining the system matrix. Our algorithm is further improved
   with displacement structure, which reduces the complexity when solving
   the system for multiple input vectors. We use numerical simulations to
   demonstrate our algorithm's complexity and accuracy.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{In the high cycle fatigue regime, microstructure attributes such as
   grain size, shape, and crystallographic orientation usually affect
   fatigue crack formation and early growth. However, most computational
   strategies and theoretical models for assessing the influence of the
   microstructure on early stages of fatigue crack formation and growth
   rely on simple constitutive models and 2D microstructures, which limit
   their applicability in design of microstructure of engineering
   materials. This work employs finite element simulations that explicitly
   render the 3D microstructure of an Face-centered cubic (FCC) alloy to
   evaluate the change of the driving force for fatigue crack formation and
   early stages of transgranular growth, including consideration of growth
   within individual grains and stress redistribution as the crack extends.
   The methodology is implemented using a crystal plasticity algorithm in
   ABAQUS and used to study the effect of microstructure on early fatigue
   life of a powder processed Ni-base RR1000 superalloy at 650 degrees C
   subjected to constant amplitude loading. The effects of the
   microstructure in extending a fatigue crack over the first few grains

Journal = {{MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1069-1078}},

Abstract = {{A new thermal management solution is proposed to maximize the
   performance of electronics devices with dynamically managed power
   profiles. To mitigate the non-uniformities in chip temperature profiles
   resulting from the dynamic power maps, solid-liquid phase change
   materials (PCMs) with an embedded heat spreader network are
   strategically positioned near localized hotspots, resulting in a large
   increase in the local thermal capacitance in these problematic areas.
   The resulting device, called composite thermal capacitor (CC), can
   theoretically produce an up-to-twenty-fold increase in the time that a
   thermally constrained high heat flux device can operate before a power
   gating or core migration event is required. A prototype CTC that
   monolithically integrates micro heaters, PCMs and a spreader matrix into
   a Si test chip was fabricated and experimentally tested to validate the
   efficacy of the concept and to gain an insight into phase change heat
   transfer in a spatially-confined environment on the microscale. As the
   most significant result, an increase in allowable device operating times
   by over 7 x has been experimentally demonstrated, while operating a
   device at heat fluxes approaching 400 W/cm(2). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a solution methodology based on the stochastic

   general stochastic branch and bound algorithm are proposed and we give
   the specific details pertaining to runway scheduling. We show how the
   algorithm can be terminated early with solutions that are close to
   optimal, and investigate the impact of the uncertainty level. The
   computational experiment indicates that the sequences obtained using the
   stochastic branch and bound algorithm have, on average, 5-7\% shorter
   makespans than sequences obtained using deterministic sequencing models.
   In addition, the proposed algorithm is able to solve instances with 14

Abstract = {{Ultrathin and flexible power sources are essential for the rapid
   development of portable and wearable electronics. The deployment of
   3-dimensional (3-D) nanostructured materials on the current collectors
   has recently emerged as a promising strategy for preparing
   high-performance supercapacitors. Additionally, it is equally important
   to develop an appropriate device packaging technique, so as to maximize
   the improvement of the electrode performance characteristic. Herein, we
   develop a simple and efficient method for fabricating ultrathin and
   flexible supercapacitor electrodes containing a manganese dioxide (MnO2)
   nanostructure deposited onto 3-D nickel nanocone arrays (NCAs). The
   MnO2-NCAs electrode was prepared by an electro-deposition technology,
   which involves the cathode deposition of NCAs on a titanium carrier film
   as the current collector and subsequent anode deposited from the MnO2
   nanostructures as the active material. The electrode can be peeled off
   from the carrier film and thus the resulting freestanding electrode is
   as thin as 3 mu m, and exhibits outstanding mechanical robustness, high
   specific capacitance (632 F g(-1)), enhanced energy density (52.2 W h
   kg(-1)) and excellent cycle performance (95.3\% retention after 20 000
   cycles). We further fabricated ultrathin supercapacitors with a total
   thickness of similar to 27 mu m, which achieved unprecedented features
   including superior energy density by volume (2.7 x 10(-3) W h cm(-3)),
   superior flexibility and reliability. We demonstrated the application of
   the MnO2-NCAs supercapacitor as an ultrathin power source such as
   driving a LED indicator. This technology may find vast applications in
   future wearable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Exposure to traffic pollution has been linked to numerous

   exposures during realistic commutes and acute response exists.
   Objectives: We conducted the Atlanta Commuters Exposures (ACE-1) Study,

   chemically-resolved in-vehicle exposures and corresponding changes in
   acute oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, pulmonary and systemic
   inflammation and autonomic response.
   Methods: We recruited 42 adults (21 with and 21 without asthma) to
   conduct two 2-h scripted highway commutes during morning rush hour in
   the metropolitan Atlanta area. A suite of in-vehicle particulate
   components were measured in the subjects' private vehicles. Biomarker
   measurements were conducted before, during, and immediately after the
   commutes and in 3 hourly intervals after commutes.
   Results: At measurement time points within 3 h after the commute, we
   observed mild to pronounced elevations relative to baseline in exhaled
   nitric oxide, C-reactive-protein, and exhaled malondialdehyde,
   indicative of pulmonary and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress
   initiation, as well as decreases relative to baseline levels in the
   time-domain heart-rate variability parameters, SDNN and rMSSD,
   indicative of autonomic dysfunction. We did not observe any detectable
   changes in lung function measurements (FEV1, PVC), the frequency-domain
   heart-rate variability parameter or other systemic biomarkers of
   vascular injury. Water soluble organic carbon was associated with
   changes in eNO at all post-commute time-points (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Our results point to measureable changes in pulmonary and
   autonomic biomarkers following a scripted 2-h highway commute. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are promising materials for cartilage repair, but the
   properties required for optimal functional outcomes are not yet known.
   In this study, we functionalized four materials that are commonly used
   in cartilage tissue engineering and evaluated them using in vitro
   cultures. Gelatin, hyaluronic acid, polyethylene glycol, and alginate
   were functionalized with methacrylic anhydride to make them
   photocrosslinkable. We found that the responses of encapsulated human
   chondrocytes were highly dependent on hydrogel type. Gelatin hydrogels
   supported cell proliferation and the deposition of a glycosaminoglycan
   rich matrix with significant mechanical functionality. However, cells
   had a dedifferentiated phenotype, with high expression of collagen type
   I. Chondrocytes showed the best redifferentiation in hyaluronic acid
   hydrogels, but the newly formed matrix was highly localized to the
   pericellular regions, and these gels degraded rapidly. Polyethylene
   glycol hydrogels, as a bioinert control, did not promote any strong
   responses. Alginate hydrogels did not support the deposition of new
   matrix, and the stiffness decreased during culture. The markedly
   different response of chondrocytes to these four photocrosslinkable
   hydrogels demonstrates the importance of material properties for
   chondrogenesis and extracellular matrix production, which are critical
   for effective cartilage repair. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to characterize the mechanical properties of aged human
   anterior mitral leaflets (AML) and posterior mitral leaflets (PML). The
   AML and PML samples from explanted human hearts (n = 21, mean age of
   82.62 +/- 8.77-years-old) were subjected to planar biaxial mechanical
   tests. The material stiffness, extensibility, and degree of anisotropy
   of the leaflet samples were quantified. The microstructure of the
   samples was assessed through histology. Both the AML and PML samples
   exhibited a nonlinear and anisotropic behavior with the circumferential
   direction being stiffer than the radial direction. The AML samples were
   significantly stiffer than the PML samples in both directions,
   suggesting that they should be modeled with separate sets of material
   properties in computational studies. Histological analysis indicated the
   changes in the tissue elastic constituents, including the fragmented and
   disorganized elastin network, the presence of fibrosis and
   proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycan infiltration and calcification,
   suggesting possible valvular degenerative characteristics in the aged
   human leaflet samples. Overall, stiffness increased and areal strain
   decreased with calcification severity. In addition, leaflet tissues from
   hypertensive individuals also exhibited a higher stiffness and low areal
   strain than normotensive individuals. There are significant differences
   in the mechanical properties of the two human mitral valve leaflets from
   this advanced age group. The morphologic changes in the tissue
   composition and structure also infer the structural and functional
   difference between aged human valves and those of animals. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Venous thrombi, fibrin- and rbc-rich clots triggered by inflammation and
   blood stasis, underlie devastating, and sometimes fatal, occlusive
   events. During intravascular fibrin deposition, rbc are thought to
   become passively trapped in thrombi and therefore have not been
   considered a modifiable thrombus component. In the present study, we
   determined that activity of the transglutaminase factor XIII (FXIII) is
   critical for rbc retention within clots and directly affects thrombus
   size. Compared with WT mice, mice carrying a homozygous mutation in the
   fibrinogen gamma chain (Fib gamma(390-396A) had a striking 50\%
   reduction in thrombus weight due to reduced rbc content. Fibrinogen from
   mice harboring the Fib gamma(390-396A) mutation exhibited reduced
   binding to FXIII, and plasma from these mice exhibited delayed FXIII
   activation and fibrin crosslinking, indicating these residues mediate
   FXIII binding and activation. FXIII-deficient mice phenocopied mice
   carrying Fib gamma(390-396A) and produced smaller thrombi with fewer rbc
   than WT mice. Importantly, FXIII-deficient human clots also exhibited
   reduced rbc retention. The addition of FXIII to FXIII-deficient clots
   increased rbc retention, while inhibition of FXIII activity in normal
   blood reduced rbc retention and produced smaller clots. These findings
   establish the FXIII-fibrinogen axis as a central determinant in venous
   thrombogenesis and identify FXIII as a potential therapeutic target for
   limiting venous thrombosis.}},

   cilia lining walls of a microfluidic channel for enhancing the

   facilitating nanoparticle transport. We identify optimal operational
   conditions in which the effect of cilia beating on particle deposition
   is maximized. Our simulations also reveal that cilia transition to a
   three-dimensional beating pattern when the actuation force exceeds a
   critical value. This transition is associated with buckling instability
   experienced by elastic cilia. Our findings guide the optimal design of
   ciliated microfluidic systems for uses such as deposition of
   particulates onto sensory surfaces and microfluidic mixing.}},

Abstract = {{Optical switches are among the essential building blocks in optical
   networks due to their unique role in routing data. In this Letter, for
   the first time to our knowledge, we have exploited a high-quality factor

   dielectric breakdown phenomenon to introduce a simple field-programmable
   on/off optical switch. This simple unit can be thought of as a building
   block for more complex optical systems with different functionalities.
   By using this simple unit we have demonstrated an optical
   field-programmable 2 x 2 switch. After the device is programmed by the
   user, no external electrical signal is needed to maintain the state of
   the device. The same approach can readily be adopted to design a

   randomly from the sample. Ninety radiologists each interpreted a unique
   randomly chosen set of 10 radiographic pairs, containing Up to 10\%
   mismatches (ie, error pairs). Radiologists were randomly assigned to
   interpret radiographs with or without photographs. The number of
   mismatches was identified, and interpretation times were recorded.
   Results: Ninety radiologists with 21 +/- 10 (mean +/-
   standard-deviation) years of experience were recruited to participate in
   this observer study. With the introduction of photographs, the
   proportion of errors detected increased from 31\% (9 of 29) to 77\% (23
   of 30; P = .006). The odds ratio for detection of error with photographs
   to detection without photographs was 7.3 (95\% confidence interval:
   2.29-23.18). Observer qualifications, training, or practice in
   cardiothoracic radiology did not influence sensitivity for error
   detection. There is no significant difference in interpretation time for
   studies without photographs and those with photographs (60 +/- 22 vs. 61
   +/- 25 seconds; = .77).
   Conclusions: In this observer study, facial photographs obtained
   simultaneously with portable Chest radiographs increased the
   identification of any wrong-patient errors, without substantial increase
   in interpretation time. This technique offers a potential means to
   increase patient safety through correct patient identification.}},

Abstract = {{Optogenetic inhibition of the electrical activity of neurons enables the
   causal assessment of their contributions to brain functions. Red light
   penetrates deeper into tissue than other visible wavelengths. We present
   a red-shifted cruxhalorhodopsin, Jaws, derived from Haloarcula
   (Halobacterium) salinarum (strain Shark) and engineered to result in red
   light-induced photocurrents three times those of earlier silencers. Jaws
   exhibits robust inhibition of sensory-evoked neural activity in the
   cortex and results in strong light responses when used in retinas of
   retinitis pigmentosa model mice. We also demonstrate that Jaws can
   noninvasively mediate transcranial optical inhibition of neurons deep in
   the brains of awake mice. The noninvasive optogenetic inhibition opened
   up by Jaws enables a variety of important neuroscience experiments and
   offers a powerful general-use chloride pump for basic and applied
   neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{The use of spinal implants for spine fusion has been steadily increasing
   to avoid the risks of complications and donor site morbidity involved
   when using autologous bone. A variety of fusion cages are clinically
   available, with different shapes and chemical compositions. However,
   detailed information about their surface properties and the effects of
   such properties on osteogenesis is lacking in the literature. Here we
   evaluate the role of surface properties for spinal implant applications,
   covering some of the key biological processes that occur around an
   implant and focusing on the role of surface properties, specifically the
   surface structure, on osseointegration, drawing examples from other
   implantology fields when required. Our findings revealed that surface
   properties such as microroughness and nanostructures can directly affect
   early cell behavior and long-term osseointegration. Microroughness has
   been well established in the literature to have a beneficial effect on
   osseointegration of implants. In the case of the role of nanostructures,
   the number of reports is increasing and most studies reveal a positive
   effect from the nanostructures alone and a synergistic effect when
   combined with microrough surfaces. Long-term clinical results are
   nevertheless necessary to establish the full implications of surface
   nanomodifications. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymers are clinically used in numerous biomedical
   applications, and classically show a loss of mechanical properties
   within weeks of implantation. This work demonstrates a new class of
   semi-degradable polymers that show an increase in mechanical properties
   through degradation via a controlled shift in a thermal transition.
   Semi-degradable polymer networks, poly(beta-amino ester)-co-methyl
   methacrylate, were formed from a low glass transition temperature
   crosslinker, poly(beta-amino ester), and high glass transition
   temperature monomer, methyl methacrylate, which degraded in a manner
   dependent upon the crosslinker chemical structure. In vitro and in vivo
   degradation revealed changes in mechanical behavior due to the
   degradation of the crosslinker from the polymer network. This novel
   polymer system demonstrates a strategy to temporally control the
   mechanical behavior of polymers and to enhance the initial performance
   of smart biomedical devices. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{In addition to external forces, collecting lymphatic vessels
   intrinsically contract to transport lymph from the extremities to the
   venous circulation. As a result, the lymphatic endothelium is routinely
   exposed to a wide range of dynamic mechanical forces, primarily fluid
   shear stress and circumferential stress, which have both been shown to
   affect lymphatic pumping activity. Although various ex vivo perfusion
   systems exist to study this innate pumping activity in response to
   mechanical stimuli, none are capable of independently controlling the
   two primary mechanical forces affecting lymphatic contractility:
   transaxial pressure gradient, , which governs fluid shear stress; and
   average transmural pressure, , which governs circumferential stress.
   Hence, the authors describe a novel ex vivo lymphatic perfusion system
   (ELPS) capable of independently controlling these two outputs using a
   linear, explicit model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. The ELPS is
   capable of reproducing arbitrary waveforms within the frequency range
   observed in the lymphatics in vivo, including a time-varying with a
   constant , time-varying and , and a constant with a time-varying . In
   addition, due to its implementation of syringes to actuate the working
   fluid, a post-hoc method of estimating both the flow rate through the
   vessel and fluid wall shear stress over multiple, long (5 s) time
   windows is also described.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we fused six self-assembling amphipathic peptides (SAPs)
   with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from Paenibacillus
   macerans to catalyze 2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G)
   production with cheap substrates, including maltose, maltodextrin, and
   soluble starch as glycosyl donors. The results showed that two fusion
   enzymes, SAP5-CGTase and SAP6-CGTase, increased AA-2G yields to 2.33-
   and 3.36-fold that of wild-type CGTase when soluble starch was used as a
   substrate. The cyclization activities of these enzymes decreased, while
   disproportionation activities increased. Enzymatic characterization of
   the two fusion enzymes was performed, and kinetics analysis of AA-2G
   synthesis confirmed the enhanced soluble starch specificity of
   SAP5-CGTase and SAP6-CGTase compared to that in the wild-type CGTase. As
   revealed by structure modeling of the fusion and wild-type CGTases,
   enhanced substrate-binding capacity may result from the increased number
   of hydrogen bonds present after fusion. This study demonstrates an
   effective protein fusion approach to improving the substrate specificity
   of CGTase for AA-2G synthesis. Fusion enzymes, especially SAP6-CGTase,
   are promising starting points for further development through protein
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major failure modes of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) is
   noncalcific structural deterioration due to fatigue of the tissue
   leaflets; yet, the mechanisms of fatigue are not well understood. BHV
   durability is primarily assessed based on visual inspection of the
   leaflets following accelerated wear testing. In this study, we developed
   a computational framework to simulate BHV leaflet fatigue, which is both
   efficient and quantitative, making it an attractive alternative to
   traditional accelerated wear testing. We utilize a phenomenological soft
   tissue fatigue damage model developed previously to describe the stress
   softening and permanent set of the glutaraldehyde-treated bovine
   pericardium leaflets in BHVs subjected to cyclic loading. A parametric
   study was conducted to determine the effects of altered leaflet and
   stent elastic properties on the fatigue of the leaflets. The simulation
   results show that heterogeneity of the leaflet elastic properties, poor
   leaflet coaptation, and little stent-tip deflection may accelerate
   leaflet fatigue, which agrees with clinical findings. Therefore, the
   developed framework may be an invaluable tool for evaluating leaflet
   durability in new tissue valve designs, including traditional BHVs as
   well as new transcatheter valves.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to understand the influence of notches under
   thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) in a directionally solidified Ni-base
   superalloy. Experiments were performed utilizing linear out-of-phase and
   in-phase TMF loadings on longitudinally oriented smooth and
   cylindrically notched specimens. Several notch severities were
   considered with elastic stress concentrations ranging from 1.3 to 3.0.
   The local response of the notched specimens was determined using the
   finite element method with a transversely isotropic viscoplastic
   constitutive model. Comparing the analysis to experiments, the locations
   observed for crack nucleation in the notch, which are offset from the
   notch root in directionally solidified alloys, are consistent with the
   maximum von Mises stress. Various local and nonlocal methods are
   evaluated to understand the life trends under out-of-phase TMF. The
   results show that a nonlocal invariant area-averaging method is the best
   approach for collapsing the TMF lives of specimens with different notch
   severities.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{Sources and properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were
   investigated based on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected
   in Beijing during a thirteen month campaign. The WSOC to OC ratios
   averaged 45.9\% annually and were substantially higher in summer
   compared with the other seasons. WSOC exhibited strong correlation with
   secondary components such as secondary organic aerosol estimated by the
   elemental carbon (EC)-tracer method and inorganic ions (e.g., sulfate
   and nitrate), whereas the correlation between WSOC and EC was much
   weaker, suggesting that WSOC should be dominated by secondary species.
   Moreover, the trend of the WSOC to EC ratio was found to coincide with
   that of relative humidity during winter, spring and fall. High WSOC/EC
   ratio in February indicates high humidity could enhance the formation
   potential of WSOC in winter. Sources of WSOC were further investigated
   by a receptor model (Positive Matrix Factorization model). The
   apportionment results suggested that biomass burning contributed about
   40\% of WSOC while about 54\% of WSOC was associated with oxalate and
   sulfate, whereas a primary factor was responsible for only 6\% of WSOC
   also demonstrating that primary emissions are not the main source of
   WSOC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intracranial implants elicit neurodegeneration via the foreign body
   response (FBR) that includes BBB leakage, macrophage/microglia
   accumulation, and reactive astrogliosis, in addition to neuronal
   degradation that limit their useful lifespan. Previously, monocyte
   chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1, also CCL2), which plays an important
   role in monocyte recruitment and propagation of inflammation, was shown
   to be critical for various aspects of the FBR in a tissue-specific
   manner. However, participation of MCP-1 in the brain FBR has not been
   evaluated. Here we examined the FBR to intracortical silicon implants in
   MCP-1 KO mice at 1, 2, and 8 weeks after implantation. MCP-1 KO mice had
   a diminished FBR compared to WT mice, characterized by reductions in BBB
   leakage, macrophage/microglia accumulation, and astrogliosis, and an
   increased neuronal density. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of
   MCP-1 in implant-bearing WT mice maintained the increased neuronal
   density. To elucidate the relative contribution of microglia and
   macrophages, bone marrow chimeras were generated between MCP-1 KO and WT
   mice. Increased neuronal density was observed only in MCP-1 knockout
   mice transplanted with MCP-1 knockout marrow, which indicates that
   resident cells in the brain are major contributors. We hypothesized that
   these improvements are the result of a phenotypic switch of the
   macrophages/microglia polarization state, which we confirmed using PCR
   for common activation markers. Our observations suggest that MCP-1
   influences neuronal loss, which is integral to the progression of
   neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease, via BBB
   leakage and macrophage polarization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biomaterials capable of providing localized and sustained presentation
   of bioactive proteins are critical for effective therapeutic growth
   factor delivery. However, current biomaterial delivery vehicles commonly
   suffer from limitations that can result in low retention of growth
   factors at the site of interest or adversely affect growth factor
   bioactivity. Heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is an
   attractive growth factor delivery vehicle due to its ability to
   reversibly bind positively charged proteins, provide sustained delivery,
   and maintain protein bioactivity. This study describes the fabrication
   and characterization of heparin methacrylamide (HMAm) micropartides for
   recombinant growth factor delivery. HMAm microparticles were shown to
   efficiently bind several heparin-binding growth factors (e.g. bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)), including a wide
   range of BMP-2 concentrations that exceeds the maximum binding capacity
   of other common growth factor delivery vehicles, such as gelatin. BMP-2
   bioactivity was assessed on the basis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
   activity induced in skeletal myoblasts (C2C12). Microparticles loaded
   with BMP-2 stimulated comparable C2C12 ALP activity to soluble BMP-2
   treatment, indicating that BMP-2-loaded microparticles retain
   bioactivity and potently elicit a functional cell response. In summary,
   our results suggest that heparin microparticles stably retain large
   amounts of bioactive BMP-2 for prolonged periods of time, and that
   presentation of BMP-2 via heparin microparticles can elicit cell
   responses comparable to soluble BMP-2 treatment. Consequently, heparin
   microparticles present an effective method of delivering and spatially
   retaining growth factors that could be used in a variety of systems to
   enable directed induction of cell fates and tissue regeneration. (C)

Abstract = {{We analyze the tradeoff between efficiency and service quality in tandem
   systems with flexible servers and finite buffers. We reward efficiency
   by assuming that a revenue is earned each time a job is completed, and
   penalize poor service quality by incorporating positive holding costs.
   We study the dynamic assignment of servers to tasks with the objective
   of maximizing the long-run average profit. For systems of arbitrary
   size, structured service rates, and linear or nonlinear holding costs,
   we determine the server assignment policy that maximizes the profit. For
   systems with two stations, two servers with arbitrary service rates, and
   linear holding costs, we show that the optimal server assignment policy
   is of threshold type and determine the value of this threshold as a
   function of the revenue and holding cost. The threshold can be
   interpreted as the best possible buffer size, and hence our results
   prove the equivalence of addressing service quality via a holding cost
   and via limiting the buffer size. Furthermore, we identify the optimal
   buffer size when each buffer space comes at a cost. We provide numerical
   results that suggest that the optimal policy also has a threshold
   structure for nonlinear holding costs. Finally, for larger systems with
   arbitrary service rates, we propose effective server assignment
   heuristics.}},

Title = {{Deterministic and band-limited stochastic energy harvesting from

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{58-65}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Deterministic and band-limited stochastic energy harvesting scenarios
   using a multilayer piezoelectric stack configuration are investigated
   for uniaxial dynamic pressure loading. The motivation for exploring this
   off-resonant energy harvesting problem derives from typical civil
   infrastructure systems subjected to dynamic compressive forces in
   deterministic or stochastic forms due to vehicular or human loads, among
   other examples of compressive loading. Modeling of vibrational energy
   harvesters in the existing literature has been mostly focused on
   deterministic forms of mechanical vibration as in the typical case of
   harmonic excitation, while the efforts on stochastic energy harvesting
   have thus far considered second-order systems such as piezoelectric
   cantilevers. In this paper, we present electromechanical modeling,
   analytical and numerical solutions, and experimental validations of
   piezoelectric energy harvesting from harmonic, periodic, and
   band-limited stochastic excitation of a multilayer piezoelectric stack
   under axial compressive loading in the off-resonant low-frequency range.
   The deterministic problem employs the voltage output-to-pressure input
   frequency response function of the harvester for a given electrical
   load, which is also extended to periodic excitation. The analytical
   stochastic electromechanical solution employs the power spectral density
   of band-limited stochastic excitation to predict the expected value of
   the power output. The first one of the two numerical solution methods
   uses the Fourier series representation of the excitation history to
   solve the resulting ordinary differential equation, while the second
   method employs an Euler-Maruyama scheme to directly solve the governing
   electromechanical stochastic differential equation. The
   electromechanical models are validated through several experiments for a
   multilayer PZT-5H stack under harmonic and band-limited stochastic
   excitations at different pressure levels. The figure of merit is also
   extracted for this particular energy harvesting problem to choose the
   optimal material. Soft piezoelectric ceramics (e.g. PZT-5H and PZT-5A)
   offer larger power output as compared to hard ceramics (e.g. PZT-8), and
   likewise, soft single crystals (e.g. PMN-PT and PMN-PZT) produce larger
   power as compared to their hard counterparts (e.g. PMN-PZT-Mn); and
   furthermore, single crystals (e.g. PMN-PT and PMN-PZT) generate more
   power than standard ceramics (e.g. PZT-5H and PZT-5A) for low-frequency,
   off-resonant excitation of piezoelectric stacks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1470-1475}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a new technique for nonlinear Rayleigh surface
   wave measurements that uses a non-contact, air-coupled ultrasonic
   transducer; this receiver is less dependent on surface conditions than
   laser-based detection, and is much more accurate and efficient than
   detection with a contact wedge transducer. A viable experimental setup
   is presented that enables the robust, non-contact measurement of
   nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves over a range of propagation distances.
   The relative nonlinearity parameter is obtained as the slope of the
   normalized second harmonic amplitudes plotted versus propagation
   distance. This experimental setup is then used to assess the relative
   nonlinearity parameters of two aluminum alloy specimens (Al 2024-T351
   and Al 7075-T651). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique - the average standard deviation of the normalized
   second harmonic amplitudes, measured at locations along the propagation
   path, is below 2\%. Experimental validation is provided by a comparison
   of the ratio of the measured nonlinearity parameters of these specimens
   with ratios from the absolute nonlinearity parameters for the same
   materials measured by capacitive detection of nonlinear longitudinal
   waves. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of max-kernel search arises everywhere: given a query point
   p(q), a set of reference objects S-r and some kernel K, find argmax(pr
   is an element of Sr) K(p(q), p(r)). Max-kernel search is ubiquitous and
   appears in countless domains of science, thanks to the wide
   applicability of kernels. A few domains include image matching,
   information retrieval, bio-informatics, similarity search, and
   collaborative filtering (to name just a few). However, there is no
   generalized technique for efficiently solving max-kernel search. This
   paper presents a single-tree algorithm called single-tree FastMKS which
   returns the max-kernel solution for a single query point in provably
   O(log N) time (where N is the number of reference objects), and also a
   dual-tree algorithm (dual-tree FastMKS) which is useful for max-kernel
   search with many query points. If the set of query points is of size
   O(N), this algorithm returns a solution in provably O(N) time, which is
   significantly better than the O(N-2) linear scan solution; these bounds
   are dependent on the expansion constant of the data. These algorithms
   work for abstract objects, as they do not require explicit
   representation of the points in kernel space. Empirical results for a
   variety of datasets show up to five orders of magnitude speedup in some
   cases. In addition, we present approximate extensions of the FastMKS
   algorithms that can achieve further speedups. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{The complexity of the physiologic and inflammatory response in acute
   critical illness has stymied the accurate diagnosis and development of
   therapies. The Society for Complex Acute Illness was formed a decade ago
   with the goal of leveraging multiple complex systems approaches to
   address this unmet need. Two main paths of development have
   characterized the society's approach: (i) data pattern analysis, either
   defining the diagnostic/prognostic utility of complexity metrics of
   physiologic signals or multivariate analyses of molecular and genetic
   data and (ii) mechanistic mathematical and computational modeling, all
   being performed with an explicit translational goal. Here, we summarize
   the progress to date on each of these approaches, along with pitfalls
   inherent in the use of each approach alone. We suggest that the next
   decade holds the potential to merge these approaches, connecting patient
   diagnosis to treatment via mechanism-based dynamical system modeling and
   feedback control and allowing extrapolation from physiologic signals to
   biomarkers to novel drug candidates. As a predicate example, we focus on
   the role of data-driven and mechanistic models in neuroscience and the
   impact that merging these modeling approaches can have on general
   anesthesia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Methodology for Global Optimization of Computationally Expensive Design
   Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The design of unconventional systems requires early use of high-fidelity
   physics-based tools to search the design space for improved and
   potentially optimum designs. Current methods for incorporating these
   computationally expensive tools into early design for the purpose of
   reducing uncertainty are inadequate due to the limited computational
   resources that are available in early design. Furthermore, the lack of
   finite difference derivatives, unknown design space properties, and the
   possibility of code failures motivates the need for a robust and
   efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm. A novel surrogate
   model-based global optimization algorithm capable of efficiently
   searching challenging design spaces for improved designs is presented.
   The algorithm, called fBcEGO for fully Bayesian constrained EGO,
   constructs a fully Bayesian Gaussian process (GP) model through a set of
   observations and then uses the model to make new observations in
   promising areas where improvements are likely to occur. This model
   remedies the inadequacies of likelihood-based approaches, which may
   provide an incomplete inference of the underlying function when function
   evaluations are expensive and therefore scarce. A challenge in the
   construction of the fully Bayesian GP model is the selection of the
   prior distribution placed on the model hyperparameters. Previous work
   employs static priors, which may not capture a sufficient number of
   interpretations of the data to make any useful inferences about the
   underlying function. An iterative method that dynamically assigns
   hyperparameter priors by exploiting the mechanics of Bayesian
   penalization is presented. fBcEGO is incorporated into a methodology
   that generates relatively few infeasible designs and provides large
   reductions in the objective function values of design problems. This new
   algorithm, upon implementation, was found to solve more nonlinearly
   constrained algebraic test problems to higher accuracies relative to the
   global minimum than other popular surrogate model-based global
   optimization algorithms and obtained the largest reduction in the
   takeoff gross weight objective function for the case study of a notional
   70-passenger regional jet when compared with competing design methods.}},

Abstract = {{A simple yet general method determines the stiffness matrix for parallel
   manipulators with serially connected legs. Link and actuator
   flexibilities for each leg are modeled by flexibility matrices that are
   additive. The effect of passive joints is implicitly included using
   reciprocal screws to yield a leg stiffness matrix that is generally
   singular. Since the legs act in parallel the leg stiffnesses are
   additive and yield the manipulator stiffness. The method is applicable
   to overconstrained, exactly constrained, and underconstrained robots in
   generic or singular configurations. It is illustrated using the Tricept
   robot containing a passive constraint leg and an overconstrained
   translating manipulator. Numerical results are confirmed using
   commercial structural analysis software.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical species composition of a vitiated oxidizer stream can
   significantly affect the combustion processes that occur in many
   propulsion and power generation systems. Experiments were performed to
   investigate the chemical kinetic effects of vitiation on ignition and
   flame propagation of hydrocarbon fuels using propane.
   Atmospheric-pressure flow reactor experiments were performed to
   investigate the effect of NOx on propane ignition delay time at varying
   O-2 levels (14-21 mol\%) and varying equivalence ratios (0.5-1.5) with
   reactor temperatures of 875 K and 917 K. Laminar flame speed
   measurements were obtained using a Bunsen burner facility to investigate
   the effect of CO2 dilution on flame propagation at an inlet temperature
   of 650 K. Experimental and modeling results show that small amounts of
   NO can significantly reduce the ignition delay time of propane in the
   low- and intermediate-temperature regimes. For example, 755 ppmv NOx in
   the vitiated stream reduced the ignition delay time of a stoichiometric
   propane/air mixture by 75\% at 875 K. Chemical kinetic modeling shows
   that H-atom abstraction reaction of the fuel molecule by NO2 plays a
   critical role in promoting ignition in conjunction with reactions
   between NO and less reactive radicals such as HO2 and CH3O2 at low and
   intermediate temperatures. Experimental results show that the presence
   of 10 mol\% CO2 in the vitiated air reduces the peak laminar flame speed
   by up to a factor of two. Chemical kinetic effects of CO2 contribute to
   the reduction in flame speed by suppressing the formation of OH radicals
   in addition to the lower flame temperature caused by dilution. Overall,
   the detailed chemical kinetic mechanism developed in the current work
   predicts the chemical kinetic effects of vitiated species, namely NOx
   and CO2, on propane combustion reasonably well. Moreover, the reaction
   kinetic scheme also predicts the negative temperature coefficient (NTC)
   behavior of propane during low-temperature oxidation. (C) 2014 The

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The combustion of nano-aluminum and water mixtures is studied
   theoretically for a particle size of 80 nm and over a pressure range of
   1-10 MPa. Emphasis is placed on the effects of entrainment and
   agglomeration of particles on the burning rate and its dependence on
   pressure. The flame thickness increases by a factor of similar to 10,
   when particle entrainment is considered. This lowers the conductive heat
   flux at the ignition front, thereby reducing the burning rate. The
   pressure dependence of the burning rate is attributed to the changes in
   the burning time and velocity of particles with pressure. In the
   diffusion limit, the pressure exponent increases from 0 to 0.5, when the
   entrainment index increases from 0 to 1.0. A similar trend is observed
   in the kinetics-controlled regime, although the corresponding value
   exceeds the diffusion counterpart by 0.5. The kinetics-controlled model
   significantly over-predicts the burning rate and its pressure exponent,
   depending on the entrainment index. The present analysis suggests that
   nano-particles formed closely-packed agglomerates of diameter 3-5 mu m,
   which may burn under diffusion-controlled conditions at high pressures.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider multiple manufacturers and a common retailer
   in a supply chain facing uncertain demand. Each manufacturer produces a

   members' equilibrium decisions of prices and quantities under the
   decentralized uncoordinated and centralized integrated settings, and
   derive the closed-form solutions to explore the impact of channel
   structure and parameters on the members' decisions and performance. We
   further study a coordination mechanism for the members' pricing and
   ordering decisions when they operate under a decentralized setting. We
   show that when certain profit allocation conditions are met, the
   decentralized system will achieve the centralized integrated overall
   optimal profit and each chain member will get a better profit than with
   the decentralized uncoordinated system. Using numerical analyses, we
   derive many managerial insights with respect to supply chain system

Volume = {{194}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate trends in noble
   gas (Ar, Kr, Xe) diffusion in the metal-organic frameworks HKUST-1 and
   ZIF-8. Diffusion occurs primarily through inter-cage jump events, with
   much greater diffusion of guest atoms in HKUST-1 compared to ZIF-8 due
   to the larger cage and window sizes in the former. We compare diffusion
   coefficients calculated for both rigid and flexible frameworks. For
   rigid framework simulations, in which the framework atoms were held at
   their crystallographic or geometry optimized coordinates, sometimes
   dramatic differences in guest diffusion were seen depending on the
   initial framework structure or the choice of framework force field
   parameters. When framework flexibility effects were included, argon and
   krypton diffusion increased significantly compared to rigid-framework
   simulations using general force field parameters. Additionally, for
   argon and krypton in ZIF-8, guest diffusion increased with loading,
   demonstrating that guest-guest interactions between cages enhance
   inter-cage diffusion. No inter-cage jump events were seen for xenon
   atoms in ZIF-8 regardless of force field or initial structure, and the
   loading dependence of xenon diffusion in HKUST-1 is different for rigid
   and flexible frameworks. Diffusion of krypton and xenon in HKUST-1
   depends on two competing effects: the steric effect that decreases
   diffusion as loading increases, and the ``small cage effect{''} that
   increases diffusion as loading increases. A detailed analysis of the
   window size in ZIF-8 reveals that the window increases beyond its normal
   size to permit passage of a (nominally) larger krypton atom. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been
   performed to study metal nanoparticles on graphene/Ru(0001).
   Specifically, we examined adsorption and diffusion of monomers, dimers,
   and trimers of Rh and Au on graphene/Ru(0001). These two metal species
   were chosen for their distinct behaviors in cluster formation on the
   graphene/Ru(0001) moire. The fcc region of this surface was predicted to
   be where the nucleation of metal nanoclusters occurs. The diffusion
   mechanisms and energy barriers for metal dimers and trimers were
   calculated. It was shown that the mobility of Rh clusters decreases with
   the increase of cluster size. For Au, however, dimers and trimers
   diffuse faster than monomers on the moire surface. These calculations
   give insights into the nucleation process of metal clusters on the
   graphene moire. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Convection in a layer of fluid with a free surface due to a combination
   of thermocapillary stresses and buoyancy is one of the classic problems
   of fluid mechanics. Although extensively studied, it is still not fully
   understood. In particular, neither the effect of phase change nor the
   thermal boundary conditions at the liquid-vapor interface have been
   properly described. These two intimately related issues have a
   significant impact on the stability of the flow and transitions between
   different convective patterns. The objective of this paper is to develop
   and validate a comprehensive numerical model which properly describes
   both heat transfer and phase change at the liquid-vapor interface, as
   well as the transport of heat and vapor in the gas layer, which is
   ignored by the vast majority of theoretical studies with minimal
   justification. We present a numerical investigation of convection in a
   long cell filled with a volatile fluid and air, and investigate the
   changes in convective patterns due to with changes in the applied
   horizontal temperature gradient. We also explore how variations in the
   wetting properties of the fluid and lateral confinement
   (three-dimensionality) affect the flow. While the numerical results have
   been found to be in general agreement with existing experimental
   observations, we have also discovered an unexpected phenomenon: a region
   of evaporation near the cold wall and a region of condensation near the
   hot wall. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Carbon as catalyst and support for electrochemical energy conversion}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{5-42}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Carbon has unique characteristics that make it an ideal material for use
   in a wide variety of electrochemical applications ranging from metal
   refining to electrocatalysis and fuel cells. In polymer electrolyte fuel
   cells (PEFCs), carbon is used as a gas diffusion layer, electrocatalyst
   support and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. When used
   as electrocatalyst support, amorphous carbonaceous materials suffer from
   enhanced oxidation rates at high potentials over time. This drawback has
   prompted an extensive effort to improve the properties of amorphous
   carbon and to identify alternate carbon-based materials to replace
   carbon blacks. Alternate support materials are classified in carbon
   nanotubes and fibers, mesoporous carbon, multi-layer graphene (undoped
   and doped with metal nanoparticles) and reduced graphene oxide. A
   comparative review of all these supports is provided. Work on
   catalytically active carbon hybrids is focused on the development of
   non-precious metal electrocatalysts that will significantly reduce the
   cost without sacrificing catalytic activity. Of the newer
   electrocatalysts, nitrogen/metal-functionalized carbons and composites
   are emerging as possible contenders for commercial PEFCs. Nitrogen-doped
   carbon hybrids with transition metals and their polymer composites
   exhibit high ORR activity and selectivity and these catalytic properties
   are presented in detail in this review. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a relatively complete analytical model of a knee
   joint interacting with a two-link exoskeleton for investigating the
   effects of different exoskeleton designs on the internal joint
   forces/torque in the knee. The closed kinematic chain formed by the leg
   and exoskeleton has a significant effect on the joint forces/torque in
   the knee. A bio-joint model is used to capture this effect by relaxing a
   commonly made assumption that approximates a knee joint as a perfect
   engineering pin-joint in designing an exoskeleton. Based on the
   knowledge of a knee-joint kinematics, an adaptive knee-joint exoskeleton
   has been designed to eliminate negative effects associated with the
   closed leg-exoskeleton kinematic chain on a human knee. For experimental
   validation, the flexion motion of an artificial human knee is
   investigated comparing the performances of five exoskeleton designs
   against the case with no exoskeleton. Analytical results that estimate
   internal forces/torque using the kinematic and dynamic models (based on
   the properties of a knee joint) agree well with data obtained
   experimentally. This investigation illustrates the applications of the
   analytical model for designing an adaptive exoskeleton that minimizes
   internal joint forces due to a knee-exoskeleton interaction.}},

   Injectable Scaffolds Enhances Stem Cell Recruitment and Skeletal Repair}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a microgel composed of chitosan and inorganic phosphates
   was used to deliver poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLAGA) microspheres
   loaded with sphingolipid growth factor FTY720 to critical size cranial
   defects in Sprague Dawley rats. We show that sustained release of FTY720
   from injected microspheres used alone or in combination with recombinant
   human bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP2) improves defect
   vascularization and bone formation in the presence and absence of rhBMP2
   as evaluated by quantitative microCT and histological measurements.
   Moreover, sustained delivery of FTY720 from PLAGA and local targeting of
   sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors reduces CD45+ inflammatory cell
   infiltration, promotes endogenous recruitment of CD29+CD90+ bone
   progenitor cells and enhances the efficacy of rhBMP2 from chitosan
   microgels. Companion in vitro studies suggest that selective activation
   of sphingosine receptor subtype-3 (S1P(3)) via FTY720 treatment induces
   smad-1 phosphorylation in bone-marrow stromal cells. Additionally,
   FTY720 enhances stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) mediated
   chemotaxis of CD90+CD11B-CD45- bone progenitor cells in vitro after
   stimulation with rhBMP2. We believe that use of such small molecule
   delivery formulations to recruit endogenous bone progenitors may be an
   attractive alternative to exogenous cell-based therapy.}},

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated experimentally by this work that significant startup
   acceleration can be achieved for simulated moving bed (SMB)
   chromatography when the transient operation is optimized. The desorbent
   consumption can be reduced and average product concentrations can be
   increased during the startup period by systematically switching the SMB
   operating conditions during startup. In this work, systematic model
   development and subsequent model-based optimization are used to find
   control policies that are implemented experimentally to realize startup
   acceleration. The SMB model is reliably determined using the recently
   developed prediction-correction method (Bentley, J.; Kawajiri, Y. AIChE
   J. 2013, 59, 736-746), which is used to efficiently optimize the cyclic
   steady state operation. The startup acceleration problem is solved
   approximately following an algorithm proposed by Li et al. (Li, S.;
   Kawajiri, Y.; Raisch, J.; Seidel-Morgenstern, A. J. Chromatogr. A 2011,
   1218, 3876-3889). The trade-off between the startup acceleration and
   product purity is investigated using the SMB model and validated
   experimentally. It is shown that the startup time and desorbent
   consumption during the startup can be reduced significantly by
   systematically switching the operating conditions three times in a case
   study with a linear isotherm system.}},

Abstract = {{Packed bed CO2 adsorption breakthrough experiments using both
   amine-impregnated and amine-grafted silica adsorbent materials in the
   presence of SO2, NO and NO2 impurities are reported. The effects of
   temperature, feed concentration and adsorbent amine loading on the
   dynamic adsorption capacity of the adsorbents are evaluated by
   performing dual component SO2/CO2, NO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 coadsorption
   experiments as well as three component SO2/NO/CO2 adsorption
   experiments. Although SO2 is found to significantly influence the
   dynamic CO2 capacity of aminosilica adsorbents, the obtained results
   confirm the long-term stability of the adsorbents during SO2/CO2
   coadsorption runs when the bed is not allowed to fully saturate with
   SO2. On the other hand, little competitive effect of NO on CO2
   adsorption is observed in any case. This is due to the decreased
   affinity of amine-based adsorbents toward NO as opposed to SO2. The more
   reactive nitrogen oxide, NO2, is shown to have a minimal impact on CO2
   adsorption when it is present at low levels in the simulated flue gas.
   Among the adsorbents investigated, the results demonstrate that
   secondary amine containing adsorbents are more stable to SO and NO
   impurities in CO2 capture processes than those that contain primary
   amine groups.}},

Abstract = {{Fully Constrained Design (FCD) is a new method for discrete sizing
   optimization of steel structures that balances computational efficiency
   with solution quality for application to large-scale problems. The
   proposed method is based on optimality criteria, but does not require
   gradient information and handles discrete variables. Based on
   benchmarking studies, FCD produces superior quality solutions to
   optimality criteria (>4\%), but inferior to heuristic methods (<2\%).
   FCD is approximately 10 x less computationally efficient than optimality
   criteria and 100x more efficient than heuristic methods. We present a
   successful industry application of FCD that yields cost savings of 19\%
   compared to conventional design methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We synthesized a series of hybrid nanomaterials combining organic dyes
   with polyhedral oligomeric silses-quioxanes (POSS) based on three
   different azobenzenes: monoazobenzene (4-phenylazophenol),
   bis-azobenzene (Disperse Yellow 7 and Fast Garnet derivative), and push
   pull azobenzene (Disperse Red 1) via hydrosilylation coupling. The
   azo-functionalized POSS compounds possess high thermal stability, and
   their branched architecture resulted in effective suppression of
   molecular aggregation and allowed for direct imaging of individual
   dye-POSS structures with expected molecular dimensions. Stable, uniform,
   smooth, and ultrathin nanocomposite films with mixed silica organic
   composition and relatively low refractive indices can be fabricated from
   all azo-POSS branched conjugates. Finally, the photoisomerization
   behavior of POSS-conjugated 4-phenylazophenol was investigated in
   solution as well as in ultrathin nanocomposite film. We found that
   conjugation to POSS core did not affect the kinetics of trans-cis
   photoisomerization and thermal cis-trans relaxation. Furthermore, rapid
   and reversible photoisomerization was observed in azo-POSS nanocomposite
   films. We suggest that the highly stable branched azo-POSS conjugates
   with high dye grafting density described here can be considered for
   nanometersized photoswitches, active layer material with
   optical-limiting properties, and a medium with photoinduced anisotropy

Title = {{Spatial assignment of symmetry adapted perturbation theory interaction
   energy components: The atomic SAPT partition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{We develop a physically-motivated assignment of symmetry adapted
   perturbation theory for intermolecular interactions (SAPT) into
   atom-pairwise contributions (the A-SAPT partition). The basic precept of
   A-SAPT is that the many-body interaction energy components are computed
   normally under the formalism of SAPT, following which a
   spatially-localized two-body quasiparticle interaction is extracted from
   the many-body interaction terms. For electrostatics and induction source
   terms, the relevant quasiparticles are atoms, which are obtained in this
   work through the iterative stockholder analysis (ISA) procedure. For the
   exchange, induction response, and dispersion terms, the relevant
   quasiparticles are local occupied orbitals, which are obtained in this
   work through the Pipek-Mezey procedure. The local orbital atomic charges
   obtained from ISA additionally allow the terms involving local orbitals
   to be assigned in an atom-pairwise manner. Further summation over the
   atoms of one or the other monomer allows for a chemically intuitive
   visualization of the contribution of each atom and interaction component
   to the overall noncovalent interaction strength. Herein, we present the
   intuitive development and mathematical form for A-SAPT applied in the
   SAPT0 approximation (the A-SAPT0 partition). We also provide an
   efficient series of algorithms for the computation of the A-SAPT0
   partition with essentially the same computational cost as the
   corresponding SAPT0 decomposition. We probe the sensitivity of the
   A-SAPT0 partition to the ISA grid and convergence parameter, orbital
   localization metric, and induction coupling treatment, and recommend a
   set of practical choices which closes the definition of the A-SAPT0
   partition. We demonstrate the utility and computational tractability of
   the A-SAPT0 partition in the context of side-on cation-p interactions
   and the intercalation of DNA by proflavine. A-SAPT0 clearly shows the
   key processes in these complicated noncovalent interactions, in systems
   with up to 220 atoms and 2845 basis functions. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is an imaging
   modality with superb penetration depth and excellent absorption
   contrast. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that this technique

   different wavelengths, it is feasible to spectrally resolve the specific
   biomolecules involved in a staining color. Furthermore, the tomographic
   capability of OR-PAM allows for noninvasive volumetric imaging of a
   thick sample without microtoming it. By immunostaining the sample with
   different chromogenic agents, we further demonstrated the ability of
   OR-PAM to resolve different types of cells in a coculture sample with
   imaging depths up to 1 mm. Taken together, the integration of OR-PAM
   with (immuno) histochemistry offers a simple and versatile technique
   with broad applications in cell biology, pathology, tissue engineering,
   and related biomedical studies.}},

Title = {{High-speed atomic force microscope imaging: Adaptive multiloop mode}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an imaging mode (called the adaptive multiloop mode) of
   atomic force microscope (AFM) is proposed to substantially increase the
   speed of tapping mode (TM) imaging while preserving the advantages of TM
   imaging over contact mode (CM) imaging. Due to its superior image
   quality and less sample disturbances over CM imaging, particularly for
   soft materials such as polymers, TM imaging is currently the most widely
   used imaging technique. The speed of TM imaging, however, is
   substantially (over an order of magnitude) lower than that of CM
   imaging, becoming the major bottleneck of this technique. Increasing the
   speed of TM imaging is challenging as a stable probe tapping on the
   sample surface must be maintained to preserve the image quality, whereas
   the probe tapping is rather sensitive to the sample topography
   variation. As a result, the increase of imaging speed can quickly lead
   to loss of the probe-sample contact and/or annihilation of the probe
   tapping, resulting in image distortion and/or sample deformation. The
   proposed adaptive multiloop mode (AMLM) imaging overcomes these
   limitations of TM imaging through the following three efforts integrated
   together: First, it is proposed to account for the variation of the TM
   deflection when quantifying the sample topography; second, an
   inner-outer feedback control loop to regulate the TM deflection is added
   on top of the tapping-feedback control loop to improve the sample
   topography tracking; and, third, an online iterative feedforward
   controller is augmented to the whole control system to further enhance
   the topography tracking, where the next-line sample topography is
   predicted and utilized to reduce the tracking error. The added feedback
   regulation of the TM deflection ensures the probe-sample interaction
   force remains near the minimum for maintaining a stable probe-sample
   interaction. The proposed AMLM imaging is tested and demonstrated by
   imaging a poly(tert-butyl acrylate) sample in experiments. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the image quality achieved by
   using the proposed AMLM imaging at a scan rate of 25 Hz and over a
   large-size imaging (50 mu m x 25 mu m) is at the same level of that
   obtained using TM imaging at 1 Hz, while the probe-sample interaction
   force is noticeably reduced from that achieved using TM imaging at 2.5
   Hz.}},

Abstract = {{The self-organization of organic polymer semiconductors into ordered
   supramolecular assemblies commensurate with efficient charge transport
   is achieved by tuning a range of process parameters (e.g., film
   deposition method (spin vs drop cast), solvent boiling point (low vs

   post-deposition processing (solvent vapor or thermal annealing)).
   However, these strategies present limitations for large-scale
   high-throughput processing due to associated pre- and/or post
   semiconductor deposition steps. Here, photoinduced anisotropic
   supramolecular assembly of P3HT chains in solution is demonstrated. UV
   irradiation provides for enhanced intramolecular ordering of solubilized
   polymer chains, and thereby effects formation of anisotropic
   supramolecular polymer assemblies via favorable pi-pi stacking
   (intermolecular interaction). Molecular ordering is thus dramatically
   enhanced with concomitant, enhanced charge transport characteristics of
   corresponding films. Additional pre- and/or post treatments are avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene has been demonstrated as a good candidate for ultrafast
   optoelectronic devices. However, graphene is essentially transparent in
   the visible and near infrared with an absorptivity of 2.3\%, which has
   largely limited its application in photon detection. This Letter
   demonstrates that the absorptance in a monatomic graphene layer can be
   greatly enhanced to nearly 70\%, thanks to the localized strong electric
   field resulting from magnetic resonances in deep metal gratings.
   Furthermore, the resonance frequency is essentially not affected by the
   additional graphene layer. The method presented here may benefit the
   design of next-generation graphene-based optical and optoelectronic
   devices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Feature-constrained registration of building point clouds acquired by
   terrestrial and airborne laser scanners}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Point-cloud registration is usually accomplished on the basis of several
   corresponding features to compute the parameters of the transformation
   model. However, common point features are difficult to select because
   airborne laser scanner (ALS) and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point
   clouds of the same object have be aligned due to the different sensing
   positions and sampling modes. Taking building profile features as
   objects, a registration method based on feature constraints is proposed
   here. The standard six-parameter rigid-body transformation adopted for
   alignment of laser scans is replaced by a two-step transformation:
   horizontal registration based on a two-dimensional similarity
   transformation and vertical registration based on a simple vertical
   shift. First, the feature-line and feature-plane equation parameters are
   obtained from both the airborne and terrestrial point clouds. Second,
   the plane transformation parameters are computed after projecting the
   extracted features onto a horizontal reference plane. Finally, the
   elevation transformation parameter is calculated by comparing the
   heights of flat features. The ALS and TLS datasets of two buildings
   (Shanghai Pudong International Conference Center and Shanghai Ocean
   Aquarium, China) were used to evaluate the robustness and accuracy. The
   results show that the proposed feature-constrained method works well for
   registration between two datasets. Five checkpoints and one overlap zone
   for the Pudong International Conference Center were selected to evaluate
   the accuracy and resulted in accuracies of 0.15 to 0.5 m in the
   horizontal direction and 0.20 m in the vertical direction. (C) 2014

Title = {{Northern winter climate change: Assessment of uncertainty in CMIP5
   projections related to stratosphere-troposphere coupling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Future changes in the stratospheric circulation could have an important
   impact on northern winter tropospheric climate change, given that sea
   level pressure (SLP) responds not only to tropospheric circulation
   variations but also to vertically coherent variations in
   troposphere-stratosphere circulation. Here we assess northern winter
   stratospheric change and its potential to influence surface climate
   change in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5)
   multimodel ensemble. In the stratosphere at high latitudes, an easterly
   change in zonally averaged zonal wind is found for the majority of the
   CMIP5 models, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5
   scenario. Comparable results are also found in the 1\% CO2 increase per
   year projections, indicating that the stratospheric easterly change is
   common feature in future climate projections. This stratospheric wind
   change, however, shows a significant spread among the models. By using
   linear regression, we quantify the impact of tropical upper troposphere
   warming, polar amplification, and the stratospheric wind change on SLP.
   We find that the intermodel spread in stratospheric wind change
   contributes substantially to the intermodel spread in Arctic SLP change.
   The role of the stratosphere in determining part of the spread in SLP
   change is supported by the fact that the SLP change lags the
   stratospheric zonally averaged wind change. Taken together, these
   findings provide further support for the importance of simulating the
   coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere, to narrow the
   uncertainty in the future projection of tropospheric circulation
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Natural lightning is both frequent and variable and thus a good subject
   for statistical studies. A typical negative cloud-to-ground (CG) flash
   consists of multiple individual return strokes. The spatial and temporal
   distributions of various lightning events throughout the discharge
   provide a surrogate look inside the CG flash and offer insight into the
   underlying physical processes. In this study, we combine 8 years of
   National Lightning Detection Network (TM) (NLDN) and North Alabama
   Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA) data to compute the spatial and temporal
   distributions of (i) subsequent NLDN-reported return strokes and (ii)
   LMA-reported sources around NLDN-reported CG strokes. Subsequent strokes
   are separated into those with the same contact point as the first stroke
   and those flowing along new lightning channels. Statistically, the
   distribution of strokes along new channels evolves deterministically,
   with similar to 200 km/s propagation speed from the original channel,
   comparable to the speed of a stepped leader. This suggests that the -CG
   subsequent strokes forming new channels may be directly linked to the
   initial one by a propagating leader inside the cloud. We present LMA
   case studies and a multiyear analysis of NLDN-LMA data that support this
   behavior. Our results are supported by ground-truth measurements and
   video recordings from previous field studies.}},

   such as optical and ultrasound radiations. In recent years, these
   materials have gained increasing interest in biomedical applications due
   to their potential for spatially and temporally controlled release of
   theranostic agents in response to the specific stimuli. This article
   highlights several recent advances in the development of such materials,
   with a focus on their molecular designs and formulations. The future of
   stimuli-responsive materials will also be explored, including
   combination with molecular imaging probes and targeting moieties, which
   could enable simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of a specific disease,
   as well as multi-functionality and responsiveness to multiple stimuli,
   all important in overcoming intrinsic biological barriers and increasing
   clinical viability.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of ordered arrays of self-encapsulated
   ``micro-bubble{''} material constructs based on the capillary-driven
   collapse of flexible silk fibroin sheets during propagation of the
   diffusion front of the encapsulated material is demonstrated. The
   individual micro-bubbles of different shapes are composed of a
   sacrificial material encapsulated within the ultrathin silk coating,
   which covers and seals the inner material during dissolution of
   supporting layer. The array of microscopic rectangular multi-layer silk
   sheets on supporting polymer layers can be selectively dissolved along
   the edges to initiate their self-encapsulation. The resulting
   micro-bubble morphology, shape, and arrangements can be readily
   pre-programmed by controlling the geometry of the silk sheets, such as
   thickness, dimension, and aspect ratio. These microbubble constructs can
   be utilized for encapsulation of various materials as well as
   nanoparticles in a single or multi compartmental manner. These
   biocompatible and biodegradable micro-bubble constructs present a
   promising platform for one-shot spatial and controllable loading and
   locking material arrays with addressable abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Three constituents of loblolly pine (stem, residue, and bark) were
   independently pyrolyzed to produce light oil. The chemical structures of
   the light oils were analyzed using GC-MS, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and
   HSQC-NMR. The experimental results indicate that levoglucosan observed
   in the light oil is the major product from cellulose pyrolysis. Furanic
   and phenolic monomers are derived from hemicellulose and lignin,
   respectively. The light oil hydrodeoxygenation reaction study was
   carried out using carbon-supported ruthenium as a catalyst. Light oils
   from all three constituents were independently upgraded under 8 MYa
   hydrogen gas at 300 degrees C for 2 h. After the upgrading process, the
   aromatic rings were hydrogenated and the oxygen-containing functional
   groups were extensively removed. According to H-1 NMR, the percentage of
   the CHnO peak area for stem, residue, and bark decreases by 90.03\%,
   77.84\%, and 94.98\%, respectively, compared to that for the pre-HDO
   light oil After upgrading, the carbon yields are 83.31\% for the bark
   and approximately 100\% for both the stem and the residue. The results
   indicate that ruthenium can hydrogenate carbonyl (C=O) bonds, furan
   ring, and aromatic ring as well as cleave the aliphatic C-O and C-C
   bonds by hydrogenolysis. However, it cannot cleave the ether and ester
   type bonds.}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic biodegradation of naphthenic acids is of importance to the oil
   industry for the long-term management and environmental impact of
   process water and wastewater. The effect of structure, particularly the
   location of the alkyl side chain as well as cyclicity, on the aerobic
   biotransformation of 10 model naphthenic acids (NAs) was investigated.
   Using an aerobic, mixed culture, enriched with a commercial NA mixture
   (NA sodium salt; TCI Chemicals), batch biotransformation assays were
   conducted with individual model NAs, including eight 8-carbon isomers.
   It was shown that NM with a quaternary carbon at the alpha- or
   beta-position or a tertiary carbon at the beta- and/or beta-position are
   recalcitrant or have limited biodegradability. In addition, branched NM
   exhibited lag periods and lower degradation rates than nonbranched or
   simple cyclic NM. Two NA isomers used in a closed bottle, aerobic
   biodegradation assay were mineralized, while 21 and 35\% of the parent
   compound carbon was incorporated into the biomass. The NA biodegradation
   probability estimated by two widely used models (BIOWIN 2 and 6) and a
   recently developed model (OCHEM) was compared to the biodegradability of
   the 10 model NM tested in this study as well as other related NM. The
   biodegradation probability estimated by the OCHEM model agreed best with
   the experimental data and was best correlated with the measured NA
   biodegradation rate.}},

Abstract = {{Zn2GeO4 nanorod/graphene composites (ZGCs) were yielded by a two-step

   was compactly covered and anchored by graphene sheets. The ZGCs were
   then utilized as anodes for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Intriguingly,
   partially crystalline ZGC containing 10.2 wt \% graphene possessed
   excellent electrochemical performance, namely, high reversible capacity
   (1020 mA h g(-1) in the first cycle), favorable cyclic performance (768
   mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles), and commendable rate capability (780 mA h
   g(-1) at the current density of 0.8A g(-1)). The amorphous region in
   partially crystalline Zn2GeO4 nanorods and the elastic graphene sheets
   provided the accommodation of volume change during the charge and

Title = {{Thickness-based adaptive mesh refinement methods for multi-phase flow
   simulations with thin regions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{269}},
Pages = {{22-39}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{In numerical simulations of multi-scale, multi-phase flows, grid
   refinement is required to resolve regions with small scales. A notable
   example is liquid-jet atomization and subsequent droplet dynamics. It is
   essential to characterize the detailed flow physics with variable length
   scales with high fidelity, in order to elucidate the underlying
   mechanisms. In this paper, two thickness-based mesh refinement schemes
   are developed based on distance- and topology-oriented criteria for thin
   regions with confining wall/plane of symmetry and in any situation,
   respectively. Both techniques are implemented in a general framework
   with a volume-of-fluid formulation and an adaptive-mesh-refinement
   capability. The distance-oriented technique compares against a critical
   value, the ratio of an interfacial cell size to the distance between the
   mass center of the cell and a reference plane. The topology-oriented
   technique is developed from digital topology theories to handle more
   general conditions. The requirement for interfacial mesh refinement can
   be detected swiftly, without the need of thickness information, equation
   solving, variable averaging or mesh repairing. The mesh refinement level
   increases smoothly on demand in thin regions. The schemes have been
   verified and validated against several benchmark cases to demonstrate
   their effectiveness and robustness. These include the dynamics of
   colliding droplets, droplet motions in a microchannel, and atomization
   of liquid impinging jets. Overall, the thickness-based refinement
   technique provides highly adaptive meshes for problems with thin regions
   in an efficient and fully automatic manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We have designed interlayer grating couplers with single/double metallic
   reflectors for Si/SiO2/SiN multilayer material platform. Out-of-plane
   diffractive grating couplers separated by 1.6 m thick buffer SiO2 layer
   are vertically stacked against each other in Si and SiN layers.
   Geometrical optimization using genetic algorithm coupled with
   electromagnetic simulations using two-dimensional (2D) finite element
   method (FEM) results in coupler designs with high peak coupling
   efficiency of up to 89\% for double-mirror and 64\% for single-mirror
   structures at telecom wavelength. Also, 3-dB bandwidths of 40 nm and 50
   nm are theoretically predicted for the two designs, respectively. We
   have fabricated the grating coupler structure with single mirror.
   Measured values for insertion loss and 3-dB bandwidth in the fabricated
   single-mirror coupler confirms the theoretical results. This opens up
   the possibility of low-loss 3D dense integration of optical
   functionalities in hybrid material platforms. (C) 2014 Optical Society

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{We study the performance of composite pulses in the presence of
   time-varying control noise on a single qubit. These protocols,
   originally devised only to correct for static, systematic errors, are
   shown to be robust to time-dependent non-Markovian noise in the control
   field up to frequencies as high as similar to 10\% of the Rabi
   frequency. Our study combines a generalized filter-function approach
   with asymptotic dc-limit calculations to give a simple analytic
   framework for error analysis applied to a number of composite-pulse
   sequences relevant to nuclear magnetic resonance as well as quantum
   information experiments. Results include examination of recently
   introduced concatenated composite pulses and dynamically corrected
   gates, demonstrating equivalent first-order suppression of
   time-dependent fluctuations in amplitude and/or detuning, as appropriate
   for the sequence in question. Our analytic results agree well with
   numerical simulations for realistic 1/f noise spectra with a roll-off to
   1/f(2), providing independent validation of our theoretical insights.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium adsorption of gas phase mixtures of D- and L-alanine (Ala)
   onto the naturally chiral Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) surfaces has been studied
   by both experiment and DFT-based modeling. Isotopically labeled {*}L-Ala
   ((HO2CCH)-C-13(NH2)CH3) and unlabeled D-Ala allow mass spectrometric
   enantiodifferentiation of the adsorbed species during
   temperature-programmed decomposition, following equilibrium adsorption.
   Measurements of the relative equilibrium coverages of D- and {*}L-Ala on
   the Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) surfaces, theta(D/R)/theta{*}(L/R) =
   theta({*}L/S)/theta(D/S), at gas phase partial pressure ratios of
   P-{*}L/PD = 1/2, 1, and 2 indicate that the D-Ala and {*}L-Ala
   conglomerate phases are more energetically stable than a D{*}L-Ala
   racemate phase, but that their adsorption energies are not measurably
   enantiospecific, Delta Delta E-DL approximate to 0. Although the DFT
   simulations provide a self-consistent structure of Ala overlayers on
   Cu\{3,1,17\}(R\&S) they overestimate the enantiospecificity of the
   adsorption energetics.}},

Abstract = {{Tastes and claims about unhealthy food are important factors that affect
   consumption. This study investigated the correlation of the
   event-related potential (ERP) of the evaluation of processing of food
   information with the task of positive judgment. Given the information on
   possible diseases that arise with food consumption, sweet-tasting food
   elicited more conflict than salty food, and this conflict was reflected
   by a negative ERP component at 250-500 ms (N400). Moreover, the late
   positive wave at 500-800 ms that was evoked by presentation of food with
   the names of chronic diseases that could arise from the consumption of
   such food was larger than that evoked when acute diseases were
   presented. Sweet-tasting food caused a more intense conflict with
   disease-related risk than salty food, and chronic diseases aroused a
   stronger emotional fear than acute diseases. These findings provide new
   insights into the N400 component and the neurocognitive processes of
   evaluating food combined with taste and risk information.}},

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stromal cells have shown clinical promise; however,
   variations in treatment responses are an ongoing concern. We previously
   demonstrated that MSCs are functionally stunned after thawing. Here, we
   investigated whether this cryopreservation/thawing defect also impacts
   the postinfusion biodistribution properties of MSCs. Under both static
   and physiologic flow, compared with live MSCs in active culture, MSCs
   thawed from cryopreservation bound poorly to fibronectin (40\%
   reduction) and human endothelial cells (80\% reduction), respectively.
   This reduction correlated with a reduced cytoskeletal F-actin content in
   post-thaw MSCs (60\% reduction). In vivo, live human MSCs could be
   detected in murine lung tissues for up to 24 hr, whereas thawed MSCs
   were undetectable. Similarly, live MSCs whose actin cytoskeleton was
   chemically disrupted were undetectable at 24 hr postinfusion. Our data
   suggest that post-thaw cryopreserved MSCs are distinct from live MSCs.
   This distinction could significantly affect the utility of MSCs as a
   cellular therapeutic.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of the anomalous frequency dispersion in accumulation
   capacitance of metal-insulator-semiconductor devices on InGaAs and InP

   The correlation between the spectroscopically detected bonding states at
   the dielectric/III-V interface, the interfacial defect density
   determined using capacitance-voltage, and modeled capacitance-voltage
   response strongly suggests that these defects are associated with the

Abstract = {{In this paper, the interplay of Bragg scattering and local resonance is
   theoretically studied in a phononic crystal (PnC) structure composed of
   a silicon membrane with periodic tungsten pillars. The comparison of
   phononic band gaps (PnBGs) in three different lattice types (i.e.,
   square, triangular, and honeycomb) with different pillar geometries
   shows that different PnBGs have varying degrees of dependency on the
   lattice symmetry based on the interplay of the local resonances and the
   Bragg effect. The details of this interplay is discussed. The
   significance of locally resonating pillars, specially in the case of
   tall pillars, on PnBGs is discussed and verified by examining the PnBG
   position and width in perturbed lattices via Monte Carlo simulations. It
   is shown that the PnBGs caused by the local resonance of the pillars are
   more resilient to the lattice perturbations than those caused by Bragg
   scattering. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A series of four quadrupolar (Donor)(2)Acceptor-acid (D(2)A)
   sensitizers, based on two acceptor cores (dibenzophenazine (DBP) or

   connecting position to the core. This architectural design leads to the
   investigation of the structure-property relationships of the dyes, both
   in solution and upon integration in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
   Within sets of regioisomers, frontier orbital levels and absorption
   properties differed, but the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs were
   similar. When examining the effect of the core, the electronic
   properties (absorbance, LUMO level) predicted a more favourable electron
   injection for the DTP systems. However, the open circuit voltages are
   similar to 100 mV greater for the DBP systems.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular sieving metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes have great
   potential for energy-efficient chemical separations, but a major hurdle
   is the lack of a scalable and inexpensive membrane fabrication
   mechanism. We describe a route for processing MOF membranes in polymeric
   hollow fibers, combining a two-solvent interfacial approach for
   positional control over membrane formation (at inner and outer surfaces,
   or in the bulk, of the fibers), a microfluidic approach to replenishment
   or recycling of reactants, and an in situ module for membrane
   fabrication and permeation. We fabricated continuous molecular sieving
   ZIF-8 membranes in single and multiple poly(amide-imide) hollow fibers,
   with H-2/C3H8 and C3H6/C3H8 separation factors as high as 370 and 12,
   respectively. We also demonstrate positional control of the ZIF-8 films
   and characterize the contributions of membrane defects and lumen bypass.}},

Abstract = {{The application of the new quantitative elastohydrodynamics, which

   new transient hot-wire instrument for pressure to 600 MPa is described
   and validated. New measurements are presented of the temperature- and
   pressure-dependent thermal conductivity of a synthetic oil for jet
   aircraft engines. The density scaling law, , with exponent approximately
   equal to the standard value of 3 gives an excellent accounting of the
   results. The temperature dependence of the conductivity may be ignored
   in elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) simulations without great loss
   of accuracy and it may be sufficient to describe the pressure dependence

Title = {{Optimal numerical flux of power-law fluids in some partially full pipes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6-10}},
Pages = {{351-362}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Consider the steady state pressure driven flow of a power-law fluid in a
   partially filled straight pipe. It is known that an increase in flux can
   be achieved for a fixed pressure by partially filling the pipe and
   having the remaining volume either void or filled with a less viscous,
   lubricating fluid. If the pipe has circular cross section, the fluid
   level which maximizes flux is the level which avoids contact with
   exactly 25\% of the boundary. This result can be proved analytically for
   Newtonian fluids and has been verified numerically for certain
   non-Newtonian models.
   This paper provides a generalization of this work numerically to pipes
   with non-circular cross sections which are partially full with a
   power-law fluid. A simple and physically plausible geometric condition
   is presented which can be used to approximate the fluid level that
   maximizes flux in a wide range of pipe geometries. Additional increases
   in flux for a given pressure can be obtained by changing the shape of
   the pipe but leaving the perimeter fixed. This computational analysis of
   flux as a function of both fluid level and pipe geometry has not been
   considered to our knowledge.
   Fluxes are computed using a special discretization scheme, designed to
   uncover general properties which are only dependent on fluid level
   and/or pipe cross-sectional geometry. Computations use finite elements
   and take advantage of the variational structure inherent in the
   power-law model. A minimization technique for approximating the critical
   points of the associated non-linear energy functional is used. In
   particular, the numerical scheme for the non-linear partial differential
   equation has been proved to be convergent with known error estimates.
   The numerical results obtained in this work can be useful for designing
   pipes and canals for transportation of non-Newtonian fluids, such as
   those in chemical engineering and food processing engineering.}},

Title = {{Using self-organizing maps to develop ambient air quality
   classifications: a time series example}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Development of exposure metrics that capture features of the
   multipollutant environment are needed to investigate health effects of
   pollutant mixtures. This is a complex problem that requires development
   of new methodologies.
   Objective: Present a self-organizing map (SOM) framework for creating
   ambient air quality classifications that group days with similar
   multipollutant profiles.
   Methods: Eight years of day-level data from Atlanta, GA, for ten ambient
   air pollutants collected at a central monitor location were classified
   using SOM into a set of day types based on their day-level
   multipollutant profiles. We present strategies for using SOM to develop
   a multipollutant metric of air quality and compare results with more
   traditional techniques.
   Results: Our analysis found that 16 types of days reasonably describe
   the day-level multipollutant combinations that appear most frequently in
   our data. Multipollutant day types ranged from conditions when all
   pollutants measured low to days exhibiting relatively high
   concentrations for either primary or secondary pollutants or both. The
   temporal nature of class assignments indicated substantial heterogeneity
   in day type frequency distributions (1\%-14\%), relatively short-term
   durations (<2 day persistence), and long-term and seasonal trends.
   Meteorological summaries revealed strong day type weather dependencies
   and pollutant concentration summaries provided interesting scenarios for
   further investigation. Comparison with traditional methods found SOM
   produced similar classifications with added insight regarding
   between-class relationships.
   Conclusion: We find SOM to be an attractive framework for developing
   ambient air quality classification because the approach eases
   interpretation of results by allowing users to visualize classifications
   on an organized map. The presented approach provides an appealing tool
   for developing multipollutant metrics of air quality that can be used to
   support multipollutant health studies.}},

Title = {{Modeling of rapid temperature swing adsorption using hollow fiber
   sorbents}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{62-76}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{The use of novel polymeric hollow fiber contactors loaded with CO2
   sorbents has been recently demonstrated experimentally as a new and
   scalable process configuration for post- combustion CO2 capture. The
   hollow fiber contactor allows coupling of efficient heat transfer and
   gas contacting, potentially yielding lower parasitic loads on host power
   plants compared to traditional contacting strategies using solid
   sorbents. In this study, a two dimensional mathematical model of a rapid
   temperature swing adsorption(RTSA) process is developed for the first
   time to predict polymer supported amine hollow fiber sorbent performance
   during post- combustion CO2 capture from flue gas. In particular, this
   work is focused on developing a single fiber model to simulate a four-
   step RTSA system accounting for adsorption, heating/desorption,
   heating/sweeping and cooling steps. The model is validated with
   experimental breakthrough data obtained from our RTSA system. The
   sensitivity of the model to parameter values such as gas and water
   velocity and initial temperatures are evaluated accordingly by
   considering the effect of these parameters on CO2 concentration and
   temperature profiles. Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption isotherms obtained
   experimentally were fitted with the Toth model. In addition, our model
   was validated against experimental breakthrough profiles. A good
   agreement was found between experimental and numerical data indicating
   that our proposed model can describe experimental observation very well.
   The numerical results obtained from RTSA cycle modeling indicate that
   under operating conditions considered here, it is possible to achieve
   high purity and recovery within a cycle time of shorter than 3 min. It
   was also found that there is a trade- off in cycle time, shorter for
   lower capital cost and longer to enable heat recovery for lower utility
   costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The `sustainable remediation' concept has been broadly embraced by

   developed a generalised framework for selecting the most environmentally

   remediation technologies were evaluated: pump and treat (P\&T), enhanced
   in situ bioremediation (EIB), permeable reactive barrier (PRB), and in
   situ chemical reduction (ISCR). Within the developed framework and
   examined site condition ranges, our results indicate that site

Title = {{A Linear Relationship between Crystal Size and Fragment Binding Time
   Observed Crystallographically: Implications for Fragment Library
   Screening Using Acoustic Droplet Ejection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{High throughput screening technologies such as acoustic droplet ejection
   (ADE) greatly increase the rate at which X-ray diffraction data can be
   acquired from crystals. One promising high throughput screening
   application of ADE is to rapidly combine protein crystals with fragment
   libraries. In this approach, each fragment soaks into a protein crystal
   either directly on data collection media or on a moving conveyor belt
   which then delivers the crystals to the X-ray beam. By simultaneously
   handling multiple crystals combined with fragment specimens, these
   techniques relax the automounter duty-cycle bottleneck that currently
   prevents optimal exploitation of third generation synchrotrons. Two
   factors limit the speed and scope of projects that are suitable for
   fragment screening using techniques such as ADE. Firstly, in
   applications where the high throughput screening apparatus is located
   inside the X-ray station (such as the conveyor belt system described
   above), the speed of data acquisition is limited by the time required
   for each fragment to soak into its protein crystal. Secondly, in
   applications where crystals are combined with fragments directly on data
   acquisition media (including both of the ADE methods described above),
   the maximum time that fragments have to soak into crystals is limited by
   evaporative dehydration of the protein crystals during the fragment
   soak. Here we demonstrate that both of these problems can be minimized
   by using small crystals, because the soak time required for a fragment
   hit to attain high occupancy depends approximately linearly on crystal
   size.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and characterization of ``bistetracene{''}, an
   unconventional, linearly extended conjugated core with eight fused
   rings. The annellation mode of the system allows for increased stability
   of the conjugated system relative to linear analogues due to the
   increased number of Clar aromatic sextets. By attaching the appropriate
   solubilizing substituents, efficient molecular packing with large
   transfer integrals can be obtained. The electronic structure
   calculations suggest these large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   exhibit excellent intrinsic charge transport properties. Charge carrier
   mobilities as large as 6.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and current on/off ratios of
   10(7) were determined experimentally for one of our compounds. Our study
   provides valuable insight into the design of unconventional

Title = {{The Role of Inorganic Pyrophosphate in Aortic Valve Calcification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEART VALVE DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{387-394}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: Aortic valve (AV) calcification is a
   major cause of morbidity and mortality, yet the molecular mechanisms
   involved are poorly understood. Hence, an ex vivo model of calcification
   in intact AVs was developed in order to test the role of orthophosphate
   and pyrophosphate (PPi), both of which factors are known to influence
   vascular calcification.
   Methods: Porcine AV leaflets were cultured in serum-free medium under
   static conditions for eight days, over which time leaflet architecture
   and viability were preserved. Calcification was measured as the
   incorporation of Ca-45, with confirmation by Alizarin Red staining.
   Results: Calcification required both a high phosphate concentration (3.8
   mM) and removal of PPi with alkaline phosphatase or inorganic
   pyrophosphatase. Calcification occurred predominantly on the fibrosa and
   was arrested by the bisphosphonate etidronate, a non-hydrolyzable analog
   of PPi. Leaflets released PPi into the medium, and this was enhanced by
   MLS38949, a specific inhibitor of tissue non-specific alkaline
   phosphatase (TNAP). Furthermore, leaflets synthesized PPi from
   extracellular ATP, which was reduced by beta,gamma-methylene-ATP, an
   inhibitor of ectonucleotide pyrophosphorylase phosphodiesterase (NPP1).
   Conclusion: The ex vivo AV calcification model developed in the present
   study showed that extracellular PPi, produced by valvular tissue, is a
   potent inhibitor of valvular calcification. In addition to synthesis,
   hydrolysis by TNAP also controls PPi levels and calcification. The
   results suggest that a decreased synthesis or increased hydrolysis of
   pyrophosphate may contribute to valvular calcification, and that
   bisphosphonates or inhibitors of TNAP are potential preventive
   strategies of the process. TNAP are potential preventive strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous investigations have been conducted to extend adiabatic
   liquid-gas volume-of-fluid (VOF) flow solvers to include condensation
   phenomena by adding an energy equation and phase-change source terms.
   Some proposed phase-change models employ empirical rate parameters, or
   adapt heat-transfer correlations, and thus must be tuned for specific
   applications. Generally applicable models have also been developed that
   rigorously resolve the phase-change process, but require interface
   reconstruction, significantly increasing computational cost, and
   software complexity. In the present work, a simplified
   first-principles-based condensation model is developed, which forces
   interface-containing mesh cells to the equilibrium state. The operation
   on cells instead of complex interface surfaces enables the use of fast
   graph algorithms without reconstruction. The model is validated for
   horizontal film condensation, and converges to exact solutions with
   increasing mesh resolution. Agreement with established results is
   demonstrated for smooth and wavy falling-film condensation.}},

Title = {{Determining the Optimal Premium for ADR Implementation Insurance in
   Construction Dispute Resolution}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In most of today's construction projects, disputes are almost
   inevitable, and the implementation costs associated with dispute
   resolution are becoming increasingly expensive. One approach to deal
   with the risk of dispute-related cost overruns is by pooling the risk
   using alternative dispute resolution (ADR) implementation insurance.
   This innovative insurance product is designed to allow the insurance
   company to compensate any ADR implementation cost that project
   participants incur during the construction phase. In return, the
   insurance company will receive a premium for bearing the risk of
   excessive ADR implementation costs. Similar to commercial medical and
   auto insurance, the ADR insurance policy specifies a deductible limit
   (DL) and a maximum payment limit (MPL) on project participants to
   prevent both moral and morale hazards. In this case, project
   participants must bear part of the future ADR implementation costs
   before their insurance is activated. Based on the basic framework of ADR
   implementation insurance previously developed by the writers, this paper
   proposes an advanced model with the two additional insurance limits to
   help determine the optimal point on the project participants' subjective
   loss curve. The objective is to provide a mutually advantageous
   insurance policy and minimize project participants' total expected
   subjective loss. An example is provided to illustrate the benefits of
   the proposed methodology. The results show that project participants'
   subjective loss function (SLF), DL, MPL, and the expense loading factor
   a together play important roles in determining the optimal premium for
   the ADR implementation insurance. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Porcine enamel matrix derivative (pEMD), a complex mixture of proteins
   and peptides including full-length amelogenin protein, splice variants,
   and proteolytic peptides, is used clinically with a carrier to
   regenerate supportive tissue around teeth. During application, pEMD
   self-assembles as nanospheres and precipitates as a three-dimensional
   matrix to facilitate cell migration and differentiation. Amelogenin, the
   primary constituent of pEMD, stimulates osteoblast differentiation, but
   it is unclear what specific roles other components of pEMD play in
   determining biological response. This study examined the potential of
   one constituent of pEMD, the N-terminal amelogenin peptide (NTAP), to
   promote osteoblastic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) and to elucidate possible signaling pathways involved. Effects of
   porcine NTAP on MSC cultures were compared to those of recombinant human
   amelogenin. While amelogenin induced MSC osteoblastic differentiation, a
   more robust osteoblastic response was seen after NTAP treatment. A
   phospho-kinase proteasome array measuring phosphorylation of 35 proteins
   indicated that protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated
   kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and beta-catenin were highly phosphorylated by
   NTAP. This was confirmed by measuring PKC activity and levels of
   phospho-ERK1/2 and beta-catenin. Both amelogenin and NTAP increased PKC,
   but NTAP induced higher phosho-ERK1/2 and phospho-beta-catenin than
   amelogenin. ERK1/2 inhibition blocked both amelogenin-and NTAP-induced
   increases in RUNX2, ALP, OCN, COL1, and BMP2. The results demonstrate
   that NTAP induces osteogenic differentiation of MSCs via PKC and ERK1/2
   activation and beta-catenin degradation. NTAP may be an active bone
   regeneration component of amelogenin, and may play this role in
   pEMD-stimulated periodontal regeneration.}},

Title = {{Thermo-mechanical radial expansion of heat exchanger piles and possible

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{170-178}},

Abstract = {{This letter shows that the increase of heat exchanger pile capacity in
   response to heating, observed in several small-scale laboratory studies,
   cannot be directly attributed to the increase of contact pressure at the
   soil-pile interface. The main thermo-hydro-mechanical processes that
   influence the capacity and behaviour of heat exchanger piles include
   thermal hardening of the soil, thermally induced water flow, excess pore
   pressure development and volume changes upon thermal consolidation. Due
   to the lack of understanding of the behaviour around the soil-pile
   interface, thermo-mechanical interactions between the heat exchanger
   pile and the ground are not taken into account appropriately in energy
   foundation design. However, in situ and reduced-scale experiments
   provide evidence about temperature-induced changes in pile capacity,
   presumably as a result of the altered stress state around the test pile.
   A finite-element analysis was conducted to quantitatively assess the
   radial stresses and strains undergone by a heated pile embedded in
   deformable soil. The study indicates that radial contact pressures
   typically increase less than 15 kPa, which cannot fully explain the
   increase in shaft resistance observed in heating tests. Further analyses
   are underway to characterise the mechanisms that govern pile
   load-displacement behaviour and the limit state.}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Cell culture in microfluidic systems has primarily been conducted in
   devices comprised of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or other elastomers. As
   polystyrene (PS) is the most characterized and commonly used substrate
   material for cell culture, microfluidic cell culture would ideally be
   conducted in PS-based microsystems that also enable tight control of
   perfusion and hydrodynamic conditions, which are especially important
   for culture of vascular cell types. Here, we report a simple method to
   prototype perfusable PS microfluidics for endothelial cell culture under
   flow that can be fabricated using standard lithography and wet
   laboratory equipment to enable stable perfusion at shear stresses up to
   300 dyn/cm(2) and pumping pressures up to 26 kPa for at least 100 h.
   This technique can also be extended to fabricate perfusable hybrid
   PS-PDMS microfluidics of which one application is for increased
   efficiency of viral transduction in non-adherent suspension cells by
   leveraging the high surface area to volume ratio of microfluidics and
   adhesion molecules that are optimized for PS substrates. These
   biologically compatible microfluidic devices can be made more accessible
   to biological-based laboratories through the outsourcing of lithography
   to various available microfluidic foundries. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Multiscale Crack Fundamental Element Model for Real-World Pavement Crack
   Classification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{High-resolution 2D intensity and 3D range data are available to support
   pavement crack detection and classification. However, crack
   classification based on actual distress protocols specified by different
   state departments of transportation (DOTs) still remains a challenge
   because of the complexity of real-world crack classification. In
   addition, developing crack performance measurements that can be used
   consistently among different state DOTs is another challenge. The
   objective of this paper is to propose a novel crack fundamental element
   (CFE) model based on a multiscale topological crack representation.
   Based on the observation of real-world pavement crack characteristics,
   the proposed multiscale CFE model consists of (1) a CFE along with its
   geometrical properties that can be represented consistently at different
   scales, (2) connecting and expanding operations to cluster CFEs from a
   small to a large scale, and (3) the topological crack representation
   inside each CFE, including fundamental and aggregated crack properties
   and CFE geometrical properties. The proposed multiscale CFE model
   provides crack properties that enable researchers to develop innovative
   crack classification methods to characterize cracks at different scales
   and flexibly model crack classifications specified by different state
   DOTs. In addition, it also delivers the rich and invariant crack
   properties that enable researchers to develop standardized crack
   performance measurements. A real-world load cracking classification
   application based on the logistic regression method has also been
   developed and tested using the actual pavement data collected near
   Savannah, Georgia to demonstrate the use of the crack properties
   extracted from the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model
   is promising for developing real-world crack classification
   applications. Finally, future research is recommended. (C) 2014 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{One of the potentially most important issues in accurately modeling
   directed self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) is the fact that the
   real BCPs often have block energy and/or density asymmetry, meaning that
   each block has a different homopolymer density and/or cohesive energy
   density (CED). A simulation of BCP behavior based on molecular dynamics
   of coarse-grained polymer chains has been developed that can
   independently parameterize and control the density and the CED of each
   block to more accurately match this asymmetry. This model was used to
   study the effect on the order-disorder transition (ODT), domain scaling,
   and self-assembly of thin films of BCPs. BCPs whose blocks each have a
   different density show deviations from the mean-field ODT coexistence
   curve, exhibiting an asymmetric order-disorder transition curve.
   Self-assembly of thin films of BCPs with mismatches in CED shows
   significant changes in morphologies compared to BCPs with energetically
   symmetric blocks, because the lowest CED block has a strong propensity
   to segregate to and ``wet{''} the free interface. This CED mismatch also
   gives rise to a large number of deviations from bulk behavior including
   changing vertical-to-horizontal morphologies through film depth,
   compression and expansion of domain sizes, and island and hole
   formations among others. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) has emerged as a key technology for enhancing
   spectrum efficiency by creating opportunistic transmission links.
   Supporting the routing function on top of opportunistic links is a must
   for transporting packets in a CR ad hoc network (CRAHN) consisting of
   cooperative relay multi-radio systems. However, there lacks a thorough
   understanding of these highly dynamic opportunistic links and a reliable
   end-to-end transportation mechanism over the network. Aspiring to meet
   this need, with innovative establishment of the spectrum map from local
   sensing information, we first provide a mathematical analysis to deal
   with transmission delay over such opportunistic links. Benefitting from
   the theoretical derivations, we then propose spectrum-map-empowered
   opportunistic routing protocols for regular and large-scale CRAHNs with
   wireless fading channels, employing a cooperative networking scheme to
   enable multi-path transmissions. Simulations confirm that our solutions
   enjoy significant reduction of end-to-end delay and achieve dependable
   communications for CRAHNs, without commonly needed feedback information
   from nodes in a CRAHN to significantly save the communication overhead
   at the same time.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Emerging contaminants (ECs) have drawn attention to many countries due
   to their persistent input and potential threat to human health and the
   environment. This article reviews the current contamination sources and
   their status for surface waters in China. The contamination levels of
   ECs in surface waters are in the range ng L-1 to mu g L-1 in China,
   apparently about the same as the situation in other countries. ECs enter
   surface water via runoff, drainage, rainfall, and wastewater treatment
   effluent. The frequency of occurrence of ECs increased rapidly from 2006
   to 2011; a significant reason is the production and consumption of
   pharmaceuticals and personal care products. As for the distribution of
   EC pollution in China, the frequency of occurrence of ECs in eastern
   regions is higher than in western regions. A majority of EC studies have
   focused on surface waters of the Haihe River and Pearl River watersheds
   due to their highly developed industries and intense human activity.
   Legislative and administrative regulation of ECs is lacking in China. To
   remove ECs, a number of technologies, such as absorption by activated
   carbon, membrane filtration technology, and advanced oxidation
   processes, have been researched.}},

Abstract = {{Multidetector logging-while-drilling (LWD) Sigma was introduced to the
   oil industry to measure neutron absorption cross section (Sigma) and
   radial length of invasion in shallow-invaded formations. Sigma
   quantifies the ability of a material to absorb thermal neutrons and is
   calculated from the late time portion of the time decay of thermal
   neutrons or gamma rays generated from thermal-neutron absorption. The
   assessment of invasion is made possible with the combination of a
   thermal-neutron detector and two gamma-ray detectors with different
   source-detector spacings. However, the interpretation of LWD Sigma logs
   is often affected by several environmental and/or geometric effects that
   can mask the formation response. A fast numerical simulation method
   embedded with inversion-based techniques can be used to estimate
   intrinsic formation Sigma from bore-hole measurements affected by
   shoulder-bed, invasion, and/or environmental effects. We developed a
   fast and accurate method to numerically simulate LWD multidetector
   thermal-neutron and gamma-ray time decays in realistic borehole
   environments. The method relies on Monte Carlo precalculated libraries
   of particle time decays and detector-specific flux sensitivity
   functions, while accounting for detector-specific borehole and diffusion
   effects. Simulations are benchmarked against test-pit measurements and
   Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) transport code calculations. Results
   indicate that multidetector time decays acquired under complex
   geometrical conditions can be numerically simulated in approximately
   1e-5 the time required using MCNP, with average difference within two
   capture units. The simulation of time decays, rather than Sigma itself
   enables a direct relationship between actual rock Sigma and
   multidetector diffusion-affected time decays, thereby removing
   intermediate correction steps often used to convert apparent into
   intrinsic formation Sigma.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication (MC) between a transmitter and a receiver placed
   in the chambers attached to a microfluidic channel is investigated. A
   linear end-to-end channel model is developed capturing the effects of
   the diffusion and the junction transition at the chambers, as well as
   the microfluidic channel shapes and the fluid flow. The spectral density
   of the propagation noise is studied, and the flat frequency bands are
   identified for the chambers and the microfluidic channel. This suggests
   that in certain microfluidic design choices, the spectral density of
   noise may end up naturally being flat. Motivated by this result, the
   additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model is developed based on the
   chamber, the microfluidic channel, and the fluid flow parameters for the
   end-to-end propagation noise. Furthermore, the molecular memory is
   modeled due to inter-diffusion among transmitted molecular signals. The
   effect of the molecular memory on the end-to-end propagation noise is
   also analyzed. To substantiate our analytical results, the ranges of
   physical parameters that yield a linear end-to-end MC channel are
   investigated. These results show the validity of the AWGN model for MC
   over microfluidic channels and characterize the impact of the
   microfluidic channel and chamber geometry on the propagation noise and
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{Visualization of evaporating water films falling over flat horizontal
   tubes, representative of the external surfaces of rectangular
   microchannel tubes, is presented using high-speed video. Experiments
   were conducted with a bank of three tubes at a saturation temperature of
   17 degrees C. In addition to a qualitative description of the flow
   mechanisms, this work quantifies key droplet and wave characteristics
   using a semi-autonomous image analysis technique that develops a
   mathematical description of the droplets and waves. This allows the
   surface area, volume, velocity, and impact frequency of the droplets, as
   well as the width, surface area, and velocity of the waves to be
   measured. It was observed that droplet diameters, surface areas, and
   volumes are smaller than those measured in flow over round tubes, but
   were not influenced significantly by Reynolds number. The observed roll
   waves demonstrated similar surface area growth rates throughout their
   development, with stretched profiles relative to those described in flow
   over round tubes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Mitral valve repair with annulus downsizing is a popular
   surgical procedure for functional mitral regurgitation. We investigated
   the effects of externally applied downsizing on the observed in-plane
   forces and valvular dimensions.
   Methods: Five animals were included in an acute porcine study. Three
   traction sutures were anchored at the right fibrous trigone (T) and
   suspended across the annulus for externalization at the P1, P2, and P3
   annular segments. The annulus was downsized with the sutures in
   controlled increments while measuring the tension force in the sutures.
   Downsizing percentages ranged from a 2\% to 32\% reduction of the T-P
   distances. Sonomicrometry was used to measure the resulting valvular
   dimensions.
   Results: No difference in force was found between the P1, P2, and P3
   segments across all levels of downsizing. The peak forces at 32\%
   downsizing were 1.2 +/- 0.9 N, 1.5 +/- 1.0 N, and 0.8 +/- 0.2 N for the
   T-P1, T-P2, and T-P3 segments, respectively. The maximum total suture
   forces in the mitral plane during downsizing increased from 0.12 +/-
   0.03 N to 3.5 +/- 1.3 N (P<.005). Sonomicrometry showed a decrease in
   the systolic thickening of the posterior myocardial wall at the annular
   level with annular downsizing (0\%-32\%) from 5 +/- 3 mm to 1 +/- 1 mm
   (P<.05).
   Conclusions: Segmental mitral valve annulus downsizing increased
   in-plane traction suture forces and has a significant influence on the
   in-plane biomechanics. These results have implications for device design
   in terms of mechanical strength requirements and can be used to
   supplement boundary conditions for computational left heart models.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Quantum-confined nanostructures are considered `artificial atoms'
   because the wave-functions of their charge carriers resemble those of
   atomic orbitals. For multiple-domain heterostructures, however, carrier
   wavefunctions are more complex and still not well understood. We have
   prepared a unique series of cation-exchanged HgxCd1-xTe quantum dots
   (QDs) and seven epitaxial core-shell QDs and measured their first and
   second exciton peak oscillator strengths as a function of size and
   chemical composition. A major finding is that carrier locations can be
   quantitatively mapped and visualized during shell growth or cation
   exchange simply using absorption transition strengths. These results
   reveal that a broad range of quantum heterostructures with different
   internal structures and band alignments exhibit distinct carrier
   localization patterns that can be used to further improve the
   performance of optoelectronic devices and enhance the brightness of QD
   probes for bioimaging.}},

   general sliced Latin hypercube design with two layers, called doubly

   sampling properties. The more flexible structure of doubly sliced Latin

Abstract = {{KTaO3 (KTO) is a useful prototypical perovskite for examining the
   mechanisms of proton transport in perovskites. Previously, Gomez et al.
   {[}J. Chem. Phys. 126, 194701 (2007)] reported density functional theory
   (DFT) calculations describing proton hopping in defect-free KTO. We use
   DFT calculations to extend that work in two directions, namely,
   understanding isotope effects in low and high temperature proton
   transport and the role of native point defects in KTO. At cryogenic
   temperatures, quantum tunneling plays a vital role in the net hopping of
   protons in KTO. At the elevated temperature characteristic of
   applications involving proton-conducting perovskites, tunneling is
   negligible but zero point energy effects still lead to non-negligible
   isotope effects for H+, D+, and T+. We also use DFT to characterize the
   populations of relevant point defects in KTO as a function of
   experimental conditions, and to examine the migration of protons that
   are close in proximity to these defects. This information gives useful
   insight into the overall transport rates of protons through KTO under a
   variety of external environments. We also assess the overall diffusivity
   of protons in KTO at various ranges of oxygen vacancy concentrations by
   performing kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Naturalistic stimuli evoke highly reliable brain activity across
   viewers. Here we record neural activity from a group of naive
   individuals while viewing popular, previously-broadcast television
   content for which the broad audience response is characterized by social
   media activity and audience ratings. We find that the level of
   inter-subject correlation in the evoked encephalographic responses
   predicts the expressions of interest and preference among thousands.
   Surprisingly, ratings of the larger audience are predicted with greater
   accuracy than those of the individuals from whom the neural data is
   obtained. An additional functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   employing a separate sample of subjects shows that the level of neural
   reliability evoked by these stimuli covaries with the amount of
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation in higher-order
   visual and auditory regions. Our findings suggest that stimuli which we
   judge favourably may be those to which our brains respond in a
   stereotypical manner shared by our peers.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in neuroscience have been closely linked to mathematical
   modeling beginning with the integrate-and-fire model of Lapicque and
   proceeding through the modeling of the action potential by Hodgkin and
   Huxley to the current era. The fundamental building block of the central
   nervous system, the neuron, may be thought of as a dynamic element that
   is ``excitable{''}, and can generate a pulse or spike whenever the
   electrochemical potential across the cell membrane of the neuron exceeds
   a threshold. A key application of nonlinear dynamical systems theory to
   the neurosciences is to study phenomena of the central nervous system
   that exhibit nearly discontinuous transitions between macroscopic
   states. A very challenging and clinically important problem exhibiting
   this phenomenon is the induction of general anesthesia. In any specific
   patient, the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness as the
   concentration of anesthetic drugs increases is very sharp, resembling a
   thermodynamic phase transition. This paper focuses on multistability
   theory for continuous and discontinuous dynamical systems having a set
   of multiple isolated equilibria and/or a continuum of equilibria.
   Multistability is the property whereby the solutions of a dynamical
   system can alternate between two or more mutually exclusive Lyapunov
   stable and convergent equilibrium states under asymptotically slowly
   changing inputs or system parameters. In this paper, we extend the
   theory of multistability to continuous, discontinuous, and stochastic
   nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, Lyapunov-based tests for
   multistability and synchronization of dynamical systems with
   continuously differentiable and absolutely continuous flows are
   established. The results are then applied to excitatory and inhibitory
   biological neuronal networks to explain the underlying mechanism of
   action for anesthesia and consciousness from a multistable dynamical
   system perspective, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for
   general anesthesia using the network properties of the brain. Finally,
   we present some key emergent properties from the fields of
   thermodynamics and electromagnetic field theory to qualitatively explain
   the underlying neuronal mechanisms of action for anesthesia and
   consciousness.}},

Abstract = {{Data Gathering is a fundamental task in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).
   Data gathering trees capable of performing aggregation operations are
   also referred to as Data Aggregation Trees (DATs). Currently, most of
   the existing works focus on constructing DATs according to different
   user requirements under the Deterministic Network Model (DNM). However,
   due to the existence of many probabilistic lossy links in WSNs, it is
   more practical to obtain a DAT under the realistic Probabilistic Network
   Model (PNM). Moreover, the load-balance factor is neglected when
   constructing DATs in current literatures. Therefore, in this paper, we
   focus on constructing a Load-Balanced Data Aggregation Tree (LBDAT)
   under the PNM. More specifically, three problems are investigated,
   namely, the Load-Balanced Maximal Independent Set (LBMIS) problem, the
   Connected Maximal Independent Set (CMIS) problem, and the LBDAT
   construction problem. LBMIS and CMIS are well-known NP-hard problems and
   LBDAT is an NP-complete problem. Consequently, approximation algorithms
   and comprehensive theoretical analysis of the approximation factors are
   presented in the paper. Finally, our simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithms outperform the existing state-of-the-art approaches
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{A cellular down-link polarization division multiple access (PDMA) scheme
   with collaborative transmitter-receiver-polarization adjustment and
   polarization filtering detection is proposed for polarized wide-band
   non-line-of-sight (NLoS) wireless fading channels. The fundamental
   novelty of the proposed scheme is that it can adjust transmit
   polarization to yield more desirable per-subcarrier complex
   cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) observed at the receivers. This
   is a significant difference between the proposed scheme and conventional
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The capacity analysis of
   the proposed PDMA scheme is provided, and the feasibility and
   satisfactory performance of the scheme are demonstrated even when
   serious time-variant channel depolarization and polarization mismatch
   between receivers occurs. The proposed cellular down-link PDMA scheme
   uses synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
   with an equally spaced pilot symbol allocation and a channel estimator.
   Excellent symbol error rate (SER)/effective signal-to-interference plus
   noise ratio (SINR) performance is shown despite the presence of
   substantial channel depolarization. The scheme can be used to extend the
   capacity of any cellular system that uses uni-polarized antennas and can
   be extended and applied to MIMO arrays as well.}},

Title = {{Associations between Perceptions of Drinking Water Service Delivery and
   Measured Drinking Water Quality in Rural Alabama}},

Abstract = {{Although small, rural water supplies may present elevated microbial
   risks to consumers in some settings, characterizing exposures through
   representative point-of-consumption sampling is logistically
   challenging. In order to evaluate the usefulness of consumer
   self-reported data in predicting measured water quality and risk factors
   for contamination, we compared matched consumer interview data with
   point-of-survey, household water quality and pressure data for 910
   households served by 14 small water systems in rural Alabama.
   Participating households completed one survey that included detailed
   feedback on two key areas of water service conditions: delivery
   conditions (intermittent service and low water pressure) and general
   aesthetic characteristics (taste, odor and color), providing five
   condition values. Microbial water samples were taken at the point-of-use
   (from kitchen faucets) and as-delivered from the distribution network
   (from outside flame-sterilized taps, if available), where pressure was
   also measured. Water samples were analyzed for free and total chlorine,
   pH, turbidity, and presence of total coliforms and Escherichia coli. Of
   the 910 households surveyed, 35\% of participants reported experiencing
   low water pressure, 15\% reported intermittent service, and almost 20\%
   reported aesthetic problems (taste, odor or color). Consumer-reported
   low pressure was associated with lower gauge-measured pressure at taps.
   While total coliforms (TC) were detected in 17\% of outside tap samples
   and 12\% of samples from kitchen faucets, no reported water service
   conditions or aesthetic characteristics were associated with presence of
   TC. We conclude that consumer-reported data were of limited utility in
   predicting potential microbial risks associated with small water
   supplies in this setting, although consumer feedback on low pressure-a
   risk factor for contamination-may be relatively reliable and therefore
   useful in future monitoring efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The applications of a single-layer triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   may be challenged by its lower output current, and a possible solution
   is to use three-dimensional (3D) integrated multilayered TENGs. However,
   the most important point is to synchronize the outputs of all the TENGs
   so that the instantaneous output power can be maximized. Here, a
   multi-layered stacked TENG is reported as a cost-effective, simple, and
   robust approach for harvesting ambient vibration energy. With superior
   synchronization, the 3D-TENG produces a short-circuit current as high as
   1.14 mA, and an open-circuit voltage up to 303 V with a remarkable peak
   power density of 104.6 W m(-2). As a direct power source, it is capable
   of simultaneously lighting up 20 spot lights (0.6 W ea.) as well as a
   white G16 globe light. Furthermore, compared with the state-of-the-art
   vibration energy harvesters, the 3D-TENG has an extremely wide working
   bandwidth up to 36 Hz in low frequency range. In addition, with specific
   dimensional design, the 3D-TENG is successfully equipped inside a ball
   with a diameter of 3 inches, using which 32 commercial LEDs are
   simultaneously lighted up via hand shaking, exhibiting great potential
   of scavenging the abundant but wasted kinetic energy when people play
   basketball, football, baseball, and so on.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been demonstrated as an
   effective way to harvest mechanical energy to drive small electronics.
   The density of triboelectric charges generated on contact surfaces
   between two distinct materials is a critical factor for dictating the
   output power. We demonstrate an approach to effectively tune the
   triboelectric properties of materials by taking advantage of the dipole
   moment in polarized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), leading to
   substantial enhancement of the output power density of the TENG. The
   output voltage ranged from 72 V to 215 V under a constant contact force
   of 50 N. This work not only provides a new method of enhancing output
   power of TENGs, but also offers an insight into charge transfer in
   contact electrification by investigating dipole-moment-induced effects
   on the electrical output of TENGs.}},

Abstract = {{A ZnO micro/nanowire has been utilized to fabricate Schottky-contacted
   humidity sensors based on a metal-semiconductor-metal (M-S-M) structure.
   By means of the piezotronic effect, the signal level, sensitivity and
   sensing resolution of the humidity sensor were significantly enhanced
   when applying an external strain. Since a higher Schottky barrier
   markedly reduces the signal level, while a lower Schottky barrier
   decreases the sensor sensitivity due to increased ohmic transport, a
   0.22\% compressive strain was found to optimize the performance of the
   humidity sensor, with the largest responsivity being 1,240\%. The
   physical mechanism behind the observed mechanical-electrical behavior
   was carefully studied by using band structure diagrams. This work
   provides a promising way to significantly enhance the overall
   performance of a Schottky-contact structured micro/nanowire sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a highly specific anticancer treatment
   modality for various cancers, particularly for recurrent cancers that no
   longer respond to conventional anticancer therapies. PDT has been under
   development for decades, but light-associated toxicity limits its
   clinical applications. To reduce the toxicity of PDT, we recently
   developed a targeted nanoparticle (NP) platform that combines a
   second-generation PDT drug, Pc 4, with a cancer targeting ligand, and
   iron oxide (IO) NPs. Carboxyl functionalized IO NPs were first
   conjugated with a fibronectin-mimetic peptide (Fmp), which binds
   integrin beta 1. Then the PDT drug Pc 4 was successfully encapsulated
   into the ligand-conjugated IO NPs to generate Fmp-IO-Pc 4. Our study
   indicated that both nontargeted IO-Pc 4 and targeted Fmp-IO-Pc 4 NPs
   accumulated in xenograft tumors with higher concentrations than
   nonfomiulated Pc 4. As expected, both IO-Pc 4 and Fmp-IO-Pc 4 reduced
   the size of HNSCC xenograft tumors more effectively than free Pc 4.
   Using a 10-fold lower dose of Pc 4 than that reported in the literature,
   the targeted Fmp-IO-Pc 4 NPs demonstrated significantly greater
   inhibition of tumor growth than nontargeted IO-Pc 4 NPs. These results
   suggest that the delivery of a PDT agent Pc 4 by IO NPs can enhance
   treatment efficacy and reduce PDT drug dose. The targeted IO-Pc 4 NPs
   have great potential to serve as both a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   agent and PDT drug in the clinic.}},

   changes in the electronic and structural properties of hollow-structured
   Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) during lithiation and delithiation using
   electrochemical Co3O4 transistor devices that function as a Co3O4 U-ion
   battery. Additive-free Co3O4 NPs were assembled into a U-ion battery,
   allowing us to isolate and explore the effects of the Co and Li2O
   formation/decomposition conversion reactions on the electrical and
   structural degradation within Co3O4 NP films. NP films ranging between a
   single monolayer and multilayered film hundreds of nanometers thick
   prepared with blade-coating and electrophoretic deposition methods,
   respectively, were embedded in the transistor devices for in situ
   conduction measurements as a function of battery cycles. During battery
   operation, the electronic and structural properties of Co3O4 NP films in
   the bulk, Co3O4/electrolyte, and Co3O4/current collector interfaces were
   spatially mapped to address the origin of the initial irreversible
   capacity loss from the first lithiation process. further, change in

Abstract = {{Focused electron-beam-induced deposition (FEBID) is a promising
   nanolithography technique using ``direct-write{''} patterning by carbon
   line and dot deposits on graphene. Understanding interactions between
   deposited carbon molecules and graphene enables highly localized
   modification of graphene properties, which is foundational to the FEBID
   utility as a nanopatterning tool. In this study, we demonstrate a unique
   possibility to induce dramatically different adsorption states of
   FEBID-produced carton deposits on graphene, through density functional
   theory calculations and complementary Raman experiments. Specifically,
   an amorphous carbon deposit formed by direct irradiation of high energy
   primary electrons exhibits unusually strong interactions with graphene
   via covalent bonding, whereas the FEBID carbon formed due to low-energy
   secondary electrons is only weakly interacting with graphene via
   physisorption. These observations not only are of fundamental importance
   to basic physical chemistry of FEBID carbon graphene interactions but
   also enable the use of selective laser-assisted postdeposition ablation
   to effectively remove the parasitically deposited, physisorbed carbon
   films for improving FEBID patterning resolution.}},

Title = {{Polyol Syntheses of Palladium Decahedra and Icosahedra as Pure Samples

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This article reports a robust method based upon polyol reduction for the
   deterministic synthesis of Pd decahedra or Icosahedra with tunable sizes
   and a purity approaching 100\%. The success of such a selective
   synthesis relies on an ability to fine-tune the reaction kinetics
   through the addition of Na-2-SO4 and Ha for decahedra and icosahedra,
   respectively. In the absence of any additive, the product of a similar
   synthesis in diethylene glycol contained 10\% decahedra and 90\%
   icosahedra. By optimizing the amount of Na2SO4 (or HCI) added into the
   reaction solution, the percent of decahedra (or icosahedra) in the
   product could be Increased up to 100\%. The roles of Na2SO4 and Ha were
   also investigated in great detail, and two plausible mechanisms were
   proposed and validated through a set of experiments. In general, a
   faster reduction rate is needed for the synthesis of Pd decahedra when
   compared with what is needed for Pd icosahedra. This work not only
   offers a simple approach to the deterministic syntheses of Pd decahedra
   and icosahedra but also provides an in-depth understanding of the
   mechanisms involved in shape-controlled syntheses of noble-metal
   nanocrystals from the perspective of reaction kinetics. On the basis of
   the mechanistic understanding, we have also achieved successful
   synthesis of Pd decahedra as pure samples by adding a proper amount of
   NaOH into the system to speed up the reduction kinetics.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{We invented a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that is based on a
   wavy-structured Cu-Kapton-Cu film sandwiched between two fiat
   nanostructured PTFE films for harvesting energy due to mechanical
   vibration/impacting/compressing using the triboelectrification effect.
   This structure design allows the TENG to be self-restorable after impact
   without the use of extra springs and converts direct impact into lateral
   sliding, which is proved to be a much more efficient friction mode for
   energy harvesting. The working mechanism has been elaborated using the
   capacitor model and finite-element simulation. Vibrational energy from 5
   to 500 Hz has been harvested, and the generator's resonance frequency
   was determined to be similar to 100 Hz at a broad full width at
   half-maximum of over 100 Hz, producing an open-circuit voltage of up to
   72 V. a short-circuit current of up to 32 mu A, and a peak power density
   of 0.4 W/m(2). Most importantly, the wavy structure of the TENG can be
   easily packaged for harvesting the impact energy from water waves,
   clearly establishing the principle for ocean wave energy harvesting.
   Considering the advantages of TENGs, such as cost-effectiveness, light
   weight, and easy scalability, this approach might open the possibility
   for obtaining green and sustainable energy from the ocean using
   nanostructured materials. Lastly, different ways of agitating water were
   studied to trigger the packaged TENG. By analyzing the output signals
   and their corresponding fast Fourier transform spectra, three ways of
   agitation were evidently distinguished from each other, demonstrating
   the potential of the TENG for hydrological analysis.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The recently introduced triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and the
   traditional electromagnetic induction generator (EMIG) are coherently
   integrated in one structure for energy harvesting and vibration
   sensing/isolation. The suspended structure is based on two oppositely
   oriented magnets that are enclosed by hollow cubes surrounded with
   coils, which oscillates in response to external disturbance and harvests
   mechanical energy simultaneously from triboelectrification and
   electromagnetic induction. It extends the previous definition of hybrid
   cell to harvest the same type of energy with multiple approaches. Both
   the sliding-mode TENG and contact-mode TENG can be achieved in the same
   structure. In order to make the TENG and EMIG work together,
   transformers are used to match the output impedance between these two
   power sources with very different characteristics. The maximum output
   power of 7.7 and 1.9 mW on the same load of 5 K Omega was obtained for
   the TENG and EMIG, respectively, after impedance matching. Benefiting
   from the rational design, the output signal from the TENG and the EMIG
   are in phase. They can be added up directly to get an output voltage of
   4.6 V and an output current of 2.2 mA in parallel connection. A power
   management circuit was connected to the hybrid cell, and a regulated
   voltage of 3.3 V with constant current was achieved. For the first time,
   a logic operation was carried out on a half-adder circuit by using the
   hybrid cell working as both the power source and the input digit
   signals. We also demonstrated that the hybrid cell can serve as a
   vibration isolator. Further applications as vibration dampers, triggers,
   and sensors are all promising.}},

Abstract = {{The physical nature (e.g. crystal size or surface atomic arrangement) of
   an electrocatalyst is central to the performance of electrochemical
   devices such as fuel cells and lithium-air batteries. This is
   particularly true in electrodes for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and
   oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involve multiple elementary steps
   and a substantial energy barrier. As a result, OER and ORR generally are
   rate-limiting step in electrode reactions. Here, we show Au nanocrystals
   enclosed by high-index facets (e.g. (310)) are more energetically and
   kinetically favorable than (111) facets for oxygen reduction in both
   lithium-air battery and fuel cell conditions. In both systems, the
   electric potential for oxygen reduction was reduced by 60-160 mV and the
   current increases by more than five times if high-index Au nanocrystals
   were utilized. These Au nanocrystals were synthesized at a temperature
   greater than the boiling point of ethylene glycol, the solvent used in
   this work. This synthetic approach opens a new reproducible route to
   synthesize nanocrystals with high-index facets because it is facile,
   rapid, and results in a large-quantity of nanocrystals with control over
   the size and morphology. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The conceptual design of the subcritical advanced burner reactor (SABR),
   a 3000-MW(thermal) annular, modular sodium pool-type fast reactor,
   fueled by metallic transuranic (TRU) fuel processed from discharged
   light water reactor fuel and driven by a tokamak D-T fusion neutron
   source based on ITER physics and technology, has been substantially
   upgraded. Several issues related to the integration of fission and
   fusion technologies have been addressed, e.g., refueling a modular
   sodium pool reactor located within the magnetic coil configuration of a
   tokamak, achieving long-burn quasi-steady-state plasma operation, access
   for heating and current drive power transmission to a toroidal plasma
   surrounded by a sodium pool fast reactor, suppression of
   magnetohydrodynamic effects in a liquid metal coolant flowing in a
   magnetic field, tritium self-sufficiency in a TRU transmutation reactor,
   shielding the superconducting magnets from fusion and fission neutrons,
   etc. A design concept for a SABR that could be deployed within 25 years,
   based on the IFR/PRISM metal-fuel, sodium pool fast reactor technology
   and on the TIER fusion physics and technology, is presented. This design
   concept can be used for realistic fuel cycle, dynamic safety, and other
   performance analyses of a SABR.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The volumetric heating values of today's biofuels are too low to power
   energy-intensive aircraft, rockets, and missiles. Recently, pinene
   dimers were shown to have a volumetric heating value similar to that of
   the tactical fuel JP-10. To provide a sustainable source of pinene, we
   engineered Escherichia coli for pinene production. We combinatorially
   expressed three pinene synthases (PS) and three geranyl diphosphate
   synthases (GPPS), with the best combination achieving similar to 28 mg/L
   of pinene. We speculated that pinene toxicity was limiting production;
   however, toxicity should not be limiting at current titers. Because GAPS
   is inhibited by geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and to increase flux through
   the pathway, we combinatorially constructed GPPS-PS protein fusions. The
   Abies grandis GPPS-PS fusion produced 32 mg/L of pinene, a 6-fold
   improvement over the highest titer previously reported in engineered E.
   coli. Finally, we investigated the pinene isomer ratio of our
   pinene-producing microbe and discovered that the isomer profile is
   determined not only by the identity of the PS used but also by the
   identity of the GPPS with which the PS is paired. We demonstrated that
   the GPP concentration available to PS for cyclization alters the pinene
   isomer ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve injuries cause severe disability with decreased nerve
   function often followed by neuropathic pain that impacts the quality of
   life. Even though use of autografts is the current gold standard, nerve
   conduits fabricated from electrospun nanofibers have shown promise to
   successfully bridge critical length nerve gaps. However, in depth
   analysis of the role of topographical cues in the context of
   spatio-temporal progression of the regenerative sequence has not been
   elucidated. Here, we explored the influence of topographical cues
   (aligned, random, and smooth films) on the regenerative sequence and
   potential to successfully support nerve regeneration in critical size
   gaps. A number of key findings emerged at the cellular, cytokine and
   molecular levels from the study. Higher quantities of IL-1 alpha and
   TNF-alpha were detected in aligned fiber based scaffolds. Differential
   gene expression of BDNF, NGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 were observed suggesting
   a role for these genes in influencing Schwann cell migration,
   myelination, etc. that impact the regeneration in various topographies.
   Fibrin matrix stabilization and arrest of nerve-innervated muscle
   atrophy was also evident. Taken together, our data shed light on the
   cascade of events that favor regeneration in aligned topography and
   should stimulate research to further refine the strategy of nerve
   regeneration using topographical cues.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrated that ultralight pure natural aerogel microspheres can be
   fabricated using cellulose nanofibrials (CNF) directly. Experimentally,
   the CNF aqueous gel droplets, produced by spraying and atomizing through
   a steel nozzle, were collected into liquid nitrogen for instant freezing
   followed by freeze-drying. The aerogel microspheres are highly porous
   with bulk density as low as 0.0018 g cm(-3). The pore size of the
   cellulose aeogel microspheres ranges from nano- to macrometers. The
   unique ultralight and high porous structure ensured high moisture
   (similar to 90 g g(-1)) and water uptake capacity (similar to 400 g
   g(-1)) of the aerogel microspheres. Covalent cross-linking between the
   native nanofibrils and cross-linkers made the aerogel microspheres very
   stable even in a harsh environment. The present study also confirmed
   this kind of aerogel microspheres from native cellulose fibers can be
   used as cell culture scaffold.}},

Abstract = {{A high refractive index (RI) and transparent encapsulant material is in
   great demand for light emitting diode (LED) packaging to lower the RI
   contrasts between a LED chip and an encapsulant, and therefore improve
   the light extraction efficiency. In this paper, we prepared
   TiO2/silicone nanocomposites and studied the effects of the crystalline
   phases of TiO2, and the TiO2 surface modifications on their optical
   properties. The rutile TiO2 was found to be more effective to increase
   the RI of the nanocomposite than the anatase phase TiO2. At a 5 wt.\%
   loading of TiO2, the RI was as high as 1.62 at the wavelength of 589 nm,
   which represents a significant improvement from 1.54 for silicone resin.
   In addition, surface modification was carried out using vinyl-terminated
   silane to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles in a silicone matrix,
   leading to a high relative transmittance of 84\%. We also demonstrated

Abstract = {{Through-silicon via (TSV) technology is a key enabler for 3-D and 2.5-D
   integration, which provides low-power and high-bandwidth chip-to-chip
   communication. During TSV fabrication, over-etching may cause notching
   at the base of the TSVs, resulting in TSV diameter variations. Endpoint
   detection (EPD) techniques are critical for controlling TSV diameter,
   and detecting the endpoint for low open areas presents a serious
   challenge to process engineers. In this paper, a hybrid partial least
   squares-support vector machine model for optical emission spectroscopy
   data are successfully demonstrated for an EPD of low open area TSVs.
   Accurate EPD results are shown for 120, 80, and 25 m diameter TSVs.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial biocatalysts capable of cellobiose assimilation are of
   interest in bioconversion of cellulosic materials. This study provides a
   careful comparison in the two mechanisms of cellobiose assimilation,
   hydrolysis versus phosphorolysis, between two otherwise isogenic E. coli
   strains. Relative to cells assimilating cellobiose hydrolytically,
   phosphorolysis cells tolerated common inhibitors better under both
   anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Additionally, phosphorolysis cells
   were able to direct the favorable energy metabolism to recombinant
   protein production, resulting in up to five fold more recombinant
   proteins. In a mixed sugar fermentation (5\% (w/v) cellobiose +5.0\%
   (w/v) xylose), however, xylose utilization in phosphorolysis cells came
   to a complete halt after only about 60\% consumption whereas the
   hydrolysis cells were able to ferment both sugars to near completion.
   These results provide insights into the new metabolic engineering
   strategy. To our best knowledge, this is the first comparison study in
   E. coli on the two cellobiose assimilation mechanisms. (C) 2014

Title = {{Spatial modulation of key pathway enzymes by DNA-guided scaffold system

   production by Bacillus subtilis}},
Journal = {{METABOLIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Previously we constructed a Bacillus subtilis strain for efficient
   production of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by engineering of GlcNAc
   synthetic and catabolic pathways. However, the further improvement of
   GlcNAc titer is limited by the intrinsic inefficiency of GlcNAc
   synthetic pathway and undesirable cellular properties including
   sporulation and high maintenance metabolism. In this work, we further
   improved GlcNAc titer through spatial modulation of key pathway enzymes
   and by blocking sporulation and decreasing maintenance metabolism.
   Specifically, a DNA-guided scaffold system was firstly used to modulate
   the activities of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase and GlNAc-6-phosphate
   N-acetyltransferase, increasing the GlcNAc titer from 1.83 g/L to 455
   g/L in a shake flask Next, sporulation was blocked by respectively
   deleting spo0A (gene encoding the initiation regulon of sporulation) and
   sigE (gene encoding RNA polymerase sporulation-specific sigma factor).
   Deletion of sigE more effectively blocked sporulation without altering
   cell growth or GlcNAc production. The respiration chain was then
   engineered to decrease the maintenance metabolism of recombinant B.
   subtilis by deleting cydB and cydC, genes encoding cytochrome bd
   ubiquinol oxidase (subunit II) and ATP-binding protein for the
   expression of cytochrome bd, respectively. The respiration-engineered B.
   subtilis produced 6.15 g/L GlcNAc in a shake flask and 2058 a GlcNAc in
   a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor. To the best of our knowledge, this report is
   the first to describe the modulation of pathway enzymes via a DNA-guided
   scaffold system in B. subtilis. The combination of spatial modulation of
   key pathway enzymes and optimization of cellular properties may be used
   to develop B. subtilis as a well-oiganized cell factory for the
   production of the other industrially useful chemicals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Droplet reactors have received considerable attention in recent years as
   an alternative route to the synthesis and potentially high-volume
   production of colloidal metal nanocrystals. Interfacial adsorption will
   immediately become an important issue to address when one seeks to
   translate a nanocrystal synthesis from batch reactors to droplet
   reactors due to the involvement of higher surface-to-volume ratios for
   the droplets and the fact that nanocrystals tend to be concentrated at
   the water-oil interface. Here we report a systematic study to compare
   the pros and cons of interfacial adsorption of metal nanocrystals during
   their synthesis in droplet reactors. On the one hand, interfacial
   adsorption can be used to generate nanocrystals with asymmetric shapes
   or structures, including one-sixth-truncated Ag octahedra and Au-Ag
   nanocups. On the other hand, interfacial adsorption has to be mitigated
   to obtain nanocrystals with uniform sizes and controlled shapes. We
   confirmed that Triton X-100, a nonionic surfactant, could effectively
   alleviate interfacial adsorption while imposing no impact on the capping
   agent typically needed for a shape-controlled synthesis. With the
   introduction of a proper surfactant, droplet reactors offer an
   attractive platform for the continuous production of colloidal metal
   nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless NanoSensor Networks (WNSNs) will allow novel intelligent
   nanomaterial-based sensors, or nanosensors, to detect new types of
   events at the nanoscale in a distributed fashion over extended areas.
   Two main characteristics are expected to guide the design of WNSNs
   architectures and protocols, namely, their Terahertz Band wireless
   communication and their nanoscale energy harvesting process. In this
   paper, a routing framework for WNSNs is proposed to optimize the use of
   the harvested energy to guarantee the perpetual operation of the WNSN
   while, at the same time, increasing the overall network throughput. The
   proposed routing framework, which is based on a previously proposed
   medium access control protocol for the joint throughput and lifetime
   optimization in WNSNs, uses a hierarchical cluster-based architecture
   that offloads the network operation complexity from the individual
   nanosensors towards the cluster heads, or nano-controllers. This
   framework is based on the evaluation of the probability of saving energy
   through a multi-hop transmission, the tuning of the transmission power
   of each nanosensor for throughput and hop distance optimization, and the
   selection of the next hop nanosensor on the basis of their available
   energy and current load. The performance of this framework is also
   numerically evaluated in terms of energy, capacity, and delay, and
   compared to that of the single-hop communication for the same WNSN
   scenario. The results show how the energy per bit consumption and the
   achievable throughput can be jointly maximized by exploiting the
   peculiarities of this networking paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{By combining interference lithography and projection photolithography
   concurrently, pattern-integrated interference lithography (PIIL) enables
   the wafer-scale, rapid, and single-exposure fabrication of
   multidimensional periodic microstructures that integrate arbitrary
   functional elements. To date, two-dimensional PIIL has been simulated
   and experimentally demonstrated. In this paper, we report new simulated
   results of PIIL exposures for various custom-modified three-dimensional
   (3D) periodic structures. These results were generated using custom PIIL
   comprehensive vector modeling. Simulations include mask-integrated and
   mask-shaped 3D periodic arrangements as well as microcavities on top of
   or fully embedded within 3D periodic structures. These results indicate
   PIIL is a viable method for making versatile 3D periodic
   microstructures. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Nano-enabled drug delivery (NEDD) systems are rapidly emerging as a key
   area for nanotechnology application. Understanding the status and
   developmental prospects of this area around the world is important to
   determine research priorities, and to evaluate and direct progress.
   Global research publication and patent databases provide a reservoir of
   information that can be tapped to provide intelligence for such needs.
   Here, we present a process to allow for extraction of NEDD-related
   information from these databases by involving topical experts. This
   process incorporates in-depth analysis of NEDD literature review papers
   to identify key subsystems and major topics. We then use these to
   structure global analysis of NEDD research topical trends and
   collaborative patterns, inform future innovation directions.
   From the Clinical Editor: This paper describes the process of how to
   derive nano-enabled drug delivery-related information from global
   research and patent databases in an effort to perform comprehensive
   global analysis of research trends and directions, along with
   collaborative patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To quantify the impact of organic carbon on the complex dielectric
   permittivity of organoclays, nine organically modified clays were
   synthesized with controlled organic carbon structure and density of
   loading. Resonance polarization responses were observed for six of the
   organoclays at resonant frequencies from 0.74 to 1.37 GHz; however,
   organoclays synthesized with the smallest organic cations did not
   exhibit resonant frequency. A structural model of water molecules near
   the surface of organoclay and in the diffuse layer was proposed, which
   consists of a surface-bound water layer, an organic cation-interactive
   zone, and bulk water. The Cole-Cole equation was used to fit the
   resonance response. Increasing the density of loading (30\% to 100\% of
   the cation exchange capacity of the base clay) on the clay surface led
   to a reduction in the resonance time of the clay, while increasing the
   size of the organic cation led to a longer dielectric resonance time for
   the clay, which indicates that altering the structure and density of the
   organic carbon phase changed the degree of constraint of water molecules
   within the clay's interlayer. However, the impact of organic carbon
   content on real permittivity was not significant. Water content had no
   obvious effect on the resonant frequency of the organoclays at high
   water content (porosity ranging from 0.7 to 1.0) in this study. In
   addition, it was shown that a linear approximation was sufficient in
   relating real permittivity of organoclay suspensions to porosity, and
   the effective conductivity decreased linearly proportional to porosity.
   That is, the real permittivity and effective conductivity were dominated
   by that of the aqueous phase until the inception of resonance
   polarization.}},

Abstract = {{In atherosclerosis, plaques preferentially develop in arterial regions
   of disturbed blood flow (d-flow), which alters endothelial gene
   expression and function. Here, we determined that d-flow regulates
   genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in a DNA
   methyltransferase-dependent (DNMT-dependent) manner. Induction of d-flow
   by partial carotid ligation surgery in a murine model induced DNMT1 in
   arterial endothelium. In cultured endothelial cells, DNMT1 was enhanced
   by oscillatory shear stress (OS), and reduction of DNMT with either the
   inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza) or siRNA markedly reduced
   OS-induced endothelial inflammation. Moreover, administration of 5Aza
   reduced lesion formation in 2 mouse models of atherosclerosis. Using
   both reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and microarray,
   we determined that d-flow in the carotid artery resulted in
   hypermethylation within the promoters of 11 mechanosensitive genes and
   that 5Aza treatment restored normal methylation patterns. Of the
   identified genes, HoxA5 and Klf3 encode transcription factors that
   contain cAMP response elements, suggesting that the methylation status
   of these loci could serve as a mechanosensitive master switch in gene
   expression. Together, our results demonstrate that d-flow controls
   epigenomic DNA methylation patterns in a DNMT-dependent manner, which in
   turn alters endothelial gene expression and induces atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Large quantities of graphene sheets, carbon nanotubes, and ultra-long
   carbon nanowires can be selectively fabricated at a high rate in ethanol
   by catalytic chemical liquid deposition under atmospheric pressure at
   room temperature. Synthesis of the carbon nanostructures can be achieved
   through the following procedural changes: (a) by manipulating the H2O
   content, carbon nanostructures can be tailored from carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) with various inner diameters to carbon nanowires (CNWs). (b) By
   adding an organic precursor containing S, graphene can be selectively
   fabricated. The simplicity and scalability of our method provides a high
   potential for mass growth, and the inherent cleanliness of the procedure
   offers a perfect starting point for straightforward, contamination-free
   synthetic processes without the use of expensive equipment. We also
   provide clear pictures of the growth process of these materials, where
   the pressure difference across the graphene surface results in the
   formation of bubbles that leads to the growth of CNTs, CNWs, or

Abstract = {{Cultivated citrus are selections from, or hybrids of, wild progenitor
   species whose identities and contributions to citrus domestication
   remain controversial. Here we sequence and compare citrus genomes-a
   high-quality reference haploid clementine genome and mandarin, pummelo,
   sweet-orange and sour-orange genomes- and show that cultivated types
   derive from two progenitor species. Although cultivated pummelos
   represent selections from one progenitor species, Citrus maxima,
   cultivated mandarins are introgressions of C. maxima into the ancestral
   mandarin species Citrus reticulata. The most widely cultivated citrus,
   sweet orange, is the offspring of previously admixed individuals, but
   sour orange is an F1 hybrid of pure C. maxima and C. reticulata parents,
   thus implying that wild mandarins were part of the early breeding
   germplasm. A Chinese wild `mandarin' diverges substantially from C.
   reticulata, thus suggesting the possibility of other unrecognized wild
   citrus species. Understanding citrus phylogeny through genome analysis
   clarifies taxonomic relationships and facilitates sequence-directed
   genetic improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterial-associated infection is one of the most common complications
   related to the implantation of any biomedical device. Several in vivo
   imaging platforms have emerged as powerful diagnostic tools to
   longitudinally monitor biomaterial-associated infections in small animal
   models. In this study, we directly compared two imaging approaches:
   bacteria engineered to produce luciferase to generate bioluminescence
   and reactive oxygen species (ROS) imaging of the inflammatory response
   associated with the infected implant. We performed longitudinal imaging
   of bioluminescence associated with bacteria strains expressing
   plasmid-integrated luciferase driven by different promoters or a strain
   with the luciferase gene integrated into the chromosome. These
   luminescent strains provided an adequate signal for acute (0-4 days)
   monitoring of the infection, but the bioluminescence signal decreased
   over time and leveled off at 7 days post-implantation. This loss in the
   bioluminescence signal was attributed to changes in the metabolic
   activity of the bacteria. In contrast, near-infrared fluorescence
   imaging of ROS associated with inflammation to the implant provided
   sensitive and dose-dependent signals of biomaterial-associated bacteria.
   ROS imaging exhibited higher sensitivity than the bioluminescence
   imaging and was independent of the bacteria strain. Near-infrared
   fluorescence imaging of inflammatory responses represents a powerful
   alternative to bioluminescence imaging for monitoring
   biomaterial-associated bacterial infections. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Purpose. To demonstrate the first use of a novel technology for
   quantifying suture forces on annuloplasty rings to better understand the
   mechanisms of ring dehiscence.
   Description. Force transducers were developed, attached to a size 24
   Physio ring, and implanted in the mitral annulus of an ovine animal.
   Ring suture forces were measured after implantation and for cardiac
   cycles reaching peak left ventricular pressures (LVP) of 100, 125, and
   150 mm Hg.
   Evaluation. After implantation of the undersized ring to the flaccid
   annulus, the mean suture force was 2.0 +/- 0.6 N. During cyclic
   contraction, the anterior ring suture forces were greater than the
   posterior ring suture forces at peak LVPs of 100 mm Hg (4.9 +/- 2.0 N vs
   2.1 +/- 1.1 N), 125 mm Hg (5.4 +/- 2.3 N vs 2.3 +/- 1.2 N), and 150 mm
   Hg (5.7 +/- 2.4 N vs 2.4 +/- 1.1 N). The largest force was 7.4 N at 150
   mm Hg.
   Conclusions. The preliminary results demonstrate trends in annuloplasty
   suture forces and their variation with location and LVP. Future studies
   will significantly contribute to clinical knowledge by elucidating the
   mechanisms of ring dehiscence while improving annuloplasty ring design
   and surgical repair techniques. (C) 2014 by The Society of Thoracic

Title = {{Effects of Wheelchair Cushions and Pressure Relief Maneuvers on Ischial
   Interface Pressure and Blood Flow in People With Spinal Cord Injury}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and interactions of 2
   methods of pressure ulcer prevention, wheelchair cushions and pressure
   relief maneuvers, on interface pressure (IF) and blood flow of the
   buttocks.
   Design: Within-subject repeated measures.
   Setting: Rehabilitation center.
   Participants: Wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury or disorder
   (N=17).
   Interventions: Participants performed 3 forward leans and 2 sideward
   leans with different degrees of lean while seated on each of 3 different
   wheelchair cushions.
   Main Outcome Measures: IP measured with a custom sensor and blood flow
   measured with laser Doppler flowmetry were collected at the ischial
   tuberosity.
   Results: Pressure relief maneuvers had a significant main effect on the
   ischial IP (P<.001); all maneuvers except for the small frontward lean
   resulted in a significant reduction in IF compared with upright sitting.
   Blood flow significantly varied across postures (P<.001) with flow
   during upright sitting and small forward leans being significantly lower
   than during the full and intermediate leans in both the forward and
   sideward directions.
   Conclusions: The results of the study highlight the importance of
   positioning wheelchair users in a manner that facilitates in-seat
   movement. Regardless of the cushion being used, the pressure relief
   maneuvers resulted in very large reductions in IPs and significant
   increases in buttock blood flow. Only the small frontward lean was shown
   to be ineffective in reducing pressure or increasing blood flow. Because
   these pressure relief maneuvers involved postural changes that can occur
   during functional activities, these pressure relief maneuvers can become
   a part of volitional pressure relief and functional weight shifts.
   Therefore, clinical instruction should cover both as a means to impart
   sitting behaviors that may lead to better tissue health. (C) 2014 by the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a stochastic search algorithm for solving
   general optimization problems with little structure. The algorithm
   iteratively finds high quality solutions by randomly sampling candidate
   solutions from a parameterized distribution model over the solution
   space. The basic idea is to convert the original (possibly
   non-differentiable) problem into a differentiable optimization problem
   on the parameter space of the parameterized sampling distribution, and
   then use a direct gradient search method to find improved sampling
   distributions. Thus, the algorithm combines the robustness feature of
   stochastic search from considering a population of candidate solutions
   with the relative fast convergence speed of classical gradient methods
   by exploiting local differentiable structures. We analyze the
   convergence and converge rate properties of the proposed algorithm, and
   carry out numerical study to illustrate its performance.}},

   one, IEEE Standard 1344, in 1995. IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 introduced
   measurement accuracy under steady state conditions as well as

   IEC to harmonize real time communications in IEEE Standard C37.118-2005
   with the IEC 61850 communication standard. These efforts led to the need
   to split the C37.118 into 2 different standards: IEEE Standard
   C37.118.1-2011 that now includes performance of synchrophasors under
   dynamic systems conditions; and IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011

Abstract = {{Voltage sensing of the utility network provide critical information for
   asset management, prioritizing asset replacements, increasing
   situational awareness and providing increased visibility of the grid.
   For ease of use, and to increase commercial appeal among utilities,
   these sensors should be designed to have a low cost, long life (>
   10years), be self-powered, and require no maintenance. This paper deals
   with the development of a novel low-cost wireless voltage sensor for
   medium- and high-voltage (MV/HV) utility assets such as cables,
   transformers, switchgear, capacitor banks, and conductors. A review of
   existing techniques along with their drawbacks is outlined in this
   paper. Further, the challenges pertaining to the development a low-cost
   floating voltage sensor such as variability of voltage, self-calibration
   requirements, and distance-to-earth variations are presented. These
   challenges are circumvented by deriving a detailed mathematical model of
   the sensor. Further, using a set of valid assumptions, a new moving
   average voltage sensing (MAVS) algorithm is proposed, tested using
   simulations and validated using a high-voltage prototype. The wireless
   voltage sensor prototype is tested at up to 35 kV and is built to
   accommodate electric field energy harvesting in addition to voltage
   sensing. The prototype has a low-volume production cost of \$150 and
   shows promising results by providing self-calibrated measurements
   capable of tracking the voltage variation with less than 2.5\% error.}},

Abstract = {{T cell activation by Ag is one of the key events in adaptive immunity.
   It is triggered by interactions of the TCR and coreceptor (CD8 or CD4)
   with antigenic peptides embedded in MHC(pMHC) molecules expressed on
   APCs. The mechanism of how signal is initiated remains unclear. In this
   article, we complement our two-dimensional kinetic analysis of
   TCR-pMHC-CD8 interaction with concurrent calcium imaging to examine how
   ligand engagement of TCR with and without the coengagement of CD8
   initiates signaling. We found that accumulation of frequently applied
   forces on the TCR via agonist pMHC triggered calcium, which was further
   enhanced by CD8 cooperative binding. Prolonging the intermission between
   sequential force applications impaired calcium signals. Our data support
   a model where rapid accumulation of serial forces on TCR-pMHC-CD8 bonds
   triggers calcium in T cells.}},

Abstract = {{Glass nanocomposites, fabricated using borosilicate glass microspheres
   and antimony tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles, were previously reported to
   have formed segregated networks at the boundaries of the glass
   particles. This resulted in an electrically conducting composite at low
   volume fractions (similar to 0.5-0.8 vol\%) of ATO nanoparticles. The
   wide range of electrical response in these borosilicate glass composites
   containing networks of varying concentration of ATO was examined using
   impedance spectroscopy. The electrical resistance of these composites
   varied over a range of around 12 orders of magnitude and exhibited
   several different types of insulator and conductor behavior. The
   formation of the ATO network was identified and tracked by scanning
   electron microscopy images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDS) scans. Detailed impedance spectroscopy analysis using all of the
   dielectric functions (impedance, permittivity, electric modulus, and
   admittance) was found to be an excellent method for detecting the
   development of the network and the effect that processing variables can
   have on its formation and the overall electrical properties of the

   Review and Discussion}},

Abstract = {{The last two decades have witnessed several advances in microfabrication
   technologies and electronics, leading to the development of small,
   low-power devices for wireless sensing, data transmission, actuation,
   and medical implants. Unfortunately, the actual implementation of such
   devices in their respective environment has been hindered by the lack of
   scalable energy sources that are necessary to power and maintain them.
   Batteries, which remain the most commonly used power sources, have not
   kept pace with the demands of these devices, especially in terms of
   energy density. In light of this challenge, the concept of vibratory
   energy harvesting has flourished in recent years as a possible
   alternative to provide a continuous power supply. While linear vibratory
   energy harvesters have received the majority of the literature's
   attention, a significant body of the current research activity is
   focused on the concept of purposeful inclusion of nonlinearities for
   broadband transduction. When compared to their linear resonant
   counterparts, nonlinear energy harvesters have a wider steady-state
   frequency bandwidth, leading to a common belief that they can be
   utilized to improve performance in ambient environments. Through a
   review of the open literature, this paper highlights the role of
   nonlinearities in the transduction of energy harvesters under different
   types of excitations and investigates the conditions, in terms of
   excitation nature and potential shape, under which such nonlinearities
   can be beneficial for energy harvesting.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED MECHANICS REVIEWS}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The study of phononic materials and structures is an emerging discipline
   that lies at the crossroads of vibration and acoustics engineering and
   condensed matter physics. Broadly speaking, a phononic medium is a
   material or structural system that usually exhibits some form of
   periodicity, which can be in the constituent material phases, or the
   internal geometry, or even the boundary conditions. As such, its overall
   dynamical characteristics are compactly described by a frequency band
   structure, in analogy to an electronic band diagram. With roots extended
   to early studies of periodic systems by Newton and Rayleigh, the field
   has grown to encompass engineering configurations ranging from trusses
   and ribbed shells to phononic crystals and metamaterials. While applied
   research in this area has been abundant in recent years, treatment from
   a fundamental mechanics perspective, and particularly from the
   standpoint of dynamical systems, is needed to advance the field in new
   directions. For example, techniques already developed for the
   incorporation of damping and nonlinearities have recently been applied
   to wave propagation in phononic materials and structures. Similarly,
   numerical and experimental approaches originally developed for the
   characterization of conventional materials and structures are now being
   employed toward better understanding and exploitation of phononic
   systems. This article starts with an overview of historical developments
   and follows with an in-depth literature and technical review of recent
   progress in the field with special consideration given to aspects
   pertaining to the fundamentals of dynamics, vibrations, and acoustics.
   Finally, an outlook is projected onto the future on the basis of the
   current trajectories of the field.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized as a
   progressive dilation and degradation of the aortic wall, associated with
   activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammation.
   Emerging evidence indicates a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in AAA
   pathogenesis, but it is unclear whether abdominal aortic endothelial
   miRNAs play a role in the disease process. We aimed to identify miRNAs
   in the abdominal aortic endothelium that play a critical role in AAA
   development.
   Approach and Results-The mouse model of AAA induced by angiotensin II
   infusion was used in this study. Through a miRNA array and validation
   study, we initially identified the murine-specific miR-712 and
   subsequently its human/murine homolog miR-205 as angiotensin II-induced
   miRNAs in the abdominal aortic endothelium in vivo and in vitro.
   Mechanistically, miR-712 stimulated MMP activity in the aortic wall by
   directly targeting 2 MMP inhibitors: tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein
   with kazal motifs (RECK). Silencing of miR-712 and miR-205 by using
   anti-miR-712 and anti-miR-205, respectively, significantly decreased the
   aortic MMP activity and inflammation, preventing AAA development in
   angiotensin II-infused ApoE(-/-) mice. Further, upregulation of 4
   angiotensin II-sensitive miRNAs, miR-205, -21, -133b, and -378,
   identified in this murine study were confirmed in human AAA samples
   compared with nondiseased control.
   Conclusions-Our results demonstrate that angiotensin II-sensitive
   miR-712 and its human homolog miR-205 downregulate TIMP3 and RECK, which
   in turn stimulate aortic MMP activity and inflammation, leading to AAA
   development. Targeting these miRNAs may be a novel therapeutic strategy
   to prevent AAA.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology is an emerging new

   Amongst the multitude of TENG designs, the grating structure is not only

   grating structured TENG is presented with in-depth interpretation and
   analysis of its working principle. Two different categories of grating
   structured TENGs -grating structured TENGs with equal plate-length and
   with unequal plate-length are discussed in detail to illustrate their
   difference in output characteristics. Then for each of these two
   categories, a study of the basic output profiles and an in-depth
   discussion on the influence of the electrode structure, number of
   grating units, and thickness of the dielectric layers were made to
   obtain a strategy for optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The change of potency to nucleate cracks in high cycle fatigue (HCF) at
   a primary nonmetallic inclusion in a martensitic gear steel due to the
   existence of a neighboring inclusion is computationally investigated
   using two-and three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element (FE)
   analyses. Fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs) are computed in the
   proximity of the inclusion and used to compare crack nucleation potency
   of various scenarios. The nonlocal average value of the maximum plastic
   shear strain amplitude is used in computing the FIP. Idealized spherical
   (cylindrical in 2D) inclusions with homogeneous linear elastic isotropic
   material properties are considered to be partially debonded, the worst
   case scenario for HCF crack nucleation as experimentally observed for
   similar systems (Furuya et al., 2004, ``Inclusion-Controlled Fatigue
   Properties of 1800 Mpa-Class Spring Steels,{''}Metall. Mater. Trans. A,
   35A(12), pp. 3737-3744; Harkegard, 1974, ``Experimental Study of the
   Influence of Inclusions on the Fatigue Properties of Steel,{''} Eng.
   Fract. Mech., 6(4), pp. 795-805; Lankford and Kusenberger, 1973,
   ``Initiation of Fatigue Cracks in 4340 Steel,{''} Metall. Mater. Trans.
   A, 4(2), pp. 553-559; Laz and Hillberry, 1998, ``Fatigue Life Prediction
   From Inclusion Initiated Cracks,{''} Int. J. Fatigue, 20(4), pp.
   263-270). Inclusion-matrix interfaces are simulated using a frictionless
   contact penalty algorithm. The fully martensitic steel matrix is modeled
   as elastic-plastic with pure nonlinear kinematic hardening expressed in
   a hardening minus dynamic recovery format. FE simulations suggest
   significant intensification of plastic shear deformation and hence
   higher FIPs when the inclusion pair is aligned perpendicular to the
   uniaxial stress direction. Relative to the reference case with no
   neighboring inclusion, FIPs decrease considerably when the inclusion
   pair aligns with the applied loading direction. These findings shed
   light on the anisotropic HCF response of alloys with primary inclusions
   arranged in clusters by virtue of the fracture of a larger inclusion
   during deformation processing. Materials design methodologies may also
   benefit from such cost-efficient parametric studies that explore the
   relative influence of microstructure attributes on the HCF properties
   and suggest strategies for improving HCF resistance of alloys.}},

   32-bp deletions (CCR5 Delta 32) are resistant to HIV-1 infection. In
   this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
   homozygous for the naturally occurring CCR5 Delta 32 mutation through
   genome editing of wild-type iPSCs using a combination of transcription
   activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or RNA-guided clustered
   regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 together
   with the piggyBac technology. Remarkably, TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
   double-strand DNA breaks resulted in up to 100\% targeting of the
   colonies on one allele of which biallelic targeting occurred at an
   average of 14\% with TALENs and 33\% with CRISPR. Excision of the
   piggyBac using transposase seamlessly reproduced exactly the naturally
   occurring CCR5 Delta 32 mutation without detectable exogenous sequences.
   We differentiated these modified iPSCs into monocytes/macrophages and
   demonstrated their resistance to HIV-1 challenge. We propose that this
   strategy may provide an approach toward a functional cure of HIV-1

Abstract = {{ZIF-8/6FDA-DAM, a proven mixed-matrix material that demonstrated
   remarkably enhanced C3H6/C3H8 selectivity in dense film geometry, was
   extended to scalable hollow fiber geometry in the current work. We
   successfully formed dual-layer ZIF-8/6FDA-DAM mixed-matrix hollow fiber
   membranes with ZIF-8 nanoparticle loading up to 30 wt \% using the
   conventional dry-jet/wet-quench fiber spinning technique. The
   mixed-matrix hollow fibers showed significantly enhanced C3H6/C3H8
   selectivity that was consistent with mixed-matrix dense films. Critical
   variables controlling successful formation of mixed-matrix hollow fiber
   membranes with desirable morphology and attractive transport properties
   were discussed. Furthermore, the effects of coating materials on
   selectivity recovery of partially defective fibers were investigated. To
   our best knowledge, this is the first article reporting successful
   formation of high-loading mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes with

Abstract = {{This paper describes updated results from a partnership between the
   Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and the Georgia Institute of Technology to
   develop, improve, and flight-test a sensor, guidance, navigation,
   control, and real-time flight path optimization system to support
   high-performance nap-of-the-earth helicopter flight. Multiple obstacle
   avoidance methods are evaluated, including (1) a simple processing of
   each laser scan; (2) a motion primitive optimizationmethod, and (3) a
   potential-field-basedmethod. Simulation and flight test results have
   been obtained utilizing an onboard laser scanner to detect terrain and
   obstacles while flying at low altitude, and they have successfully
   demonstrated obstacle avoidance in a realistic semiurban environment at
   speeds up to 12 m/s while maintaining a specified vertical and
   horizontal miss distance. Additionally, the performance of the selected
   LIDAR model in multiple degraded environments was observed. The
   performances of the three guidance methods are directly compared, using
   a published benchmark performance for reference. These results validate
   the above approaches and pave the way for extensions to this work,
   including investigation of additional motion primitives and the
   relationship between sensor range and aircraft performance requirements.

Abstract = {{A microsphere templating process was recently developed for fabrication
   of open-cell porous elastomer. The material contained a unique
   cocontinuous structure having micropores interconnected by
   microchannels. In this work, a follow-up study was conducted to
   investigate the mechanical behavior of such porous materials.
   Polysiloxane was chosen as a model material. The deformation
   characteristics and mechanical properties of the porous elastomer under
   tension and compression were then studied. For both tensile and
   compressive tests, the mechanical properties measured were found to
   largely deviate from those calculated by the additive rule assuming
   affine deformation. This nonaffine mechanics was further verified by
   microscopic observations. Cyclic loading and unloading tests were also
   performed to study the hysteresis of the material. In comparison with
   the solid elastomer, the hysteresis of the porous elastomer was
   considerably higher and more sensitive to the strain rate. An attempt
   was further made to fit the stress-strain curve using existing
   hyperelastic models, and the results showed that the Arruda-Boyce model,
   in general, fit both the solid and porous polysiloxane very well. (C)

Abstract = {{Finding the location of feature points in 3D space from 2D vision data
   in structured environments has been done successfully for years and has
   been applied effectively on industrial robots. Miniature flying robots
   flying in unknown environments have stringent weight, space, and
   security constraints. For such vehicles, it has been attempted here to
   reduce the number of vision sensors to a single camera. At first,
   feature points are detected in the image using Harris corner detector,
   the measurements of which are then statistically corresponded across
   various images, using knowledge of vehicle's pose from onboard inertial
   measurement unit. First approach attempted is that of ego-motion
   perpendicular to camera axis and acceptable results for 3D feature point
   locations have been achieved. Next, except for a small region around the
   focus of expansion, forward translations along the camera axis have also
   been attempted with acceptable results, which is an improvement to the
   previous relevant work. The 3D location map of feature points thus
   obtained is utilizable for trajectory planning while ensuring collision
   avoidance through 3D space. Reduction of vision sensors to a single
   camera while utilizing minimum ego-motion space for 3D feature point
   location is a significant contribution of this work.}},

Abstract = {{A key step to understanding and producing natural motion is creating a
   physical, well understood actuator with a dynamic model resembling
   biological muscle. This actuator can then serve as the basis for
   building viable, full-strength, and safe muscles for disabled patients,
   rehabilitation, human force amplification, telerobotics, and humanoid
   robotic systems. This paper presents a cell-based flexible actuator
   modeling methodology and the General Fingerprint Method for
   systematically and efficiently calculating the actuators' respective
   dynamic equations of motion. The cellular actuator arrays combine many
   flexible `cells' in complex and varied topologies for combined
   large-scale motion. The cells can have varied internal dynamic models
   and common actuators such as piezoelectric, SMA, linear motor, and
   pneumatic technologies can fit the model by adding a flexible element in
   series with the actuator. The topology of the cellular actuator array
   lends it many of its properties allowing the final muscle to be catered
   to particular applications. The General Fingerprint Method allows for
   fast recalculation for different and/or changing structures and internal
   dynamics, and provides an intuitive base for future controls work. This
   paper also presents two physical SMA based cellular actuator arrays
   which validate the presented theory and give a basis for future
   development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental study of reacting jets in a
   high-temperature (1775 K) vitiated cross-flow at 6 atm. We present an
   extensive data set based on high speed chemiluminescence imaging and
   exhaust gas sampling showing the characteristics of the time-averaged
   trajectory, width of the flame, flame standoff (or ignition) location,
   and NO emissions over a momentum flux ratio range of 0.75 < J < 240. Key
   observations are: (1) Depending upon ignition times, reaction can
   initiate uniformly around the jet, initiate on the leeward side of the
   jet and spread around to the windward side farther downstream, or
   initiate further downstream. (2) The time-averaged trajectory generally
   follows nonreacting trajectories, but penetrates further in the
   far-field than for what would be expected of a nonreacting jet (3) The
   width of heat release zone increases monotonically with downstream
   location, J, and flame flapping amplitude, but seems to be dominated by
   the size of the counter-rotating vortex pair. (4) The measured ignition
   locations were of the same order of magnitude as values based on
   calculated ignition time scales and mean jet exit velocities, but with
   some additional variability. (5) The incremental NOx emissions were
   controlled primarily by the global temperature rise associated with
   burning the jet fuel (for the fixed crossflow conditions studied here),
   and the NOx emissions increased roughly linearly with the temperature
   rise. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

   infants, young children, and the elderly or immunocompromised. There are
   many open questions regarding the processes that regulate human RSV
   (hRSV) assembly and budding. Here, using cryo-electron tomography, we
   identified virus particles that were spherical, filamentous, and
   asymmetric in structure, all within the same virus preparation. The
   three particle morphologies maintained a similar organization of the
   surface glycoproteins, matrix protein (M), M2-1, and the
   ribonucleoprotein (RNP). RNP filaments were traced in three dimensions
   (3D), and their total length was calculated. The measurements revealed
   the inclusion of multiple full-length genome copies per particle. RNP
   was associated with the membrane whenever the M layer was present. The
   amount of M coverage ranged from 24\% to 86\% in the different
   morphologies. Using fluorescence light microscopy (fLM), direct
   stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), and a proximity
   ligation assay (PLA), we provide evidence illustrating that M2-1 is
   located between RNP and M in isolated viral particles. In addition,
   regular spacing of the M2-1 densities was resolved when hRSV viruses
   were imaged using Zernike phase contrast (ZPC) cryo-electron tomography.
   Our studies provide a more complete characterization of the hRSV virion
   structure and substantiation that M and M2-1 regulate virus
   organization.}},

Title = {{Biotransformation of phytosterols under aerobic conditions}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{71-81}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Phytosterols are plant-derived sterols present in pulp and paper
   wastewater and have been implicated in the endocrine disruption of
   aquatic species. Bioassays were performed to assess the effect of an
   additional carbon source and/or solubilizing agent on the aerobic
   biotransformation of a mixture of three common phytosterols
   (beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol). The aerobic
   biotransformation of the phytosterol mixture by a mixed culture
   developed from a pulp and paper wastewater treatment system was examined
   under three separate conditions: with phytosterols as the sole added
   carbon source, with phytosterols and dextrin as an additional carbon
   source, and with phytosterols added with ethanol as an additional carbon
   source and solubilizing agent. Significant phytosterol removal was not
   observed in assays set up with phytosterol powder, either with or
   without an additional carbon source. In contrast, all three phytosterols
   were aerobically degraded when added as a dissolved solution in ethanol.
   Thus, under the experimental conditions of this study, the
   bioavailability of phytosterols was limited without the presence of a
   solubilizing agent. The total phytosterol removal rate was linear for
   the first six days before respiking, with a rate of 0.47 mg/L-d (R-2 =
   0.998). After the second spiking, the total phytosterol removal rate was
   linear for seven days, with a rate of 0.32 mg/L-d (R-2 = 0.968).
   Following the 7th day, the phytosterol removal rate markedly
   accelerated, suggesting two different mechanisms are involved in
   phytosterol biotransformation, more likely related to the production of
   enzyme(s) involved in phytosterol degradation, induced under different
   cell growth conditions. beta-sitosterol was preferentially degraded, as
   compared to stigmasterol and campesterol, although all three
   phytosterols fell below detection limits by the 24th day of incubation.

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The extreme loads generated by blast events, both man-made and
   accidental, can cause devastating consequences for structures and their
   components. Typically, the development of analysis methodologies, design
   procedures and hardening strategies is driven by conclusions that have
   been obtained experimentally via field testing with live explosives.
   These types of experiments, although generally effective, are often
   expensive and due to the extreme environment, do not provide clear
   visual evidence and quantitative data of structural response throughout
   the explosive event.
   In 2006, a blast simulation facility was designed and constructed in
   order to provide blast-like loadings on structures and components in a
   controlled laboratory setting. The Blast Simulator, located at the
   University of California, San Diego, was the first facility to utilize
   ultra-fast, hydraulically drive, computer-controlled actuators to
   generate impulsive loadings on full-scale structures. Because the
   experiments do not involve explosives and the subsequent fireball, high
   speed cameras and other instrumentation can be effectively used to
   produce quantitative, as well as high resolution visual data in a
   repeatable environment.
   Since 2006, over 500 experiments have been conducted using the Blast
   Simulator for both validation studies and exploratory research. This
   paper serves to summarize the current methodology for imparting blast
   and shock-like loads, as well as to validate the Blast Simulator's
   effectiveness in producing accurate, controllable and repeatable loading
   on a range of civil and military structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Gliding robotic fish, a new type of underwater robot, combines both
   strengths of underwater gliders and robotic fish, featuring long
   operation duration and high maneuverability. In this paper, we present
   both analytical and experimental results on a novel gliding motion,
   tail-enabled three-dimensional (3D) spiraling, which is well suited for
   sampling a water column. A dynamic model of a gliding robotic fish with
   a deflected tail is first established. The equations for the relative
   equilibria corresponding to steady-state spiraling are derived and then
   solved recursively using Newton's method. The region of convergence for
   Newton's method is examined numerically. We then establish the local
   asymptotic stability of the computed equilibria through Jacobian
   analysis and further numerically explore the basins of attraction.
   Experiments have been conducted on a fish-shaped miniature underwater
   glider with a deflected tail, where a gliding-induced 3D spiraling
   maneuver is confirmed. Furthermore, consistent with model predictions,
   experimental results have shown that the achievable turning radius of
   the spiraling can be as small as less than 0.4 m, demonstrating the high
   maneuverability.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Directed Intuitive Approach for Bioinspired Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bioinspired design, the practice of looking to nature to find
   inspiration for solutions to engineering problems, is increasingly a
   desired approach to design. It allows designers to tap a wealth of
   time-tested solutions to difficult problems in a domain less considered
   by designers. Only recently have researchers developed organized,
   systematic methods for bioinspired design. Traditionally, bioinspired
   design has been conducted without the benefit of any organized method.
   Designers relied on the informal ``directed intuitive approach{''} of
   bioinspired design, which simply directs designers to consider how
   nature might solve a problem. This paper presents an experiment to
   explore the impact of the directed approach on idea generation. This
   experiment is foundationally important to bioinspired engineering design
   method research. The results of this experiment serve as a fundamental
   baseline and benchmark for the comparison of more systematic, and often
   more involved, bioinspired design methods. A group of 121 novice
   designers are given one of two design problems and instructed to either
   generate solutions using the directed approach or to generate solutions
   without being prompted in any additional fashion. Based on the findings
   presented here, the directed approach offers designers no advantage in
   the average number of nonredundant ideas, quality, novelty, or variety
   of the solutions produced. In conclusion, systematic and organized
   methods for bioinspired design should be sought to effectively leverage
   nature's design knowledge.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{5862-5874}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Carbohydrates and glycoconjugates have been shown to exert
   pro-inflammatory effects on the dendritic cells (DCs), supporting
   pathogen-induced innate immunity and antigen processing, as well as
   immunosuppressive effects in the tolerance to self-proteins.
   Additionally, the innate inflammatory response to implanted biomaterials
   has been hypothesized to be mediated by inflammatory cells interacting
   with adsorbed proteins, many of which are glycosylated. However, the
   molecular factors relevant for surface displayed glycoconjugate
   modulation of dendritic cell (DC) phenotype are unknown. Thus, in this
   study, a model system was developed to establish the role of glycan
   composition, density, and carrier cationization state on DC response.
   Thiol modified glycans were covalently bound to a model protein carrier,
   maleimide functionalized bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the number of
   glycans per BSA modulated. Additionally, the carrier isoelectric point
   was scaled from a pI of similar to 4.0 to similar to 10.0 using
   ethylenediamine (EDA). The DC response to the neoglycoconjugates
   adsorbed to wells of a 384-well plate was determined via a high
   throughput assay. The underlying trends in DC phenotype in relation to
   conjugate properties were elucidated via multivariate general linear
   models. It was found that glycoconjugates with more than 20 glycans per
   carrier had the greatest impact on the pro-inflammatory response from
   DCs, followed by conjugates having an isoelectric point above 9.5.
   Surfaces displaying terminal alpha 1-2 linked mannose structures were
   able to increase the inflammatory DC response to a greater extent than
   did any other terminal glycan structure. The results herein can be
   applied to inform the design of the next generation of combination
   products and biomaterials for use in future vaccines and implanted
   materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Non-healing bone defects present tremendous socioeconomic costs.
   Although successful in some clinical settings, bone morphogenetic
   protein (BMP) therapies require supraphysiological dose delivery for
   bone repair, raising treatment costs and risks of complications. We
   engineered a protease-degradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) synthetic
   hydrogel functionalized with a triple helical, alpha 2 beta 1
   integrin-specific peptide (GFOGER) as a BMP-2 delivery vehicle.
   GFOGER-functionalized hydrogels lacking BMP-2 directed human stem cell
   differentiation and produced significant enhancements in bone repair
   within a critical-sized bone defect compared to RGD hydrogels or empty
   defects. GFOGER functionalization was crucial to the BMP-2-dependent
   healing response. Importantly, these engineered hydrogels outperformed
   the current clinical carrier in repairing non-healing bone defects at
   low BMP-2 doses. GFOGER hydrogels provided sustained in vivo release of
   encapsulated BMP-2, increased osteoprogenitor localization in the defect
   site, enhanced bone formation and induced defect bridging and
   mechanically robust healing at low BMP-2 doses which stimulated almost
   no bone regeneration when delivered from collagen sponges. These
   findings demonstrate that GFOGER hydrogels promote bone regeneration in
   challenging defects with low delivered BMP-2 doses and represent an
   effective delivery vehicle for protein therapeutics with translational
   potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Success of an immunotherapy for cancer often depends on the critical
   balance of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) responses driven by
   antigen presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells (DCs). Th1-driven
   cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses are key to eliminating tumor cells. It
   is well established that CpG oligonucleotides (ODN), a widely studied
   Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, used to enhance Th1 response, also
   induces high levels of the anti-inflammatory, Th2-promoting cytokine
   IL10, which could dampen the resulting Th1 response. Biomaterials-based
   immunomodulatory strategies that can reduce IL10 production while
   maintaining IL12 levels during CpG delivery could further enhance the
   Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and improve anti-tumor immune response. Here we
   report that dual-delivery of IL10-silencing siRNA along with CpG ODN to
   the same DCs using pathogen-mimicking microparticles (PMPs),
   significantly enhances their Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio through concurrent
   inhibition of CpG-induced IL10 production. Co-delivery of poly(I:C), a
   TLR3 agonist had only minor effects on IL10 levels. Further,
   simultaneous immunotherapy with CpG ODN and IL10 siRNA enhanced immune
   protection of an idio-type DNA vaccine in a prophylactic murine model of
   B cell lymphoma whereas co-delivery of poly(I:C) and CpG did not enhance
   protection. These results suggest that PMPs can be used to precisely
   modulate TLR ligand-mediated immune-stimulation in DCs, through
   co-delivery of cytokine-silencing siRNAs and thereby boost antitumor
   immunity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{86-94}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Reliable and repeatable experimental generation of high-g shock
   environments is a long-standing problem which faces significant
   difficulty. The shock levels experienced by various defense-related
   structural and mechanical components are not always easily obtained in
   the true environments but are known to span a significant range of peak
   accelerations and pulse durations. The reproduction of these high-g
   shock levels in a controlled setting is highly important but also quite
   complicated. A system which is characterized by substantial energy
   output, a high level of precision, and adjustability is ideal for
   producing the varying and intense conditions experienced by structures
   and components subjected to shock loads.
   The Blast Simulator, a complex experimental device which simulates
   explosive blasts without the use of explosive materials, has proven to
   be an appropriate tool for this application. The system uses
   high-precision, computer-controlled hydraulic actuators to fire a piston
   mounted with various impact materials at high velocities into the
   specified test article. In the developed experimental series, a
   cylindrical steel specimen is launched by the Blast Simulator from a set
   of custom pedestals into a catcher pit. The response of the test article
   to the impact is acquired and analyzed using the shock response
   spectrum. The results are used to display the capabilities of the Blast
   Simulator to induce a wide range of shocks on the test article and
   display the effectiveness of the device as a shock loading tool. C()

Title = {{Experimental investigation and multiscale modeling of
   ultra-high-performance concrete panels subject to blast loading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{95-103}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Tailored cementitious materials, such as Ultra-High-Performance Concrete
   (UHPC), may significantly improve the blast resistance of structural
   panels. To understand and quantify the performance of UHPC panels
   subject to blast loading, four 1626- by 864- by 51-mm UHPC panels
   without steel rebar reinforcement were subjected to reflected impulse
   loads between 0.77 and 2.05 MPa-ms. The UHPC material was composed of a
   commercially available UHPC premix, high-range water reducing agent, 2\%
   volume fraction of straight, smooth 14-mm-long by 0.185-mm-diameter
   fibers, and water. Experimental results determined that the UHPC panel
   fractured at a reflected impulse between 0.97 and 1.47 MPa-ms. These
   results were used to validate a multiscale model which accounts for
   structure and phenomena at two length scales: a multiple fiber length
   scale and a structural length scale. Within the multiscale model, a
   hand-shaking scheme conveys the energy barrier threshold and dissipated
   energy density from the model at the multiple fiber length scale to the
   model at the structural length scale. Together, the models at the two
   length scales account for energy dissipation through granular flow of
   the matrix, frictional pullout of the fibers, and friction between the
   interfaces. The simulated displacement and fracture patterns generated
   by the multiscale model are compared to experimental observations. This
   work is significant for three reasons: (1) new experimental data provide
   an upper and lower bound to the blast resistance of UHPC panels, (2) the
   multiscale model simulates the experimental results using readily
   available material properties and information regarding mesostructure
   attributes at two different length scales, and (3) by incorporating
   information from multiple length scales, the multiscale model can
   facilitate the design of UHPC materials to resist blast loading in ways
   not accessible using single length scale models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   SWNT-PABS dispersion was then printed onto pre-printed silver electrodes
   to fabricate the ammonia gas sensor. The rheological behaviors of
   SWNT-PABS dispersion and surface structures of fabricated sensors were
   characterized. The effects of electrode configuration and the number of
   SWNT-PABS printed layers on the electric resistance of sensors were
   studied. The paper-based sensor showed excellent sensor response, short
   response and recovery time to different concentrations of NH3 at ppm
   level, and could be stable for several months. This fabrication method
   assembling electrodes and testing parts onto the flexible photo-paper is

Abstract = {{BDE209 (decabromodiphenyl ether) and lead (Pb) are the main contaminants
   at e-waste recycling sites, and their potential toxicological effects on
   terrestrial organisms have received extensive attention. However, the
   impact on earthworms of exposure to the two chemicals remains almost
   unknown. Therefore, indoor incubation tests were performed on control
   and contaminated soil samples to determine the uptake and transformation
   of BDE209 in the presence of Pb for the first time. The results have
   demonstrated that Pb addition can affect BDE209 bioaccumulation
   efficiency compared with exposure to BDE209 alone. For a low BDE209
   concentration (1 mg kg-1), Pb addition barely affected the uptake of
   BDE209, whereas for a high BDE209 concentration (100 mg kg-1), Pb
   addition elicited a complex response. Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   observation indicated that a higher level of Pb (250 and 500 mg kg-1)
   facilitated the uptake of BDE209 through the skin. Gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis showed that the peak
   of BDE209 accumulation usually appeared in the joint exposure groups
   involving 10 or 100 mg kg(-1), BDE209 and 250 mg kg-1 Pb, and the
   average bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was 0.53, which is more than 1.2
   times that of single exposure to BDE209 (average = 0.44). Also, the
   earthworms eliminated more BDE209 after 21 d, and the biodegradation
   products were mainly BDE206 and BDE208. Furthermore, Pb addition can
   affect the transformation efficiency of BDE209 in earthworms, and
   several lower bromodiphenyl ethers can be detected. The results of these
   observations have provided a basic understanding of the potential
   ecotoxicological effects of joint PBDE and heavy metal exposure on
   terrestrial invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{When fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is added to the ethylene carbonate
   (EC)-diethyl carbonate (DEC) electrolyte, the capacity and cyclability
   of full-cells employing Si-graphene anode and lithium nickel cobalt
   aluminum oxide cathode (NCA) cathode are improved due to formation of a
   thin (30-50 nm) SEI layer with low ionic resistance (similar to 2 ohm
   cm(2)) on the surface of Si-graphene anode. These properties are
   confirmed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and a
   cross-sectional image analysis using Focused Ion Beam (FIB)-SEM.
   Approximately 5 wt.\% FEC in EC:DEC (1:1 wt.\%) shows the highest
   capacity and most stability. This high capacity and low capacity fade is
   attributed to a more stable SEI layer containing less CH2OCO2Li, Li2CO3
   and LiF compounds, which consume cyclable Li. Additionally, a greater
   amount of polycarbonate (PC), which is known to form a more robust
   passivation layer, thus reducing further reduction of electrolyte, is
   confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Metallodielectric photonic crystals having hyperbolic dispersions are

   be used to depict the flow of electromagnetic energy through a structure
   when wave propagation does not follow ray optics. We obtain the energy
   streamlines through two semi-infinite uniaxial anisotropic effective
   medium structures, separated by a small vacuum gap, using the Green
   functions and fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The lateral shifts are
   determined from the streamlines within two penetration depths. For
   hyperbolic modes, the predicted lateral shift can be several thousand
   times of the vacuum gap width. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Severe injuries to the extremities often result in muscle trauma and, in
   some cases, significant volumetric muscle loss (VML). These injuries
   continue to be challenging to treat, with few available clinical
   options, a high rate of complications, and often persistent loss of limb
   function. To facilitate the testing of regenerative strategies for
   skeletal muscle, we developed a novel quadriceps VML model in the rat,
   specifically addressing functional recovery of the limb. Our outcome
   measures included muscle contractility measurements to assess muscle
   function and gait analysis for evaluation of overall limb function. We
   also investigated treatment with muscle autografts, whole or minced, to
   promote regeneration of the defect area. Our defect model resulted in a
   loss of muscle function, with injured legs generating less than 55\% of
   muscle strength from the contralateral uninjured control legs, even at 4
   weeks post-injury. The autograft treatments did not result in
   significant recovery of muscle function. Measures of static and dynamic
   gait were significantly decreased in the untreated, empty defect group,
   indicating a decrease in limb function. Histological sections of the
   affected muscles showed extensive fibrosis, suggesting that this
   scarring of the muscle may be in part the cause of the loss of muscle
   function in this VML model. Taken together, these data are consistent
   with clinical findings of reduced muscle function in large VML injuries.
   This new model with quantitative functional outcome measures offers a
   platform on which to evaluate treatment strategies designed to
   regenerate muscle tissue volume and restore limb function. (C) 2013

Number = {{9, SI}},

Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Although it has been established that cellular stiffness can change as a
   stem cell differentiates, the precise relationship between cell
   mechanics and other phenotypic properties remains unclear. Inherent cell
   heterogeneity and asynchronous differentiation complicate population
   analysis; therefore, single-cell analysis was employed to determine how
   changes in cell stiffness correlate with changes in molecular biomarkers
   during differentiation. Design of a custom gridded tissue culture dish
   facilitated single-cell comparisons between cell mechanics and other
   differentiation biomarkers by enabling sequential measurement of cell
   mechanics and protein biomarker expression at the single cell level. The
   Young's modulus of mesenchymal stem cells was shown not only to decrease
   during chemically-induced osteoblast differentiation, but also to
   correlate more closely with the day of differentiation than did the
   relative expression of the traditional osteoblast differentiation
   markers, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin. Therefore, cell stiffness, a
   measurable property of individual cells, may serve as an improved
   indicator of single-cell osteoblast differentiation compared to
   traditional biological markers. Revelation of additional osteoblast
   differentiation indicators, such as cell stiffness, can improve
   identification and collection of starting cell populations, with
   applications to mesenchymal stem cell therapies and stem cell-based
   tissue engineering. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boronate affinity materials have attracted increasing attentions as
   sample enrichment platforms for glycoproteomic analysis in recent years.
   However, most of the boronate affinity materials that have already
   employed for proteomic analysis are suffering from apparent
   disadvantages, such as alkaline pH for binding, weak affinity, and
   relatively poor selectivity. Benzoboroxoles are a unique class of
   boronic acids which have showed excellent binding properties for the
   recognition of cis-diol-containing compounds. Recently, a
   3-carboxy-benzoboroxole-functionalized monolithic column had been
   reported and it had exhibited the best selectivity and affinity as well
   as the lowest binding pH among all reported boronate affinity monolithic
   columns. In this study, an off-line hyphenation of this boronate
   affinity monolithic column-based extraction with matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
   was developed and the powerfulness of this hyphenated approach in the
   analysis of glycoproteins and glycopeptides in complex samples was
   investigated. The approach was first applied to the analysis of
   glycopeptides in the tryptic digest of horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
   Totally 22 glycopeptides were identified. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the best performance among all the boronic acid-functionalized
   materials. We further employed this approach to the analysis of intact
   proteins in human saliva. Totally 6 intact glycoproteins were
   successfully identified. As comparison, when the samples were analyzed
   without extraction, only a few glycopeptides were identified from the
   tryptic digest of HRP while no glycoproteins were found from the saliva
   samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the properties of hybrid composites made by epoxy
   reinforced with short glass fibers (GF) and exfoliated graphite
   nanoplatelets (GNP) were determined as a function of the GF loading. The
   addition of GNP, either within the matrix or at the GF surface (GFc),
   promoted the formation of a stronger GF-epoxy interface, as evaluated by
   the single-fiber microdebonding test, resulting in an increase of the
   interfacial shear strength by similar to 60\% exhibited by the hybrid
   epoxy composite reinforced with 5 wt\% GNP. Quasi-static tensile tests
   and impact tests were performed in order to explore how the combined
   effect of the nano- and micro- size reinforcements affected the
   macroscopic mechanical properties under low and high strain rates. The
   improved tensile modulus, ultimate tensile strength and impact
   resistance exhibited by the hybrid composites revealed that it is
   possible to introduce the nano-materials at the fiber/matrix interface
   and significantly improve the interfacial properties, leading to lighter
   and stronger composites. Furthermore, the storage modulus and the
   viscoelastic behavior of GF/epoxy composites were remarkably enhanced
   upon addition of GNP, indicating strong GNP-polymer interactions and
   immobilization of the polymer chains. In conclusion, the combined effect
   of nano-materials and micro-size reinforcements can be exploited to
   produce light-weight hybrid composites with enhanced mechanical
   properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{RuO2 has been studied for a long time as a model electrode for lithium
   ion battery, however, little is known about their cycle life at high
   capacity. Using a simple low-pressure chemical vapor deposition process,
   hierarchical columnar RuO2 nanoplates were directly deposited on
   stainless steel current collectors. Powder X-ray diffraction revealed
   the existence of the rutile form of RuO2 (P42/mnm, a = 4.499 angstrom, c
   = 3.111 angstrom), with a (110) preferred orientation for the
   as-deposited materials. The electrodes showed significant cycle life
   improvement versus Li/Li+ at high capacity (932 mAh g(-1)). This
   capacity is higher than expected for the conversion reaction (806 rnAh
   g(-1)) of RuO2. Galvanostatic discharge-charge experiments were
   performed in the range of 4.0 to 0.1 V versus Li/Li+ at a constant
   current density of similar to 806 mA g(-1). These self-supported
   electrodes have shown 94\% reversibility for the first 30 cycles and
   81\% after 60 cycles, which indicate good kinetics and excellent
   capacity retention. This significant improvement in the electrochemical
   properties is attributed to the growth process and the chemical and
   mechanical robustness of the electrode.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the characteristics of nanoparticle (NP)-to-DNA binding is
   important for the rational design of functionalized NPs to use in
   biomedical applications as well as for the toxicological assessment of
   NPs. In this study we employed a single-molecule imaging technique,
   atomic force microscopy (AFM), to determine the characteristics of
   NP-to-DNA binding, including the binding kinetics, isotherm, and
   specificity. We demonstrated the capability of this AFM-based approach
   using quantum dots (QDs) as a model NP. The binding kinetics and binding
   isotherm of QDs to DNA were investigated by examining a large number of
   single DNA molecules after exposure to QDs using AFM; the models that we
   developed fit the experimental results well. According to the binding
   kinetics model, the average number of bound QDs per DNA molecule at
   equilibrium is approximately five, and the binding rate constant is
   approximately 0.35 s(-1). Furthermore, from the binding isotherm, the
   equilibrium binding constant and maximum number of QDs bound to DNA were
   determined to be approximately 0.23 nM(-1) and 14, respectively.
   Finally, by examining the position of QDs on DNA molecules, i.e., the
   distance from a QD to the nearest DNA terminus, we found that the
   binding of QDs to DNA is nonspecific.}},

   Three US Cities}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Heat-related mortality in US cities is expected to more than double by
   the mid-to-late 21st century. Rising heat exposure in cities is
   projected to result from: 1) climate forcings from changing global
   atmospheric composition; and 2) local land surface characteristics
   responsible for the urban heat island effect. The extent to which heat
   management strategies designed to lessen the urban heat island effect
   could offset future heat-related mortality remains unexplored in the
   literature. Using coupled global and regional climate models with a
   human health effects model, we estimate changes in the number of
   heat-related deaths in 2050 resulting from modifications to vegetative
   cover and surface albedo across three climatically and demographically
   diverse US metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Employing separate health impact
   functions for average warm season and heat wave conditions in 2050, we
   find combinations of vegetation and albedo enhancement to offset
   projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40 to 99\% across the
   three metropolitan regions. These results demonstrate the potential for
   extensive land surface changes in cities to provide adaptive benefits to
   urban populations at risk for rising heat exposure with climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) impregnated mesoporous gamma-alumina sorbents
   are utilized for CO2 adsorption from dry and humid simulated ambient
   air, and the sorbents are regenerated under an environment of flowing
   steam for times ranging from 5 min to 24 h of continuous exposure. The
   sorbents are compared on the basis of equilibrium CO2 capacities from
   simulated air at 400 ppm of CO2, 50\% relative humidity, and 30 degrees
   C as well as their physiochemical characterization by means of X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Al-27 NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, Raman
   spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, and elemental analysis. The sorbents
   retain better than 90\% of the initial equilibrium capacity of similar
   to 1.7 mmol/g at steam exposure times up to 12 h; however, PEI leaching
   reduced the capacity of the sorbent to 0.66 mmol/g after 24 h of
   continuous treatment. It is demonstrated that the gamma-alumina support
   partially hydrates to form a boehmite crystal phase at steam times of 90
   min and longer but that this phase transition occurs predominately
   between 90 min and 12 h of steam treatment, slowing at longer times of
   12 and 24 h of treatment. Evidence is presented to suggest that the
   presence of boehmite on the sorbent surface does not significantly alter
   the amine efficiency of impregnated PEI. The collected results suggest
   that gamma-alumina/PEI composite materials are promising sorbents for
   CO2 capture from ambient air with regeneration in flowing steam.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to the nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) constructed from a single
   layer of aligned nanofibers, bilayer NGCs with random and aligned
   nanofibers in the outer and inner layers are more robust and
   tear-resistant during surgical procedures thanks to an isotropic
   mechanical property provided by the random nanofibers. However, it
   remains unclear whether the random nanofibers will interfere with the
   aligned nanofibers to alter the extension pattern of the neurites and
   impede regeneration. To answer this question, we seeded dorsal root
   ganglia (DRG) on a double-layered scaffold, with aligned and random
   nanofibers on the top and bottom layers, respectively, and evaluated the
   outgrowth of neurites. The random nanofibers in the bottom layer exerted
   a negative impact on the extension of neurites projecting from the DRG,
   giving neurites a less ordered structure compared to those cultured on a
   single layer of aligned nanofibers. The negative impact of the random
   nanofibers could be effectively mitigated by preseeding the
   double-layered scaffold with Schwann cells. DRG cultured on top of such
   a scaffold exhibited a neurite outgrowth pattern similar to that for DRG
   cultured on a single layer of aligned nanofibers. We further fabricated
   bilayer NGCs from the double-layered scaffolds and tested their ability
   to facilitate nerve regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve injury model.
   Both histomorphometric analysis and functional characterization
   demonstrated that bilayer NGCs with an inner surface that was preseeded
   with Schwann cells could reach 54\%, 64.2\%, and 74.9\% of the
   performance of isografts in terms of nerve fiber number, maximum
   isometric tetanic force, and mass of the extensor digitorum longus
   muscle, respectively. It can be concluded that the bilayer NGCs hold
   great potential in facilitating motor axon regeneration and functional
   motor recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer materials with large dielectric constants are desirable for the
   development of high energy density capacitors. We show that the
   dielectric properties of poly(vinylidene
   fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) {[}P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)]
   can be improved by the use of processing conditions that favor formation
   of a highly crystalline morphology of the nonpolar alpha-phase. Through
   the use of spin coating, thermal treatment above the melting
   temperature, and quenching, we were able to attain a highly crystalline,
   alpha-phase rich morphology that has a quite large dielectric constant
   of 77 +/- 10 at 1 kHz. The final morphology and phase composition of the
   terpolymer films depend strongly on the postprocessing thermal treatment
   and the quality of the solvent. Evaluation of the polarization behavior
   of the terpolymer films as a function of electric field reveal that the
   polymer exhibits a relaxor-ferroelectric behavior and has a substantial
   energy density of 9.7 J/cm(3) at fields of up to approximately 470 V/mu
   m. Under millisecond pulsed charge discharge measurements a 3-fold
   increase in energy density (27 J/cm(3)) is obtained at high fields
   (similar to 600 V/mu m). Our study demonstrates that the processing
   conditions and morphology of fluorinated terpolymer films are
   controlling factors for achievement of high dielectric permittivity and
   energy density that are critical for high performance capacitors.}},

Title = {{Single cell transcriptional analysis reveals novel innate immune cell
   types}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Single-cell analysis has the potential to provide us with a host of new
   knowledge about biological systems, but it comes with the challenge of
   correctly interpreting the biological information. While emerging
   techniques have made it possible to measure inter-cellular variability
   at the transcriptome level, no consensus yet exists on the most
   appropriate method of data analysis of such single cell data. Methods
   for analysis of transcriptional data at the population level are well
   established but are not well suited to single cell analysis due to their
   dependence on population averages. In order to address this question, we
   have systematically tested combinations of methods for primary data
   analysis on single cell transcription data generated from two types of
   primary immune cells, neutrophils and T lymphocytes. Cells were obtained
   from healthy individuals, and single cell transcript expression data was
   obtained by a combination of single cell sorting and nanoscale
   quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) for markers of cell type,
   intracellular signaling, and immune functionality. Gene expression
   analysis was focused on hierarchical clustering to determine the
   existence of cellular subgroups within the populations. Nine
   combinations of criteria for data exclusion and normalization were
   tested and evaluated. Bimodality in gene expression indicated the
   presence of cellular subgroups which were also revealed by data
   clustering. We observed evidence for two clearly defined cellular
   subtypes in the neutrophil populations and at least two in the T
   lymphocyte populations. When normalizing the data by different methods,
   we observed varying outcomes with corresponding interpretations of the
   biological characteristics of the cell populations. Normalization of the
   data by linear standardization taking into account technical effects
   such as plate effects, resulted in interpretations that most closely
   matched biological expectations. Single cell transcription profiling
   provides evidence of cellular subclasses in neutrophils and leukocytes
   that may be independent of traditional classifications based on cell
   surface markers. The choice of primary data analysis method had a
   substantial effect on the interpretation of the data. Adjustment for
   technical effects is critical to prevent misinterpretation of single
   cell transcript data.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene has attracted great attention in nanoelectronics, optics, and
   energy harvesting. Here, the near-field radiative heat transfer between
   graphene-covered corrugated silica is investigated based on the exact
   scattering theory. It is found that graphene can improve the radiative
   heat flux between silica gratings by more than one order of magnitude
   and alleviate the performance sensitivity to lateral shift. The
   underlying mechanism is mainly attributed to the improved photon
   tunneling of modes away from phonon resonances. Besides, coating with
   graphene leads to nonlocal radiative transfer that breaks Derjaguin's
   proximity approximation and enables corrugated silica to outperform bulk
   silica in near-field radiation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Microbial Community Responses to Organophosphate Substrate Additions in
   Contaminated Subsurface Sediments}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Radionuclide-and heavy metal-contaminated subsurface
   sediments remain a legacy of Cold War nuclear weapons research and
   recent nuclear power plant failures. Within such contaminated sediments,
   remediation activities are necessary to mitigate groundwater
   contamination. A promising approach makes use of extant microbial
   communities capable of hydrolyzing organophosphate substrates to promote
   mineralization of soluble contaminants within deep subsurface
   environments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Uranium-contaminated sediments from the
   U. S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC) Area
   2 site were used in slurry experiments to identify microbial communities
   involved in hydrolysis of 10 mM organophosphate amendments {[}i.e.,
   glycerol-2-phosphate (G2P) or glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)] in synthetic
   groundwater at pH 5.5 and pH 6.8. Following 36 day (G2P) and 20 day
   (G3P) amended treatments, maximum phosphate (PO43-) concentrations of
   4.8 mM and 8.9 mM were measured, respectively. Use of the PhyloChip 16S
   rRNA microarray identified 2,120 archaeal and bacterial taxa
   representing 46 phyla, 66 classes, 110 orders, and 186 families among
   all treatments. Measures of archaeal and bacterial richness were lowest
   under G2P (pH 5.5) treatments and greatest with G3P (pH 6.8) treatments.
   Members of the phyla Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Bacteroidetes, and
   Proteobacteria demonstrated the greatest enrichment in response to
   organophosphate amendments and the OTUs that increased in relative
   abundance by 2-fold or greater accounted for 9\%-50\% and 3\%-17\% of
   total detected Archaea and Bacteria, respectively.
   Conclusions/Significance: This work provided a characterization of the
   distinct ORFRC subsurface microbial communities that contributed to
   increased concentrations of extracellular phosphate via hydrolysis of
   organophosphate substrate amendments. Within subsurface environments
   that are not ideal for reductive precipitation of uranium, strategies
   that harness microbial phosphate metabolism to promote uranium phosphate
   precipitation could offer an alternative approach for in situ
   sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate two types of polysulfone-based membranes (quaternary
   ammonium-functionalized anion exchange membrane and sulfonated proton
   exchange membrane) using molecular dynamics simulations to compare their
   nanophase-segregated structures and transport properties. Although the
   distribution of ionic groups on the polymer backbone is similar for both
   types, the quaternary ammonium groups and hydroxide ions in the anion
   exchange membrane are more solvated by water compared to the sulfonate
   groups and hydronium ions in the proton exchange membrane.
   Correspondingly, such better solvation of the ammonium groups and
   hydroxide ions leads the internal structure to a less matured hydrogen
   bonding network in the water phase, especially at low water content
   conditions. Through analysis of the nanophase segregation of the
   membranes, it is found that the characteristic correlation length has a
   similar value for both membranes, whereas the concentration contrast
   between the polymer domain and water phase is more distinct in the anion
   exchange membrane relative to the proton exchange membrane. Within such
   nanophase-segregated structures, it is found that the diffusion of
   hydroxide is similar to 6\% and similar to 11\% of that of hydronium at
   10 and 20 wt \% of water content, respectively, which might be due to
   the strong correlation at similar to 4 angstrom among the hydroxide in
   the anion exchange membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulation is used to examine the thermal slip of
   liquids at rough solid surfaces as characterized by fractal Cantor

   thermal slip, and interfacial thermal resistance are investigated and
   evaluated for a variety of surface topographies. In addition, the
   effects of liquid-solid interaction, surface stiffness, and boundary
   condition on thermal slip length are presented. Our results indicate
   that the presence of roughness expands the low potential energy regions
   in adjacent liquids, enhances the energy transfer at liquid-solid
   interface, and decreases the thermal slip. Interestingly, the thermal
   slip length and thermal resistance for liquids in contact with solid
   surfaces depends not only on the statistical roughness height, but also
   on the fractal dimension (i.e., topographical spectrum).}},

Abstract = {{Effectively harvesting ambient mechanical energy is the key for
   realizing self-powered and autonomous electronics, which addresses
   limitations of batteries and thus has tremendous applications in sensor
   networks, wireless devices, and wearable/implantable electronics, etc.
   Here, a thin-film-based micro-grating triboelectric nanogenerator
   (MG-TENG) is developed for high-efficiency power generation through
   conversion of mechanical energy. The shape-adaptive MG-TENG relies on
   sliding electrification between complementary micro-sized arrays of
   linear grating, which offers a unique and straightforward solution in
   harnessing energy from relative sliding motion between surfaces.
   Operating at a sliding velocity of 10 m/s, a MG-TENG of 60 cm(2) in
   overall area, 0.2 cm(3) in volume and 0.6 g in weight can deliver an
   average output power of 3 W (power density of similar to 50 mW cm(-2)
   and 15 W cm(-3)) at an overall conversion efficiency of similar to 50\%,
   making it a sufficient power supply to regular electronics, such as
   light bulbs. The scalable and cost-effective MG-TENG is practically
   applicable in not only harvesting various mechanical motions but also
   possibly power generation at a large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Biological productivity in many ocean regions is controlled by the
   availability of the nutrient phosphorus. In the Mediterranean Sea,
   aerosol deposition is a key source of phosphorus and understanding its
   composition is critical for determining its potential bioavailability.
   Aerosol phosphorus was investigated in European and North African air
   masses using phosphorus near-edge X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy
   (P-NEXFS). These air masses are the main source of aerosol deposition to
   the Mediterranean Sea. We show that European aerosols are a significant
   source of soluble phosphorus to the Mediterranean Sea. European aerosols
   deliver on average 3.5 times more soluble phosphorus than North African
   aerosols and furthermore are dominated by organic phosphorus compounds.
   The ultimate source of organic phosphorus does not stem from common
   primary emission sources. Rather, phosphorus associated with bacteria
   best explains the presence of organic phosphorus in Mediterranean
   aerosols.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoindentation is used to assess mechanical properties of ordered

   Estimates of strut properties are obtained under the standard scaling
   assumptions widely used in porous media. The inferred hardness and
   fracture toughness of individual struts are found to correspond to
   anatase titania, indicating the absence of obvious size effects in the
   nanostructured ceramic. This is in marked contrast to nanoporous metals,

Abstract = {{During the 2011 Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment
   (E-PEACE) and 2013 Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) field
   campaigns, a predominantly organic aerosol (> 85\% by mass) was observed
   in the free troposphere over marine stratocumulus off the coast of
   California. These particles originated from a densely forested region in
   the Northwestern United States. The organic mass spectrum resolved by
   positive matrix factorization is consistent with the mass spectra of
   previously measured biogenic organic aerosol. Particulate organic mass
   exhibits a latitudinal gradient that corresponds to the geographical
   distribution of vegetation density and composition, with the highest
   concentration over regions impacted by densely populated monoterpene
   sources. Due to meteorological conditions during summer months,
   cloud-clearing events transport aerosol from the Northwestern United
   States into the free troposphere above marine stratocumulus. Based on
   the variation of meteorological variables with altitude, dry air
   containing enhanced biogenic organic aerosol is shown to entrain into
   the marine boundary layer. Fresh impacts on cloud water composition are
   observed north of San Francisco, CA which is consistent with fresh
   continental impacts on the marine atmosphere at higher latitudes.
   Continental aerosol size distributions are bimodal. Particles in the
   100nm mode are impacted by biogenic sources, while particles in the
   approximate to 30nm mode may originate from fresh biogenic emissions.
   Continental aerosol in the 100nm mode is cloud condensation nuclei
   active and may play a role in modulating marine stratocumulus
   microphysics.}},

Abstract = {{Radiocarbon (14C) analysis is a unique tool to distinguish
   fossil/nonfossil sources of carbonaceous aerosols. We present 14C
   measurements of organic carbon (OC) and total carbon (TC) on highly time
   resolved filters (3-4 h, typically 12 h or longer have been reported)
   from 7 days collected during California Research at the Nexus of Air
   Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) 2010 in Pasadena. Average nonfossil
   contributions of 58\%+/- 15\% and 51\%+/- 15\% were found for OC and TC,
   respectively. Results indicate that nonfossil carbon is a major
   constituent of the background aerosol, evidenced by its nearly constant
   concentration (2-3 gC m-3). Cooking is estimated to contribute at least
   25\% to nonfossil OC, underlining the importance of urban nonfossil OC
   sources. In contrast, fossil OC concentrations have prominent and
   consistent diurnal profiles, with significant afternoon enhancements
   (similar to 3 gC m-3), following the arrival of the western Los Angeles
   (LA) basin plume with the sea breeze. A corresponding increase in
   semivolatile oxygenated OC and organic vehicular emission markers and
   their photochemical reaction products occurs. This suggests that the
   increasing OC is mostly from fresh anthropogenic secondary OC (SOC) from
   mainly fossil precursors formed in the western LA basin plume. We note
   that in several European cities where the diesel passenger car fraction
   is higher, SOC is 20\% less fossil, despite 2-3 times higher elemental
   carbon concentrations, suggesting that SOC formation from gasoline
   emissions most likely dominates over diesel in the LA basin. This would
   have significant implications for our understanding of the on-road
   vehicle contribution to ambient aerosols and merits further study.}},

Abstract = {{Journal of Cell Science Although current treatments for localized
   ovarian cancer are highly effective, this cancer still remains the most
   lethal gynecological malignancy, largely owing to the fact that it is
   often detected only after tumor cells leave the primary tumor.
   Clinicians have long noted a clear predilection for ovarian cancer to
   metastasize to the soft omentum. Here, we show that this tropism is due
   not only to chemical signals but also mechanical cues. Metastatic
   ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) preferentially adhere to soft
   microenvironments and display an enhanced malignant phenotype, including
   increased migration, proliferation and chemoresistance. To understand
   the cell-matrix interactions that are used to sense the substrate
   rigidity, we utilized traction force microscopy (TFM) and found that, on
   soft substrates, human OCCs increased both the magnitude of traction
   forces as well as their degree of polarization. After culture on soft
   substrates, cells underwent morphological elongation characteristic of
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was confirmed by
   molecular analysis. Consistent with the idea that mechanical cues are a
   key determinant in the spread of ovarian cancer, the observed
   mechanosensitivity was greatly decreased in less-metastatic OCCs.
   Finally, we demonstrate that this mechanical tropism is governed through
   a Rho-ROCK signaling pathway.}},

   Then, we obtain the invariance of the support of density for the smooth
   solutions with compactly supported initial mass density by the property
   of the system under the vacuum state. Based on the above-mentioned
   results, we prove that we cannot get a global classical solution, no
   matter how small the initial data are, as long as the initial mass
   density is of compact support. Finally, we will see that some of the
   results that we obtained are still valid for the isentropic flows with
   degenerate viscosity coefficients as well as for one-dimensional case.

Abstract = {{Despite the important role of ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) in reverse
   electrodialysis (RED) systems, the current absence of proper
   ion-exchange membranes delays the sustainable development of the RED
   process for salinity gradient power generation. This research presents
   the preparation of a new type of organic-inorganic nanocomposite cation
   exchange membrane and its performance characteristics. The combination
   of functionalized iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3-SO42-) as an inorganic filler
   with the sulfonated poly (2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (sPPO)
   polymer matrix proved to have great potential for power generation by
   RED. The results showed that an optimal amount of Fe2O3-SO42- (05-0.7
   wt\%) enhanced the key electrochemical properties of the ion-exchange
   membranes including a permselectivity up to 87.65\% and an area
   resistance of 0.87 Omega cm(2). The nanocomposite membrane containing
   0.7 wt\% (Fe2O3-SO42- achieved a maximum power density (amount of power
   per unit membrane area) of 1.3 W m(-2), which is relatively higher than
   that of the commercially available CSO (Selemion (TM), Japan) membranes.
   The goal of the present work is to maximize the salinity gradient power
   generation by developing RED-specific nanocomposite IEMs. The results
   show the potential of the new design of the nanocomposite IEMs for
   viable energy generation by RED. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables is greatly influenced by
   environmental conditions. Increasing temperature usually results in
   accelerated loss of quality and shelf-life reduction, which is not
   physically visible until too late in the supply chain to adjust
   logistics to match shelf life. A blackberry study showed that
   temperatures inside pallets varied significantly and 57\% of the berries
   arriving at the packinghouse did not have enough remaining shelf life
   for the longest supply routes. Yet, the advanced shelf-life loss was not
   physically visible. Some of those pallets would be sent on longer supply
   routes than necessary, creating avoidable waste. Other studies showed
   that variable pre-cooling at the centre of pallets resulted in
   physically invisible uneven shelf life. We have shown that using simple
   temperature measurements much waste can be avoided using `first expiring
   first out'. Results from our studies showed that shelf-life prediction
   should not be based on a single quality factor as, depending on the
   temperature history, the quality attribute that limits shelf life may
   vary. Finally, methods to use air temperature to predict product
   temperature for highest shelf-life prediction accuracy in the absence of
   individual sensors for each monitored product have been developed. Our
   results show a significant reduction of up to 98\% in the
   root-mean-square-error difference between the product temperature and
   air temperature when advanced estimation methods are used.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of primary amine grafted mesoporous SBA-15 silica
   adsorbents with alkyl linker length varying from methyl to propyl
   (SBA-Methyl, SBA-Ethyl, SBA-Propyl) is investigated with respect to
   thermal, oxidative, and CO2 induced degradation to assess how
   differences in stability may result from different chain lengths.
   Methyl-based materials are found to have no thermal stability, with a
   severe reduction in amine content of up to 80\% upon heating to 135
   degrees C, and were therefore unable to be assessed for oxidative or CO2
   specific instabilities. SBA-Ethyl and SBA-Propyl adsorbents are both
   thermally and oxidatively stable but are prone to urea induced
   deactivation in the presence of high-temperature, dry CO2 for prolonged
   periods. A greater extent of CO2 capacity deactivation is observed for
   SBA-Propyl materials, which is attributed to the larger amine efficiency
   of the material as compared to that of SBA-Ethyl adsorbents, as this
   would translate to a greater percentage of amines interacting with CO2
   that could then be susceptible to deactivation upon heating. DFT
   calculations are used to assess CO2 induced urea formation pathways,
   leading to an energetically favored pathway for CO2 induced degradation,
   as well as to compare differences in stability between the varied alkyl
   chain lengths. We show that an isocyanate intermediate provides the
   lowest-energy route to urea formation and also that amine or silanol
   assisted deactivation lowers the energy barrier of deactivation, thus
   supporting the observation that high efficiency SBA-Propyl adsorbents
   are prone to a higher degree of deactivation under dry, high-temperature
   CO2 exposure conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Collecting and converting energy from ambient air flow promise to be a
   viable approach in developing self-powered autonomous electronics. Here,
   we report an effective and robust triboelectric generator that consists
   of an undulating thin-film membrane and an array of segmented fine-sized
   electrode pairs on a single substrate. Sequential processes of contact
   electrification and electrostatic induction generate alternating flows
   of free electrons when the membrane interacts with ambient air flow.
   Based on an optimum rational design, the segmented electrodes play an
   essential role in boosting the output current, leading to an enhancement
   of over 500\% compared to the structure without the segmentation. The
   thin-film based generator can simultaneously and continuously light up
   tens of commercial light-emitting diodes. Moreover, it possesses
   exceptional durability, providing constant electric output after
   millions of operation cycles. This work offers a truly practical
   solution that opens the avenue to take advantage of wind energy by using
   the triboelectric effect.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a sexithienyl and two donor acceptor donor oligothiophenes,
   employing benzothiadiazole and isoindigo as electron-acceptors, each
   functionalized with a phosphonic acid group for anchoring onto TiO2

   (DSSCs). These dyes absorb light to wavelengths as long as 700 nm, as
   their optical HOMO/LUMO energy gaps are reduced from 2.40 to 1.77 eV
   with increasing acceptor strength. The oligomers were adsorbed onto
   mesoporous TiO2 films on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrates
   and incorporated into DSSCs, which show AM1.5 power conversion
   efficiencies (PCEs) ranging between 2.6\% and 6.4\%. This work
   demonstrates that the donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) molecular structures
   coupled to phosphonic acid anchoring groups, which have not been used in
   DSSCs, can lead to high PCEs.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a newly invented technology that
   is effective using conventional organic materials with functionalized
   surfaces for converting mechanical energy into electricity, which is
   light weight, cost-effective and easy scalable. Here, we present the
   first systematic analysis and comparison of EMIG and TENG from their
   working mechanisms, governing equations and output characteristics,
   aiming at establishing complementary applications of the two
   technologies for harvesting various mechanical energies. The equivalent
   transformation and conjunction operations of the two power sources for
   the external circuit are also explored, which provide appropriate
   evidences that the TENG can be considered as a current source with a
   large internal resistance, while the EMIG is equivalent to a voltage
   source with a small internal resistance. The theoretical comparison and
   experimental validations presented in this paper establish the basis of
   using the TENG as a new energy technology that could be parallel or
   possibly equivalently important as the EMIG for general power
   application at large-scale. It opens a field of organic nanogenerator
   for chemists and materials scientists who can be first time using
   conventional organic materials for converting mechanical energy into
   electricity at a high efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We report a robust synthesis of Ag@Au core-shell nanocubes by directly
   depositing Au atoms on the surfaces of Ag nanocubes as conformal,
   ultrathin shells. Our success relies on the introduction of a strong
   reducing agent to compete with and thereby block the galvanic
   replacement between Ag and HAuCl4. An ultrathin Au shell of 0.6 nm thick
   was able to protect the Ag in the core in an oxidative environment.
   Significantly, the core shell nanocubes exhibited surface plasmonic
   properties essentially identical to those of the original Ag nano cubes,
   while the SERS activity showed a 5.4-fold further enhancement owing to
   an improvement in chemical enhancement. The combination of excellent
   SERS activity and chemical stability may enable a variety of new
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Following exposure to ppm-level hydrogen sulfide at elevated
   temperatures, a section of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) Ni-YSZ anode
   was examined using a combination of synchrotron-based x-ray
   nanotomography and x-ray fluorescence techniques. While fluorescence
   measurements provided elemental identification and coarse spatial
   mapping, x-ray nanotomography was used to map the detailed 3-D spatial
   distribution of Ni, YSZ, and a nickel-sulfur poisoning phase. The
   nickel-sulfur layer was found to form a scale covering most of the
   exposed nickel surface, blocking most fuel reformation and hydrogen
   oxidation reaction sites. Although the exposure conditions precluded the
   ability to develop a detailed kinetic description of the nickel-sulfur
   phase formation, the results provide strong evidence of the detrimental
   effects of 100 ppm hydrogen sulfide on typical Ni-YSZ anode materials.}},

Abstract = {{High performance titanium nitride sub-100 nm rectifying contact,
   deposited by sputtering on AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors,
   shows a reverse leakage current as low as 38 pA/mm at V-GS = -40V and a
   Schottky barrier height of 0.95 eV. Based on structural characterization
   and 3D simulations, it is found that the polarization gradient induced
   by the gate metallization forms a P-type pseudo-doping region under the
   gate between the tensile surface and the compressively strained bulk
   AlGaN barrier layer. The strain induced by the gate metallization can
   compensate for the piezoelectric component. As a result, the gate
   contact can operate at temperatures as high as 700 degrees C and can
   withstand a large reverse bias of up to -100 V, which is interesting for
   high-performance transistors dedicated to power applications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We measure ion heating following transport throughout a Y-junction
   surface-electrode ion trap. By carefully selecting the trap voltage
   update rate during adiabatic transport along a trap arm, we observe
   minimal heating relative to the anomalous heating background. Transport
   through the junction results in an induced heating between 37 and 150
   quanta in the axial direction per traverse. To reliably measure heating
   in this range, we compare the experimental sideband envelope, including
   up to fourth-order sidebands, to a theoretical model. The sideband
   envelope method allows us to cover the intermediate heating range
   inaccessible to the first-order sideband and Doppler recooling methods.
   We conclude that quantum information processing in this ion trap will
   likely require sympathetic cooling in order to support high fidelity
   gates after junction transport.}},

Abstract = {{To engineer the desired properties of fibrous porous media, a parametric
   modeling approach is needed to support the rational design of the
   materials before the fabrication. In this study, we propose a
   methodology that enables the accurate representation of
   three-dimensional (3D) microstructures of fibrous porous media and
   prediction of their transport properties. Toray TGP-H-060 gas diffusion
   layer (GDL) is selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of
   the suggested design methodology. The detailed microstructure of the GDL
   with the inclusion of locally distributed binder is constructed using an
   extended periodic surface (PS) modeling technique. A 3D morphological
   approach is taken to create the binder distribution within the fibrous
   microstructure. Transport properties including permeability, relative
   diffusivity, and tortuosity and local structure characteristics of the
   generated microstructure, under different binder loading are calculated.
   It is shown that the detailed model of the fiber-binder composite has a
   strong influence on the predicted properties. Copyright (C) 2014,

Abstract = {{This study was to investigate the mechanisms of ischemic mitral
   regurgitation (IMR) by using a finite element (FE) approach. IMR is a
   common complication of coronary artery disease; and it usually occurs
   due to myocardial infarction. The pathophysiological mechanisms of IMR
   have not been fully understood, much debate remains about the exact
   contribution of each mechanism to IMR. Two patient-specific FE models of
   normal mitral valves (MV) were reconstructed from multi-slice computed
   tomography scans. Different grades of IMR during its pathogenesis were
   created by perturbation of the normal MV geometry. Effects of annular
   dilatation and papillary muscle (PM) displacement (both isolated and
   combined) on the severity of IMR were examined. We observed greater
   increase in IMR (in terms of regurgitant area and coaptation length) in
   response to isolated annular dilatation than that caused by isolated PM
   displacement, while a larger PM displacement resulted in higher PM
   forces. Annular dilation, combined with PM displacement, was able to
   significantly increase the severity of IMR and PM forces. Our
   simulations demonstrated that isolated annular dilatation might be a
   more important determinant of IMR than isolated PM displacement, which
   could help explain the clinical observation that annular size reduction
   by restrictive annuloplasty is generally effective in treating IMR. (C)

Abstract = {{The considerable blood mixing in the bidirectional Glenn (BDG)
   physiology further limits the capacity of the single working ventricle
   to pump enough oxygenated blood to the circulatory system. This
   condition is exacerbated under severe conditions such as physical
   activity or high altitude. In this study, the effect of high altitude
   exposure on hemodynamics and ventricular function of the BDG physiology
   is investigated. For this purpose, a mathematical approach based on a
   lumped parameter model was developed to model the BOG circulation.
   Catheterization data from 39 BOG patients at stabilized oxygen
   conditions was used to determine baseline flows and pressures for the
   model. The effect of high altitude exposure was modeled by increasing
   the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and heart rate (HR) in
   increments up to 80\% and 40\%, respectively. The resulting differences
   in vascular flows, pressures and ventricular function parameters were
   analyzed. By simultaneously increasing PVR and HR, significant changes
   (p < 0.05) were observed in cardiac index (11\% increase at an 80\% PVR
   and 40\% HR increase) and pulmonary flow (26\% decrease at an 80\% PVR
   and 40\% HR increase). Significant increase in mean systemic pressure
   (9\%) was observed at 80\% PVR (40\% HR) increase. The results show that
   the poor ventricular function fails to overcome the increased preload
   and implied low oxygenation in BDG patients at higher altitudes,
   especially for those with high baseline PVRs. The presented mathematical
   model provides a framework to estimate the hemodynamic performance of
   BDG patients at different PVR increments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Atlanta Commuters Exposure (ACE) Study was designed to measure
   in-cabin exposure to roadway particulate pollution and acute health
   response in a panel of adults with and without asthma following a 2-h
   scripted route along major highways in Atlanta. This article focuses on
   methods and results of both continuous and integrated approaches used to
   measure the concentration of PM2.5 mass, particle number concentration
   (PNC), black carbon (BC) mass, and particle-bound PAHs, in-cabin noise,
   PM elemental composition, elemental carbon, organic carbon,
   water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) content, and speciation of a broad
   range of organic compounds including alkanes, hopanes, and PAHs.
   Speciated PM data indicates that in-cabin particles derive from three
   non-co-varying processes: the resuspension of road dust containing
   crustal elements and previously-deposited brake pad residue with a
   contribution of normal fuel combustion, incomplete combustion processes
   producing PAHs and carbon particles, and particles ablated from brake
   pads that have not previously deposited to the roadside environment.
   Most in-cabin pollutants were elevated during the warm season with the
   notable exception of PNC. PNC was not found to be correlated with most
   other pollutants. In-cabin concentrations were marginally higher when
   windows were open.

Abstract = {{Economic losses from natural disasters due to extreme wind hazards, such
   as hurricanes or tornadoes, have been significant in recent years, and
   recent amendments to building design standards have been aimed at
   mitigating the risk from catastrophic wind storms. Public and
   professional attitudes regarding building performance and willingness to
   accept risk from wind hazards are reflected in these amended standards.
   In general, attitudes of decision-makers towards risk can be categorised
   as risk-accepting, risk-neutral and risk-averse. Recent studies of risk
   attitudes have suggested that individuals or small group decision-makers
   tend to be risk-averse when confronting low-probability,
   high-consequence hazards. In this paper, risk-acceptance attitudes
   towards extreme wind hazards are explored utilising cumulative prospect
   theory to establish a context for how this hazard is viewed in
   comparison to other hazards affecting buildings. Two case studies are
   considered, the first involving low-rise residential buildings designed
   for hurricane winds according to North and South Carolina practice in
   2001 and the second related to high-rise commercial office buildings
   designed for wind and earthquake in Los Angeles, CA; Charleston, SC and
   Boston, MA. A comparison of risk attitudes towards these competing
   natural hazards reveals that risk-acceptance is more prevalent for wind
   than for seismic hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene is a promising material for future electronic applications and
   chemical vapor deposition of graphene on copper is a promising method
   for synthesizing graphene on the wafer scale. The processing of such

   residues from the graphene channel is presented in which a thin layer of
   titanium is deposited via thermal e-beam evaporation and immediately
   removed. This procedure does not damage the graphene as evidenced by
   Raman spectroscopy, greatly enhances the electrical performance of the
   fabricated graphene field effect transistors, and completely removes the
   chemical residues from the surface of the graphene channel as evidenced
   by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Of the many fullerene derivatives that have been examined, cationic
   functionalization has proven to be most promising for aqueous or
   biological applications. Until recently, however, no cationic colloidal
   fullerene aggregates in the nanosize regime have been characterized in
   the aqueous phase. The results presented here represent the most rapid
   and efficient, to the best of our knowledge, viral inactivation reported
   for any colloidal fullerene aggregates. Tris-adducted
   fulleropyrrolidinium aggregates are prepared and analyzed for
   concentration-dependent singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) production and MS2
   bacteriophage inactivation. Experiments are performed under visible,
   UVA, and sunlight irradiation with the addition of natural organic
   matter (NOM) to simulate environmental conditions. Viral inactivation
   was observed at sensitizer concentrations in the nanomolar range. A
   5-log inactivation of MS2 was observed after 4 or 1 min of sunlight
   exposure with 250 nM fullerenes with or without NOM, respectively. The
   environmental implications of these results are discussed in the context

Abstract = {{In the two previous decades, high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes have been
   used to provide shorter and reliable travel option utilizing congestion
   pricing. To investigate the disproportionate distribution of the HOT
   lane benefits among demographic groups, previous studies have conducted
   surveys from a small portion of the travelers. Considering the high cost
   and time-intensiveness of surveys, this study proposes the application
   of vehicle value as a proxy for income on the Atlanta I-85 HOT corridor.
   More than 300,000 license-plate records were collected across all the
   lanes during peak periods of spring and summer 2012. The State vehicle
   registration database was employed to obtain vehicle characteristics
   from license-plate observations, which were then processed to estimate
   vehicle value. The results show that there is 23\% difference between
   average vehicle value across HOT lane and general purpose lanes. To
   support the proposed methodology, the research team used targeted market
   income data which demonstrates notably similar trends of differences
   across the lanes. This study once again rejects the concept of ``Lexus
   Lane{''} by illustrating that significant amount of low-income users are
   using the HOT lane; however, very high income travelers are using HOT
   lane twice as frequent as low-income travelers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A framework for determining road pricing revenue use and its welfare

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{61-70}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the last five decades, much of the focus on travel cost has been on
   what form pricing should take, whether it should be a direct road toll,
   in the form a Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) tax, encapsulated in the gas
   tax, or by some other mechanism. An area that has received much less
   attention, but is nonetheless important when considering any pricing
   change, is the impact of such mechanisms on traveler welfare and travel
   time savings. While an increase in the cost of travel may achieve
   traffic flow efficiencies, it may also unduly burden low-income
   travelers or unjustly benefit higher-income drivers. An important aspect
   of the road pricing debate is not just whether pricing will produce an
   efficient market, but also if such pricing is implemented, how the
   generated revenue will be managed. We propose a model to analyze
   transport equity by measuring change in traveler welfare and travel time
   savings as a result of a mix of road pricing, revenue recycling (tax
   cuts) and transit subsidies. In this paper we introduce a multimodal
   travel demand model to incorporate road pricing mechanisms with various
   subsidy options. A base case and five scenarios are developed to address
   various hypothetical pricing scenarios. We find the structure of the
   road pricing mechanism on average has a small impact on annual per
   capita traveler welfare. Replacing the state gas tax with a VMT tax can
   have a positive impact on traveler welfare, particularly for
   lower-income groups and rural residents. A VMT tax increase would be the
   least detrimental to welfare, especially for low-income groups. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems are very promising for waste heat
   recovery. This work analyzes the performance of a near-field TPV device
   with a gold reflecting layer on the backside of the cell. The radiative
   transfer from a tungsten radiator, at a temperature ranging from 1250 K
   to 2000 K, to an In0.18Ga0.82Sb TPV cell at 300 K is calculated using
   fluctuational electrodynamics. The current generation by the absorbed
   photon energy is modeled by the minority carrier diffusion equations
   considering recombination. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell
   is determined from the generated electrical power and the net absorbed
   radiant power per unit area. A parametric study of the cell efficiency
   considering the gap spacing and other parameters is conducted. For an
   emitter at temperature 1250 K, the efficiency enhancement by adding a
   mirror, which reduces the sub-bandgap radiation, is shown to be as much
   as 35\% relative to a semi-infinite TPV cell. In addition, the potential
   for further improvement by reducing surface recombination velocity from
   that of a perfect ohmic contact is examined. The cell performance is
   shown to increase with decreasing gap spacing below a critical surface
   recombination velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical oxidation of multilayer graphene grown on silicon carbide
   yields films exhibiting reproducible characteristics, lateral
   uniformity, smoothness over large areas, and manageable chemical
   complexity, thereby opening opportunities to accelerate both fundamental
   understanding and technological applications of this form of graphene
   oxide films. Here, we investigate the vertical inter-layer structure of
   these ultra-thin oxide films. X-ray diffraction, atomic force
   microscopy, and IR experiments show that the multilayer films exhibit
   excellent inter-layer registry, little amount (<10\%) of intercalated
   water, and unexpectedly large interlayer separations of about 9.35
   angstrom. Density functional theory calculations show that the apparent
   contradiction of ``little water but large interlayer spacing in the
   graphene oxide films{''} can be explained by considering a multilayer
   film formed by carbon layers presenting, at the nanoscale, a
   non-homogenous oxidation, where non-oxidized and highly oxidized
   nano-domains coexist and where a few water molecules trapped between
   oxidized regions of the stacked layers are sufficient to account for the
   observed large inter-layer separations. This work sheds light on both
   the vertical and intra-layer structure of graphene oxide films grown on
   silicon carbide, and more in general, it provides novel insight on the
   relationship between inter-layer spacing, water content, and structure

Abstract = {{Sorption and fixation of Cs by the upland soils of the US Department of
   Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) have been attributed to micaceous
   grains consisting mostly of hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV).
   Results of experiments to characterize SRS soil samples, to examine
   aspects of their radiocesium sorption, and to determine how much of
   their natural Cs is accessible for chemical extraction and isotope
   dilution are presented in support of mechanistic hypotheses to explain
   Cs sorption and fixation in HIV grains. The HIV is responsible for most
   of the soil cation exchange capacity, and concentrations of naturally
   occurring Cs, Rb, and K in soil samples are closely related to the
   concentration of HIV. Experiments with Cs-137 to examine (1) sorption
   kinetics, (2) blocking of exchange sites with silver thiourea, and (3)
   susceptibility of sorbed Cs-137 to chemical extraction, support the idea
   that added Cs is sorbed at different kinds of cation exchange sites in
   HIV grains. Sites highly selective for Cs but relatively few in number
   are inferred to exist in interlayer wedge zones within such grains.
   Little of the naturally occurring Cs in the soil samples was extractable
   by chemical agents that would remove Cs from ordinary cation-exchange
   sites and from within non-silicate soil components. Furthermore, most of
   the natural Cs was inaccessible for isotope dilution under slightly
   acidic conditions approximating the natural soil environment. These
   observations support the idea that most of the Cs in these soils has
   become effectively fixed in the narrower parts of interlayer wedge
   zones. Control of Cs uptake and fixation by highly Cs-selective
   interlayer wedge sites would account for the large distribution
   coefficients found for Cs-137 at the low aqueous Cs concentrations
   typical of environmental systems and also for the relatively large
   concentrations of stable Cs in the SRS soils.}},

Abstract = {{Geotextiles are porous and fibrous materials that consist of randomly
   oriented and isotropically distributed long filaments which vary in
   terms of spatial distribution, curvature, orientation, size, and mass
   density. The heterogeneous internal structure of geotextiles constituted
   from individual/discrete fibers and having different micro-structure and
   macro-structure properties are prone to exhibit dissimilar tensile
   stress-strain behavior (i.e. progressive versus reactionary) as well as
   showing favorable versus adverse response to varied experimental
   conditions such as temperature and strain rate change when tested at
   macro scale as opposed to micro-scale level. To this end, in order to
   evaluate thermo-tensile strength properties as well as to characterize
   tensile extension behavior of single geotextile filaments at micro-scale
   level, micro-mechanical tensile tests were performed at different
   temperatures using a Dynamic Thermo-Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) on single
   filaments extracted from polypropylene needle punched nonwoven
   geotextile. Various test temperatures between 21 degrees C and 50
   degrees C were chosen to represent and simulate the wide range of
   temperatures encountered in the field for geotechnical applications such
   as landfill base liners. The paper also presents a statistical analysis
   of the results of the test program to provide a basis for comparison of
   inherent filament variability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{As the human society is facing potentially significant environmental
   impacts due to climate change, accurate impact assessments of sea level
   rise (SLR) are also critically needed. In this study, to conduct
   reliable SLR projection and inundation assessment, an integrated
   modeling framework is proposed and the application of this methodology
   is demonstrated for the State of Florida, USA. This framework utilizes a
   dynamic system model (DSM) with spatial analysis capability to predict
   the regional sea level change. The DSM projections are then used for
   geographic information system (GIS) based inundation analysis. Results
   show that the proposed methodology provides reliable inundation
   assessment for the likely scenario of spatially variable SLR over the
   21st century and can be utilized in other coastal regions of the world
   to aid management decision in a timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models are frequently used to predict population trends in
   biologic systems, ecologic applications, as well as for human
   populations. Most commonly these models are developed for static
   conditions for stable population trends that reflect the carrying
   capacity of the system under study. In this study we extend this concept
   to the analysis of dynamic carrying capacity of earth systems as these
   limits may change as a time-dependent function of the external stresses
   that are imposed on the system. It is anticipated that this would
   represent a typical case for environmental systems where the carrying
   capacity of the system is a function of future climatic conditions. This
   question was tackled in the literature qualitatively, indicating that
   sustainable population levels may collapse in view of adverse climatic
   conditions. In this study a model of this type is proposed and the
   stability conditions of world population are evaluated quantitatively
   for some scenarios. The outcome observed is that within the projected
   temperature increase ranges of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) studies (1-6 degrees C) the carrying capacity stability levels of
   world population will be mostly maintained albeit at much lower levels
   than present. However, for temperature increase scenarios close to and
   beyond similar to 6 degrees C the world population may lose its
   stability characteristics, in which case drastic changes in population
   levels are expected. These quantitative observations indicate the
   urgency of imposing controls over increasing temperatures worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are very popular for both graphics and
   general-purpose applications. Since GPUs operate many processing units
   and manage multiple levels of memory hierarchy, they consume a
   significant amount of power. Although several power models for CPUs are
   available, the power consumption of GPUs has not been studied much yet.
   In this article we develop a new power model for GPUs by utilizing
   McPAT, a CPU power tool. We generate initial power model data from McPAT
   with a detailed GPU configuration, and then adjust the models by
   comparing them with empirical data. We use the NVIDIA's Fermi
   architecture for building the power model, and our model estimates the
   GPU power consumption with an average error of 7.7\% and 12.8\% for the
   microbenchmarks and Merge benchmarks, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Sugars play an important role in various physiological processes during
   plant growth and development; however, the developmental roles and
   regulatory functions of hexoses other than glucose are still largely
   unclear. Recent studies suggest that blocked embryo development in
   Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) is associated with accumulation
   of fructose. In the present study, the potential biochemical regulatory
   mechanism of glucose and fructose was studied during development of
   somatic embryos of Norway spruce from pro-embryogenic masses to mature
   embryos. The changes in protein fluorescence, a marker of the Maillard
   reaction, were monitored in two cell lines of Norway spruce that were
   grown on media containing sucrose (control), glucose or fructose. Manual
   time-lapse photography showed that growth of embryogenic cultures on
   medium containing sucrose was characterized by normal development of
   mature embryos whereas the embryogenic cultures that were grown on media
   containing glucose or fructose did not develop mature embryos. The
   biochemical analyses of embryogenic samples collected during embryo
   development showed that: (i) the content of glucose and fructose in the
   embryogenic cultures increased significantly during growth on each
   medium, respectively; (ii) the accumulation of Maillard products in the
   embryogenic cultures was highly correlated with the endogenous content
   of fructose but not glucose; and (iii) the embryogenic cultures grown on
   fructose displayed the highest protein carbonyl content and DNA damage
   whereas the highest content of glutathione was recorded in the
   embryogenic cultures that had grown on sucrose. Our data suggest that
   blocked development of embryos in the presence of fructose may be
   associated with the Maillard reaction.}},

   empirically verify that these techniques are significantly effective in

Abstract = {{Central-pattern-generating neural circuits function reliably throughout
   an animal's life, despite constant molecular turnover and environmental
   perturbations. Fluctuations in temperature pose a problem to the nervous
   systems of poikilotherms because their body temperature follows the
   ambient temperature, thus affecting the temperature-dependent dynamics
   of various subcellular components that constitute neuronal circuits. In
   the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, the pyloric circuit
   produces a triphasic rhythm comprising the output of the pyloric
   dilator, lateral pyloric, and pyloric constrictor neurons. In vitro, the
   phase relationships of these neurons are maintained over a fourfold
   change in pyloric frequency as temperature increases from 7 degrees C to
   23 degrees C. To determine whether these temperature effects are also
   found in intact crabs, in the presence of sensory feedback and
   neuromodulator-rich environments, we measured the temperature dependence
   of the pyloric frequency and phases in vivo by implanting extracellular
   electrodes into Cancer borealis and Cancer pagurus and shifting tank
   water temperature from 11 degrees C to 26 degrees C. Pyloric frequency
   in the intact crab increased significantly with temperature (Q(10) =
   2-2.5), while pyloric phases were generally conserved. For a subset of
   the C. borealis experiments, animals were subsequently dissected and the
   stomatogastric ganglion subjected to a similar temperature ramp in
   vitro. We found that the maximal frequency attained at high temperatures
   in vivo is lower than it is under in vitro conditions. Our results
   demonstrate that, over a wide temperature range, the phases of the
   pyloric rhythm in vivo are generally preserved, but that the frequency
   range is more restricted than it is in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting from ambient water motions is a desirable but
   underexplored solution to on-site energy demand for self-powered
   electronics. Here we report a liquid-solid electrification-enabled
   generator based on a fluorinated ethylene propylene thin film, below
   which an array of electrodes are fabricated. The surface of the thin
   film is charged first due to the water-solid contact electrification.
   Aligned nanowires created on the thin film make it hydrophobic and also
   increase the surface area. Then the asymmetric screening to the surface
   charges by the waving water during emerging and submerging processes
   causes the free electrons on the electrodes to flow through an external
   load, resulting in power generation. The generator produces sufficient
   output power for driving an array of small electronics during direct
   interaction with water bodies, including surface waves and falling
   drops. Polymer-nanowire-based surface modification increases the contact
   area at the liquid-solid interface, leading to enhanced surface charging
   density and thus electric output at an efficiency of 7.7\%. Our
   planar-structured generator features an all-in-one design without
   separate and movable components for capturing and transmitting
   mechanical energy. It has extremely lightweight and small volume, making
   it a portable, flexible, and convenient power solution that can be
   applied on the ocean/river surface, at coastal/offshore areas, and even
   in rainy places. Considering the demonstrated scalability, it can also
   be possibly used in large-scale energy generation if layers of planar
   sheets are connected into a network.}},

Abstract = {{We present a plasmon-active hybrid nanomaterial design with
   electrochemical tunability of the localized surface plasmon resonances.
   The plasmonic-active nanostructures are composed of silver nanocube
   aggregates embedded into an electrochromic polymer coating on an indium
   tin oxide electrode with the nanocube aggregation controlled by the
   surface pressure. Such polymer-nanocube hybrid nanomaterials
   demonstrated unique tunable plasmonic behavior under an applied
   electrochemical potential. A significant reversible experimental peak
   shift of 22 nm at an electrical potential of 200 mV has been achieved in
   these measurements. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
   show that, under full oxidation potential, a maximal spectral shift of
   ca. 80 nm can be potentially achieved, which corresponds to a high
   sensitivity of 178 nm per refractive index unit. Furthermore, FDTD
   modeling suggests that the electrochemically controlled tunability of
   plasmonic peaks is caused by reversible changes in the refractive index
   of the electrochromic polymer coating caused by oxidation or reduction
   reactions under external electrical potential. Consequently, we define
   the orthogonal plasmonic resonance shift as a shift that is orthogonal
   to the redox process responsible for the refractive index change. On the
   basis of these results, we suggest that the combination of anisotropic
   nanostructures and electrochromic matrix has the potential to reversibly
   electrically tune plasmonic resonances over the full visible spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Smart garments for monitoring physiological and biomechanical signals of
   the human body are key sensors for personalized healthcare. However,
   they typically require bulky battery packs or have to be plugged into an

   particularly desirable. Here, we demonstrated a metal-free fiber-based
   generator (FBG) via a simple, cost-effective method by using commodity
   cotton threads, a polytetrafluoroethylene aqueous suspension, and carbon
   nanotubes as source materials. The FBGs can convert biomechanical
   motions/vibration energy into electricity utilizing the electrostatic
   effect with an average output power density of similar to 0.1 mu W/cm(2)
   and have been identified as an effective building element for a power
   shirt to trigger a wireless body temperature sensor system. Furthermore,
   the FBG was demonstrated as a self-powered active sensor to
   quantitatively detect human motion.}},

Abstract = {{When water is passing through the air or an insulating tube, it will
   contain not only the mechanical energy but also the electrostatic energy
   due to the existence of triboelectric charges on its surface as a result
   of contact with the air/solid surface. In this paper, a hybrid
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is designed to simultaneously harvest
   the electrostatic and mechanical energies of flowing water. Water-TENG,
   mainly constructed by a superhydrophobic TiO2 layer with hierarchical
   micro/nanostructures, is used to collect the electrostatic energy of
   water (Output 1). Contact-TENG, composed by a polytetrafluoroethylene
   film and a layer of assembled SiO2 nanoparticles, is used to collect the
   mechanical energy of water (Output 1 and Output 2). Using TiO2
   nanomaterials in water-TENG provides the advantages of photocatalytic
   activity and antibacterial property for water purification. Under the
   impact of a water stream from a household faucet at a flowing rate of 40
   mL s(-1), the generated short-circuit current from Output 1 and Output 2
   of dual-mode TENG can reach 43 and 18 mu A, respectively. The
   instantaneous output power densities from Output 1 and Output 2 of
   dual-mode TENG are 1.31 and 0.38 W m(-2), respectively, when connecting
   to a load resistor of 44 M Omega. The rectified outputs have been
   applied to drive light-emitting diodes and charge commercial capacitors.
   Besides, the water-TENG has also been demonstrated as a self-powered
   nanosensor for ethanol detection.}},

Abstract = {{At metal/organic interfaces, the insertion of an organic monolayer can
   significantly modify the surface properties of the substrate, especially
   in terms of charge injection across the interface. Herein, we study the
   formation of an insulating monolayer of morpholine or
   amine-functionalized polystyrene on Al(111) and Au(111) surfaces and its
   impact on surface work-function and charge injection. First-principles
   calculations based on Density Functional Theory have been carried out
   and point to a significant decrease in the work-function of modified
   metal surfaces; this is in very good agreement with ultraviolet
   photoemission spectroscopy measurements performed on the Au(111)
   surface. In addition, a bilayer cathode, consisting of a thin film of
   high-work-function metal, such as Al and Au, and a layer of
   amine-functionalized polystyrene, was also fabricated and tested in
   organic light-emitting diodes. Such bilayer structures exhibit
   substantially enhanced efficiency when compared with controls without
   the functionalized polymers. Our combined theoretical and experimental
   investigation gives insight into how a thin layer of a commodity polymer
   can be used to transform rather high-work-function metals into
   high-performance cathodes to provide efficient electron injection.}},

Title = {{Use of the swim bladder and lateral line in near-field sound source

Abstract = {{We investigated the roles of the swim bladder and the lateral line
   system in sound localization behavior by the plainfin midshipman fish
   (Porichthys notatus). Reproductive female midshipman underwent either
   surgical deflation of the swim bladder or cryoablation of the lateral
   line and were then tested in a monopolar sound source localization task.
   Fish with nominally `deflated' swim bladders performed similar to
   sham-deflated controls; however, post-experiment evaluation of swim
   bladder deflation revealed that a majority of `deflated' fish (88\%,
   seven of the eight fish) that exhibited positive phonotaxis had
   partially inflated swim bladders. In total, 95\% (21/22) of fish that
   localized the source had at least partially inflated swim bladders,
   indicating that pressure reception is likely required for sound source
   localization. In lateral line experiments, no difference was observed in
   the proportion of females exhibiting positive phonotaxis with ablated
   (37\%) versus sham-ablated (47\%) lateral line systems. These data
   suggest that the lateral line system is likely not required for sound
   source localization, although this system may be important for
   fine-tuning the approach to the sound source. We found that midshipman
   can solve the 180 deg ambiguity of source direction in the shallow water
   of our test tank, which is similar to their nesting environment. We also
   found that the potential directional cues (phase relationship between
   pressure and particle motion) in shallow water differs from a
   theoretical free-field. Therefore, the general question of how fish use
   acoustic pressure cues to solve the 180 deg ambiguity of source
   direction from the particle motion vector remains unresolved.}},

Volume = {{217}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2089-2100}},

Abstract = {{To overcome obstacles and survive harsh environments, fire ants link
   their bodies together to form self-assemblages such as rafts, bridges
   and bivouacs. Such structures are examples of self-assembling and
   self-healing materials, as ants can quickly create and break links with
   one another in response to changes in their environment. Because ants
   are opaque, the arrangement of the ants within these three-dimensional
   networks was previously unknown. In this experimental study, we applied
   micro-scale computed tomography, or micro-CT, to visualize the
   connectivity, arrangement and orientation of ants within an assemblage.
   We identified active and geometric mechanisms that ants use to obtain
   favorable packing properties with respect to well-studied packing of
   inert objects such as cylinders. Ants use their legs to push against
   their neighbors, doubling their spacing relative to random packing of
   cylinders. These legs also permit active control of their orientation,
   an ability ants use to arrange themselves perpendicularly rather than in
   parallel. Lastly, we found an important role of ant polymorphism in
   promoting self-aggregation: a large distribution of ant sizes permits
   small ants to fit between the legs of larger ants, a phenomenon that
   increases the number of average connections per ant. These combined
   mechanisms lead to low packing fraction and high connectivity, which
   increase raft buoyancy and strength during flash floods.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{217}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2130-2138}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fluid-feeding Lepidoptera use an elongated proboscis, conventionally
   modeled as a drinking straw, to feed from pools and films of liquid.
   Using the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus), we show that
   the inherent structural features of the lepidopteran proboscis
   contradict the basic assumptions of the drinking-straw model. By
   experimentally characterizing permeability and flow in the proboscis, we
   show that tapering of the food canal in the drinking region increases
   resistance, significantly hindering the flow of fluid. The calculated
   pressure differential required for a suction pump to support flow along
   the entire proboscis is greater than 1 atm (similar to 101 kPa) when the
   butterfly feeds from a pool of liquid. We suggest that behavioral
   strategies employed by butterflies and moths can resolve this
   paradoxical pressure anomaly. Butterflies can alter the taper, the
   interlegular spacing and the terminal opening of the food canal, thereby
   controlling fluid entry and flow, by splaying the galeal tips apart,
   sliding the galeae along one another, pulsing hemolymph into each galeal
   lumen, and pressing the proboscis against a substrate. Thus, although
   physical construction of the proboscis limits its mechanical
   capabilities, its functionality can be modified and enhanced by
   behavioral strategies.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An innovative design is reported of a direct-current triboelectric
   nanogenerator (DC-TENG) based on a rotating disk design for harvesting
   rotational mechanical energy. The DC-TENG consists of two disks and two
   pairs of flexible electric brushes that are made of carbon fiber and
   contact two electrodes, respectively. During the rotation, two disks
   have distinct triboelectric polarities for a cyclic in-plane charge
   separation between them and an alternating current is generated between
   the two electrodes. Because of the sliding contact and automatically
   switch between the electric brushes and the two electrodes, the current
   is reversed in the second half of the cycle and a direct current is
   generated. The role that the rotating speed and the segmentation number
   have is thoroughly investigated and shows that there is direct current
   enhancement not only at higher speed but also with more segments. The
   DC-TENG has been demonstrated as a constant current source for directly
   and continuously driving electronic devices and/or charging an energy
   storage unit without a rectifier bridge. This work presents a novel
   DC-TENG technology and opens up more potential applications for
   harvesting rotational mechanical energy and powering electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The design of polymer semiconductors possessing effective -
   intermolecular interactions coupled with good solution processability
   remains a challenge. Structure-property relationships associated with
   side chain structure, - intermolecular interactions, polymer solubility,
   and charge carrier transport are reported for a
   donor-acceptor(1)-donor-acceptor(2) polymer: 5-Decylheptadecyl (5-DH),
   2-tetradecyl (2-DT), and linear n-octadecyl (OD) chains are substituted
   onto a polymer backbone consisting of terthiophene units (T) between two
   different electron acceptors, benzothiadiazole (B), and
   diketopyrrolopyrrole (D), pTBTD, to afford pTBTD-5DH, pTBTD-2DT, and
   pTBTD-OD, respectively. In the 5-DH side chain, the branching position
   is remote from the polymer backbone, whereas it is proximal in 2-DT.
   This study demonstrates that incorporation of branched side chains where
   the branching position is remote from the polymer backbone merges the
   advantages of improved solubility from branched units with effective -
   intermolecular interactions normally associated with linear chains on
   conjugated polymers. pTBTD-5DH exhibits superior qualities with respect
   to the degree of polymerization, solution processability, - interchain
   stacking, and charge carrier transport relative to the other analogs.
   pTBTD-5DH exhibits a field-effect hole mobility of up to 2.95 cm2 V-1
   s-1, a factor of 3-7 times that achieved with pBDT6-DT and pBDT6-OD.}},

Abstract = {{The first direct-current triboelectric generator (DC-TEG) based on
   sliding electrification for harvesting mechanical energy from rotational
   motion is reported. The DC-TEG consists of two rotating wheels and one
   belt for connecting them, which are made of distinctly different
   triboelectric materials with a specific requirement. During the
   rotation, the contact-induced electrification and the relative sliding
   between the two wheels and the belt can induce a continuous increase of
   the accumulated positive and negative triboelectric charges at the two
   rotating wheels, respectively, resulting in a Corona discharge and
   producing the observed current through an external load. The DC-TEG can
   deliver an open-circuit voltage of larger than 3200 V and a maximum
   power of 100 W under an external load of 60 M at a rotational speed of
   1000 r min-1. By designing a point metal discharge electrode near the

Abstract = {{Two receiver architectures are presented for equalization of multi-h
   continuous phase modulation (CPM). In the first approach, the receiver
   front end is a matched-filter bank, which is derived from Laurent
   decomposition of the signal. A circulant-matrix model derived for the
   samples of the matched filter is used to perform the equalization in
   frequency domain. The second technique employs a receiver with a simple
   front end consisting of a low-pass filter and a fractional sampler. We
   also develop a circulant matrix model for the latter approach, which
   relates the Laurent pseudo-symbols to each polyphase component at the
   output of the sampler. A linear frequency-domain equalizer (FDE) is also
   proposed using this model. In addition to providing the details of these
   approaches, the paper proposes several simplifications applicable to
   each of the two cases, and provides a detailed discussion on the
   performance/complexity trade-off. Bit-error rate (BER) results are
   presented for the IRIG-106 aeronautical telemetry dual-h CPM waveform.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Molecular nanonetworks stand at the intersection of nanotechnology,
   biotechnology, and network engineering. The research on molecular
   nanonetworks proposes the interconnection of nanomachines through
   molecule exchange. Amongst different solutions for the transport of
   molecules between nanomachines, the most general is based on free
   diffusion. The objective of this paper is to provide a
   statistical-physical modeling of the interference when multiple
   transmitting nanomachines emit molecules simultaneously. This modeling
   stems from the same assumptions used in interference study for radio
   communications, namely, a spatial Poisson distribution of transmitters
   having independent and identically distributed emissions, while the
   specific molecule emissions model is in agreement with a chemical
   description of the transmitters. As a result of the property of the
   received molecular signal of being a stationary Gaussian Process (GP),
   the statistical-physical modeling is operated on its Power Spectral
   Density (PSD), for which it is possible to obtain an analytical
   expression of the log-characteristic function. This expression leads to
   the estimation of the received PSD probability distribution, which
   provides a complete model of the interference in diffusion-based
   molecular nanonetworks. Numerical results in terms of received PSD
   probability distribution and probability of interference are presented
   to compare the proposed statistical-physical model with the outcomes of
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The total-dose radiation tolerance of 32-nm nFETs is investigated. nFETs

   32-nm) on the total-dose radiation tolerance and hot-carrier reliability
   (HCR) is investigated through both experiments and supporting TCAD
   simulations. The 32-nm nFETs exhibit less total-dose degradation
   compared to 45-nm nFETs. However, the hot-carrier degradation increases
   as the technology scales. An interplay of electric-field in the gate
   oxide and impact ionization in the channel region is responsible for the
   observed differences in the degradation mechanisms for the three

Volume = {{749}},
Pages = {{145-166}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate the motion of a solid spheroid particle
   in a simple shear flow. Using a lattice Boltzmann method, we examine
   individual effects of fluid inertia and particle rotary inertia as well
   as their combination on the dynamics and trajectory of spheroid
   particles at low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The motion of a single
   spheroid is shown to be dependent on the particle Reynolds number,
   particle aspect ratio, particle initial orientation and the Stokes
   number. Spheroids with random initial orientations are found to drift to
   stable orbits influenced by fluid inertia and/or particle inertia.
   Specifically, prolate spheroids drift towards the tumbling mode of
   motion, whereas oblate spheroids drift to the rolling mode. The rotation
   period and the variation of angular velocity of tumbling spheroids
   decrease as Stokes number increases. With increasing Reynolds number,
   both the maximum and minimum values of angular velocity decrease,
   whereas the particle rotation period increases. We show that particle
   inertia does not affect the hydrodynamic torque on the particle. We also
   demonstrate that superposition can be used to estimate the combined
   effect of fluid inertia and particle inertia on the dynamics of spheroid
   particles at sufficiently low Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Wave dispersion in a string carrying periodically distributed masses is
   investigated analytically and experimentally. The effect of the string's
   geometric nonlinearity on its wave propagation characteristics is
   analyzed through a lumped parameter model yielding coupled Duffing
   oscillators. Dispersion frequency shifts are predicted that correspond
   to the hardening behavior of the nonlinear chain and that relate well to
   the backbone of individual Duffing oscillators. Experiments conducted on
   a string of finite length illustrate the relation between measured
   resonances and the dispersion properties of the medium. Specifically,
   the locus of resonance peaks in the frequency/wavenumber domain outlines
   the dispersion curve and highlights the existence of a frequency
   bandgap. Moreover, amplitude-dependent resonance shifts induced by the
   string nonlinearity confirm the hardening characteristics of the
   dispersion curve. Analytical and experimental results provide a critical
   link between nonlinear dispersion frequency shifts and the backbone
   curves intrinsic to nonlinear frequency response functions. Moreover,
   the study confirms that amplitude-dependent wave properties for
   nonlinear periodic systems may be exploited for tunability of wave
   transport characteristics such as frequency bandgaps and wave speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Studying how bacterial strains diverge over space and time and how
   divergence leads to ecotype formation is important for understanding
   structure and dynamics of environmental communities. Here we assess the
   ecological speciation and temporal dynamics of a collection of
   Shewanella baltica strains from the redox transition zone of the central
   Baltic Sea, sampled at three time points over a course of 12 years, with
   a subcollection containing 46 strains subjected to detailed genetic and
   physiological characterization. Nine clades were consistently recovered
   by three different genotyping approaches: gyrB gene sequencing,
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome clustering of data
   from comparative genomic hybridization, and indicated specialization
   according to nutrient availability, particle association and temporal
   distribution. Genomic analysis suggested higher intra- than inter-clade
   recombination that might result from niche partitioning. Substantial
   heterogeneity in carbon utilization and respiratory capabilities
   suggested rapid diversification within the same named' species and
   physical habitat and showed consistency with genetic relatedness. At
   least two major ecotypes, represented by MLST clades A and E, were
   proposed based on genetic, ecological and physiological distinctiveness.
   This study suggests that genetic analysis in conjunction with phenotypic
   evaluation can provide better understanding of the ecological framework
   and evolutionary trajectories of microbial species.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{286-303}},

Abstract = {{Many conventional models that characterize the reliability of
   multicomponent systems are developed on the premise that for a given
   system, the failures of its components are independent. Although this
   facilitates mathematical tractability, it may constitute a significant
   departure from what really takes place. In many real-world applications,
   system components exhibit various degrees of interdependencies, which
   present significant challenges in predicting degradation performance and
   the remaining lifetimes of the individual components as well as the
   system at large. We focus on modeling the performance of interdependent
   components of networked systems that exhibit interactive degradation
   processes. Specifically, we focus on how the performance level of one
   component affects the degradation rates of other dependent components.
   This is achieved by using stochastic models to characterize how
   degradation-based sensor signals associated with the components evolve
   over time. We consider ``Continuous-Type{''} component interactions that
   occur continuously over time. This type of degradation interaction
   exists in many applications, in which interdependencies occur on a
   continuum. We use a system of stochastic differential equations to
   capture such ``Continuous-Type{''} interaction. In addition, we utilize
   a Bayesian approach to update the proposed model using real-time sensor
   signals observed in the field and provide more accurate estimation of
   component residual lifetimes. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Security and privacy are widely recognized as important requirements for
   access and management of electronic health record (EHR) data. In this
   paper, we argue that EHR data need to be managed with customizable
   access control in both spatial and temporal dimensions. We present a
   role-based and time-bound access control (RBTBAC) model that provides
   more flexibility in both roles (spatial capability) and time (temporal
   capability) dimensions to control the access of sensitive data. Through
   algorithmic combination of role-based access control and time-bound key
   management, our RBTBAC model has two salient features. First, we have
   developed a privacy-aware and dynamic key structure for role-based
   privacy aware access and management of EHR data, focusing on the
   consistency of access authorization (including data and time interval)
   with the activated role of user. In addition to role-based access, a
   path-invisible EHR structure is built for preserving privacy of
   patients. Second, we have employed a time tree method for generating
   time granule values, offering fine granularity of time-bound access
   authorization and control. Our initial experimental results show that
   tree-like time structure can improve the performance of the key
   management scheme significantly, and RBTBAC model is more suitable than
   existing solutions for EHR data management because it offers
   high-efficiency and better security and privacy. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {{Single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerators (SETENGs) significantly
   expand the application of triboelectric nanogenerators in various
   circumstances, such as touch-pad technologies. In this work, a
   theoretical model of SETENGs is presented with in-depth interpretation
   and analysis of their working principle. Electrostatic shield effect
   from the primary electrode is the main consideration in the design of
   such SETENGs. On the basis of this analysis, the impacts of two
   important structural parameters, that is, the electrode gap distance and
   the area size, on the output performance are theoretically investigated.
   An optimized electrode gap distance and an optimized area size are
   observed to provide a maximum transit output power. Parallel connection
   of multiple SETENGs with micro-scale size and relatively larger spacing
   should be utilized as the scaling-up strategy. The discussion of the
   basic working principle and the influence of structural parameters on
   the whole performance of the device can serve as an important guidance

Abstract = {{A frequently investigated paradigm for monitoring the integrity of
   plate-like structures is a spatially-distributed array of piezoelectric
   transducers, with each array element capable of both transmitting and
   receiving ultrasonic guided waves. This configuration is relatively
   inexpensive and allows interrogation of defects from multiple directions
   over a relatively large area. Typically, full sets of pairwise
   transducer signals are acquired by exciting one transducer at a time in
   a round-robin fashion. Many algorithms that operate on such data use
   differential signals that are created by subtracting prerecorded
   baseline signals, leaving only signal differences introduced by
   scatterers. Analysis methods such as delay-and-sum imaging operate on
   these signals to detect and locate point-like defects, but such
   algorithms have limited performance and suffer when potential scatterers
   have high directionality or unknown phase-shifting behavior. Signal
   envelopes are commonly used to mitigate the effects of unknown phase
   shifts, but this further reduces performance. The block-sparse technique
   presented here uses a different principle to locate damage: each pixel
   is assumed to have a corresponding multidimensional linear scattering
   model, allowing any possible amplitude and phase shift for each
   transducer pair should a scatterer be present. By assuming that the
   differential signals are linear combinations of a sparse subset of these
   models, it is possible to split such signals into location-based
   components. Results are presented here for three experiments using
   aluminum and composite plates, each with a different type of scatterer.
   The scatterers in these images have smaller spot sizes than
   delay-and-sum imaging, and the images themselves have fewer artifacts.
   Although a propagation model is required, block-sparse imaging performs
   well even with a small number of transducers or without access to
   dispersion curves.}},

Abstract = {{When the frequencies of a pair of collinear shear and longitudinal waves
   satisfy the resonant condition, mixing of these two primary waves
   generates a third, resonant shear wave that propagates in the direction
   opposite to the propagating direction of the primary shear wave. In this
   study, experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the acoustic
   nonlinearity parameter at the location of the mixing zone can be
   obtained by measuring the resonant shear wave. Since the location of the
   mixing zone can be controlled by adjusting the trigger time of the
   transducers that generate the primary waves, this collinear wave mixing
   technique enables the scanning of a bar sample to measure the
   distribution of acoustic nonlinearity along the bar. To demonstrate this
   scanning capability, bar samples with non-uniform acoustic nonlinearity
   parameters were fabricated by inducing localized plastic deformation at
   known locations. Scanning collinear wave mixing tests conducted on such
   bar samples clearly identified the locations of the plastic zone. These
   results show that collinear wave mixing is a promising method for
   scanning the test sample to map out the distribution of localized
   plastic deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Severe extremity trauma often results in large zones of injury
   comprising multiple types of tissue and presents many clinical
   challenges for reconstruction. Considerable investigation is ongoing in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics to improve
   reconstruction outcomes; however, the vast majority of musculoskeletal
   trauma models employed for testing the therapeutics consist of
   single-tissue defects, offering limited utility for investigating
   strategies for multi-tissue repair. Here we present the first model of
   composite lower limb bone and nerve injury, characterized by comparison
   to well-established, single-tissue injury models, using
   biomaterials-based technologies previously demonstrated to show promise
   in those models. Quantitative functional outcome measures were
   incorporated to facilitate assessment of new technologies to promote
   structural and functional limb salvage following severe extremity
   trauma. Nerve injury induced significant changes in the morphology and
   mechanical properties of intact bones. However, BMP-mediated segmental
   bone regeneration was not significantly impaired by concomitant nerve
   injury, as evaluated via radiographs, microcomputed tomography (CT) and
   biomechanical testing. Neither was nerve regeneration significantly
   impaired by bone injury when evaluated via histology and
   electrophysiology. Despite the similar tissue regeneration observed, the
   composite injury group experienced a marked functional deficit in the
   operated limb compared to either of the single-tissue injury groups, as
   determined by quantitative, automated CatWalk gait analysis. As a whole,
   this study presents a challenging, clinically relevant model of severe
   extremity trauma to bone and nerve tissue, and emphasizes the need to
   incorporate quantitative functional outcome measures to benchmark tissue
   engineering therapies. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile/touch sensing is essential in developing human-machine
   interfacing and electronic skins for areas such as automation, security,
   and medical care. Here, we report a self-powered triboelectric sensor
   based on flexible thin-film materials. It relies on contact
   electrification to generate a voltage signal in response to a physical
   contact without using an external power supply. Enabled by the unique
   sensing mechanism and surface modification by polymer-nanowires, the
   triboelectric sensor shows an exceptional pressure sensitivity of 44
   mV/Pa (0.09\% Pa-1) and a maximum touch sensitivity of 1.1 V/Pa (2.3\%
   Pa-1) in the extremely low-pressure region (<0.15 KPa). Through
   integration of the sensor with a signal-processing circuit, a complete
   tactile sensing system is further developed. Diverse applications of the
   system are demonstrated, explicitly indicating a variety of immediate
   uses in human-electronics interface, automatic control, surveillance,

Abstract = {{Carbonaceous materials have great potential for applications as anodes
   of alkali-metal ion batteries, such as Na-ion batteries and K-ion
   batteries (NIB and KIBs). We conduct an in situ study of the
   electrochemically driven sodiation and potassiation of individual carbon
   nanofibers (CNFs) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CNFs
   are hollow and consist of a bilayer wall with an outer layer of
   disordered-carbon (d-C) enclosing an inner layer of crystalline-carbon
   (c-C). The d-C exhibits about three times volume expansion of the c-C
   after full sodiation or potassiation, thus suggesting a much higher
   storage capacity of Na or K ions in d-C than c-C. For the bilayer
   CNF-based electrode, a steady sodium capacity of 245 mAh/g is measured
   with a Coulombic efficiency approaching 98\% after a few initial cycles.
   The in situ TEM experiments also reveal the mechanical degradation of
   CNFs through formation of longitudinal cracks near the c-C/d-C interface
   during sodiation and potassiation. Geometrical changes of the tube are
   explained by a chemomechanical model using the anisotropic
   sodiation/potassiation strains in c-C and d-C. Our results provide
   mechanistic insights into the electrochemical reaction, microstructure
   evolution and mechanical degradation of carbon-based anodes during
   sodiation and potassiation, shedding light onto the development of
   carbon-based electrodes for NIBs and KIBs.}},

Title = {{Atomic Layer-by-Layer Deposition of Pt on Pd Nanocubes for Catalysts

Abstract = {{An effective strategy for reducing the Pt content while retaining the
   activity of a Pt-based catalyst is to deposit the Pt atoms as ultrathin
   skins of only a few atomic layers thick on nanoscale substrates made of
   another metal. During deposition, however, the Pt atoms often take an
   island growth mode because of a strong bonding between Pt atoms. Here we
   report a versatile route to the conformal deposition of Pt as uniform,
   ultrathin shells on Pd nanocubes in a solution phase. The introduction
   of the Pt precursor at a relatively slow rate and high temperature
   allowed the deposited Pt atoms to spread across the entire surface of a
   Pd nanocube to generate a uniform shell. The thickness of the Pt shell
   could be controlled from one to six atomic layers by varying the amount
   of Pt precursor added into the system. Compared to a commercial Pt/C
   catalyst, the Pd@Pt-nL (n = 1-6) core-shell nanocubes showed
   enhancements in specific activity and durability toward the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   on model (100) surfaces suggest that the enhancement in specific
   activity can be attributed to the weakening of OH binding through ligand
   and strain effects, which, in turn, increases the rate of OH
   hydrogenation. A volcano-type relationship between the ORR specific
   activity and the number of Pt atomic layers was derived, in good
   agreement with the experimental results. Both theoretical and
   experimental studies indicate that the ORR specific activity was
   maximized for the catalysts based on Pd@Pt2-3L nanocubes. Because of the
   reduction in Pt content used and the enhancement in specific activity,
   the Pd@Pt-1L nanocubes showed a Pt mass activity with almost three-fold
   enhancement relative to the Pt/C catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Noble metal nanowires are excellent candidates as subwavelength optical
   components in miniaturized devices due to their ability to support the
   propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Nanoscale data
   transfer based on SPP propagation at optical frequencies has the
   advantage of larger bandwidths but also suffers from larger losses due
   to strong mode confinement. To overcome losses, SPP gain has been
   realized, but so far only for weakly confined SPPs in metal films and
   stripes. Here we report the demonstration of gain for subwavelength SPPs
   that were strongly confined in chemically prepared silver nanowires
   (mode area = lambda(2)/40) using a dye-doped polymer film as the optical
   gain medium. Under continuous wave excitation at 514 nm, we measured a
   gain coefficient of 270 cm(-1) for SPPs at 633 nm, resulting in partial
   SPP loss compensation of 14\%. This achievement for strongly confined
   SPPs represents a major step forward toward the realization of nanoscale
   plasmonic amplifiers and lasers.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{11-12}},
Pages = {{2955-2982}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are often used for the development of
   hydro-climatic variable forecasts based on teleconnection methods. Such
   methods rely on projections or linear combinations of teleconnection
   indices {[}e.g. El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] and other predictor
   fields. This study introduces a new hydro-climatic forecasting method
   identifying SST ``dipole{''} predictors motivated by major
   teleconnection patterns. An SST dipole is defined as a function of
   average SST anomalies over two oceanic areas of specific sizes and
   geographic locations. An optimization algorithm is developed to search
   for the most significant SST dipole predictors of an external
   hydro-climatic series based on the Gerrity Skill Score. The significant
   dipoles are cross-validated and used to generate multiple forecast
   values. The new method is applied to the forecasting of seasonal
   precipitation over the southeast US. Hindcasting results show that
   significant dipoles related to ENSO as well as other prominent patterns
   at different lead times can indeed be identified. The dipole method also
   compares favorably with existing statistical forecasting schemes with
   respect to multiple skill measures. Furthermore, an operational
   forecasting framework able to produce ensemble forecast traces and
   uncertainty intervals that can support regional water resources planning
   and management is also developed.}},

Abstract = {{The primary challenges in making renewable energy competitive with

   concentrated solar power (CSP) with thermal storage could play an
   important role, since the cost of thermal storage is lower than that of
   electrochemical batteries. CSP, however, is still expensive and a number
   of ongoing research efforts are targeted at reducing the cost via a
   number of technological development pathways. Here, we present a
   simplified cost model for CSP and show that increasing the temperature
   of the heat delivered to the power cycle is a potential pathway to
   reduce the cost. We also propose that solid state energy converters,

   advantages that can enable high temperature CSP systems with a lower

Abstract = {{Purpose: The efficacy of a boron-containing cholesteryl ester compound
   (BCH) as a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agent for the targeted
   irradiation of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells was examined.
   Materials and methods: Liposome-based delivery of BCH was quantified
   with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cytotoxicity of the
   BCH-containing liposomes was evaluated with neutral red,
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl
   )-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Colony
   formation assays were utilized to evaluate the decrease in cell survival
   due to high-linear energy transfer (LET) particles resulting from 10 B
   thermal neutron capture.
   Results: BCH delivery by means of encapsulation in a lipid bilayer
   resulted in a boron uptake of 35.2 +/- 4.3 mu g/10(9) cells, with
   minimal cytotoxic effects. PC-3 cells treated with BCH and exposed to a
   9.4 x 10(11) n/cm(2) thermal neutron fluence yielded a 20-25\% decrease
   in clonogenic capacity. The decreased survival is attributed to the
   generation of high-LET alpha particles and Li-7 nuclei that deposit
   energy in densely ionizing radiation tracks.
   Conclusion: Liposome-based delivery of BCH is capable of introducing
   sufficient boron to PC-3 cells for BNCT. High-LET a particles and Li-7
   nuclei generated from B-10 thermal neutron capture significantly
   decrease colony formation ability in the targeted PC-3 cells.}},

Abstract = {{This theoretical and experimental study investigated the applicability
   of Archie's equation to iron oxide coated soils as a function of pore
   water chemistry, with the ultimate goal of developing a relationship to
   estimate electrical conductivity based on the physical properties of
   soils. The study performed an experimental investigation to quantify the
   electrical properties of uncoated and lab-prepared iron oxide coated
   sands and clay, in order to evaluate the role of sorbed hematite on the
   measured electrical conductivity/resistivity of the soils. It was
   demonstrated that the observed conductivity/resistivity of hematite
   coated and uncoated clean sands showed good agreement under the tested
   salinities and iron contents, and both coated and uncoated sands could
   be represented by Archie's equation. In contrast, the electrical
   conductivity of iron oxide coated clay indicated a slightly higher value
   than that of clean kaolinite at low salinity due to the higher relevance
   of surface conduction: however, with further increase in salinity, the
   electrical properties of both coated and uncoated kaolinites were
   comparable and governed by pore water conduction, which agreed with the
   prediction from Archie's equation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{748}},
Pages = {{692-711}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Long-time evolution of a weakly perturbed wavetrain near the
   modulational instability (MI) threshold is examined within the framework
   of the compact Zakharov equation for unidirectional deep-water waves
   (Dyachenko and Zakharov, JETP Lett., vol. 93, 2011, pp. 701-705).
   Multiple-scale solutions reveal that a perturbation to a slightly
   unstable uniform wavetrain of steepness mu slowly evolves according to a
   nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS). In particular, for small carrier
   wave steepness mu < mu(1) approximate to 0.27 the perturbation dynamics
   is of focusing type and the long-time behaviour is characterized by the
   Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence, the signature of breather interactions.
   However, the amplitude of breathers and their likelihood of occurrence
   tend to diminish as mu increases while the Benjamin-Feir index (BFI)
   decreases and becomes nil at mu(1). This indicates that homoclinic
   orbits persist only for small values of wave steepness mu << mu(1), in
   agreement with recent experimental and numerical observations of
   breathers. When the compact Zakharov equation is beyond its nominal
   range of validity, i.e. for mu > mu(1,) predictions seem to foreshadow a
   dynamical trend to wave breaking. In particular, the perturbation
   dynamics becomes of defocusing type, and nonlinearities tend to
   stabilize a linearly unstable wavetrain as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
   recurrence is suppressed. mu = mu(c) approximate to 0.577, subharmonic
   perturbations restabilize and superharmonic instability appears,
   possibly indicating that wave dynamical behaviour changes at large
   steepness, in qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations of
   Longuet-Higgins and Cokelet (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 364, 1978, pp.
   1-28) for steep waves. Indeed, for mu > mu(1) a multiple-scale
   perturbation analysis reveals that a weak narrowband perturbation to a
   uniform wavetrain evolves in accord with a modified Korteweg-de
   Vries/Camassa-Holm type equation, again implying a possible mechanism
   conducive to wave breaking.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix factorization has been widely utilized as a latent factor model
   for solving the recommender system problem using collaborative
   filtering. For a recommender system, all the ratings in the rating
   matrix are bounded within a pre-determined range. In this paper, we
   propose a new improved matrix factorization approach for such a rating
   matrix, called Bounded Matrix Factorization (BMF), which imposes a lower
   and an upper bound on every estimated missing element of the rating
   matrix. We present an efficient algorithm to solve BMF based on the
   block coordinate descent method. We show that our algorithm is scalable
   for large matrices with missing elements on multicore systems with low
   memory. We present substantial experimental results illustrating that
   the proposed method outperforms the state of the art algorithms for
   recommender system such as stochastic gradient descent, alternating
   least squares with regularization, SVD++ and Bias-SVD on real-world
   datasets such as Jester, Movielens, Book crossing, Online dating and

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{547-557}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The stem cell/material interface is a complex, dynamic microenvironment
   in which the cell and the material cooperatively dictate one another's
   fate: the cell by remodelling its surroundings, and the material through
   its inherent properties (such as adhesivity, stiffness, nanostructure or
   degradability). Stem cells in contact with materials are able to sense
   their properties, integrate cues via signal propagation and ultimately
   translate parallel signalling information into cell fate decisions.
   However, discovering the mechanisms by which stem cells respond to
   inherent material characteristics is challenging because of the highly
   complex, multicomponent signalling milieu present in the stem cell
   environment. In this Review, we discuss recent evidence that shows that
   inherent material properties may be engineered to dictate stem cell fate
   decisions, and overview a subset of the operative signal transduction
   mechanisms that have begun to emerge. Further developments in stem cell
   engineering and mechanotransduction are poised to have substantial
   implications for stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.}},

   were cultured in pellet form and exposed to several strengths of SMFs

   production of the cartilage-specific macromolecules sGAG, collage type 2
   (Col2), and proteoglycans was determined both biochemically and
   histologically. The role of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
   signaling pathway was also examined. Results showed that a 0.4 T
   magnetic field applied for 14 days elicited a strong chondrogenic
   differentiation response in cultured BMSCs, so long as TGF-beta 3 was
   also present, that is, a synergistic response of a SMF and TGF-beta 3 on
   BMSC chondrogenic differentiation was observed. Further, SMF alone
   caused TGF-beta secretion in culture, and the effects of SMF could be
   abrogated by the TGF-beta receptor blocker SB-431542. These data show
   that moderate-strength magnetic fields can induce chondrogenesis in
   BMSCs through a TGF-beta-dependent pathway. This finding has potentially
   important applications in cartilage tissue-engineering strategies.}},

Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Different forms of biomaterials, including microspheres, sponges,
   hydrogels and nanofibres have been broadly used in cartilage
   regeneration; however, effects of internal structures of biomaterials on
   chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain largely
   unexplored. Here we investigated the effect of physical
   microenvironments of sponges and hydrogels on chondrogenic
   differentiation of MSCs. MSCs, cultured in these two scaffold systems,
   were induced with TGF-beta(3) in chondrogeneic differentiation medium
   and the chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated and compared after
   three weeks. MSCs in the sponges clustered with spindle morphologies,
   while they distributed homogenously with round morphologies in the
   hydrogel. The MSCs proliferated faster in the sponge compared to that in
   the hydrogel. Significantly higher glycosaminoglycan and collagen II
   were found in the sponges but not in the hydrogels. The different tissue
   formation ability of MSCs in these two systems could be attributed to
   the different metabolic requirements and the cellular events
   prerequisite in the chondrogenic process of MSCs. It is reasonable to
   conclude that sponges with relatively active microenvironments that
   facilitate cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix interaction are optimal
   for early stage of chondrogeneic differentiation.}},

   the conventional finite element analysis and fatigue life analysis were
   conducted and their simulation results have been validated by physical
   experiments in this research. The probability of failure is estimated by
   a classification process. Specifically, the probabilistic neural network
   classifier is incorporated into the simulation process to reduce the
   number of finite element analysis calculations while ensuring the
   prediction accuracy of the failure probability. Based on the estimated
   failure probability and other structural analysis results, the margin of
   the performance of the spider assembly is fully identified.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to evaluate different practically

   nanowires and nanoholes, multilayers, and one-dimensional gratings) in
   terms of their potential for enhancing near-field radiative heat
   transfer at ambient temperature. It is found that both doped silicon
   nanowires and nanoholes may achieve an enhancement over bulk doped
   silicon by more than one order of magnitude in the deep submicron gap
   region. The enhancement is attributed to either the broadband hyperbolic
   modes or low-loss surface modes or a combination of both. On the other
   hand, polarization coupling, which can occur in the grating
   configuration, contributes little to the radiative transfer at the
   nanometer scale. This work will facilitate the application of
   nanostructures in more efficient non-contact thermal management, thermal
   imaging, and near-field thermophotovoltaics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of enzymes as therapeutics is very promising because of their
   catalytic activity and specificity. However, intracellular delivery of
   active enzymes is challenging due to their low stability and large size.
   The production of protein-enzyme nanoparticles was investigated with the
   goal of developing a protein carrier for active enzyme delivery.
   -Galactosidase (-gal), an enzyme whose deficiency is the cause of some
   lysosomal storage disorders, was incorporated into enhanced green
   fluorescent protein nanoparticles prepared via desolvation. Particle
   size was found to be sensitive to the type of cross-linker,
   cross-linking time, and the presence of imidazole. The results indicate
   that -gal activity is highly retained (>70\%) after particle fabrication
   and >85\% of protein is incorporated in the particles. Protein-enzyme
   nanoparticles exhibited higher internalization in multiple cell lines in
   vitro, compared with the soluble enzyme. Importantly, -gal retained its
   activity following intracellular delivery. These data demonstrate that
   protein nanoparticles are a biocompatible, high-efficiency alternative
   for intracellular delivery of active enzyme therapeutics. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Open surgery effectively treats mesial temporal lobe
   epilepsy, but carries the risk of neurocognitive deficits, which may be
   reduced with minimally invasive alternatives.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe technical and clinical outcomes of stereotactic
   laser amygdalohippocampotomy with real-time magnetic resonance thermal
   imaging guidance.
   METHODS: With patients under general anesthesia and using standard
   stereotactic methods, 13 adult patients with intractable mesial temporal
   lobe epilepsy (with and without mesial temporal sclerosis {[}MTS])
   prospectively underwent insertion of a saline-cooled fiber-optic laser
   applicator in amygdalohippocampal structures from an occipital
   trajectory. Computer-controlled laser ablation was performed during
   continuous magnetic resonance thermal imaging followed by confirmatory
   contrast-enhanced anatomic imaging and volumetric reconstruction.
   Clinical outcomes were determined from seizure diaries.
   RESULTS: A mean 60\% volume of the amygdalohippocampal complex was
   ablated in 13 patients (9 with MTS) undergoing 15 procedures. Median
   hospitalization was 1 day. With follow-up ranging from 5 to 26 months
   (median, 14 months), 77\% (10/13) of patients achieved meaningful
   seizure reduction, of whom 54\% (7/13) were free of disabling seizures.
   Of patients with preoperative MTS, 67\% (6/9) achieved seizure freedom.
   All recurrences were observed before 6 months. Variances in ablation
   volume and length did not account for individual clinical outcomes.
   Although no complications of laser therapy itself were observed, 1
   significant complication, a visual field defect, resulted from deviated
   insertion of a stereotactic aligning rod, which was corrected before
   ablation.
   CONCLUSION: Real-time magnetic resonance-guided stereotactic laser
   amygdalohippocampotomy is a technically novel, safe, and effective
   alternative to open surgery. Further evaluation with larger cohorts over
   time is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic oxidation and binding capacity of cement containing
   titanium dioxide nanoparticles under nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide
   gas exposures were examined experimentally both in the presence and
   absence of ultraviolet (UV) light, to examine independently the
   contributions of photocatalysis and potential additional mechanisms for
   binding of nitrogen oxides (NOx) inherent in cement-based materials. The
   overall, photocatalytic efficiency was similar for both gas exposures,
   with faster initial rates of initial NO binding for higher
   water-to-cement ratio pastes, due to higher surface area. In the absence
   of UV light, greater binding of NO2 gas was found compared to NO gas,
   perhaps due to the greater polarity of the NO2 molecule, although
   further examination of this phenomenon is warranted. Overall, these
   experiments show not only the fact that cementitious materials can be
   tailored to decrease NOx levels through photocatalysis but also the fact
   that Portland cements possess the inherent ability to bind NOx, and in
   particular NO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An enhanced classification approach for reliability estimation of

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of a classification-based surrogate model for reliability
   assessment can be improved by augmenting the training data (labeled data
   or data with known responses) with a large number of unlabeled data
   (data with unknown responses) in semi-supervised learning methods. In
   this research, an enhanced Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) algorithm
   is proposed where the Gaussians at each labeled point are not assumed to
   be spherical. Each of the Gaussians has a `full' covariance matrix
   instead of simply assuming the Gaussian with a `spherical' covariance
   matrix. First, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is applied on the
   labeled and unlabeled data while assuming that the number of `full'
   Gaussians is equal to the number of labeled datapoints. The contribution
   of each of these `full' Gaussians at a particular datapoint is found by
   using the Bayes Theorem. The Bayes decision criterion is then used in
   the final output layer of the PNN to classify test patterns into either
   the safe or the failure class. The primary benefit of the proposed
   method comes from utilizing unlabeled data for better estimation of
   `full' covariance matrices of constituting Gaussian clusters of
   underlying data, which are then used to estimate the Probability Density
   Functions of classes for classification. This procedure does not require
   additional computational costs to improve the accuracy of the
   classification results since the cost of unlabeled data is negligible in
   general. Two examples including an analytic problem and a truss problem
   are presented in order to validate the proposed reliability estimation
   process. The results reflect considerable improvements of the classifier
   performance for estimating reliability while maintaining sufficient
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Porous materials with well-defined pore shapes, sizes and distributions
   are highly desired in many emerging applications, particularly for
   biomedical materials and devices. However, conventional methods for
   processing porous materials only demonstrated limited capability in
   morphological control. One promising solution is the porogen templating
   process, where a structured porogen pattern is created first and
   subsequently used as a template or mold for generation of the desired
   porous material. Particularly, with solid freeform fabrication, porogen
   templates having complex internal structures can be additively
   fabricated, and they can then be used as molds for molding of porous
   materials and devices. This article attempts to offer a constructive
   overview on the state of the art of porogen patterning and inverse
   molding, with the goal of explaining the working mechanisms and
   providing unbiased accounts of the pros and cons of existing techniques
   and process variants. The article further intends to provide a
   fundamental understanding of the constituent elements and corresponding
   building blocks in porogen templating processes. An increased
   understanding of these elements will facilitate the development of more
   capable new processes.}},

Abstract = {{A cutting-plane procedure for integer programming (IP) problems usually
   involves invoking a black-box procedure (such as the Gomory-Chvatal
   procedure) to compute a cutting-plane. In this paper, we describe an
   alternative paradigm of using the same cutting-plane black-box. This
   involves two steps. In the first step, we design an inequality where and
   are integral, independent of the cutting-plane black-box. In the second
   step, we verify that the designed inequality is a valid inequality by
   verifying that the set is empty using cutting-planes from the black-box.
   Here is the feasible region of the linear-programming relaxation of the
   IP. We refer to the closure of all cutting-planes that can be verified
   to be valid using a specific cutting-plane black-box as the verification
   closure of the considered cutting-plane black-box. This paper undertakes
   a systematic study of properties of verification closures of various

Abstract = {{Cortical networks are hypothesized to rely on transient network activity
   to support short-term memory (STM). In this letter, we study the
   capacity of randomly connected recurrent linear networks for performing
   STM when the input signals are approximately sparse in some basis. We
   leverage results from compressed sensing to provide rigorous
   nonasymptotic recovery guarantees, quantifying the impact of the input
   sparsity level, the input sparsity basis, and the network
   characteristics on the system capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that
   network memory capacities can scale superlinearly with the number of
   nodes and in some situations can achieve STM capacities that are much
   larger than the network size. We provide perfect recovery guarantees for
   finite sequences and recovery bounds for infinite sequences. The latter
   analysis predicts that network STM systems may have an optimal recovery
   length that balances errors due to omission and recall mistakes.
   Furthermore, we show that the conditions yielding optimal STM capacity
   can be embodied in several network topologies, including networks with
   sparse or dense connectivities.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a centralized photonic precoding method for millimeter-wave
   (MMW) multicell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
   communications. By applying the multicell MIMO and hence exploiting the
   spatial multiplexing gain over MMW, the system capacity is enhanced
   compared with the conventional single-input single-output (SISO) system.
   Based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) techniques, the multicell function is
   realized in a centralized location, which simplifies the design of
   remote access units. Traversing over the optical links enabled by the
   RoF infrastructure, we implement a novel method of photonic precoding to
   realize the zero-forcing precoding approach, which simplifies the user
   equipment complexity. A two-cell MIMO downlink transmission using the
   proposed method is experimentally demonstrated. Our results show that
   original signals can be directly recovered at the receivers with a power
   penalty <1 dB compared with SISO transmission. The effect of varying

Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying arterial residual deformations is critical for understanding
   the stresses and strains within the arterial wall during physiological
   and pathophysiological conditions. This study presents novel findings on
   residual shear deformations in the left anterior descending coronary
   artery. Residual shear deformations are most evident when thin, long
   axial strips are cut from the artery. These strips deform into helical
   configurations when placed in isotonic solution. A residual shear angle
   is introduced as a parameter to quantify the residual shear
   deformations. Furthermore, a stress analysis is performed to study the
   effects of residual shear deformations on the intramural shear stress
   distribution of an artery subjected to pressure, axial stretch, and
   torsion using numerical simulation. The results from the stress analyses
   suggest that residual shear deformations can significantly modulate the
   intramural shear stress across the arterial wall.}},

Abstract = {{Image reconstruction is the transformation process from a reduced-order
   representation to the original image pixel form. In materials
   characterization, it can be utilized as a method to retrieve material
   composition information. In our previous work, a surfacelet transform
   was developed to efficiently represent boundary information in material
   images with surfacelet coefficients. In this paper, new
   constrained-conjugate-gradient based image reconstruction methods are
   proposed as the inverse surfacelet transform. With geometric constraints
   on boundaries and internal distributions of materials, the proposed
   methods are able to reconstruct material images from surfacelet
   coefficients as either lossy or lossless compressions. The results
   between the proposed and other optimization methods for solving the

Abstract = {{Usability of in-vehicle systems has become increasingly important for
   ease of operations and safety of driving. The user interface (UI) of
   in-vehicle systems is a critical focus of usability study. This paper
   studies how to use advanced computational, physiology-and behavior-based
   tools and methodologies to determine affective/emotional states and
   behavior of an individual in real time and in turn how to adapt the
   human-vehicle interaction to meet users' cognitive needs based on the
   real-time assessment. Specifically, we set up a set of physiological
   sensors that are capable of collecting EEG, facial EMG, skin conductance
   response, and respiration data and a set of motion sensing and tracking
   equipment that is capable of capturing eye ball movement and objects
   which the user is interacting with. All hardware components and software
   are integrated into an augmented sensor platform that can perform as
   ``one coherent system{''} to enable multimodal data processing and
   information inference for context-aware analysis of emotional states and
   cognitive behavior based on the rough set inference engine. Meanwhile
   subjective data are also recorded for comparison. A usability study of
   in-vehicle system UI is shown to demonstrate the potential of the

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{We present a combined approach for the realization of the (quasi-)geoid
   as a height reference surface and the vertical reference surface at sea
   (chart datum). This approach, specifically designed for shallow seas and
   coastal waters, provides the relation between the two vertical reference
   surfaces without gaps down to the coast. It uses a regional hydrodynamic
   model, which, after vertical referencing, provides water levels relative
   to a given (quasi-)geoid. Conversely, the hydrodynamic model is also
   used to realize a (quasi-)geoid by providing corrections to the dynamic
   sea surface topography, which are used to reduce radar altimeter-derived
   sea surface heights to the (quasi-)geoid. The coupled problem of
   vertically referencing the hydrodynamic model and computing the
   (quasi-)geoid is solved iteratively. After convergence of the iteration
   process, the vertically referenced hydrodynamic model is used to realize
   the chart datum. In this way, consistency between the chart datum and
   (quasi-)geoid is ensured. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance
   of this approach for the Dutch mainland and North Sea. We show that in
   the Dutch part of the North Sea, the differences between modeled and
   observed instantaneous and mean dynamic sea surface topography is 8-10
   and 5.8 cm, respectively. On land, we show that the methodology provides
   a quasi-geoid which has a lower standard deviation (SD) than the
   European Gravimetric Geoid 2008 (EGG08) and the official Netherlands
   quasi-geoid NLGEO2004-grav when compared to GPS-levelling data. The root
   mean square at 81 GPS-levelling points is below 1.4 cm; no correction
   surface is needed. Finally, we show that the chart datum (lowest
   astronomical tide, LAT) agrees with the observed chart datum at 92
   onshore tide gauges to within 21.5 cm (SD).}},

Abstract = {{Major advances in highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) have
   extended the lives of people living with HIV, but there still remains an
   increased risk of death by cardiovascular diseases (CVD). HIV proteins
   have been shown to contribute to cardiovascular dysfunction with effects
   on the different cell types that comprise the arterial wall. In
   particular, HIV-1 transactivating factor (Tat) has been shown to bind to
   endothelial cells inducing a range of responses that contribute to
   vascular dysfunction. It is well established that hemodynamics also play
   an important role in endothelial cell mediated atherosclerotic
   development. When exposed to low or oscillatory shear stress, such as
   that found at branches and bifurcations, endothelial cells contribute to
   proteolytic vascular remodeling by upregulating cathepsins, potent
   elastases and collagenases that contribute to altered biomechanics and
   plaque formation. Mechanisms to understand the influence of Tat on shear
   stress mediated vascular remodeling have not been fully elucidated.
   Using an in vivo HIV-Tg mouse model and an in vitro cone and plate shear
   stress bioreactor to actuate physiologically relevant pro-atherogenic or
   atheroprotective shear stress on human aortic endothelial cells, we have
   shown synergism between HIV proteins and pro-atherogenic shear stress to
   increase endothelial cell expression of the powerful protease cathepsin
   K, and may implicate this protease in accelerated CVD in people living
   with HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with aortic stenosis present with calcium deposits on the
   native aortic valve, which can result in non-concentric expansion of
   Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) stents. The objective of
   this study is to evaluate whether eccentric deployment of TAVRs lead to
   turbulent blood flow and blood cell damage. Particle Image Velocimetry
   was used to quantitatively characterize fluid velocity fields, shear
   stress and turbulent kinetic energy downstream of TAVRs deployed in
   circular and eccentric orifices representative of deployed TAVRs in
   vivo. Effective orifice area (EOA) and mean transvalvular pressure
   gradient (TVG) values did not differ substantially in circular and
   eccentric deployed valves, with only a minor decrease in EOA observed in
   the eccentric valve (2.0 cm(2) for circular, 1.9 cm(2) for eccentric).
   Eccentric deployed TAVR lead to asymmetric systolic jet formation, with
   increased shear stresses (circular = 97 N/m(2) vs. eccentric = 119
   N/m(2)) and regions of turbulence intensity (circular = 180 N/m(2) vs.
   eccentric = 230 N/m(2)) downstream that was not present in the circular
   deployed TAVR. The results of this study indicate that eccentric
   deployment of TAVRs can lead to altered flow characteristics and may
   potentially increase the hemolytic potential of the valve, which were
   not captured through hemodynamic evaluation alone.}},

Abstract = {{The continuing lack of longitudinal histopathological and biomechanical
   data for human arteries in health and disease highlights the importance
   of studying the many genetic, pharmacological, and surgical models that
   are available in mice. As a result, there has been a significant
   increase in the number of reports on the biomechanics of murine arteries
   over the past decade, particularly for the common carotid artery.
   Whereas most of these studies have focused on wild-type controls or
   comparing controls vs. a single model of altered hemodynamics or
   vascular disease, there is a pressing need to compare results across
   many different models to understand more broadly the effects of genetic
   mutations, pharmacological treatments, or surgical alterations on the
   evolving hemodynamics and the microstructure and biomechanical
   properties of these vessels. This paper represents a first step toward
   this goal, that is, a biomechanical phenotyping of common carotid
   arteries from control mice and seven different mouse models that
   represent alterations in elastic fiber integrity, collagen remodeling,
   and smooth muscle cell functionality.}},

Title = {{A yearlong study of water-soluble organic carbon in Beijing II: Light
   absorption properties}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{235-241}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Light absorption properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in
   Beijing were investigated by 24 h-averaged fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) samples collected from October 2010 to November 2011. The light
   absorption spectra of WSOC exhibited strong wavelength dependence such
   that the absorption Angstrom exponent was approximately 7.5. The light
   absorption at 365 nm (Abs(365)), which is typically used as a proxy of
   water-soluble brown carbon, was found to correlate strongly with WSOC
   (R-2 > 0.75, p < 0.01). Moreover, the correlation between Abs(365) and
   levoglucosan (especially in fall and winter) indicated that biomass
   burning could contribute significantly to water-soluble brown carbon.
   Source apportionment with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model
   showed that biomass burning and mixed sources contributed 58.0\% and
   20.8\% to total Abs(365), compared with 21.2\% from WSOC associated with
   sulfate and oxalate. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of WSOC in
   Beijing showed distinct temporal variations (averaging 1.26 m(2)/g and
   0.51 m(2)/g during winter and summer, respectively), and was
   approximately 2-3 times the values of that observed in the southeastern
   United States, but was substantially lower than the summertime results
   from Los Angeles. Influence factors responsible for the temporal and
   spatial variations of MAE were investigated. MAE were calculated for
   each PMF factor. It was found that the MAE for WSOC from biomass burning
   (1.19 m(2)/g) and mixed primary sources (2.89 m(2)/g) was much higher
   than that of WSOC associated with sulfate or oxalate (0.32-0.33 m(2)/g)
   in Beijing. In addition, it was concluded that differences in the
   precursors of WSOC might also be responsible for the observed variation
   of MAE such that WSOC associated with anthropogenic precursors are more
   light-absorbing compared with WSOC biogenic sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper considers a general class of infinite-dimensional linear

   accomplish trajectory planning of a BCS through a `stable' dynamic
   inversion without resorting to discretization. To this end, the paper
   first formulates the particular solution of an infinite-dimensional SCS
   within a Sobolev space together with a set of necessary and sufficient
   conditions for its existence and an explicit formula for computing it.
   The resulting solution, which may be noncausal, is further utilized to
   explicitly compute the bounded control input needed for output tracking
   of a BCS without requiring its inverse to be minimum phase or even to
   possess a -semigroup. The key results of the paper are illustrated on a
   flexible beam and a one-dimensional heat conduction system.}},

Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{154-163}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most previous studies have investigated in vitro thrombus formation
   under steady flow conditions at physiological shear rates, though
   occlusive thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction and stroke forms
   under elevated shear rates and pulsatile flow. Two reports of pulsatile
   flow on thrombosis have yielded conflicting results. In the present
   study, we quantify the effect of very high shear, reversing pulsatile
   flow relevant to coronary thrombosis on platelet deposition leading to
   occlusive thrombus formation. Whole porcine blood was perfused in a
   collagen-coated, tubular, stenotic test section under pulsatile or
   steady flow. Pulsatile flow was generated with a frequency of 60 beats
   per minute and large magnitude excursions similar to a coronary artery
   waveform. Alternatively, steady flow conditions from a pressure driven
   system created shear rates matched to the maximum (16000 s(-1)), mean
   (3800 s(-1)), and an intermediate (6500 s(-1)) shear rates corresponding
   to the pulsatile system. Thrombus growth in thickness was recorded using
   a high-resolution CCD attached to a microscope. Steady flow recreated
   pulsatile flow thrombus formation in most cases. Lag time, t(lag),
   thrombus growth rate, dV/dt, and time to occlusion, t(occ), did not show
   statistically significant differences between pulsatile flow and steady
   flow with matched mean shear rate. Pulsatile flow conditions yielded
   t(occ) = 5.5 +/- 2.8 min, which was not significantly different compared
   to a steady mean shear rate condition with t(occ) = 6.2 +/- 1.7 min.
   Similarly, occlusion times for steady intermediate and steady maximum
   shear rate conditions were not significantly difference from pulsatile
   flow conditions yielding tocc of 4.6 +/- 2.9 and 4.6 +/- 1.8 min,
   respectively. In contrast, lag time for steady flow at maximum shear
   rate of 16000 s(-1) was decreased to 26.1 s compared to pulsatile flow
   (t(lag) = 42.7 s, p = 0.03), steady mean flow (t(lag) = 60.9 s, p =
   0.02), and steady intermediate flow (t(lag) = 39.9 s, p = 0.01).
   Occlusive thrombus formation under high shear, pulsatile conditions may
   be modeled in vitro using steady flow with matched mean shear rate with
   respect to occlusion time, lag time, and growth rate. Our results
   indicate that the magnitude of shear rate more strongly affects thrombus
   growth characteristics than flow pulsatility for an arterial frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible systems such as silylamines are neutral amines that can react
   reversibly with CO2 to form the corresponding ammonium carbamate ionic
   pair. The ionic-to-neutral `switch' capability provides an advantageous
   means for efficient synthesis and facile deposition of nanoparticles
   onto a solid support. Herein, we first illustrate the surface
   active/non-surface active duality of the silylamine systems with the
   reversible solubilization-precipitation of methyl orange from a hexane
   solution of the 3-(aminopropyl) tripropylsilane (TPSA) system (0.275 M).
   The authors then demonstrate the application of this system to the
   controlled reduction of an ionic gold salt to yield gold nanoparticles
   using two reversible silylamine systems: TPSA and 3-(aminopropyl)
   trihexylsilane (THSA). The post-synthesis deposition of the
   THSA-stabilized gold nanoparticles from solution onto a support using
   the surface active/non-surface active duality of these systems was also
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Colorectal cancer is one of the most prevalent causes of
   cancer death. It has been studied extensively for a long time, and
   numerous genetic and epigenetic events have been associated with the
   disease. However, its molecular mechanisms are still unclear.
   High-throughput metabolomics data, combined with customized
   computational systems modeling, can assist our understanding of some of
   these mechanisms by revealing connections between alterations in
   enzymatic activities and their consequences for a person's metabolic
   profile. Of particular importance in this context is purine metabolism,
   as it provides the nucleotides needed for cell proliferation.
   Methods and findings: We employ a computational systems approach to
   infer molecular mechanisms associated with purine metabolism in
   colorectal carcinoma. The approach uses a dynamic model of purine
   metabolism as the simulation system and metabolomics data as input. The
   execution of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and optimization with
   the model permits a step-wise reduction in possibly affected enzyme
   mechanisms, from which likely targets emerge.
   Conclusions: According to our results, some enzymes in the purine
   pathway system are very unlikely the targets of colorectal carcinoma. In
   fact, only three enzymatic steps emerge with statistical confidence as
   most likely being affected, namely: amidophosphoribosyltransferase
   (ATASE), 5'-nucleotidase (5NUC), and the xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase
   (XD) reactions. The first of these enzymes catalyzes the first committed
   step of de novo purine biosynthesis, while the other two enzymes are
   associated with critical purine salvage pathways. The identification of
   these enzymes is statistically significant and robust. In addition, the
   results suggest potential secondary targets. The computational method
   cannot discern whether the inferred mechanisms constitute symptoms of
   colorectal carcinoma, or whether they might be causative and critical
   components of the uncontrolled cellular growth in cancer. The inferred
   molecular mechanisms present testable hypotheses that suggest targeted
   experiments for future studies of colorectal carcinoma and might
   eventually lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike traditional supervised learning problems, preference learning
   learns from data available in the form of pairwise preference relations
   between instances. Existing preference learning methods are either
   parametric or nonparametric in nature. We propose in this paper a
   semiparametric preference learning model, abbreviated as SPPL, with the
   aim of combining the strengths of the parametric and nonparametric
   approaches. SPPL uses multiple Gaussian processes which are linearly
   coupled to determine the preference relations between instances. SPPL is
   more powerful than previous models while keeping the computational
   complexity low (linear in the number of distinct instances). We devise
   an efficient algorithm for model learning. Empirical studies have been
   conducted on two real-world data sets showing that SPPL outperforms
   related preference learning methods.}},
