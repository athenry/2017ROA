Abstract = {{Black phosphorus is a newly rising layered material with tremendous and
   intriguing physical, chemical, and electronic properties. Recently, it
   was reintroduced into the community from the perspective of
   two-dimensional ( 2D) materials, showing excellent carrier mobility,
   strong light-matter interactions in the mid-infrared ( mid-IR) range,
   and unique anisotropic physical properties. These features are beyond
   the existing 2D materials in terms of bandgap range and mobility/bandgap
   trade-off, making it possible to bridge the application gaps ranging
   from mid-IR photonics to high-performance field-effect devices. In this
   paper, we review the status and perspectives of the optical properties
   of black phosphorus, with a particular emphasis on their broadband
   tunable bandgap and anisotropic optical properties. We began with a
   brief introduction on the history, synthesis, crystal/band structures,
   and basic physical properties of black phosphorus. In Section 3, we
   discuss the optical properties of black phosphorus, including comparison
   of the electronic-excitation-induced versus phonon-excitation-induced
   optical properties, linear versus nonlinear absorption, and static
   versus dynamic photoresponse, as well as the quasi-particle effect
   versus the effect. After that, we exemplify typical black phosphorus
   photonic devices in Section 4. We highlight recent progress in
   photodetectors covering mid-IR and terahertz wavelength, ultrafast
   Q-switching and mode-locking pulse lasers and nanophotonic devices.
   Finally, we present a summary and outlook of black phosphorus regarding
   current challenges and future application opportunities in Section 5.

Abstract = {{In situ precision synthesis of monodisperse hairy plasmonic
   nanoparticles with tailored dimensions and compositions by capitalizing
   on amphiphilic starlike diblock copolymers as nanoreactors are reported.
   Such hairy plasmonic nanoparticles comprise uniform noble metal
   nanoparticles intimately and perpetually capped by hydrophobic polymer
   chains (i.e., ``hairs{''}) with even length. Interestingly, amphiphilic
   star-like diblock copolymer nanoreactors retain the spherical shape
   under reaction conditions, and the diameter of the resulting plasmonic
   nanoparticles and the thickness of polymer chains situated on the
   surface of the nanoparticle can be readily and precisely tailored. These
   hairy nanoparticles can be regarded as hard/soft core/shell
   nanoparticles. Notably, the polymer ``hairs{''} are directly and
   permanently tethered to the noble metal nanoparticle surface, thereby
   preventing the aggregation of nanoparticles and rendering their
   dissolution in nonpolar solvents and the homogeneous distribution in
   polymer matrices with long-term stability. This amphiphilic star-like
   block copolymer nanoreactor-based strategy is viable and robust and
   conceptually enables the design and synthesis of a rich variety of hairy
   functional nanoparticles with new horizons for fundamental research on
   self-assembly and technological applications in plasmonics, catalysis,
   energy conversion and storage, bioimaging, and biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene is the first carbon-based two dimensional atomic crystal and
   has gained much attention since its discovery by Geim and co-workers in
   2004. Graphene possesses a large number of material parameters such as
   superior mechanical stiffness, strength and elasticity, very high
   electrical and thermal conductivity, among many others. It is the
   strongest and the most stretchable known material, which has the record
   thermal conductivity and very high intrinsic mobility, as well as being
   completely impermeable. Numerous favorable properties of graphene make
   it a potential promising material for applications in biomedicine. A
   large surface area, chemical purity and the possibility for its easy
   functionalization allow graphene to provide opportunities for drug
   delivery. Its unique mechanical properties suggest applications in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, like other
   nanomaterials, graphene may pose a bio-hazard. In this article, we
   present a systematic review on the synthesis of graphene, various
   approaches for the fabrication of nanocomposites of graphene and their
   applications in biomedicine. A very detailed review is presented on how
   graphene and its nanocomposites are currently exploited for drug
   delivery, cancer therapy, gene delivery, biosensing and regenerative
   medicine. Finally, the safety and toxicity associated with graphene are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The successful development of low-cost, durable electrocatalysts for
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at intermediate temperatures is critical
   for broad commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells. Here, we report
   our findings in design, fabrication, and characterization of a
   cobalt-free SrFe(0.8)5Ti(0.1)Ni(0.05)O(3-delta) cathode decorated with
   NiO nanoparticles. Exsolved from and well bonded to the parent electrode
   under well-controlled conditions, the NiO nanoparticles uniformly
   distributed on the surface of the parent electrode greatly enhance
   cathode performance, demonstrating ORR activity better than that of the
   benchmark cobalt-based Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta. Further, a process
   for regeneration of the NiO nanoparticles was also developed to mitigate
   potential performance degradation due to coarsening of NiO particles
   under practical operating conditions. As a general approach, this
   exsolution dissolution of electrocatalytically active nanoparticles on
   an electrode surface may be applicable to the development of other
   high-performance cobalt-free cathodes for fuel cells and other

Abstract = {{The deposition of conjugated polymers is typically subject to
   chain-entanglement effects, which can severely hinder chain unfolding,
   alignment, and pi-pi stacking during rapid solution-coating processes.
   Here, long-range ordering and highly aligned poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) thin films were demonstrated by preprocessing the polymer
   solution with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation/solution aging and then
   depositing via the blade-coating method, which is compatible with
   roll-to-roll printing processes. The surface morphologies and optical
   anisotropy of deposited films revealed that the degree of chain
   alignment was greatly improved with increased levels of polymer assembly
   that can be precisely controlled by solution-aging time. The
   correlations between oriented nanofibrillar structures and their
   charge-transport anisotropy were further systematically investigated by
   blade coating pretreated solutions parallel and perpendicular to the
   direction of the source and drain electrodes. Interestingly, charge
   transport across the well-aligned P3HT nanofibers was more efficient
   than along the long-axis of nanofibrillar structures owing to enhanced
   intramolecular charge transport and tie-chains. The facile and scalable
   solution-coating method investigated here suggests an effective approach
   to induce anisotropic crystalline structures, which are readily obtained
   by directly controlling their intrinsic solution properties without the
   need for extrinsic techniques such as surface templating or shearing
   blade patterning.}},

Abstract = {{Three phenylenediamine (PD) monomers, o-phenylenediamine (OPD),
   m-phenylenediamine (MPD), and p-phenylenediamine (PPD), were used to
   prepare the functionalized graphene (PD/rGO) networks. The results
   obtained from a series of chemical, thermal, and rheological analyses
   elucidated the mechanism of the covalent bonding and the existence of
   cross-linked graphene networks. The measured XRD patterns and molecular
   dynamic calculations discovered that those PPD and MPD molecules could
   enlarge graphene interlayer spacing to 1.41 and 1.30 nm, respectively,
   while OPD molecules were disorderly bonded or nonbonded to the basal
   planes of graphene layers, resulting in small and variable inter layer
   distances. The loadings of PD monomers were optimized to achieve
   superior supercapacitor performance. Electrochemical study showed that
   PPD/rGO exhibited the largest specific capacitance of 422 F/g with
   excellent cycling stability and low charge transfer resistance. The
   large variations in the capacitance values among PD/rGO networks with
   different PD monomers were explained by the difference in the graphene
   nanostructures, reversible redox transitions, and charge transfer
   characteristics. Particularly, density function theory calculations were
   adopted to compare electronic properties of the PD/rGO composites,
   including formation energy, electron density distribution, HOMO energy
   levels, and electron density of states near the Fermi level.}},

Abstract = {{A bio-enabled, environmentally-friendly, and maximally mild
   layer-by-layer approach has been developed to surface modify inherently
   hydrophobic Kapton HN substrates to allow for great printability of both
   water-and organic solvent-based inks thus facilitating the
   full-inkjet-printing of flexible electronic devices. Different from the
   traditional Kapton surface modification approaches which are
   structure-compromising and use harsh conditions to target, and oxidize
   and/or remove part of, the surface polyimide of Kapton, the present
   Kapton surface modification approach targeted the surface electric
   charges borne by its additive particles, and was not only the first to
   utilize environmentally-friendly clinical biomolecules to build up a
   thin film of protamine-heparin complex on Kapton, but also the first to
   be conducted under minimally destructive and maximally mild conditions.
   Besides, for electrically charged ink particles, the present surface
   modification method can enhance the uniformity of the inkjet-printed
   films by reducing the ``coffee ring effect{''}. As a proof-of-concept
   demonstration, reduced graphene oxide-based gas sensors, which were
   flexible, ultra-lightweight, and miniature-sized, were
   fully-inkjet-printed on surface modified Kapton HN films and tested for
   their sensitivity to dimethyl methylphosphonate (a nerve agent
   simulant). Such fabricated sensors survived a Scotch-tape peel test and
   were found insensitive to repeated bending to a small 0.5 cm radius.}},

   one drug encapsulated in the nanorods and the other physisorbed on their
   surface. During cell culture, preosteoblasts are predominantly attracted
   to the nanorod forests and driven to climb up along the nanorods. This
   type of scaffold integrates both microscale and nanoscale features into
   a single substrate, holding great potential for applications in cell

   average capacity of 329.2 mAh g(-1) at 17 mA g(-1) and a stable cycling
   performance over 40 cycles are achieved. The excellent electrochemical

Abstract = {{The color variations of light emitted by some natural and mutant
   luciferases are normally attributed to collective factors referred to as
   microenvironment effects; however, the exact nature of these
   interactions between the emitting molecule (oxyluciferin) and the active
   site remains elusive. Although model studies of noncomplexed
   oxyluciferin and its variants have greatly advanced the understanding of
   its photochemistry, extrapolation of the conclusions to the real system
   requires assumptions about the polarity and proticity of the active
   site. To decipher the intricate excited-state dynamics, global and
   target analysis is performed here for the first time on the steady-state
   and time-resolved spectra of firefly oxyluciferin complexed with
   luciferase from the Japanese firefly (Luciola cruciata). The
   experimental steady-state and time resolved luminescence spectra of the
   oxyluciferin/luciferase complex in solution are compared with the
   broadband time-resolved firefly bioluminescence recorded in vivo. The
   results demonstrate that de-excitation of the luminophore results in a
   complex cascade of photoinduced proton transfer processes and can be
   interpreted by the pH dependence of the emitted light. It is confirmed
   that proton transfer is the central event in the spectrochemistry of
   this system for which any assignment of the pH dependent emission to a
   single chemical species would be an oversimplification.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun fibers of mixed polyacrylonitrile/polyvinyl pyrrolidine
   (PAN/PVP) sheath and silicone oil core were obtained by coaxial
   electrospinning. PVP and silicone oil were then removed from the coaxial
   electrospun fibers via phase separation and carbonization processes,
   respectively, to make the hollowporous multilayered ultrafine carbon
   fibers. The relationship between the morphology and electrochemical
   performance of ultrafine carbon fibers was investigated. Results show
   that the supercapacitor based on electrode of hollow-porous multilayered
   ultrafine carbon fibers exhibits high conductivity, fast ion diffusion,
   high specific capacitance (231.6 F.g(-1)), high charging/discharging
   efficiency (99.7\%), and low internal resistance (0.2 Omega) using
   tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile as electrolyte.
   Additionally, this work also demonstrates a great potential in the
   preparation of carbon nano-materials with graphene-like multilayer

Abstract = {{We analyze high-quality NuSTAR observations of the local (z = 0.011)
   Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 3639, in conjunction with
   archival Suzaku and Chandra data. This provides the first broadband
   X-ray spectral analysis of the source, spanning nearly two decades in
   energy (0.5-30 keV). Previous X-ray observations of the source below 10
   keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration on the basis of a pronounced
   iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray energy coverage of
   NuSTAR, together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing models,
   enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of
   the source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an
   obscuring column in excess of 3.6 x 10(24) cm(-2), unconstrained at the
   upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of log(10)
   (L2-10keV{[}erg s(-1)] = 43.4(-1.1)(+0.6) to 90\% confidence, almost 400
   times the observed flux, and consistent with various multiwavelength
   diagnostics. Such a high ratio of intrinsic to observed flux, in
   addition to an Fe-K alpha fluorescence line equivalent width exceeding 2
   keV, is extreme among known bona fide CTK AGNs, which we suggest are
   both due to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639. Our
   study demonstrates that broadband spectroscopic modeling with NuSTAR
   enables large corrections for obscuration to be carried out robustly and
   emphasizes the need for improved modeling of AGN tori showing intense
   iron fluorescence.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional studies of dynamic phagocytic behavior have been limited in
   terms of spatial and temporal resolution due to the inherent
   three-dimensionality and small features of phagocytosis. To overcome
   these issues, we use a series of frustrated phagocytosis assays to
   quantitatively characterize phagocytic spreading dynamics. Our
   investigation reveals that frustrated phagocytic spreading occurs in
   phases and is punctuated by a distinct period of contraction. The
   spreading duration and peak contact areas are independent of the surface
   opsonin density, although the opsonin density does affect the likelihood
   that a cell will spread. This reinforces the idea that phagocytosis
   dynamics are primarily dictated by cytoskeletal activity. Structured
   illumination microscopy reveals that F-actin is reorganized during the
   course of frustrated phagocytosis. F-actin in early stages is consistent
   with that observed in lamellipodial protrusions. During the contraction
   phase, it is bundled into fibers that surround the cell and is
   reminiscent of a contractile belt. Using traction force microscopy, we
   show that cells exert significant strain on the underlying substrate
   during the contraction phase but little strain during the spreading
   phase, demonstrating that phagocytes actively constrict during
   late-stage phagocytosis. We also find that late-stage contraction
   initiates after the cell surface area increases by 225\%, which is
   consistent with the point at which cortical tension begins to rise.
   Moreover, reducing tension by exposing cells to hypertonic buffer shifts
   the onset of contraction to occur in larger contact areas. Together,
   these findings provide further evidence that tension plays a significant
   role in signaling late-stage phagocytic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Photoactivation of aqueous chlorine could promote degradation of
   chlorine-resistant and photochemically stable chemicals accumulated in
   swimming pools. This study investigated the degradation of two such
   chemicals, N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) and caffeine, by low
   pressure ultraviolet (UV) light and simulated sunlight (SS) activated
   free chlorine (FC) in different water matrices. Both DEET and caffeine
   were rapidly degraded by UV/FC and SS/FC but exhibited different kinetic
   behaviors. The degradation of DEET followed pseudo-first-order kinetics,
   whereas the degradation of caffeine accelerated with reaction.
   Mechanistic study revealed that, under UV/FC, center dot OH and Cl
   center dot were responsible for degradation of DEET, whereas ClO center
   dot related reactive species (ClOrrs), generated by the reaction between
   FC and center dot OH/Cl center dot, played a major role in addition to
   center dot OH and Cl center dot in degrading caffeine. Reaction rate
   constants of DEET and caffeine with the respective radical species were
   estimated. The imidazole moiety of caffeine was critical for the special
   reactivity with ClOrrs. Water matrix such as pH had a stronger impact on
   the UV/FC process than the SS/FC process. In saltwater matrix under
   UV/FC and SS/FC, the degradation of DEET was significantly inhibited,
   but the degradation of caffeine was much faster than that in nonsalty
   solutions. The interaction between Br- and Cl- may play an important
   role in the degradation of caffeine by UV/FC in saltwater. Reaction
   product analysis showed similar product patterns by UV/FC and SS/FC and
   minimal formation of chlorinated intermediates and disinfection
   byproducts.}},

Abstract = {{Acidification of airborne dust particles can dramatically increase the
   amount of bioavailable phosphorus (P) deposited on the surface ocean.
   Experiments were conducted to simulate atmospheric processes and
   determine the dissolution behavior of P compounds in dust and dust
   precursor soils. Acid dissolution occurs rapidly (seconds to minutes)
   and is controlled by the amount of H+ ions present. For H+ < 10(-4)
   mol/g of dust, 1-10\% of the total P is dissolved, largely as a result
   of dissolution of surface-bound forms. At H+ > 10(-4) mol/g of dust, the
   amount of P (and calcium) released has a direct proportionality to the
   amount of H+ consumed until all inorganic P minerals are exhausted and
   the final pH remains acidic. Once dissolved, P will stay in solution due
   to slow precipitation kinetics. Dissolution of apatite-P (Ap-P), the
   major mineral phase in dust (79-96\%), occurs whether calcium carbonate
   (calcite) is present or not, although the increase in dissolved P is
   greater if calcite is absent or if the particles are externally mixed.
   The system was modeled adequately as a simple mixture of Ap-P and
   calcite. P dissolves readily by acid processes in the atmosphere in
   contrast to iron, which dissolves more slowly and is subject to
   reprecipitation at cloud water pH. We show that acidification can
   increase bioavailable P deposition over large areas of the globe, and
   may explain much of the previously observed patterns of variability in
   leachable P in oceanic areas where primary productivity is limited by
   this nutrient (e.g., Mediterranean).}},

Abstract = {{Significant research has been dedicated to the exploration of high
   thermal conductivity polymer composite materials with conductive filler
   particles for use in heat transfer applications. However, poor particle
   dispersibility and interfacial phonon scattering have limited the
   effective composite thermal conductivity. Three-dimensional foams with
   high ligament thermal conductivity offer a potential solution to the two
   aforementioned problems but are traditionally fabricated through
   expensive and/or complex manufacturing methods. Here, laser induced
   graphene foams, fabricated through a simple and cost effective laser
   ablation method, are infiltrated with poly(3-hexylthiophene) in a
   step-wise fashion to demonstrate the impact of polymer on the thermal
   conductivity of the composite system. Surprisingly, the addition of
   polymer results in a drastic (250\%) improvement in material thermal
   conductivity, enhancing the graphene foam's thermal conductivity from
   0.68 W/m-K to 1.72 W/m-K for the fully infiltrated composite material.
   Graphene foam density measurements and theoretical models are utilized
   to estimate the effective ribbon thermal conductivity as a function of
   polymer filling. Here, it is proposed that the polymer solution acts as
   a binding material, which draws graphene ligaments together through
   elastocapillary coalescence and bonds these ligaments upon drying,
   resulting in greatly reduced contact resistance within the foam and an
   effective thermal conductivity improvement greater than what would be
   expected from the addition of polymer alone. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

   amazing propertise of the prepared PEC hydrogel are presented, which are
   including the ionic strength-responsiveness, the modest mechanical
   property (a tensile stress of 0.2 MPa and a tensile strain of 1500\%)
   and the self-healing ability (a self-healing efficiency of ca. 70\%). In
   brief, we report a multi-functional hydrogel which might serve as a new

Title = {{A unified approach to transfer learning of deep neural networks with
   applications to speaker adaptation in automatic speech recognition}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{448-459}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a unified approach to transfer learning of
   deep neural networks (DNNs) to address performance degradation issues
   caused by a potential acoustic mismatch between the training and testing
   conditions due to inter-speaker variability in state-of-the-art
   connectionist (a.k.a., hybrid) automatic speech recognition (ASR)
   systems. Different schemes to transfer knowledge of deep neural networks
   related to speaker adaptation can be developed with ease under such a
   unifying concept as demonstrated in the three frameworks investigated in
   this study. In the first solution, knowledge is transferred between
   homogeneous domains, namely the source and the target domains. Moreover
   the transfer takes place in a sequential manner from the target to the
   source speaker to boost the ASR accuracy on spoken utterances from a
   surprise target speaker. In the second solution, a multi-task approach
   is adopted to adjust the connectionist parameters to improve the ASR
   system performance on the target speaker. Knowledge is transferred
   simultaneously among heterogeneous tasks, and that is achieved by adding
   one or more smaller auxiliary output layers to the original DNN
   structure. In the third solution, DNN output classes are organised into
   a hierarchical structure in order to adjust the connectionist parameters
   and close the gap between training and testing conditions by
   transferring prior knowledge from the root node to the leaves in a
   structural maximum a posteriori fashion. Through a series of experiments
   on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech recognition task, we show that
   the proposed solutions result in consistent and statistically
   significant word error rate reductions. Most importantly, we show that
   transfer learning is an enabling technology for speaker adaptation,
   since it outperforms both the transformation-based adaptation algorithms
   usually adapted in the speech community, and the multi-condition
   training (MCT) schemes, which is a data combination methods often
   adopted to cover more acoustic variabilities in speech when data from
   the source and target domains are both available at the training time.
   Finally, experimental evidence demonstrates that all proposed solutions
   are robust to negative transfer even when only a single sentence from
   the target speaker is available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{339}},
Pages = {{308-318}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Regrowth inhibitory molecules prevent axon regeneration in the adult
   mammalian central nervous system (CNS). RhoA, a small GTPase in the Rho
   family, is a key intracellular switch that mediates the effects of these
   extracellular regrowth inhibitors. The bacterial enzyme C3-ADP
   ribosyltransferase (C3) selectively and irreversibly inhibits the
   activation of RhoA and stimulates axon outgrowth and regeneration.
   However, effective intracellular delivery of the C3 protein in vivo is
   limited by poor cell permeability and a short duration of action. To
   address this, we have developed a gene therapy approach using viral
   vectors to introduce the C3 gene into neurons or neuronal progenitors.
   Our vectors deliver C3 in a cell-autonomous (endogenous) or a
   cell-nonautonomous (secretable/permeable) fashion and promote in vitro
   process outgrowth on inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
   substrate. Further conditional control of our vectors was achieved via
   the addition of a Tet-On system, which allows for transcriptional
   control with doxycycline administration. These vectors will be crucial
   tools for promoting continued axonal regeneration after CNS injuries or
   neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present a facile method for the fabrication of hematite
   nanocrystal-carbon cloth (Fe2O3-CC) composite. Hierarchical manganite is
   chosen as the sacrificial precursor, that does not contribute to the
   component of final iron oxide but can be in situ dissolved by the acid
   produced from the Fe3+ hydrolysis. This method effectively enhances the
   specific surface area and conductivity of hematite (Fe2O3) by attaching
   Fe2O3 nanocrystals (around 5 nm) firmly on the surface of carbon fibers.
   The obtained Fe2O3-CC can be directly used as a binder-free electrode
   for a supercapacitor. Interestingly, the composite electrode exhibits
   synergistic electrochemical capacitance (electrochemical double-layer
   capacitance and pseudo-capacitance). It manifests a very high areal
   capacitance of 1.66 F cm(-2) (1660 F g(-1)) at 2 mA cm(-2) and excellent
   cycling performance at large current densities (88.6\% retention at 30
   mA cm(-2) after 5000 cycles) in a three-electrode testing system, which
   is among the best performances reported in the literature. Importantly,
   when fabricated as a solid-state flexible symmetric supercapacitor it
   still shows a maximum energy density of 8.74 mW h cm(-3) and power
   density of 253.9 mW cm(-3). Additionally, its good flexibility makes it
   suitable for portable devices.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of assigning and scheduling minor league scouts for
   Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. There are multiple objectives in this
   problem. We formulate the problem as an integer program, use
   decomposition and both column-generation-based and problem-specific
   heuristics to solve it, and evaluate policies on multiple objective
   dimensions based on 100 bootstrapped season schedules. Our approach can
   allow teams to improve operationally by finding better scout schedules,
   to understand quantitatively the strategic tradeoffs inherent in scout
   assignment policies, and to select the assignment policy whose strategic
   and operational performance best meets their needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{MSAProbs is a state-of-the-art protein multiple sequence alignment tool
   based on hidden Markov models. It can achieve high alignment accuracy at
   the expense of relatively long runtimes for large-scale input datasets.
   In this work we present MSAProbs-MPI, a distributed-memory parallel
   version of the multithreaded MSAProbs tool that is able to reduce
   runtimes by exploiting the compute capabilities of common multicore CPU
   clusters. Our performance evaluation on a cluster with 32 nodes (each
   containing two Intel Haswell processors) shows reductions in execution
   time of over one order of magnitude for typical input datasets.
   Furthermore, MSAProbs-MPI using eight nodes is faster than the
   GPU-accelerated QuickProbs running on a Tesla K20. Another strong point
   is that MSAProbs-MPI can deal with large datasets for which MSAProbs and
   QuickProbs might fail due to time and memory constraints, respectively.

Abstract = {{The atmospheric cycle of phosphorus (P) is parameterized here in a
   state-of-the-art global 3-D chemistry transport model, taking into
   account primary emissions of total P (TP) and soluble P (DP) associated
   with mineral dust, combustion particles from natural and anthropogenic
   sources, bioaerosols, sea spray and volcanic aerosols. For the present
   day, global TP emissions are calculated to be roughly 1.33 Tg-P yr(-1),
   with the mineral sources contributing more than 80\% to these emissions.
   The P solubilization from mineral dust under acidic atmospheric
   conditions is also parameterized in the model and is calculated to
   contribute about one-third (0.14 Tg-P yr(-1) /of the global DP
   atmospheric source. To our knowledge, a unique aspect of our global
   study is the explicit modeling of the evolution of phosphorus speciation
   in the atmosphere. The simulated present-day global annual DP deposition
   flux is 0.45 Tg-P yr(-1) (about 40\% over oceans), showing a strong
   spatial and temporal variability. Present-day simulations of atmospheric
   P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared
   with available observations, indicating however an underestimate of
   about 70\% on current knowledge of the sources that drive the P
   atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year
   1850) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios showed a
   present-day increase of 75\% in the P solubilization flux from mineral
   dust, i.e., the rate at which P is converted into soluble forms,
   compared to preindustrial times, due to increasing atmospheric acidity
   over the last 150 years. Future reductions in air pollutants due to the
   implementation of air-quality regulations are expected to decrease the P
   solubilization flux from mineral dust by about 30\% in the year 2100
   compared to the present day. Considering, however, that all the P
   contained in bioaerosols is readily available for uptake by marine
   organisms, and also accounting for all other DP sources, a total
   bioavailable P flux of about 0.17 Tg-P yr(-1) to the oceans is derived.
   Our calculations further show that in some regions more than half of the
   bioavailable P deposition flux to the ocean can originate from
   biological particles, while this contribution is found to maximize in
   summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the
   highest due to ocean stratification. Thus, according to this global
   study, a largely unknown but potentially important role of terrestrial
   bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the global ocean is also
   revealed. Overall, this work provides new insights to the atmospheric P
   cycle by demonstrating that biological materials are important carriers
   of bioavailable P, with very important implications for past and future
   responses of marine ecosystems to global change.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{69-82}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Pressure reduction at the entrance of the compressor in supercritical
   CO2 Brayton cycles may cause nucleation and create a mixture of vapor
   and liquid droplets due to operation near the saturation conditions.
   Transient behavior of the flow after nucleation may cause serious issues
   in operation of the cycle and degrade the materials used in the design.
   The nucleation behavior of supercritical carbon-dioxide inside a venturi
   nozzle near the critical point is computationally studied. A transient
   compressible 3D Navier- Stokes solver, coupled with continuity, and
   energy equations have been implemented. In order to expedite the
   simulations, Fluid property Interpolation Tables (FIT) based on a
   piecewise biquintic spline interpolation of Helmholtz energy have been
   integrated with OpenFOAM to model S-CO2 properties. The mass fraction of
   vapor created in the venturi nozzle has been calculated using
   homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM). Nucleation behavior has been shown
   to be very sensitive to the inlet pressure, inlet temperature, and flow
   rate. The flow conditions that led to nucleation were identified.
   Nucleation was observed in the throat area and divergent section of the
   nozzle for mass flow rates from 0.050 kg/s to 0.065 kg/s, inlet pressure
   from 7.8 to 7.4 MPa for fixed exit pressure equal to 7.28 MPa. The
   inception of high-vapor-content nucleation was first observed in the
   throat area away from the side walls that remained confined to the
   throat region in later times. However, near the walls, a high
   liquid-content two-phase region was detected, first in the divergent
   section. At later times, the two-phase region was convected downstream
   toward the nozzle exit.
   Nucleation in central plane was associated with larger pressure drop and
   higher vapor-content (higher volume fraction); whereas lower pressure
   drop and more liquid-content (lower volume fraction) was observed near
   the walls. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Weighing Scale-Based Pulse Transit Time is a Superior Marker of Blood
   Pressure than Conventional Pulse Arrival Time}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Pulse transit time (PTT) is being widely pursued for cuff-less blood
   pressure (BP) monitoring. Most efforts have employed the time delay
   between ECG and finger photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms as a
   convenient surrogate of PTT. However, these conventional pulse arrival
   time (PAT) measurements include the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the
   time delay through small, muscular arteries and may thus be an
   unreliable marker of BP. We assessed a bathroom weighing scale-like
   system for convenient measurement of ballistocardiography and foot PPG
   waveforms-and thus PTT through larger, more elastic arteries-in terms of
   its ability to improve tracking of BP in individual subjects. We
   measured ``scale PTT{''}, conventional PAT, and cuff BP in humans during
   interventions that increased BP but changed PEP and smooth muscle
   contraction differently. Scale PTT tracked the diastolic BP changes
   well, with correlation coefficient of -0.80 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE) and
   root-mean-squared-error of 7.6 +/- 0.5 mmHg after a best-case
   calibration. Conventional PAT was significantly inferior in tracking
   these changes, with correlation coefficient of -0.60 +/- 0.04 and
   root-mean-squared-error of 14.6 +/- 1.5 mmHg (p < 0.05). Scale PTT also
   tracked the systolic BP changes better than conventional PAT but not to
   an acceptable level. With further development, scale PTT may permit
   reliable, convenient measurement of BP.}},

Abstract = {{Despite all improvements in buildings shell, equipment, and design, CO2
   emissions from buildings are increasing. Since occupants spend more than
   87\% of their time indoors, they are inseparable and significant
   elements of building system dynamics. Hence, there is a great potential
   for energy efficiency in buildings using a wide range of programs such
   as intervention and eco-feedback. Despite the high level of individual
   differences and intra-class variability of occupants' behaviors, the
   current state-of-the-art eco-feedback programs treat all the occupants
   uniformly and do not target and tailor the feedback. Therefore, it
   leaves an opportunity to increase the efficacy of eco-feedback systems
   through the designing of tailored and targeted programs. In this paper,
   we conducted a comprehensive analysis and tested hypotheses on
   occupants' behavioral responses to a normative comparison feedback
   program, in addition to the impact of notifications on the level of
   engagement of each group of occupants. We categorized occupants who
   participated in the normative comparison feedback program into three
   groups (i.e. low, medium, and high energy consumers) based on their
   baseline energy consumption, and tested 9 hypotheses. A mixed-effect
   regression model (MRM) and a paired t-test was implemented to evaluate
   the proposed hypotheses. The hypotheses examine the variability of
   occupants' responses under the same eco-feedback program, and the
   effectiveness of notifications on reinforcing occupants' engagement in
   these programs. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1)
   reporting that the effectiveness of the notifications in eco-feedback
   programs are initially highly dependent on the type and the nature of
   the program, and then the interval and the content of the notification,
   and (2) demonstrating the variability of occupants' behavioral responses
   under the same normative comparison eco-feedback program. These findings
   indicate the need for a shift in focus toward targeted and tailored
   feedback programs which treat occupants based on their characteristics.
   Moreover, they highlight the need for eco-feedback design, development,
   testing and implementation research that acknowledges and addresses
   differences in occupant responses to feedback. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a class of active materials that have
   the capability of fixing a temporary shape and recovering to a permanent
   shape in response to environmental stimuli. While SMPs have been studied
   intensively, researchers paid comparatively fewer attentions to SMPs
   exhibiting anisotropic mechanical and shape memory behaviors by
   controlling the microscopic architectures. At the same time, the rapidly
   developed three-dimension (3D) printing technologies enable us to
   directly print complex 3D structures with multimaterials and provide
   possibilities to fabricate anisotropic shape memory polymer by precisely
   controlling the microstructure of fibers. In this paper, we present a
   new approach for fabricating printed anisotropic shape memory
   elastomeric composites (p-ASMECs) by taking advantage of 3D printing. In
   the fabrication process, an elastomer is first printed as matrix and the
   orientation of fibers is defined by the precisely printed channels. By
   interrupting the printing process, the printed channels are filled with
   the crystallizable polymeric fibers that endow the shape memory effect
   into the composite system. The p-ASMEC5 exhibit large, controllable
   anisotropy in both mechanical and shape memory behaviors that can be
   precisely controlled by geometric parameters of the microstructure such
   as fiber's volume fraction and position in space. To facilitate design
   of p-ASEMCs, we also developed a thermomechanical constitutive framework
   to describe the complex, anisotropic, larger deformation
   thermomechanical behaviors of p-ASEMCs. The developed constitutive
   model, used to explain the phenomenon that the lowest stiffness of
   p-ASEMCs occurs at the fiber orientation angle theta approximate to 55
   degrees, successfully predicts the anisotropic shape memory behavior of
   p-ASMECs, guides the design to enhance the temporary shape fixity, and
   simulates the shear deformation of the temporary shape after completely
   releasing the external constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a simple and cost-effective approach to separate
   the mechanical vibration signals from the electrical feedthrough signals
   resulted from stray capacitances, which is a generic issue in capacitive
   MEMS gyroscopes. Taking advantage of the quadratic relationship between
   the drive voltage and the electrostatic force, the micro-structure can
   be driven into resonance by using voltages oscillating at half of its
   resonant frequency. As a result, the mechanical signals and the
   electrical feedthrough can be readily identified in the frequency
   domain. Although the forcer in this control scheme is nonlinear, it is
   still possible to adopt this method to implement a force rebalance loop.
   A particular feedback controller is designed to achieve a linear
   measurement. Meanwhile, we simplify the modulation and demodulation
   processes in the feedback loop to obtain a fully linear system design.
   In addition, the noise characteristic is analytically investigated by
   using power spectral density in the open-loop case, and is numerically
   simulated in the closed-loop case. The experimental results not only
   demonstrate the feasibility of the control scheme, but also show that
   the fabricated micro-gyroscope using the proposed approach exhibits
   moderate performances. The nonlinearity of the scale factor is 290 ppm
   within the measurement range of +/- 300 deg/s. The bias instability
   achieves about 4.5 deg/h with an angular random walk of 11.9
   deg/h/sqrt(Hz).}},

Title = {{A simple visualization and programming framework for wireless sensor

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in
   various critical domains like health care, critical infrastructure, and
   climate monitoring, where application builders have diversified
   development needs for programming, visualization, and simulation tools.
   However, these tools are designed as separate stand-alone applications.
   To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools, we have designed a new
   extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and open-source framework called
   PROVIZ. PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming framework
   with the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization tool
   that can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packet
   payload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packet
   sniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF
   802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) a
   scripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aims
   at reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) an
   over-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) a
   visual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules for
   generating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison tool
   that analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposed
   visual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ also
   includes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities that
   allow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with other
   users. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ's
   visualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, and
   discuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to create
   an all-encompassing development and test environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Void growth is usually considered one of the most critical phases
   leading to dynamic fracture of ductile materials. Investigating the
   detailed process of void growth at the nanoscale aids in understanding
   the damage mechanism of metals. While most atomistic simulations by far
   assume circular or spherical voids for simplicity, recent studies
   highlight the significance of the initial void ellipticity in mechanical
   response of voided metals. In this work, we perform large scale
   molecular dynamics simulations with millions of atoms to investigate the
   void growth in plastic deformation of thin films in face-centered cubic
   Cu. It is found that the initial ellipticity and the initial orientation
   angle of the void have substantial impacts on the dislocation
   nucleation, the void evolution, and the stress-strain response. In
   particular, the initial dislocation emission sites and the sequence of
   slip plane activation vary with the initial void geometry. For the void
   size evolution, three regimes are identified: (I) the porosity increases
   relatively slowly in the absence of dislocations, (II) the porosity
   grows much more rapidly after dislocations start to glide on different
   slip planes, and (III) the rate of porosity variation becomes much more
   slowly when dislocations are saturated in the model, and the void
   surface becomes irregular, non-smooth. In terms of the stress-strain
   response, the effects of the initial orientation angle are more
   pronounced when the initial void ellipticity is large; the influence of
   the initial void ellipticity is different for different initial
   orientation angles. The effects of the temperature, the strain rate, the
   loading direction, and the initial porosity in the void growth are also
   explored. Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of initial void
   geometry-dependent plastic deformation of metallic thin films and shed
   light on informing more accurate theoretical models.}},

   behavior and morphology}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{56-63}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Here, we reported a new type of water expandable polystyrene (WEPS)
   beads containing cellulose nanofibrils (CNEs). This expansible material,
   called CNFWEPS, showed the highest expansion ratio (16) for the
   as-synthesized beads and 8 after 4.5 months, which has never been
   reported in the literature. Expandable beads containing 9-13 wt\% of the
   well-dispersed water were synthesized through Pickering emulsion
   polymerization of styrene in the presence of CNF. During the
   polymerization, CNEs rearrange and create nanospheres which entrap water
   inside polystyrene beads. Morphological investigations along with
   thermogravimetric analysis showed that the entrapped water is either
   discrete water droplets of 9-10 mu m in diameter or bound water with a
   strong adsorption to the hydrophilic nanoparticles inside the beads.
   Importantly, the bound water could be preserved several months after
   synthesis and therefore prolong the shelf-life of the CNFWEPS beads. The
   analysis of the expansion kinetics of the CNF-WEPS beads revealed
   three-regime behavior with strong temperature dependency. The highest
   expansion ratio was obtained at 135 degrees C for the sample containing
   0.2 wt\% of CNF. Overall, apart from stabilization of water in the
   beads, the vital role of CNF unveiled to be reinforcing the foam
   structure and inhibiting the cell wall rupture by increasing melt
   strength of the matrix during expansion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{389}},

Abstract = {{Phosphonic acid (PA) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are utilized at
   critical interfaces between transparent conductive oxides (TCO) and
   organic active layers in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). The
   effects of PA deposition method and time on the formation of
   close-packed, high-quality monolayers is investigated here for SAMs
   fabricated by solution deposition, micro-contact printing, and spray
   coating. The solution deposition isotherm for pentafluorinated
   benzylphosphonic acid (F5BnPA) on indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) is
   studied using polarization modulation-infrared reflection-absorption
   spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) at room temperature as a model PA/IZO system.
   Fast surface adsorption occurs within the first min; however,
   well-oriented high-quality SAMs are reached only after similar to 48 h,
   presumably through a continual process of molecular
   adsorption/desorption and monolayer filling accompanied by molecular
   reorientation. Two other rapid, soak-free deposition techniques,
   micro-contact printing and spray coating, are also explored. SAM quality
   is compared for deposition of phenyl phosphonic acid (PPA),
   F-13-octylphosphonic acid (F(13)OPA), and pentafluorinated benzyl
   phosphonic acid (F(5)BnPA) by solution deposition, micro-contact
   printing and spray coating using PM-IRRAS. In contrast to micro-contact
   printing and spray coating techniques, 48-168h solution deposition at
   both room temperature and 70 degrees C result in contamination- and
   surface etch-free close-packed monolayers with good reproducibility.
   SAMs fabricated by micro-contact printing and spray coating are much
   less well ordered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A bilayer oxygen permeable membrane consisting of hierarchically porous
   Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95-(La0.8Sr0.20)(0.95)MnO3-delta (GDC-LSM) support and
   dense GDC-LSM film has been fabricated by a combined freeze-drying
   tape-casting and screen-printing method followed by co-sintering. Two
   dimensional (2D) SEM-BSE and reconstructed three dimensional (3D) XCT
   images indicated that the porous GDC-LSM support (870-mu m-thick)
   contains graded straight pores with low tortuosity factor, promoting
   fast gas diffusion in the support, while the dense GDC-LSM film with a
   thickness of 30 mu m provides a short path for the bulk transport of
   oxygen ions and electrons. However, the oxygen flux of the asymmetric
   GD-CLSM membrane is only 81\% higher than that of the 900-mu m-thick
   dense GDC-LSM symmetric membrane, indicating that the oxygen transport
   becomes limited by the surface oxygen exchange process for the GDC-LSM
   asymmetric membrane with a 30-mu m-thick dense GDC-LSM film. When the
   permeate side surface is modified with
   Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (SDC-LSCF), the oxygen
   permeation flux of the GDC-LSM asymmetric membrane is significantly
   enhanced from 0.105 to 0.780 mL cm(-2) min(-1), while the activation
   energy is substantially decreased from 219.6 +/- 8.7 to 138.1 +/- 3.3 kJ
   mol(-1), due to enhanced surface oxygen exchange kinetics. Furthermore,
   the coated asymmetric membrane shows 1100\% higher oxygen flux than the
   coated symmetric membrane. When the sweep gas is switched from helium to
   CO2, although the adsorption of CO2 on the permeate side surface leads
   to a slight decrease in oxygen permeation flux, a high oxygen permeation
   flux of 0.659 mL cm(-2) min(-1) can still be achieved, demonstrating
   that the coated GDC-LSM asymmetric membrane is promising for oxy-fuel
   combustion application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A previously reported polyimide, 6FDA/DETDA:DABA(3:2), was pyrolyzed
   under different protocols to produce carbon molecular sieve (CMS) dense
   film membranes for separation of important gas pairs, including pure
   gases CO2, CH4, O-2, N-2 and mixture gases 50\%CO2/50\% CH4 and 50\%
   C3H6/50\% C3H8. This study investigated the effects of pyrolysis
   temperature, 02 doping, and precrosslinking on the separation
   performance of 6FDA/DETDA:DABA(3:2) CMS membranes. Comparing to the
   precursor membranes, separation performance of all 6FDA/DETDA:DABA(3:2)
   CMS membranes improves significantly with both higher permeability and
   selectivity. The CMS film pyrolyzed with a novel method, i.e., 800
   degrees C with precrosslinking, shows very attractive separation
   performance with CO2 and O-2 permeability of 4678 Barrer and 683 Barrer,
   CO2/CH4, O-2/N-2 selectivity of 71.5 and 8.0. Sorption measurements
   provide insight into the pore size distributions among these CMS
   membranes. The effects of these three parameters during pyrolysis on the
   CMS membranes gas separation performance are summarized and compared,
   hypotheses regarding the structure changes brought about by changing
   these parameters are also provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{433-446}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical method for designing a spatial filter
   that processes the data from an array of two-dimensional guided wave
   transducers. An inverse problem is defined where the spatial filter
   coefficients are determined in such a way that a prescribed beam shape,
   i.e., a desired array output is best approximated in the least-squares
   sense. Taking advantage of the 2 pi-periodicity of the generated wave
   field, Fourier-series representation is used to derive closed-form
   expressions for the constituting matrix elements. Special cases in which
   the desired array output is an ideal delta function and a gate function
   are considered in a more explicit way. Numerical simulations are
   performed to examine the performance of the filters designed by the
   proposed method. It is shown that the proposed filters can significantly
   improve the beam quality in general. Most notable is that the proposed
   method does not compromise between the main lobe width and the sidelobe
   levels; i.e. a narrow main lobe and low sidelobes are simultaneously
   achieved. It is also shown that the proposed filter can compensate the
   effects of nonuniform directivity and sensitivity of array elements by
   explicitly taking these into account in the formulation. From an example
   of detecting two separate targets, how much the angular resolution can
   be improved as compared to the conventional delay-and-sum filter is
   quantitatively illustrated. Lamb wave based imaging of localized defects
   in an elastic plate using a circular array is also presented as an
   example of practical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The temperature dependence of the orientational order parameters <
   P-2(cos beta)> and < P-4(cos beta)> in the nematic (N) and twist-bend
   nematic (N-tb) phases of the liquid crystal dimer CB7CB have been
   measured using x-ray and polarized Raman scattering. The < P-2(cos
   beta)> obtained from both techniques are the same, while < P-4(cos
   beta)>, determined by Raman scattering is, as expected, systematically
   larger than its x-ray value. Both order parameters increase in theN
   phase with decreasing temperature, drop across the N-N-tb transition,
   and continue to decrease. In the N-tb phase, the x-ray value of <
   P-4(cos beta)> eventually becomes negative, providing a direct and
   independent confirmation of a conical molecular orientational
   distribution. The heliconical tilt angle a, determined from
   orientational distribution functions in the N-tb phase, increases to
   similar to 24 degrees at similar to 15 K below the transition. In the
   N-tb phase, alpha(T)alpha(T {*}-T)(lambda), with lambda = 0.19 +/- 0.03.
   The transition supercools by 1.7 K, consistent with its weakly
   first-order nature. The value of lambda is close to 0.25 indicating
   close proximity to a tricritical point.}},

Abstract = {{We report a systematic study of the sulfate mediated polyol synthesis of
   Pd decahedra in an attempt to maximize both the conversion and
   morphology yields. Quantitative analyses of the as-obtained products
   reveal the presence of nanocrystal populations with distinct ranges of
   size. Samples collected in the early stage of a standard synthesis
   indicate that this size distribution is likely caused by the coalescence
   of the initially formed decahedral nuclei. Kinetic measurements clearly
   show the impact of the sulfate additive on the initial reduction rate
   and thus the yield of decahedral nuclei. Based on the mechanistic
   understanding developed over the course of this work, we were able to
   significantly improve the conversion and morphology yields of the Pd
   decahedra synthesis by introducing a second reducing agent after the
   completion of homogeneous nucleation. The improvement in yields for the
   Pd decahedra synthesis will increase the availability of these
   nanocrystals as catalytic materials and as a unique platform for the
   development of more complex nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystals can organize dispersed particles into useful and exotic
   structures. In the case of lyotropic cholesteric polypeptide liquid
   crystals, polypeptide-coated particles are appealing because the surface
   chemistry matches that of the polymeric mesogen, which permits a tighter
   focus on factors such as extended particle shape. The colloidal
   particles developed here consist of a magnetic and fluorescent
   cylindrically symmetric silica core with one rounded, almost
   hemispherical end. Functionalized with helical
   poly(gamma-stearyl-L-glutamate) (PSLG), the particles were dispersed at
   different concentrations in cholesteric liquid crystals (ChLC) of the
   same polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Defects introduced by the
   particles to the director field of the bulk PSLG/THF host led to a
   variety of phases. In fresh mixtures, the cholesteric mesophase of the
   PSLG matrix was distorted, as reflected in the absence of the
   characteristic fingerprint pattern. Over time, the fingerprint pattern
   returned, more quickly when the concentration of the PSLG-coated
   particles was low. At low particle concentration the particles were
   ``guided{''} by the PSLG liquid crystal to organize into patterns
   similar to that of the re-formed bulk chiral nematic phase. When their
   concentration increased, the well-dispersed PSLG-coated particles seemed
   to map onto the distortions in the bulk host's local director field. The
   particles located near the glass vial-ChLC interfaces were stacked
   lengthwise into architectures with apparent two-dimensional hexagonal
   symmetry. The size of these ``crystalline{''} structures increased with
   particle concentration. They displayed remarkable stability toward an
   external magnetic field; hydrophobic interactions between the PSLG
   polymers in the shell and those in the bulk LC matrix may be
   responsible. The results show that bio-inspired LCs can assemble
   suitable colloidal particles into soft crystalline structures.}},

Abstract = {{Free-energy landscapes govern the behavior of all interactions in the
   presence of thermal fluctuations in the fields of physical chemistry,
   materials sciences, and the biological sciences. From the energy
   landscape, critical information about an interaction, such as the
   reaction kinetic rates, bond lifetimes, and the presence of intermediate
   states, can be determined. Despite the importance of energy landscapes
   to understanding reaction mechanisms, most experiments do not directly
   measure energy landscapes, particularly for interactions with steep
   force gradients that lead to premature jump to contact of the probe and
   insufficient sampling of transition regions. Here we present an atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) approach for measuring energy landscapes that
   increases sampling of strongly adhesive interactions by using
   white-noise excitation to enhance the cantilever's thermal fluctuations.
   The enhanced fluctuations enable the recording of subtle deviations from
   a harmonic potential to accurately reconstruct interfacial energy
   landscapes with steep gradients. Comparing the measured energy landscape
   with adhesive force measurements reveals the existence of an optimal
   excitation voltage that enables the cantilever fluctuations to fully
   sample the shape and depth of the energy surface.}},

Abstract = {{In2O3-x(OH)(y) nanoparticles have been shown to function as an effective
   gas-phase photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO via the reverse
   water-gas shift reaction. Their photocatalytic activity is strongly
   correlated to the number of oxygen vacancy and hydroxide defects present
   in the system. To better understand how such defects interact with
   photogenerated electrons and holes in these materials, we have studied
   the relaxation dynamics of In2O3-x(OH)(y) nanoparticles with varying
   concentration of defects using two different excitation energies
   corresponding to above-band-gap (318-nm) and near-band-gap (405-nm)
   excitations. Our results demonstrate that defects play a significant
   role in the excited-state, charge relaxation pathways. Higher defect
   concentrations result in longer excited-state lifetimes, which are
   attributed to improved charge separation. This correlates well with the
   observed trends in the photocatalytic activity. These results are
   further supported by density-functional theory calculations, which
   confirm the positions of oxygen vacancy and hydroxide defect states
   within the optical band gap of indium oxide. This enhanced understanding
   of the role these defects play in determining the optoelectronic
   properties and charge carrier dynamics can provide valuable insight
   toward the rational development of more efficient photocatalytic
   materials for CO2 reduction.}},

Abstract = {{For the design of adsorptive-separation units, knowledge is required of
   the multicomponent adsorption behavior. Ideal adsorbed solution theory
   (IAST) breaks down for olefin adsorption in open-metal site (OMS)
   materials due to non-ideal donor-acceptor interactions. Using a
   density-function-theory-based energy decomposition scheme, we develop a
   physically justifiable classical force field that incorporates the
   missing orbital interactions using an appropriate functional form. Our
   first-principles derived force field shows greatly improved quantitative
   agreement with the inflection points, initial uptake, saturation
   capacity, and enthalpies of adsorption obtained from our in-house
   adsorption experiments. While IAST fails to make accurate predictions,
   our improved force field model is able to correctly predict the
   multicomponent behavior. Our approach is also transferable to other OMS
   structures, allowing the accurate study of their separation performances
   for olefins/paraffins and further mixtures involving complex
   donor-acceptor interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The IceCube Collaboration has previously discovered a high-energy
   astrophysical neutrino flux using neutrino events with interaction
   vertices contained within the instrumented volume of the IceCube
   detector. We present a complementary measurement using charged current
   muon neutrino events where the interaction vertex can be outside this
   volume. As a consequence of the large muon range the effective area is
   significantly larger but the field of view is restricted to the Northern
   Hemisphere. IceCube data from 2009 through 2015 have been analyzed using
   a likelihood approach based on the reconstructed muon energy and zenith
   angle. At the highest neutrino energies between 194 TeV and 7.8 PeV a
   significant astrophysical contribution is observed, excluding a purely
   atmospheric origin of these events at 5.6 sigma significance. The data
   are well described by an isotropic, unbroken power-law flux with a
   normalization at 100 TeV neutrino energy of (0.90(-0.27)(+0.30)) x
   10(-18) GeV-1 cm(-2) s(-1) sr(-1) and a hard spectral index of gamma =
   2.13 +/- 0.13. The observed spectrum is harder in comparison to previous
   IceCube analyses with lower energy thresholds which may indicate a break
   in the astrophysical neutrino spectrum of unknown origin. The
   highest-energy event observed has a reconstructed muon energy of (4.5
   +/- 1.2) PeV which implies a probability of less than 0.005\% for this
   event to be of atmospheric origin. Analyzing the arrival directions of
   all events with reconstructed muon energies above 200 TeV no correlation
   with known gamma-ray sources was found. Using the high statistics of
   atmospheric neutrinos we report the current best constraints on a prompt
   atmospheric muon neutrino flux originating from charmed meson decays
   which is below 1.06 in units of the flux normalization of the model in
   Enberg et al.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmic reionization is thought to be primarily fueled by the first
   generations of galaxies. We examine their stellar and gaseous
   properties, focusing on the star formation rates and the escape of
   ionizing photons, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and environment
   using the full suite of the Renaissance Simulations with an eye to
   provide better inputs to global reionization simulations. This suite
   probes overdense, average, and underdense regions of the universe of
   several hundred comoving Mpc(3), each yielding a sample of over 3000
   halos in the mass range of 10(7)-10(9.5)M(circle dot) at their final
   redshifts of 15, 12.5, and 8, respectively. In the process, we simulate
   the effects of radiative and supernova feedback from 5000 to 10,000
   Population III stars in each simulation. We find that halos as small as
   10(7) M-circle dot are able to host bursty star formation due to
   metal-line cooling from earlier enrichment by massive Population III
   stars. Using our large sample, we find that the galaxy-halo occupation
   fraction drops from unity at virial masses above 10(8.5) M-circle dot to
   similar to 50\% at 10(8) M-circle dot and similar to 10\% at 10(7)
   M-circle dot, quite independent of redshift and region. Their average
   ionizing escape fraction is similar to 5\% in the mass range of

   this range, reaching 40\%-60\% at 10(7) M-circle dot. Interestingly, we
   find that the escape fraction varies between 10\%-20\% in halos with
   virial masses of similar to 3 x 10(9) M-circle dot. Taken together, our

Abstract = {{The interlayer waveguide grating coupling efficiencies under angular
   (rotational) misalignments are simulated using the 3D rigorous
   coupled-wave analysis (3D-RCWA) together with the RCWA
   equivalent-index-slab (RCWA-EIS) method. As examples of conical
   diffraction, rotations about the two coordinate axes, x and z, defined
   by the vectors {[} 1 0 0] and {[} 0 0 1], respectively, as well as an
   arbitrary axis, defined by the vector {[} 2 2 1], are simulated for
   binary rectangular-groove gratings. The interlayer grating coupling
   efficiency is approximated by the product of the top-and bottom-grating
   diffraction efficiencies (DEs). It is found that the bottom-grating DEs
   decrease about 25\% when the bottom grating is rotated +/- 0.1 rad (5.73
   degrees) about the z-axis. DEs slightly increase (5\% to 10\% depending
   on the grating structures) when the bottom grating is rotated +/- 0.1
   rad about the x-axis. This is consistent with the diffraction behavior
   of an over-modulated grating. When the bottom grating is rotated about
   the vector {[} 2 2 1], the change in DEs is asymmetric with a 100\%
   decrease at a rotation angle -0.1 rad and a 67\% decrease at a rotation
   angle +/- 0.1 rad. The method is shown to be computationally efficient
   and numerically stable for grating structures with optimized parameters,
   and the resulting bottom-grating diffraction efficiencies demonstrate
   similar trends as those calculated by the 3D finite-difference
   time-domain simulations. The procedure presented can be directly used in
   the analysis and design of interlayer waveguide grating coupling for
   optical interconnects in high-density integrated electronics. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel wideband circularly polarized (CP)
   composite, called cavity-backed crossed dipole antenna for 2.45 GHz
   industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band wireless communication.
   To excite the CP radiation effectively, a curved-delay line providing an
   orthogonal phase difference among the cross-dipole elements is attached
   at corners of the sequentially rotated elements. By choosing a proper
   radius of the curved-delay line, a wide input impedance of the antenna
   can be realized. Unlike conventional cross-dipole antennas, the proposed
   cross-dipole antenna is designed with an open stub added to the
   radiating arms of the dipole so that both impedance and axial ratio
   bandwidths are enhanced. The antenna is center-fed by a 50-Omega coaxial
   cable and is placed above a cavity-backed reflector to obtain a
   directional CP radiation pattern. With the advantage of being
   center-fed, a symmetric CP radiation pattern can be achieved across the
   entire operating bandwidth. To further improve the directivity and the
   radiation pattern, a rectangular cavity-backed reflector is used.
   Simulated and measured results confirm that the proposed antenna has
   good CP characteristics. The proposed antenna obtains a broad 3-dB axial
   ratio bandwidth of 49\% (1.20 GHz, 1.96-3.16 GHz) and an impedance
   bandwidth of 67.7\% (1.66 GHz, 1.69-3.35 GHz) for reflection coefficient
   (S-11) <= -10 dB. It also yields an average CP gain of 9.2 dBic across
   the operating bandwidth and a peak CP gain of 10 dBic. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Effects of Heavy Metals from Soil and Dust Source on DNA Damage of the
   Leymus chinensis Leaves in Coal-Mining Area in Northwest China}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Air and soil pollution from mining activities has been considered as a
   critical issue to the health of living organisms. However, few efforts
   have been made in distinguishing the main pathway of organism genetic
   damage by heavy metals related to mining activities. Therefore, we
   investigated the genetic damage of Leymus chinensis leaf cells, the air
   particulate matter (PM) contents, and concentrations of the main heavy
   metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg) in soil and foliar dust samples collected from
   seven experiment points at the core mining area and one control point 20
   kilometers away from the core mining area in Inner Mongolia in 2013.
   Comet assay was used to test the genetic damage of the Leymus chinensis
   leaf cells; the Tail DNA\% and Tail Moment were used to characterize the
   genetic damage degree of the plant cells. The comet assay results showed
   that the cell genetic damage ratio was up to 77.0\% in experiment points
   but was only 35.0\% in control point. The control point also had the
   slight Tail DNA\% and Tail Moment values than other experiment groups.
   The cell damage degree of the control group was 0.935 and experiment
   groups were 1.299-1.815. The geo-accumulation index and comperehensive
   pollution index(CPI) were used to characterize heavy metal pollution in
   foliar dust samples, and single factor pollution index and CPI were used
   to characterize the heavy metal pollution in soil samples. The CPIfoliar
   dust of control group was 0.36 and experiment groups were 1.45-2.57; the
   CPIsoil of control group was 0.04 and experiment groups were 0.07-0.12.
   The results of correlation analyze showed that Air Quality Index
   (AQI)-CPIfoliar dust(r = 0.955{*}{*})>Damage degree-CPIfoliar dust(r =
   0.923{*}{*}) >Damage degree-AQI(r = 0.908{*}{*})> Damage degree-CPIsoil
   (r = 0.824{*}). The present research proved that mining activity had a
   high level of positive correlation with organism genetic damage caused
   by heavy metals through comparing with the control point; soil and
   atmosphere were both the important action pathway for heavy metal
   induced genetic damage in mining area. Furthermore, heavy metal contents
   in foliar dust showed a higher positive correlation with genetic damage
   than when compared with soil. This means the heavy metal contents that
   L. chinensis absorbed through respiration from the atmosphere could make
   more serious genetic damage than when absorbed by root systems from soil
   in the mining area. This study can provide theoretical support for
   research on plant genetic damage mechanisms and exposure pathways
   induced by environmental pollution.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of studies have used a combination of intravascular
   ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the
   assessment of atherosclerotic plaques. Given their respective strengths
   these imaging modalities highly complement each other. Correlations of
   hemodynamics and coronary artery disease (CAD) have been extensively
   investigated with both modalities separately, though not concurrently
   due to challenges in image registration. Manual co-registration of these
   modalities is a time expensive task subject to human error, and the
   development of an automatic method has not been previously addressed. We
   developed a framework that uses dynamic time warping for the
   longitudinal co-registration and dynamic programming for the
   circumferential co-registration of images and evaluated the methodology
   in a cohort (n = 12) of patients with moderate CAD. Excellent
   correlation was seen between the algorithm and two expert readers for
   longitudinal co-registration (CCC = 0.9964, CCC = 0.9959) and
   circumferential co-registration (CCC = 0.9688, CCC = 0.9598). The mean
   error of the circumferential co-registration angle was found to be
   within 10\%. A framework for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT
   pullbacks has been developed which provides a foundation for
   comprehensive studies of CAD biomechanics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a set of nanoporous
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable porosity and functionality.
   Among MOFs, they also show relatively good stability with respect to
   temperature and humidity. These characteristics lead to their possible
   applications in separation processes. In many practical separation
   processes, adsorbents are exposed to a variety of molecular species
   including acid gases. However, there is little knowledge of the effects
   of such acid gas exposure on the adsorption and separation properties of
   ZIFs. Here, the stability of a model ZIF material (ZIF-8) under SO2
   exposure in dry, humid, and aqueous environments has been investigated
   in detail. Combined characterization by several techniques (PXRD, N-2
   physisorption, EDX, XPS, and FTIR) allowed us to track the structural
   and compositional properties of ZIF-8 before and after SO2 exposure.
   ZIF-8 is stable after prolonged exposure in dry SO2 and in humid air
   without SO2. However, exposure to 10-20 ppm concentrations of SO2 in the
   presence of high relative humidity led to its irreversible structural
   degradation over time as evidenced by substantial losses in
   crystallinity and textural properties. Exposure to similar
   concentrations of aqueous SO2 did not lead to bulk degradation. Humid
   SO2 exposed ZIF-8 showed a significant presence of sulfur (S) even after
   reactivation, with vibrational characteristics corresponding to
   (bi)sulfite and (bi)sulfate groups. A mechanism of ZIF-8 degradation
   combining the synergistic effects of SO2 and humidity is proposed.
   Attack by sulfuric and sulfurous acid species (generated in humid SO2)
   leads to protonation of nitrogen in the imidazole ring, resulting in
   cleavage of metal-linker (Zn-N) bonds. Our detailed experimental
   findings serve as a starting point for developing a generalized
   mechanism of acid gas interactions with ZIF materials.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the presence of acid
   gases may be decisive in their suitability for industrial applications.
   In this study, MIL-125 and MIL-12S-NH2 were investigated with SO2
   exposure in dry, humid, and aqueous environments. MIL-125 was found to
   be unstable in both humid and aqueous acidic environments, while
   MIL-125-NH2 was stable under these exposure conditions, showing no
   change in textural properties or visual degradation, as observed through
   SEM. Both materials were stable in the presence of water and dry SOD
   suggesting that the reaction of these molecules to form an acidic
   species is likely a key factor in the degradation of MIL-125. In situ IR
   experiments confirmed the presence of sulfite species, supporting the
   hypothesis that the presence of an acidic sulfur species likely leads to
   the degradation of the MIL-125 structure. Computational investigation of
   several potential reaction mechanisms in MIL-125 indicated reactions
   involving the bisulfite ion are favored over reactions with water or
   SO2. DFT simulations support the observation that MIL-125-NH2 is stable
   in humid conditions, as all reactions are less favorable with the
   functionalized framework compared to the unfunctionalized framework.
   This combined experimental and computational study advances the
   fundamental understanding of MOF degradation mechanisms during acid gas
   exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) in aqueous, humid, and
   acid gas environments likely begins at defect sites. Until now, however,
   theoretical studies of MOFs have widely assumed an ideal defect-free
   structure. Here we present a computational model for low-energy extended
   defects in bulk zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) that are
   analogous to stacking faults in zeolites. We demonstrate the
   thermodynamic accessibility of stacking faults in ZIFs and examine the
   impact of these defects on pore diffusion and accessible surface area.
   We identify strong correlations between the defect density of a
   structure and its X-ray diffraction spectra. By examining a
   topologically isomorphic ZIF that has been reported experimentally we
   find characteristic defect-induced peak broadening and splitting in the
   reported powder patterns, giving strong evidence for the existence for
   stacking faults in this material.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been observed in several
   neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma
   oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced,
   behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque
   formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
   Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive
   (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies,
   reduces levels of amyloid-beta (A beta)(1-40) and A beta(1-42) isoforms.
   Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with
   morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis
   confirmed increased microglia co-localization with A beta. Subsequently,
   we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A
   beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) levels in the visual cortex of
   pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice.
   Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma
   rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate
   Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of 1 sun illumination for 24 h on encapsulated inverted
   organic photovoltaic devices is studied through a series of electrical
   and optical characterizations for donor/acceptor polymer solar cells
   based on poly(dithienogermole-alt-thienopyrrolodione)/{[}6,6]-phenyl C71
   butyric acid methyl ester blends. Power conversion efficiency is
   significantly reduced after light exposure due to a 45\% drop in the
   device fill factor and a 40\% drop in both the open circuit voltage and
   short circuit current. The decrease in open circuit voltage is
   attributed to a reduction in the built-in field in the device due to
   photodegradation of the ZnO interlayer. The reduction in fill factor and
   short circuit current is shown to be due to the formation of an
   extraction barrier for hole collection as a result of photodegradation
   of the MoOx interlayer. Using a 400 nm long pass filter to block the UV
   light, device stability is significantly enhanced, resulting in a
   decrease in power conversion efficiency of less than 5\% under the same

   ceramics during redox processes}},

Abstract = {{Ceria (CeO2) based ceramics have been widely used for many applications
   due to their unique ionic, electronic, and catalytic properties. Here,
   we report our findings in investigating into the redox processes of
   undoped and Sm-doped CeO2 ceramics stimulated by high-energy electron
   beam irradiation within a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The
   reduced structure with oxygen vacancy ordering has been identified as
   the CeO1.68 (C-Ce2O3+delta) phase via high-resolution TEM. The reduction
   of Ce4+ to Ce3+ has been monitored by electron energy-loss spectroscopy.
   The decreased electronic conductivity of the Sm-doped CeO2
   (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, SDC) is revealed by electron holography, as positive
   electrostatic charges accumulated at the surfaces of SDC grains under
   electron beam irradiation, but not at CeO2 grains. The formation of the
   reduced CeO1.68 domains corresponds to lattice expansion compared to the
   CeO2 matrix. Therefore, the growth of CeO1.68 nuclei builds up strain
   inside the matrix, causing annihilation of dislocations inside the
   grains. By using in-situ high-resolution TEM and a fast OneView camera
   recording system, we investigated dislocation motion inside both CeO2
   and SDC grains under electron beam irradiation. The dislocations prefer
   to dissociate into Shockley partials bounded by stacking faults. Then,
   the partials can easily glide in the \{111\} planes to reach the grain
   surfaces. Even the Lomer-Cottrell lock can be swept away by the phase
   change induced strain field. Our results revealed the high mobility of
   dislocations inside CeO2 and SDC grains during their respective redox
   processes. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   Two-Dimensional MoS2 on Metal Substrates}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the role of interfacial electronic properties on the
   phonon transport in two-dimensional MoS2 adsorbed on metal substrates
   (Au and Sc) using first-principles density functional theory and the
   atomistic Green's function method. Our study reveals that the different
   degree of orbital hybridization and electronic charge distribution
   between MoS2 and metal substrates play a significant role in determining
   the overall phonon-phonon coupling and phonon transmission. The charge
   transfer caused by the adsorption of MoS2 on Sc substrate can
   significantly weaken the Mo-S bond strength and change the phonon
   properties of MoS2, which result in a significant change in thermal
   boundary conductance (TBC) from one lattice-stacking configuration to
   another for same metallic substrate. In a lattice-stacking configuration
   of MoS2/Sc, weakening of the Mo-S bond strength due to charge
   redistribution results in decrease in the force constant between Mo and
   S atoms and substantial redistribution of phonon density of states to
   low-frequency region which affects overall phonon transmission leading
   to 60\% decrease in TBC compared to another configuration of MoS2/Sc.
   Strong chemical coupling between MoS2 and the Sc substrate leads to a
   significantly (similar to 19 times) higher TBC than that of the weakly
   bound MoS2/Au system. Our findings demonstrate the inherent connection
   among the interfacial electronic structure, the phonon distribution, and
   TBC, which helps us understand the mechanism of phonon transport at the
   MoS2/metal interfaces. The results provide insights for the future
   design of MoS2-based electronics and a way of enhancing heat dissipation
   at the interfaces of MoS2-based nanoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Recent increases in shale gas production provide an excellent
   opportunity for advancements in the energy-efficient separation of
   natural gas liquids because these are increasingly used as fuel sources
   and chemical feedstocks. Current fractionation schemes generally involve
   cryogenic distillation of C-1-C-4 hydrocarbons and are extremely energy
   intensive. Here, we describe the first steps toward a lower energy,
   kinetic pressure-swing-adsorption cycle for the separation of ethane,
   propane, propylene, and butane using ZIF-8 as a diffusionally selective
   adsorbent. Crystal engineering techniques were employed to control the
   diffusive time scale of the separation, allowing for multiple
   separations using the same adsorbent within reasonable process times.
   Equimolar separation of ethane/propane mixtures at 293 K exhibited
   separation factors of 2.7 in the gas phase under nonoptimized
   conditions, which enhances the concentration of the feed mixture to 7.5
   mol \% propane. The separation performance was shown to improve to 3.8
   at lower temperatures (81 mol \% propane), which is attributed to
   differences in the activation energy of permeation of the two
   components. Propane/butane mixtures demonstrated a lower diffusive
   selectivity and almost negligible enhancement, while propylene/propane
   showed enhancement beyond ethane/propane due to a strong diffusive
   selectivity and sorption selectivities closer to unity. Single-component
   adsorption and diffusion results were incorporated into a computational
   model of the system and shown to be in relatively good agreement with
   the experimental values. The model was used to predict the separation
   system performance and recovery at various temperatures.}},

Title = {{Constraints on Ultrahigh-Energy Cosmic-Ray Sources from a Search for

Abstract = {{We report constraints on the sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays
   (UHECRs) above 10(9) GeV, based on an analysis of seven years of IceCube
   data. This analysis efficiently selects very high-energy
   neutrino-induced events which have deposited energies from 5 x 10(5) GeV
   to above 10(11) GeV. Two neutrino-induced events with an estimated
   deposited energy of (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(6) GeV, the highest neutrino
   energy observed so far, and (7.7 +/- 2.0) x 10(5) GeV were detected. The
   atmospheric background-only hypothesis of detecting these events is
   rejected at 3.6 sigma. The hypothesis that the observed events are of
   cosmogenic origin is also rejected at > 99\% CL because of the limited
   deposited energy and the nonobservation of events at higher energy,
   while their observation is consistent with an astrophysical origin. Our
   limits on cosmogenic neutrino fluxes disfavor the UHECR sources having a
   cosmological evolution stronger than the star formation rate, e.g.,
   active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts, assuming proton-dominated
   UHECRs. Constraints on UHECR sources including mixed and heavy UHECR
   compositions are obtained for models of neutrino production within UHECR
   sources. Our limit disfavors a significant part of parameter space for
   active galactic nuclei and new-born pulsar models. These limits on the
   ultrahigh-energy neutrino flux models are the most stringent to date.}},

Abstract = {{3-D MnO2 ion cages (CMO) were fabricated and shown to have a high
   capacity for lithium removal from wastewater. CMO had a maximum Li(I)
   adsorption capacity of 56.87 mg/g, which is 1.38 times greater than the
   highest reported value (41.36 mg/g). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   indicated that the stability of the Mn-O-Mn-O skeleton played an
   essential role in Li adsorption. The lattice clearance had a high charge
   density, forming a strong electrostatic field. The Dubinin-Ashtakhov
   (DA) site energy distribution model based on Polanyi theory described
   the linear increase of Li adsorption capacity (Q(0)) with increasing
   temperature (Q(0) = k(3) x E-m + d(3) = k(3) X (a X T) + d(3)).
   Furthermore, the pore diffusion model (PDM) accurately predicted the
   lithium breakthrough (R-2 approximate to 0.99). The maximum number of
   bed volumes (BVs) treated was 1374, 1972, and 2493 for 200 mu g/L at 20,
   30, and 40 degrees C, respectively. Higher temperatures increased the
   number of BVs that may be treated, which implies that CMO will be useful
   in treating industrial Li(I) wastewater in regions with different
   climates (e.g., Northern or Southern China).}},

Title = {{Mechanical characterization of Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy at multiple
   length scales using spherical indentation stress-strain measurements}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{463-472}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in spherical indentation stress-strain protocols and
   analyses have demonstrated the capability for measuring reliably the
   local mechanical responses in polycrystalline metal samples at different
   length scales, ranging from sub-micron (regions within individual
   grains) to several hundreds of microns (regions covering several
   grains). These recent advances have now made it possible to study
   systematically the mechanical behavior of a single material system at
   different length scales, with tremendous potential to obtain new
   insights into the role of individual phases, interfaces, and other
   microscale constituents on the macroscale mechanical response of the
   material. In this paper, we report spherical indentation stress-strain
   measurements with different indenter sizes (microns to millimeters) on
   Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-64) which capture the mechanical response of single phase
   alpha-Ti-64, single colony (alpha-beta), few colonies, and many colonies
   of Ti-64. The results show that the average mechanical response
   (indentation modulus and yield strength) from multiple indentations
   remains relatively unchanged from single phase alpha to many colonies of
   Ti-64, while the variance in the response decreases with indenter size.
   The work-hardening response in indentation tests follows a similar
   behavior up to indentation zones of many colonies, which shows
   significantly higher work hardening rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Examining the Validity of the Phonon Gas Model in Amorphous Materials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The idea of treating phonon transport as equivalent to transport through
   a gas of particles is termed the phonon gas model (PGM), and it has been
   used almost ubiquitously to try and understand heat conduction in all
   solids. However, most of the modes in disordered materials do not
   propagate and thus may contribute to heat conduction in a fundamentally
   different way than is described by the PGM. From a practical
   perspective, the problem with trying to apply the PGM to amorphous
   materials is the fact that one cannot rigorously define the phonon
   velocities for non-propagating modes, since there is no periodicity.
   Here, we tested the validity of the PGM for amorphous materials by
   assuming the PGM is applicable, and then, using a combination of lattice
   dynamics, molecular dynamics (MD) and experimental thermal conductivity
   data, we back-calculated the phonon velocities for the vibrational
   modes. The results of this approach show that if the PGM was valid, a
   large number of the mid and high frequency modes would have to have
   either imaginary or extremely high velocities to reproduce the
   experimental thermal conductivity data. Furthermore, the results of MD
   based relaxation time calculations suggest that in amorphous materials
   there is little, if any, connection between relaxation times and thermal
   conductivity. This then strongly suggests that the PGM is inapplicable
   to amorphous solids.}},

Title = {{Compressive Sensing with Optical Chaos}},
Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) is a technique to sample a sparse signal below
   the Nyquist-Shannon limit, yet still enabling its reconstruction. As
   such, CS permits an extremely parsimonious way to store and transmit
   large and important classes of signals and images that would be far more
   data intensive should they be sampled following the prescription of the
   Nyquist-Shannon theorem. CS has found applications as diverse as
   seismology and biomedical imaging. In this work, we use actual optical
   signals generated from temporal intensity chaos from external-cavity
   semiconductor lasers (ECSL) to construct the sensing matrix that is

Abstract = {{Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed
   atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements
   have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase
   chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for
   decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive
   laboratory measurements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid,
   ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD
   (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a
   comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation
   throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic
   organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction
   of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion
   concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in
   cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through
   nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Neuronal communication is a biological phenomenon of the central nervous
   system that influences the activity of all intra-body nano-networks. The
   implicit biocompatibility and dimensional similarity of neurons with
   miniature devices make their interaction a promising communication
   paradigm for nano-networks. To understand the information transfer in
   neuronal networks, there is a need to characterize the noise sources and
   unreliability associated with different components of the functional
   apposition between two cells-the synapse. In this paper, we introduce
   analogies between the optical communication system and the neuronal
   communication system to apply results from optical Poisson channels in
   deriving theoretical upper bounds on the information capacity of both
   the bipartite and tripartite synapses. The latter refer to the
   anatomical and functional integration of two communicating neurons and
   surrounding glia cells. The efficacy of information transfer is analyzed
   under different synaptic setups with progressive complexity, and is
   shown to depend on the peak rate of the communicated spiking sequence
   and neurotransmitter (spontaneous) release, neurotransmitter
   propagation, and neurotransmitter binding. The results provided serve as
   a progressive step in the evaluation of the performance of neuronal
   nano-networks and the development of new artificial nano-networks.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoframes are unique for their 3D, highly open architecture. When made
   of noble metals, they are attractive for use as heterogeneous catalysts
   because of their large specific surface areas, high densities of
   catalytically active sites and low vulnerability toward sintering. They
   promise to enhance the catalytic activity and durability while reducing
   the material loading and cost. For nanoframes composed of Au and/or Ag,
   they also exhibit highly tunable plasmonic properties similar to those
   of nanorods. This article presents a brief account of recent progress in
   the design, synthesis and utilization of noble-metal nanoframes. We
   start with a discussion of the synthetic strategies, including those
   involving site-selected deposition and etching, as well as dealloying of
   both hollow and solid nanocrystals. We then highlight some of the
   applications enabled by noble-metal nanoframes. Finally, we discuss the
   challenges and trends with regard to future development.}},

Abstract = {{Mutually coupled lines create challenges for legacy protection schemes.
   In this paper, a dynamic state estimation based protection (EBP) method
   is proposed to address these challenges. The method requires GPS
   synchronized measurements at both ends of the line and a high fidelity
   model of the protected line. The paper presents the dynamic model of the
   protected line and its impact on the performance of the protection
   scheme. Numerical simulations prove that the method can correctly
   identify faults, independent of position and type. The work also
   demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method versus legacy
   protection functions such as distance protection and line differential.
   These advantages include reliable and faster detection of internal low
   impedance faults, inter-circuit faults, and high impedance faults, even
   in cases of 1) partially coupled lines and 2) lack of measurements in
   adjacent lines.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{97-107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work investigated the effect of two extreme normalized stress
   gradients (eta = 17\% vs. 36\% mu m(-1)) on the fully-reversed bending
   fatigue behavior (fatigue life and fatigue crack propagation curves) of
   20-mu m-thick, electroplated Ni microbeams, in humid air environments.
   The results highlight the significant challenge in predicting the
   bending fatigue life of microbeams subjected to extreme stress
   gradients, which was measured to be three order of magnitudes larger for
   eta = 36\% mu m(-1) at a stress amplitude of similar to 450 MPa. The
   fatigue life is dominated by the ultraslow growth of microstructurally
   small cracks, which is a strong function of the normalized stress
   gradient. For eta= 17\% mu m(-1), the crack growth rates are initially
   about one order of magnitude larger than for. = 36\% mu m(-1) and, in
   contrast to the larger stress gradient microbeams, do not decrease with
   increasing crack size. This singular behavior results in low Basquin and
   Coffin-Manson exponents (in absolute value) compared to eta= 0. As a
   result, the fatigue endurance limit increases from 35\% to 50\% of the
   tensile strength for eta increasing from 17\% to 36\% mu m(-1), compared
   to 30\% in the absence of stress gradients. The environmental effects
   are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   materials by photopolymerization}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{108-118}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Photopolymerization is one of the most widely used methods for additive
   manufacturing and microfabrication of polymer structures. However, the
   mechanical properties of these materials, formed incrementally or
   layer-by-layer by photopolymerization, remain unclear. One critical
   issue is the strength of the interfaces between adjacent layers. During
   free radical photopolymerization, these interfaces are exposed to
   atmospheric oxygen, which is detrimental to the polymerization reaction
   due to radical inhibition. The influence of oxygen on the interfacial
   properties, however, is still not well understood. This paper
   investigates the effect of oxygen on the mechanical behavior of
   interfaces. In order to facilitate mechanical tests, the interfacial
   strength is investigated using a part-by-part method that mimics the
   conventional layer-by-layer photopolymerization process. The experiments
   found that oxygen enhances the interfacial strength by improving
   interfacial bridging macromolecular links. A theoretical model is
   developed to capture the interfacial evolution. Numerical studies
   further illustrate the role of several processing parameters such as
   curing condition and resin component. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Empowered by spectral aggregation and cell densification, future 5G
   mobile data networks pose a huge challenge to building next-generation
   mobile fronthaul systems with higher capacity, scalability, and energy
   efficiency. Under this circumstance, traditional solutions based on the
   Common Public Radio Interface or channel aggregation with digital signal
   processing (DSP) are not sufficient to support heterogeneous ubiquitous
   wireless access. In this paper, we demonstrate a point-to-multipoint
   bidirectional mobile fronthaul system. Wavelength division multiplexing
   plus frequency division multiplexing is applied to support independent
   asynchronous small cells. Intensity-modulation and direct-detection
   downlink (DL) as well as field-modulation and heterodyne-detection
   uplink (UL) are proposed. Combined with efficient virtual tone-based DSP
   for phase recovery and carrier-frequency-offset estimation, signal
   degradations from beating among incoherent asynchronous UL signals are
   mitigated. Proof-of-concept experiments are demonstrated where 20 and 16
   80-MHz component carriers are transmitted over 25-km standard
   single-mode fiber for DL and UL, respectively. Less than 6\% error
   vector magnitudes with 64-, 16-, and 4-ary quadrature amplitude

Abstract = {{High-capacity next-generation materials for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries
   often undergo significant volume changes (up to similar to 300\%) during
   reaction with Li or Na. These largevolume- change transformations cause
   mechanical fracture and pulverization of active battery materials, which
   can have detrimental effects on battery cycle life. Recent years have
   seen significant efforts dedicated to understanding the mechanics of
   such largevolume- change transformations in alloying anode materials.
   This review paper introduces recent work focused on various aspects of
   the mechanics of alloying anode materials, including in situ
   characterization of real-time reaction mechanisms and mechanical
   degradation processes, measurements of mechanical properties,
   measurements and simulations of spatiotemporal stress generation and
   evolution in active battery materials and structures, and studies on the
   interplay between chemistry and mechanics during reaction. In addition,
   mechanical effects across length scales within battery electrode
   structures are discussed. As demonstrated herein, the improved
   understanding of the mechanics of large-volume-change transformations
   has been essential for the rational design of durable high-capacity
   electrodes for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The increasing pace of urbanization means that cities and global
   organizations are looking for ways to increase energy efficiency and
   reduce emissions. Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems
   have the potential to improve the energy generation efficiency of a city
   or urban region by providing energy for heating, cooling, and
   electricity simultaneously. The purpose of this study is to estimate the
   water consumption for energy generation use, carbon dioxide (CO2) and
   NOx emissions, and economic impact of implementing CCHP systems for five
   generic building types within the Atlanta metropolitan region, under
   various operational scenarios following the building thermal (heating
   and cooling) demands. Operating the CCHP system to follow the hourly
   thermal demand reduces CO2 emissions for most building types both with
   and without net metering. The system can be economically beneficial for
   all building types depending on the price of natural gas, the
   implementation of net metering, and the cost structure assumed for the
   CCHP system. The greatest reduction in water consumption for energy
   production and NOx emissions occurs when there is net metering and when
   the system is operated to meet the maximum yearly thermal demand,
   although this scenario also results in an increase in greenhouse gas
   emissions and, in some cases, cost. CCHP systems are more economical for
   medium office, large office, and multifamily residential buildings. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents characterization of 300-GHz wireless channel on a
   computer motherboard, where several different measurement scenarios have
   been considered. Results indicate that the presence of the ground plane
   and/or vertical parallel-plate structures in the channel introduces
   multipath that, if constructively superimposed, may create a path loss
   lower than free-space propagation path loss. In addition, it has been
   found that a few centimeters of vertical misalignment between the
   transmitter and the receiver result in a path loss greater than 5 dB.
   Furthermore, the results indicate that vertical components such as dual
   in-line memory modules with reflection coefficient close to one for all
   incident angles can be used to create directed non-lineof- sight (LoS)
   links with wide coherence bandwidth. Finally, for LoS propagation
   obstructed by large objects, such as a heatsink, the path-loss exponent
   of 1.77 is found, while the rotating fan causes periodic fading in the
   received power, indicating that channel equalization techniques will be
   needed to overcome deep fades. All these results indicate that optimal
   communications can be achieved by carefully positioning the antennas
   with respect to the motherboard layout.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular motor networks (MMNs) are networks constructed from molecular
   motors to enable nanomachines to perform coordinated tasks of sensing,
   computing, and actuation at the nano-and micro-scales. Living cells are
   naturally enabled with this same mechanism to establish point-to-point
   communication between different locations inside the cell. Similar to a
   railway system, the cytoplasm contains an intricate infrastructure of
   tracks, named microtubules, interconnecting different internal
   components of the cell. Motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, are
   able to travel along these tracks directionally, carrying with them
   large molecules that would otherwise be unreliably transported across
   the cytoplasm using free diffusion. Molecular communication has been
   previously proposed for the design and study of MMNs. However, the
   topological aspects of MMNs, including the effects of branches, have
   been ignored in the existing studies. In this paper, a physical
   end-to-end model for MMNs is developed, considering the location of the
   transmitter node, the network topology, and the receiver nodes. The
   end-to-end gain and group delay are considered as the performance
   measures, and analytical expressions for them are derived. The
   analytical model is validated by Monte-Carlo simulations and the
   performance of MMNs is analyzed numerically. It is shown that, depending
   on their nature and position, MMN nodes create impedance effects that
   are critical for the overall performance. This model could be applied to
   assist the design of artificial MMNs and to study cargo transport in
   neurofilaments to elucidate brain diseases related to microtubule
   jamming.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular communication (MC) is a new paradigm for developing
   communication systems that exchanges information through the
   transmission and reception of molecules. One proposed model for MC is
   using bacteria to carry information encoded into DNA plasmids, and this
   is termed bacterial nanonetworks. However, a limiting factor in the
   models that have been studied so far is the environment considered only
   in ideal conditions with a single population. This is far from realistic
   in natural environments, where bacteria coexist in multiple populations
   of same and different species, resulting in a very complex social
   community. This complex community has social interactions that include
   cooperation, cheating, as well as competition. In this paper, the
   effects of these social interactions on the information delivery in
   bacterial nanonetworks are studied in terms of delay, attenuation and
   data rate. The numerical results show that the cooperative behavior of
   bacteria improves the performance of delay and attenuation leading to a
   higher data rate, and this performance can be degraded once their
   behavior switches towards cheating. The competitive social behavior
   shows that the performance can degrade delay as well as attenuation
   leading to slower data rates, as the population with the encoded DNA
   plasmids are prevented from reaching the receiver. The analysis of
   social interactions between the bacteria will pave the way for efficient
   design of bacterial nanonetworks enabling applications such as intrabody
   sensing, drug delivery, and environmental control against pollution and
   biological hazards.}},

   Based on Interfacial Thermal Resistance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The building envelope plays an important role for the contributions to
   the whole building thermal load, especially for residential houses
   without significant internal heat gain; hence, it is a critical
   component for influencing a building's thermal performance. However, the
   envelope R-value is usually acquired from the original design value,
   regardless of the thermal insulation degrading that has occurred during
   the whole long lifecycle. The main reason lies in that, with traditional
   methods, the in situ envelope R-value is extremely inconvenient to
   measure. In this study, a simple noninvasive approach was proposed to
   measure the envelope R-value using the interfacial thermal resistance
   from the thermal boundary layer between the envelope exterior surface
   and the ambient air, and the envelope surface temperature measured
   through the infrared thermal imaging. A field measurement procedure was
   developed and implemented for a typical detached residential house,
   along with a widely accepted method using film heat-flux sensors as a
   validation test. The final results show a good approximation between
   these two tests, which shows that the proposed method could extend the
   functions of thermography from only qualitative diagnosis to
   quantitative measurement on envelope thermal performance. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is enabling the development of miniature devices able to
   perform simple tasks at the nanoscale. The interconnection of such
   nano-devices with traditional wireless networks and ultimately the
   Internet enables a new networking paradigm known as the Internet of
   Nano-Things (IoNT). Despite their promising applications, nano-devices
   have constrained power, energy, and computation capabilities along with
   very limited memory on board, which may only be able to hold one packet
   at once and, thus, requires packets to be delivered before certain hard
   deadlines. Toward this goal, a fully-distributed computation-light
   provably-correct scheduling/MAC protocol is introduced for bufferless
   nano-devices, which can maximize the network throughput, while achieving
   perpetual operation. More specifically, the proposed scheduling
   algorithm allows every nano-device to make optimal transmission
   decisions locally based on its incoming traffic rate, virtual debts, and
   channel sensing results. It is proven that the proposed algorithm is
   timely throughput optimal in the sense that it can guarantee reliable
   data delivery before deadlines as long as the incoming traffic rates are
   within the derived maximum network capacity region. This feature not
   only can lead to high network throughput for the IoNT, but also
   guarantees that the memory of each device is empty before the next
   packet arrives, thus addressing the fundamental challenge imposed by the
   extremely limited memory of nano-devices. In addition, the optimal
   deadline is derived, which guarantees that all the nano-devices can
   achieve perpetual communications by jointly considering the energy
   consumption of communications over the terahertz channel and energy
   harvesting based on piezoelectric nano-generators.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of miniaturized electronic devices requires
   state-of-the-art small-form-factor energy storage units for power
   supply. Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), as microscale supercapacitors,
   have great potential to replace microbatteries or electrolytic
   capacitors due to their high power density and long cycling stability.
   The planar design of inter-digital microelectrodes not only shortens the
   ionic diffusion distance but also enables the direct integration of the
   device on-chip or on a flexible substrate for various applications.
   Graphene, with a unique 2-D nanostructure, has been extensively studied
   as a supercapacitor material with superior charge storage capability.
   Recently, the progress in thin-film fabrication technologies has
   facilitated the development of graphene-based MSCs, which results in
   device miniaturization and improved areal capacitance. This paper
   reviews the recent advances on the design of graphene-based MSCs and

Abstract = {{This paper describes ultrathin tantalum-based high-volumetric-density
   power capacitors with low leakage properties for 1-10-MHz frequency
   applications. Nanodielectrics with low-defect density were grown on
   nanoporous tantalum anodes using the self-limiting anodization process.
   The fundamental mechanisms that govern the film growth and quality were
   investigated to provide anodization process guidelines. Conducting
   polymer nanoparticles were used as the cathodes. Complete filling of
   conducting polymer was achieved by the optimization of conducting
   polymer application process. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and
   structural SEM studies were performed to investigate the morphology and
   structure of the tantalum pentoxide films. The fabricated capacitor
   showed 0.6-0.8 mu F/mm(2) of capacitance density in the 1-10-MHz range,
   in substrate-compatible ultrathin (<75 mu m) form factors. This is the
   highest volumetric density reported for such thin-film capacitors in a
   megahertz frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 3-D integrated disposable ``electronic
   microplate{''} (e-microplate) platform that allows the reuse of CMOS
   biosensor, thereby significantly reducing cost and increasing throughput
   compared to nondisposable biosensing systems. The e-microplate utilizes
   mechanically flexible interconnects and through-silicon-vias to
   electrically connect the cells cultured on the top (sensing electrode
   side) of the e-microplate to the electrodes on the CMOS biosensor while
   maintaining a physical separation between the aforementioned substrate
   tiers. Electrical measurements performed show that the incorporation of
   the e-microplate does not degrade the sensing amplifier's gain, 3-dB
   bandwidth, or the input referred noise; this ensures a high
   signal-to-noise ratio allowing accurate sensing of weak signals from
   living cells under test. Cell growth experiments performed show adhesion
   and growth of mouse embryonic stem cells on the surface of the sensing
   electrodes of the e-microplate. Impedance mapping for Dulbecco's
   phosphate buffered saline solution performed with the e-microplate, for
   two different e-microplate assemblies, confirms the functional accuracy
   of the assembled systems.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of activity trackers with and without incentives to
   increase physical activity (TRIPPA): a randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{LANCET DIABETES \& ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background Despite the increasing popularity of activity trackers,
   little evidence exists that they can improve health outcomes. We aimed
   to investigate whether use of activity trackers, alone or in combination
   with cash incentives or charitable donations, lead to increases in
   physical activity and improvements in health outcomes.
   Methods In this randomised controlled trial, employees from 13
   organisations in Singapore were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) with a
   computer generated assignment schedule to control (no tracker or
   incentives), Fitbit Zip activity tracker, tracker plus charity
   incentives, or tracker plus cash incentives. Participants had to be
   English speaking, full-time employees, aged 21-65 years, able to walk at
   least ten steps continuously, and non-pregnant. Incentives were tied to
   weekly steps, and the primary outcome, moderate-to-vigorous physical
   activity (MVPA) bout min per week, was measured via a sealed
   accelerometer and assessed on an intention-to-treat basis at 6 months
   (end of intervention) and 12 months (after a 6 month post-intervention
   follow-up period). Other outcome measures included steps, participants
   meeting 70 000 steps per week target, and health-related outcomes
   including weight, blood pressure, and quality-of-life measures. This
   trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,number NCT01855776.
   Findings Between June 13, 2013, and Aug 15, 2014, 800 participants were
   recruited and randomly assigned to the control (n=201), Fitbit (n=203),
   charity (n=199), and cash (n=197) groups. At 6 months, compared with
   control, the cash group logged an additional 29 MVPA bout min per week
   (95\% CI 10-47; p=0.0024) and the charity group an additional 21 MVPA
   bout min per week (2-39; p=0.0310); the difference between Fitbit only
   and control was not significant (16 MVPA bout min per week {[}-2 to 35;
   p=0.0854]). Increases in MVPA bout min per week in the cash and charity
   groups were not significantly greater than that of the Fitbit group. At
   12 months, the Fitbit group logged an additional 37 MVPA bout min per
   week (19-56; p=0.0001) and the charity group an additional 32 MVPA bout
   min per week (12-51; p=0.0013) compared with control; the difference
   between cash and control was not significant (15 MVPA bout min per week
   {[}-5 to 34; p=0.1363]). A decrease in physical activity of -23 MVPA
   bout min per week (95\% CI -42 to -4; p=0.0184) was seen when comparing
   the cash group with the Fitbit group. There were no improvements in any
   health outcomes (weight, blood pressure, etc) at either assessment.
   Interpretation The cash incentive was most effective at increasing MVPA
   bout min per week at 6 months, but this effect was not sustained 6
   months after the incentives were discontinued. At 12 months, the
   activity tracker with or without charity incentives were effective at
   stemming the reduction in MVPA bout min per week seen in the control
   group, but we identifi ed no evidence of improvements in health
   outcomes, either with or without incentives, calling into question the
   value of these devices for health promotion. Although other incentive
   strategies might generate greater increases in step activity and
   improvements in health outcomes, incentives would probably need to be in
   place long term to avoid any potential decrease in physical activity
   resulting from discontinuation.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), rapid reduction of
   circulating blasts with induction chemotherapy may serve as an in vivo
   marker of chemosensitivity. We performed a retrospective analysis of 363
   patients with untreated AML who received induction chemotherapy in order
   to determine the relationship between day of blast disappearance (DOBD)
   and complete remission (CR) rates, event-free survival (EFS), and
   overall survival (OS). DOBD <= 5 vs. > 5 was identified as the most
   discriminating cutoff for OS. DOBD>5 was observed in 35 patients
   (9.6\%). The CR rate for patients with DOBD <= 5 vs. > 5 was 74.0 and
   28.6\%, median EFS was 9.4 and 1.8 months, and median OS was 17.1 and
   5.8 months, respectively (P < 0.001 for all). DOBD>5 was independently
   associated with a lower CR rate and shorter EFS and OS (P < 0.001 for
   all). DOBD> 5 retained prognostic significance for EFS and OS when
   patients were stratified by cytogenetic risk group, de novo vs.
   secondary or therapy-related AML, European LeukemiaNet-based risk
   groups, and whether CR was achieved. We propose DOBD> 5 as a simple and
   early marker of disease resistance that identifies patients with poor
   prognosis who otherwise may not be identified with existing risk
   stratification systems. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This work seeks to leverage semantic networks containing millions of
   entries encoding assertions of common-sense knowledge to enable
   improvements in robot task execution and learning. The specific
   application we explore in this project is object substitution in the
   context of task adaptation. Humans easily adapt their plans to
   compensate for missing items in day-to-day tasks, substituting a wrap
   for bread when making a sandwich, or stirring pasta with a fork when out
   of spoons. Robot plan execution, however, is far less robust, with
   missing objects typically leading to failure if the robot is not aware
   of alternatives. In this article, we contribute a context-aware
   algorithm that leverages the linguistic information embedded in the task
   description to identify candidate substitution objects without reliance
   on explicit object affordance information. Specifically, we show that
   the task context provided by the task labels within the action structure
   of a task plan can be leveraged to disambiguate information within a
   noisy large-scale semantic network containing hundreds of potential
   object candidates to identify successful object substitutions with high
   accuracy. We present two extensive evaluations of our work on both
   abstract and real-world robot tasks, showing that the substitutions made
   by our system are valid, accepted by users, and lead to a statistically
   significant reduction in robot learning time. In addition, we report the
   outcomes of testing our approach with a large number of crowd workers
   interacting with a robot in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Studies assessing the effects of anthropogenic inputs on the taxonomic
   and functional diversity of bacterioplankton communities in lotic
   ecosystems are limited. Here, we applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon and
   whole-genome shotgun sequencing to examine the microbial diversity in
   samples from the Kalamas River (Northwest Greece), a mid-size river that
   runs through agricultural and NATURA-protected areas, but also receives
   urban sewage from a large city through a manmade ditch. Samples from
   three different locations between the exit of the ditch and the estuary,
   during three different months showed that temporal differences of
   taxonomic and functional diversity were more pronounced than spatial
   ones, and <1\% of total taxa were shared among all samples, revealing a
   highly dynamic ecosystem. Comparisons of gene diversity with other
   aquatic habitats showed that only the high flow winter samples resembled
   more to freshwater environments while samples during the decreased water
   flow months were dominated by sewage inputs and soil-related organisms.
   Notably, microbial human gut signals were detectable over background
   freshwater and soil/runoff related signals, even at tens of kilometers

Abstract = {{The worldwide use of the phenylurea herbicide, isoproturon (IPU), has
   resulted in considerable concern about its environmental fate. Although
   many microbial metabolites of IPU are known and IPU-mineralizing
   bacteria have been isolated, the molecular mechanism of IPU catabolism
   has not been elucidated yet. In this study, complete genes that encode
   the conserved IPU catabolic pathway were revealed, based on comparative
   analysis of the genomes of three IPU-mineralizing sphingomonads and
   subsequent experimental validation. The complete genes included a novel
   hydrolase gene ddhA, which is responsible for the cleavage of the urea
   side chain of the IPU demethylated products; a distinct aniline
   dioxygenase gene cluster adoQTA1A2BR, which has a broad substrate range;
   and an inducible catechol meta-cleavage pathway gene cluster
   adoXEGKLIJC. Furthermore, the initial mono-N-demethylation genes pdmAB
   were further confirmed to be involved in the successive N-demethylation
   of the IPU mono-N-demethylated product. These IPU-catabolic genes were
   organized into four transcription units and distributed on three
   plasmids. They were flanked by multiple mobile genetic elements and
   highly conserved among IPUmineralizing sphingomonads. The elucidation of
   the molecular mechanism of IPU catabolism will enhance our understanding
   of the microbial mineralization of IPU and provide insights into the
   evolutionary scenario of the conserved IPU-catabolic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate spectrum-power trading between a small
   cell (SC) and a macro cell (MC), where the SC consumes power to serve
   the MC users (MUs) in exchange for some bandwidth from the MC. Our goal
   is to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) of the SC while
   guaranteeing the quality of service of each MU as well as SC users
   (SUs). Specifically, given the minimum data rate requirement and the
   bandwidth provided by the MC, the SC jointly optimizes MU selection,
   bandwidth allocation, and power allocation while guaranteeing its own
   minimum required system data rate. The problem is challenging due to the
   binary MU selection variables and the fractional-form objective
   function. We first show that the bandwidth of an MU is shared with at
   most one SU in the SC. Then, for a given MU selection, the optimal
   bandwidth and power allocation are obtained by exploiting the fractional
   programming. To perform MU selection, we first introduce the concept of
   the trading EE to characterize the data rate obtained as well as the
   power consumed for serving an MU. We then reveal a sufficient and
   necessary condition for serving an MU without considering the total
   power constraint and the minimum data rate constraint: the trading EE of
   the MU should be higher than the system EE of the SC. Based on this
   insight, we propose a low complexity MU selection method and also
   investigate the optimality condition. Simulation results verify our
   theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource
   allocation achieves near-optimal performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we demonstrate a new design for integrated phononic
   crystal (PnC) resonators based on confining acoustic waves in a
   heterogeneous waveguide-based PnC structure. In this architecture, a PnC
   waveguide that supports a single mode at the desired resonance
   frequencies is terminated by two waveguide sections with no propagating
   mode at those frequencies (i.e., have mode gap). The proposed PnC
   resonators are designed through combining the spatial-domain and the
   spatial-frequency domain (i.e., the k-domain) analysis to achieve a
   smooth mode envelope. This design approach can benefit both
   membrane-based and surface-acoustic-wave-based architectures by
   confining the mode spreading in k-domain that leads to improved
   electromechanical excitation/detection coupling and reduced loss through
   propagating bulk modes. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content, except

Abstract = {{In this paper, a two-dimensional (2-D) Finite Element (FE) analysis of a
   geothermal well was performed with respect to five different
   cross-sections corresponding to the design specifications for the
   geothermal well that is currently constructed in Pohang, South Korea.
   Among the essential components (such as ground formation, casing, and
   cementing) of a geothermal well, the thermal and mechanical stability of
   the cementing component was discussed based on a series of parametric
   studies with consideration of the thermal conductivity and Young's
   modulus of the cementing component. With increasing number of casing
   layers, the cementing component experiences less stress concentration.
   In addition, the lower thermal conductivity of the cementing material is
   advantageous for effectively controlling radial displacement.
   Consequently, it should be noted in geothermal well cementing
   construction that long-term strength degradation of the cementing might
   cause the severe structural instability of an entire geothermal well.}},

Abstract = {{To advance commercial application of forward osmosis (FO), we
   investigated the effects of two additives on the performance of
   polysulfone (PSf) based FO membranes: one is poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG), and another is PSf grafted with PEG methyl ether methacrylate
   (PSf-g-PEGMA). PSf blended with PEG or PSf-g-PEGMA was used to form a
   substrate layer, and then polyamide was formed on a support layer by
   interfacial polymerization. In this study, NaCl (1 mol.L-1) and
   deionized water were used as the draw solution and the feed solution,
   respectively. With the increase of PEG content from 0 to 15 wt-\%, FO
   water flux declined by 23.4\% to 59.3\% compared to a PSf TFC FO
   membrane. With the increase of PSf-g-PEGMA from 0 to 15 wt-\%, the
   membrane flux showed almost no change at first and then declined by
   about 52.0\% and 50.4\%. The PSf with 5 wt-\% PSf-g-PEGMA FO membrane
   showed a higher pure water flux of 8.74 L.m(-2).h(-1) than the
   commercial HTI membranes (6-8 L.m(-2).h(-1)) under the FO mode. Our
   study suggests that hydrophobic interface is very important for the
   formation of polyamide, and a small amount of PSfg-PEGMA can maintain a
   good condition for the formation of polyamide and reduce internal
   concentration polarization.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary aerosols formed from anthropogenic pollutants and natural
   emissions have substantial impacts on human health, air quality, and the
   Earth's climate. New particle formation (NPF) contributes up to 70\% of
   the global production of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), but the
   effects of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and their
   oxidation products on NPF processes in forests are poorly understood.
   Observations show that isoprene, the most abundant BVOC, suppresses NPF
   in forests. But the previously proposed chemical mechanism underlying
   this suppression process contradicts atmospheric observations. By
   reviewing observations made in other forests, it is clear that NPF
   rarely takes place during the summer when emissions of isoprene are
   high, even though there are sufficient concentrations of monoterpenes.
   But at present it is not clear how isoprene and its oxidation products
   may change the oxidation chemistry of terpenes and how NOx and other
   atmospheric key species affect NPF in forest environments. Future
   laboratory experiments with chemical speciation of gas phase nucleation
   precursors and clusters and chemical composition of particles smaller
   than 10 nm are required to understand the role of isoprene in NPF. Our
   results show that climate models can overpredict aerosol's first
   indirect effect when not considering the absence of NPF in the
   southeastern U.S. forests during the summer using the current nucleation
   algorithm that includes only sulfuric acid and total concentrations of
   low-volatility organic compounds. This highlights the importance of
   understanding NPF processes as function of temperature, relative
   humidity, and BVOC compositions to make valid predictions of NPF and CCN
   at a wide range of atmospheric conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Multicore processors have become an integral part of modern large-scale
   and high-performance parallel and distributed computing systems.
   Unfortunately, applications co-located on multicore processors can
   suffer from decreased performance and increased dynamic energy use as a
   result of interference in shared resources, such as memory. As this
   interference is difficult to characterize, assumptions about application
   execution time and energy usage can be misleading in the presence of
   co-location. Consequently, it is important to accurately characterize
   the performance and energy usage of applications that execute in a
   co-located manner on these architectures. This work investigates some of
   the disadvantages of co-location, and presents a methodology for
   building models capable of utilizing varying amounts of information
   about a target application and its co-located applications to make
   predictions about the target application's execution time and the
   system's energy use under arbitrary co-locations of a wide range of
   application types. The proposed methodology is validated on three
   different server class Intel Xeon multicore processors using eleven
   applications from two scientific benchmark suites. The model's utility
   for scheduling is also demonstrated in a simulated large-scale
   high-performance computing environment through the creation of a
   co-location aware scheduling heuristic. This heuristic demonstrates that
   scheduling using information generated with the proposed modeling
   methodology is capable of making significant improvements over a
   scheduling heuristic that is oblivious to co-location interference.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the quantification, practice, and implications
   of structural data de-anonymization, including social data, mobility
   traces, and so on. First, we answer several open questions in structural
   data de-anonymization by quantifying perfect and (1-epsilon)-perfect
   structural data de-anonymization, where epsilon is the error tolerated
   by a de-anonymization scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first work on quantifying structural data de-anonymization under a
   general data model, which closes the gap between the structural data
   de-anonymization practice and theory. Second, we conduct the first
   large-scale study on the de-anonymizability of 26 real world structural
   data sets, including social networks, collaborations networks,
   communication networks, autonomous systems, peer-to-peer networks, and
   so on. We also quantitatively show the perfect and (1 - epsilon)-perfect
   de-anonymization conditions of the 26 data sets. Third, following our
   quantification, we present a practical attack {[}a novel single-phase
   cold start optimization-based de-anonymization (ODA) algorithm]. An
   experimental analysis of ODA shows that similar to 77.7\%-83.3\% of the
   users in Gowalla (196 591 users and 950 327 edges) and 86.9\%-95.5\% of
   the users in Google+ (4 692 671 users and 90 751 480 edges) are
   de-anonymizable in different scenarios, which implies that the
   structure-based de-anonymization is powerful in practice. Finally, we
   discuss the implications of our de-anonymization quantification and our
   ODA attack and provide some general suggestions for future secure data

Abstract = {{Vibrational energy harvesting using piezoelectric cantilever beams has
   received significant attention over the past decade. When compared to
   piezoelectric cantilever-based harvesters, piezopatch energy harvesters
   integrated on plate-like thin structures can be a more efficient and
   compact option to supply electrical power for wireless structural health
   and condition monitoring systems. In this article, electroelastic
   modeling, analytical and numerical solutions, and experimental
   validations of piezopatch-based energy harvesting from stationary random
   vibrations of thin plates are presented. Electroelastic models for the
   series and parallel connected multiple piezopatches are given based on a
   distributed-parameter modeling approach for a thin host plate excited by
   a transverse point force. The analytical and numerical solutions for the
   mean power output and the mean-square shunted vibration response are
   then derived. The experimental measurements are carried out by employing
   a fully clamped thin plate with three piezopatches connected in series.
   It is shown that the analytical and numerical model predictions for the
   mean power output and the mean-square velocity response are in very good
   agreement with the experimental measurements. The electroelastic
   modeling framework and solution methods presented in this work can be
   used for design, performance analysis, and optimization of piezoelectric
   energy harvesting from stationary random vibration of thin plates.}},

Abstract = {{Deep-seated large-scale toppling failure presents unique challenges in
   the study of natural slope deformation process in mountainous regions.
   An active deep-seated toppling process was identified in the Erguxi
   slope located in southwest China, which affected a large area and
   damaged critical transportation infrastructure with the volume of the
   deforming rock mass exceeding 24x10(6) m(3). It poses significant risks
   to the downstream Shiziping Hydropower Station by damming the Zagunao
   River. Field investigation and monitoring results indicate that the
   deformation of the Erguxi slope is in the advanced stage of deep-seated
   toppling process, with the formation of a disturbed belt but no
   identifiable master failure surface. It was postulated that the
   alternating tensile and shear strength associated with the hard/soft
   laminated rock strata of metasandstone and phyllite layers preclude the
   development of either a tensile or shear failure surface, which resulted
   in the continuous deformation and displacement without a catastrophic
   mass movement. The slope movement is in close association with the
   unfavorable geological conditions of the study area in addition to the
   construction of transportation infrastructure and the increase of the
   reservoir level. On the basis of the mechanism and intensity of the
   ongoing toppling deformation, a qualitative grading system was proposed
   to describe the toppling process and to evaluate the slope stability.
   This paper summarized the field observation and monitoring data on the
   toppling deformation for better characterizing its effect on the
   stability of the Erguxi slope. The qualitative grading system intends to
   provide a basis for quantitative study of large-scale deep-seated
   toppling process in metamorphic rocks.}},

Abstract = {{The Evolved Packet System-based Authentication and Key Agreement
   (EPS-AKA) protocol of the long-term evolution (LTE) network does not
   support Internet of Things (IoT) objects and has several security
   limitations, including transmission of the object's (user/device)
   identity and key set identifier in plaintext over the network,
   synchronization, large overhead, limited identity privacy, and security
   attack vulnerabilities. In this article, we propose a new secure and
   efficient AKA protocol for the LTE network that supports secure and
   efficient communications among various IoT devices as well as among the
   users. Analysis shows that our protocol is secure, efficient, and
   privacy preserved, and reduces bandwidth consumption during
   authentication.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale tactile sensor arrays are of great importance in flexible
   electronics, human robot interaction, and medical monitoring. In this
   paper, a flexible 10 X 10 tribotronic transistor array (TTA) is
   developed as an active tactile sensing system by incorporating
   field-effect transistor units and triboelectric nanogenerators into a
   polyimide substrate. The drain source current of each tribotronic
   transistor can be individually modulated by the corresponding external
   contact, which has induced a local electrostatic potential to act as the
   conventional gate voltage. By scaling down the pixel size from 5 X 5 to
   0.5 x 0.5 mm(2), the sensitivities of single pixels are systematically
   investigated. The pixels of the TTA show excellent durability,
   independence, and synchronicity, which are suitable for applications in
   real-time tactile sensing, motion monitoring, and spatial mapping. The
   integrated tribotronics provides an unconventional route to realize an
   active tactile sensing system, with prospective applications in wearable
   electronics, human-machine interfaces, fingerprint identification, and
   so on.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered a promising alternative
   to lithium ion batteries for large-scale energy storage. However, their
   inferior electrochemical performances, especially cyclability, become
   the major challenge for further development of SIBs. Large volume change
   and sluggish diffusion kinetics are generally considered to be
   responsible for the fast capacity degradation. Here we report the strong
   chemical bonding of nanostructured Sb2S3 on sulfur-doped graphene sheets
   (Sb2S3/SGS) that enables a stable capacity retention of 83\% for 900
   cycles with high capacities and excellent rate performances. To the best
   of our knowledge, the cycling performance of the Sb2S3/SGS composite is
   superior to those reported for any other Sb-based materials for SIBs.
   Computational calculations demonstrate that sulfur-doped graphene (SGS)
   has a stronger affinity for Sb2S3 and the discharge products than pure
   graphene, resulting in a robust composite architecture for outstanding
   cycling stability. Our study shows a feasible and effective way to solve
   the long-term cycling stability issue for SIBs.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development of a piezopotential-programmed nonvolatile
   memory array using a combination of ion gel-gated field-effect
   transistors (FETs) and piezoelectric nanogenerators (NGs).
   Piezopotentials produced from the NGs under external strains were able
   to replace the gate voltage inputs associated with the
   programming/erasing operation of the memory, which reduced the power
   consumption compared with conventional memory devices. Multilevel data
   storage in the memory device could be achieved by varying the external
   bending strain applied to the piezoelectric NGs. The resulting devices
   exhibited good memory performance, including a large programming/erasing
   current ratio that exceeded 103, multilevel data storage of 2 bits (over
   4 levels), performance stability over 100 cycles, and stable data
   retention over 3000 s. The piezopotential-programmed multilevel
   nonvolatile memory device described here is important for applications
   in data-storable electronic skin and advanced human-robot interface

Abstract = {{Ocean energy, in theory, is an enormous clean and renewable energy
   resource that can generate electric power much more than that required
   to power the entire globe without adding any pollution to the
   atmosphere. However, owing to a lack of effective technology, such blue
   energy is almost unexplored to meet the energy requirement of human
   society. In this work, a fully packaged hybrid nanogenerator consisting
   of a rolling triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG) and an electromagnetic
   generator (EMG) is developed to harvest water motion energy. The
   outstanding output performance of the R-TENG (45 cm(3) in volume and
   28.3 g in weight) in the low-frequency range (<1.8 Hz) complements the
   ineffective output of EMG (337 cm(3) in volume and 311.8 g in weight) in
   the same range and thus enables the hybrid nanogenerator to deliver
   valuable outputs in a broad range of operation frequencies. Therefore,
   the hybrid nanogenerator can maximize the energy conversion efficiency
   and broaden the operating frequency simultaneously. In terms of charging
   capacitors, this hybrid nanogenerator provides not only high voltage and
   consistent charging from the TENG component but also fast charging speed
   from the EMG component. The practical application of the hybrid
   nanogenerator is also demonstrated to power light-emitting diodes by
   harvesting energy from stimulated tidal flow. The high robustness of the
   R-TENG is also validated based on the stable electrical output after
   continuous rolling motion. Therefore, the hybrid R-TENG and EMG device
   renders an effective and sustainable approach toward large-scale blue
   energy harvesting in a broad frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{With a promising prospect of light-emitting diodes as an attractive
   alternative to conventional light sources, remaining challenges still
   cannot be addressed owing to their limited efficiency. Among the
   continued scientific efforts, significant improvement on the emission
   efficiency has been achieved via either piezo-phototronic effect-based
   strain modulation or resonant excitation of plasmons in metallic
   nanostructures. Here, we present the investigation on the coupling
   process between piezo-phototronic effect and localized surface plasmonic
   resonance for enhancing the photoluminescence of InGaN/GaN quantum wells
   coated with Ag nanoparticles. The underlying physical mechanism of
   experimental results originates from tuning plasmonic resonance
   controlled by the shift of emission wavelength via piezo-phototronic
   effect, and it is further confirmed with the support of theoretical
   calculations. As a result, our research provides an approach to the
   integration of plasmonics with piezo-phototronic effect and brings
   widespread applications to high-efficiency artificial lighting, on-chip
   integrated plasmonic circuits, subwavelength optical communication, and
   micro-optoelectronic mechanical systems.}},

Abstract = {{Modern cryptography increasingly employs random numbers generated from
   physical sources in lieu of conventional software-based pseudorandom
   numbers, primarily owing to the great demand of unpredictable,
   indecipherable cryptographic keys from true random numbers for
   information security. Thus, far, the sole demonstration of true random
   numbers has been generated through thermal noise and/or quantum effects,
   which suffers from expensive and complex equipment. In this paper, we
   demonstrate a method for self-powered creation of true random numbers by
   using triboelectric technology to collect random signals from nature.
   This random number generator based on coupled triboelectric and
   electrostatic induction effects at the liquid dielectric interface
   includes an elaborately designed triboelectric generator (TENG) with an
   irregular grating structure, an electronic optical device, and an
   optical electronic device. The random characteristics of raindrops are
   harvested through TENG and consequently transformed and converted by
   electronic optical device and an optical electronic device with a
   nonlinear characteristic. The cooperation of the mechanical, electrical,
   and optical signals ensures that the generator possesses complex
   nonlinear input output behavior and contributes to increased randomness.
   The random number sequences are deduced from final electrical signals
   received by an optical electronic device using a familiar algorithm.
   These obtained random number sequences exhibit good statistical
   characteristics, unpredictability, and unrepeatability. Our study
   supplies a simple, practical, and effective method to generate true
   random numbers, which can be widely used in cryptographic protocols,
   digital signatures, authentication, identification, and other
   information security fields.}},

Abstract = {{The growing reliance on intellectual properties exposes systems on chip
   (SoCs) to many security vulnerabilities and is raising more and more
   concerns. At the same time, with the quick increase in chip density and
   deep scaling of feature size, current billion-transistor chip designs
   introduce more challenges to manufacturing fault-free chips. In this
   paper, we propose an integrated run-time solution for both security and
   fault tolerance of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)-based SoCs
   through digital signatures, live monitoring, adaptive routing, and
   partial reconfiguration supported by an in-house-developed network on
   chip, X-Network. Our X-Network reduces the ratio of required routers
   versus processing elements with better performance, and more
   importantly, offers more flexibility than conventional networks to
   facilitate fault tolerance and security designs. A multi-plexed
   Montgomery modular multiplication architecture is used to increase the
   speed of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm. The design has been
   implemented and tested on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA development board.
   Experimental results show that even if up to 20\% of the links in the
   network are faulty, our reconfigurable architecture and algorithm manage
   to route packets around such faults, and deliver them to their
   destinations in a relatively low latency. Unlike conventional
   fault-tolerant methods that usually require resource redundancy, our
   design does not incur significant area or speed degradation. The
   resource overhead for both security and fault-tolerant features is
   around 10\% more lookup tables.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a generalization of Lamb's problem to a linear
   elastic, infinite half-space with random fields (RFs) of mass density,
   subject to a normal line load. Both, uncorrelated and correlated (with
   fractal and Hurst characteristics) RFs without any weak noise
   restrictions, are proposed. Cellular automata (CA) is used to simulate
   the wave propagation. CA is a local computational method which, for
   rectangular discretization of spatial domain, is equivalent to applying
   the finite difference method to the governing equations of classical
   elasticity. We first evaluate the response of CA to an uncorrelated mass
   density field, more commonly known as white-noise, of varying coarseness
   as compared to CA's node density. We then evaluate the response of CA to
   multiscale mass density RFs of Cauchy and Dagum type; these fields are
   unique in that they are able to model and decouple the field's fractal
   dimension and Hurst parameter. We focus on stochastic imperfection
   sensitivity; we determine to what extent the fractal or the Hurst
   parameter is a significant factor in altering the solution to the planar
   stochastic Lamb's problem by evaluating the coefficient of variation of
   the response when compared with the coefficient of variation of the RF.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic Ericksen problem consists of finding deformations in
   isotropic hyperelastic solids that can be maintained for arbitrary
   strain-energy density functions. In the compressible case, Ericksen
   showed that only homogeneous deformations are possible. Here, we solve
   the anelastic version of the same problem, that is, we determine both
   the deformations and the eigenstrains such that a solution to the
   anelastic problem exists for arbitrary strain-energy density functions.
   Anelasticity is described by finite eigenstrains. In a nonlinear solid,
   these eigenstrains can be modelled by a Riemannian material manifold
   whose metric depends on their distribution. In this framework, we show
   that the natural generalization of the concept of homogeneous
   deformations is the notion of covariantly homogeneous
   deformations-deformations with covariantly constant deformation
   gradients. We prove that these deformations are the only universal
   deformations and that they put severe restrictions on possible universal
   eigenstrains. We show that, in a simply-connected body, for any
   distribution of universal eigenstrains the material manifold is a
   symmetric Riemannian manifold and that in dimensions 2 and 3 the
   universal eigenstrains are zero-stress.}},

Abstract = {{DNA-functionalized colloidal particles have wide-spanning applicability
   from biotechnology to nanotechnology. Within the colloids community,
   there is a rich experimental and theoretical history addressing
   nonspecific colloidal interactions such as van der Waals,
   electrostatics, sterics, and depletion on resulting suspension phases
   and behavior. Thus, the addition of DNA as a macromolecular tool to
   program, tune, and even thermally reverse specific colloidal
   interactions has generated excitement and increasing research momentum
   for the last twenty years. Since several review articles highlighting
   reports of DNA-mediated colloidal aggregation and assembly are already
   available, this perspective focuses on the following four emerging areas
   in DNA-functionalized colloidal suspensions: (1) the exchange of
   oligonucleotide hybridization partners as an alternative as well as
   supplemental strategy to thermal melting of duplex bridges; (2)
   fluid-like membranes that allow for lateral mobility of DNA tethers as
   well as large adhesive contact zones; (3) the need to extend modeling
   efforts to include longrange electrosterics and 3D structural
   complexity; and (4) opportunities and challenges involving
   oligonucleotide-based ligands that bind to non-nucleotide targets. (C)

Abstract = {{Low-impact development (LID) technologies, such as bioretention areas,
   rooftop rainwater harvesting, and xeriscaping can control stormwater
   runoff, supply non-potable water, and landscape open space. This study
   examines a hybrid system (HS) that combines LID technologies with a
   centralized water system to lessen the burden on a conventional system
   (CS). CS is defined as the stormwater collection and water supply
   infrastructure, and the conventional landscaping choices in the City of
   Atlanta. The study scope is limited to five single-family residential
   zones (SFZs), classified R-1 through R-5, and four multi-family
   residential zones (MFZs), classified RG-2 through RG-5. Population
   density increases from 0.4 (R-1) to 62.2 (RG-5) persons per 1,000 m(2).
   We performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparison of CS and HS using
   TRACI 2.1 to simulate impacts on the ecosystem, human health, and
   natural resources. We quantified the impact of freshwater consumption
   using the freshwater ecosystem impact (FEI) indicator. Test results
   indicate that HS has a higher LCA single score than CS in zones with a
   low population density; however, the difference becomes negligible as
   population density increases. Incorporating LID in SFZs and MFZs can
   reduce potable water use by an average of 50\% and 25\%, respectively;
   however, water savings are negligible in zones with high population
   density (i.e., RG-5) due to the diminished surface area per capita
   available for LID technologies. The results demonstrate that LID
   technologies effectively reduce outdoor water demand and therefore would
   be a good choice to decrease the water consumption impact in the City of
   Atlanta. (C) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive approach for the design of planar
   structural steel members and framing systems using a direct
   computational buckling analysis configured with appropriate column, beam
   and beam-column inelastic stiffness reduction factors. The stiffness
   reduction factors are derived from the ANSI/AISC 360-16 Specification
   column, beam and beam-column strength provisions. The resulting
   procedure provides a rigorous check of all member in-plane and
   out-of-plane design resistances accounting for continuity effects across
   braced points as well as lateral and/or rotational restraint from other
   framing. The method allows for the consideration of any type and
   configuration of stability bracing. With this approach, no member
   effective length (K) or moment gradient and/or load height (C-b) factors
   are required. The buckling analysis rigorously captures the stability
   behavior commonly approximated by these factors. A pre-buckling analysis
   is conducted using the AISC Direct Analysis Method (the DM) to account
   for second-order effects on the in-plane internal forces. The buckling
   analysis is combined with cross-section strength checks based on the
   AISC Specification resistance equations to fully capture all the member
   strength limit states. This approach provides a particularly powerful
   mechanism for the design of frames utilizing general stepped and/or
   tapered I-section members.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a recently proposed variational principle with rigid-body

   we demonstrate that, as compared to the commonly adopted approach of
   discretizing the rigid domains with standard finite elements, the
   proposed formulation requires neither discretization nor numerical
   integration in the interior of each rigid domain. As a comparative
   result, the variational formulation may reduce the total number of

Abstract = {{The definition of a traction-separation relationship is essential in
   cohesive zone models because it describes the nonlinear fracture process
   zone. A few models are investigated in this paper and a comparative
   study is conducted. Among various traction-separation relationships, the
   one in Abaqus is assessed by evaluating the cohesive traction and its
   tangent stiffness according to a given separation path. The results
   demonstrate that the traction-separation relationship in Abaqus can lead
   to non-physical responses because of a pathological positive tangent
   stiffness under softening condition. This is reflected in cohesive
   tractions that increase and decrease repeatedly while the cohesive
   separation monotonically increases. Thus, together with supporting
   information, this paper conveys the message that a traction-separation
   relationship should be developed and selected with great caution,
   especially under mixed-mode conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Although the Park-Paulino-Roesler (PPR) potential-based cohesive zone
   fracture model was not derived based on a thermodynamics consistency
   principle, we investigate the thermodynamic consistency of the PPR model
   under conditions of loading, unloading and reloading. First, we present
   a general anisotropic Helmholtz free energy function. Then, we
   reformulate the PPR model into the anisotropic Helmholtz form, and
   investigate its consistency and the various unloading/reloading
   relations which have been proposed for use with the model. By recasting
   the PPR model into the Helmholtz form, we illustrate that the PPR
   cohesive potential, while not designed with thermodynamic consistency in
   mind, is thermodynamically consistent under the pure loading conditions
   for which it was designed (as expected). We also demonstrate that the
   unloading/reloading relations, which are commonly used with the PPR
   model, are not thermodynamically consistent; however, through our
   investigation, we develop a new coupled unloading/reloading relation,
   which maintains the thermodynamic consistency of the PPR cohesive model.
   The considerations addressed in this paper are aimed at achieving a
   better understanding of the PPR model and other models of similar

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research is motivated from the analysis of a real gene expression
   data that aims to identify a subset of ``interesting{''} or
   ``significant{''} genes for further studies. When we blindly applied the
   standard false discovery rate (FDR) methods, our biology collaborators
   were suspicious or confused, as the selected list of significant genes
   was highly unbalanced: there were ten times more under expressed genes
   than the over-expressed genes. Their concerns led us to realize that the
   observed two-sample t-statistics were highly skewed and asymmetric, and
   thus the standard FDR methods might be inappropriate. To tackle this
   case, we propose a symmetric directional FDR control method that
   categorizes the genes into ``over-expressed{''} and
   ``under-expressed{''} genes, pairs ``over-expressed{''} and
   ``under-expressed{''} genes, defines the p-values for gene pairs via
   column permutations, and then applies the standard FDR method to select
   ``significant{''} gene pairs instead of ``significant{''} individual
   genes. We compare our proposed symmetric directional FDR method with the
   standard FDR method by applying them to simulated data and several
   well-known real data sets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite many safety considerations addressed in lift pre-planning, the
   ability to provide real-time safety assistance to crane operators and to
   mitigate human errors during the lifting operation is missing. This
   research developed a framework for real-time pro-active safety
   assistance for mobile crane lifting operations. First, crane poses are
   reconstructed in real-time based on the critical motions of crane parts
   captured by a sensor system. Second, as-is lift site conditions are
   automatically modeled and updated based on point cloud data. Lastly, the
   risk of colliding the crane parts and lifted load into nearby
   obstructions is pro-actively analyzed and warnings are provided to the
   operator through a graphical user interface. A prototype system was
   developed based on the framework and deployed on a mobile crane. Field
   test results indicate that the system can accurately reconstruct crane
   motion in real-time and provide pro-active warnings that allow the
   operator to make timely decisions to mitigate the risk. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We report a facile method for the synthesis of Pt-Pd nanocages and Pt
   nanorings by conformally coating Pd nanoplates with Pt-based shells
   using polyol- and water-based protocols, respectively, followed by
   selective removal of the Pd cores. For the polyol-based system, Pd
   nanoplates were conformally coated with Pt-Pd alloy shells due to the
   use of a high reaction temperature of 200 degrees C and a slow injection
   rate for the Pt precursor. In comparison, Pt shells were formed on Pd
   nanoplates with a larger thickness on the side face than on the
   top/bottom face in the water-based system due to the use of a low
   reaction temperature of 80 degrees C and the presence of twin boundaries
   on the side face. As such, the Pd@Pt nanoplates prepared using the
   polyol- and water-based protocols evolved into Pt-Pd nanocages and Pt
   nanorings, respectively, when the Pd templates in the cores were
   selectively removed by wet etching. The wall thickness of the nanocages
   and the ridge thickness of the nanorings could be reduced down to 1.1nm
   and 1.8nm, respectively, without breaking the hollow structures.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{219}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ambient fine particulate matter samples were collected during 2009-2013
   in Chengdu, a megacity in western China, and the samples were speciated
   into organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), char-EC, soot-EC, eight
   carbon fractions, inorganic elements and water-soluble ions. Char-EC and
   soot-EC contribute to the better understanding of the sources and
   properties of EC. The highest levels of most carbon fractions were found
   in winter and May. The higher OC/EC ratio in winter suggests higher SOC
   fraction in winter, and higher char-EC/soot-EC ratio in May are the
   direct consequences of straw burning activities. Source contributions to
   PM2.5 and carbonaceous aerosols were quantified using the ME2 receptor
   model. Major contributors to OC in PM2.5 are vehicular exhaust (36.5\%),
   coal combustion \& straw burning (35.2\%) and SOC (27.0\%). The first
   two categories also contributed 51.4\% and 493\% of char-EC in PM2.5.
   Vehicular exhaust dominated soot-EC, contributing 63.0\% to soot-EC in
   PM2.5. SOC contributed to high OC levels in winter due to{''}the
   increase of precursor emissions and stable meteorological conditions.
   Coal combustion \& straw burning show higher contributions to OC,
   char-EC and soot-EC in winter months and in May, which can be explained,
   in part, by increased coal consumption in winter and straw burning
   activities in May. Vehicular exhaust contributions are not strongly
   associated with monthly nor weekday-weekend patterns, resulting in that
   soot-EC vary insignificantly by month nor by weekday. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The study shows a new method for hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (HPEI)
   induced polycation membranes with an objective of achieving better
   fouling resistance and high reverse osmosis (RO) performance. Chemically
   crosslinked composite membrane (CCCM) was prepared with polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA), maleic acid (MA) and Pluronic F127 via chemical
   crosslinldng methodology. Polycation induced membranes were fabricated
   by surface coating of HPEI onto the CCCM (PVA/MA/PluronicF127) RO
   membranes. Functional group analysis, morphology and surface roughness
   of CCCM and HPEI-RO membranes were analyzed by Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force
   microscopy respectively. The hydrophilicity and water permeability of
   CCCM and HPEI-RO were examined with water contact angle measurement and
   RO performance test. Optimum RO performance was obtained for HPEI-R03
   membrane with NaCI and MgSO4, as for R-Nacl = 96.1\%, J(Nacl) = 58.2 L
   m(-2)h(-1) and R-Mgso4 = 99.6\%, MgSO4 = 15.8 L m(-2) h(-1) (testing
   with 3.28 wt.\% aqueous NaCI and MgSO4 solution at 25 degrees C and 55
   bar). Moreover, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as standard
   foulants presented a smaller fouling tendency for the modified HPEI-R03
   membrane. HPEI-RO3 compared to the unmodified membrane, was able to
   decrease the stickiness of charged bacteria, Gram negative Escherichia
   coli and Gram positive Staphylococcus epidermidis. Therefore, the
   permeation flux, salt rejection and fouling resistant property of
   membrane (HPEI-RO3) were significantly improved with polycation
   induction into the membranes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A power divider/combiner circuit, which simultaneously achieves wide
   bandwidth, flat gain characteristics, and bidirectional operation, is
   proposed for multichannel broadband system applications. The proposed
   circuit utilizes cascode-based bidirectional amplifier cores, which
   steer the operation modes between a divider and a combiner depending on
   the control input, and a two-stage distributed-amplifier topology with
   artificial transmission lines. Implemented in a 130-nm silicon-germanium
   BiCMOS technology platform, the proposed divider/combiner provides the
   advantage of seamless integration with digital control blocks. The power
   divider/combiner exhibits the flat in-band gain of 9 dB and the
   operational bandwidth of 2-22 GHz, which covers S-, C-, X-, and
   Ku-bands. In addition, it shows the amplitude imbalance of 0.8 dB, the
   phase imbalance of 3.5 degrees, the port-to-port isolation of 22 dB, the
   output 1-dB compression point of 3 dBm, and good impedance matching

Abstract = {{In this effort, the authors implement the first ultralong-range chipless

   in reading range, compared with the state of the art. The theoretical
   advantages of the use of millimeter-wave frequencies for
   high-performance chipless radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensor
   implementations are first argued before both a new fully inkjet-printed
   flexible device, based on the Van-Atta reflectarray structure, as well
   as a new chipless RFID polarimetric interrogation, and time-frequency
   data-processing approach is then presented and implemented, for
   operation in the Ka-band. The array, fully inkjet printed on Kapton HN
   polyimide, was demonstrated as being robust to variations of
   interrogation angle (between +/- 70 degrees from normal), as well as to
   bending. With its demonstrated range, in excess of 30 m, and its proven
   adequacy for dense multitag and multisensing implementations in indoor
   environments, the structure may set the foundation for the emergence of
   flexible printable low-cost sensing smart skins for the Internet of

Abstract = {{The increasing use of backscatter radio for pervasive Internet-of-Things
   systems as a low-power and low-cost communication scheme will result in
   dense deployments of tags that need to operate under bandwidth (BW)
   constraints. Typical backscatter tags and computational radio frequency
   (RF) identification systems are unnecessarily limited to modulating data
   with ``ON-OFF{''} switching front-ends, which leads to extensive
   spectrum occupancy, due to the rectangular pulses. This paper sets the
   foundations to overcome these limitations and proposes designs of RF
   front-ends that are capable of varying the tag reflection coefficient in
   a continuous way over time. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated to
   perform pulse shaping on the backscattered signals, which require
   significantly reduced BW. The principles presented in this paper will
   enable sophisticated tags to perform complex modulation schemes under BW
   constraints, while maintaining a very low RF front-end complexity, using
   a single nonlinear component such as a p-i-n diode or field-effect
   transistor. Migrating the idea of pulse shaping from complex
   power-demanding active radios to such minimal RF front-ends will
   complete backscatter radio as a communication scheme for simple RF tags
   and sensors in large-scale deployments. Each tag becomes a miniature
   software-defined radio that implements diverse communication schemes
   with increased spectral efficiency.}},

   Nanoparticles by Reduced Hydrophobicity}},

Abstract = {{Well-structured amphiphilic copolymers are necessary to obtain
   self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) based on synthetic polymers. Highly
   homogeneous and monodispersed macromolecules obtained by controlled
   polymerization have successfully been used for this purpose. However,
   disaggregation of the organized macromolecules is desired when a
   bioactive element, such as -tocopheryl succinate, is introduced in
   self-assembled NPs and this element must be exposed or released to exert
   its action. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the bioactivity
   of synthetic NPs based on defined reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain transfer polymerization copolymers can be enhanced by the
   introduction of hydrophilic comonomers in the hydrophobic segment. The
   amphiphilic terpolymers are based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as
   hydrophilic block, and a hydrophobic block based on a methacrylic
   derivative of -tocopheryl succinate (MTOS) and small amounts of
   2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) (PEG-b-poly(MTOS-co-HEMA)). The
   introduction of HEMA reduces hydrophobicity and introduces disorder both
   in the homogeneous blocks and the compact core of the corresponding NPs.
   These NPs are able to encapsulate additional -tocopheryl succinate
   (-TOS) with high efficiency and their biological activity is much higher
   than that described for the unmodified copolymers, proposedly due to
   more efficient degradation and release of -TOS, demonstrating the
   importance of the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance.}},

   cm(-2) when a pressure as small as 5 N cm(-2) is applied, which leads to
   the invention of a pressure sensitive device by integrating with an

Title = {{Investigation into the origin of high stability of delta-MnO2
   pseudo-capacitive electrode using operando Raman spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Manganese oxides of different structures, especially alpha-MnO2, have
   been extensively studied as electrodes for pseudocapacitors. However,
   the poor stability associated with intercalation of proton has been the
   main obstacle to their commercial applications. To effectively mitigate
   this problem, it is necessary to fully understand the energy storage
   mechanism of the MnO2 phases. In this study, delta phase MnO2 has been
   synthesized through controllable electroplating on architectural
   Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) bones, demonstrating a high specific capacitance of
   1068 F g(-1) and high stability (slight performance drop focus on the
   first 2000 cycles and then remained relatively constant in the
   subsequent 13,000 cycles). The charge storage mechanism of the
   delta-MnO2 coated GZO has been carefully investigated under this extreme
   reaction condition. Results suggest that the amount of charge stored in
   the electrode material correlates well with the amount of Na+ inserted
   into the electrode material from the electrolyte. It is also noted that
   no spectral features corresponding to Na+ insertion were detected during
   cycling when the sample was probed using in operando Raman spectroscopy.
   Therefore, for layered delta-MnO2, a charge storage mechanism of Na+
   intercalation/deintercalation dominated, accompanied by interlayer
   spacing expansion/contraction, was proposed. Moreover, theoretical
   calculations also confirmed that the insertion of Na+ is more
   energetically favorable than H+ at all sites of the interlayer in
   delta-MnO2, offering a rational explanation of the proposed mechanism
   and the observed excellent stability.}},

Abstract = {{Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix hybrid nanocomposites,
   featuring ferroelectric barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles and
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) embedded in the polymer, were
   fabricated by a miscible-immiscible coagulation method followed by hot
   pressing. SEM images showed good distribution of the ceramic
   nanoparticles with very little particle agglomeration. The conductive
   MWCNT increased the charge storage ability of the matrix polymer by
   serving as a polarized charge transport phase for the ferroelectric
   nanoparticles, while the small MWNT amounts used prevented the formation
   of conductive networks. The simple processing method utilized resulted
   in composites with high real permittivity and low dielectric loss over a
   wide range of frequency (10-1 MHz). The dielectric properties of the
   polymer matrix nanocomposites with hybrid fillers (BT with and without
   MWNT) were improved by optimizing the synergistic effects between the
   charge storage behavior of the ferroelectric phase and the charge
   transport behavior of the conductive phase. The best combination of real
   permittivity and dielectric loss properties (71.7 and 0.045
   respectively) were obtained for the nanocomposites containing 37.1 vol\%
   of BaTiO3 and 3 vol\% of MWCNT. In addition to achieving reliable
   dielectric properties, the nanocomposites also displayed flexibility
   making these composites potentially useful for many flexible electronic
   devices and electrostatic energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{With the bloom of portable and wearable electronics, electrochemical
   storage devices featured with high performance, low-cost, safe,
   environmental-friendly, lightweight, thin and flexible features become
   more important than ever. Here, we construct a rechargeable Ni/Zn
   battery with a Co-doped Ni(OH)(2) (CNH) and Zn materials on nickel
   nanowire arrays (NNA) for electrodes. The CNH cathodic material can be
   electrochemically deposited onto the NNA, which can deliver a high
   capacity of 346 mA h g(-1) at current density of 5 A g(-1). Co doping
   can effectively stabilize Ni(OH)(2) with only similar to 10\% capacity
   loss over 5 000 charge/discharge cycles at 30 A g(-1). For anode, the
   design of Zn on NNA considerably lowers the risk of corrosion and
   dendrite form ation. As a result, ultrafast rechargeable Ni/Zn batteries
   are obtained, exhibiting a cell voltage of similar to 1.75 V, energy
   density of 148.54 Wh kg(-1) (4.05 Wh L-1) and power density of 1.725 kW
   kg(-1) (based on the mass of active materials) with a charging time of <
   1 min. Additionally, the NNA-based aqueous Ni/Zn battery exhibits
   superior longevity (only similar to 12\% capacity losses after 5000
   cycles). These features enable our Ni/Zn batteries a highly promising
   candidate for the next generation of flexible energy storage systems.

Abstract = {{Due to the technology advancement and the large-scale application of
   lithium-ion batteries in recent years, the market demand for lithium is
   growing rapidly and the availability of land lithium resources is
   decreasing significantly. As such, the focus of lithium extraction
   technologies has shifted to water lithium resources involving salt-lake
   brines and sea water. Among various aqueous recovery technologies, the
   lithium ion-sieve (LIS) technology is considered the most promising one.
   This is because LISs are excellent adsorbents with high lithium uptake
   capacity, superior lithium selectivity and good cycle performance. These
   attributes have enabled LISs to separate lithium effectively from
   aqueous solutions containing different ions. The present work reviews
   the latest development in LIS technology, including the chemical
   structures of ion-sieves, the corresponding lithium adsorption
   desorption mechanisms, the ion-sieves preparation methods, and the
   challenges associated with the lithium recovery from aqueous solutions
   by the LIS batteries. Besides, some common LIS composite materials
   forming technologies, including granulation, foaming, membrane and fiber
   formation, and magnetization, which are used to overcome the
   shortcomings in industrial column operations, are also explored. (C)

Abstract = {{In this research, a slotted patch antenna sensor is designed for
   wireless strain and crack sensing. An off-the-shelf RFID (radiofrequency
   identification) chip is adopted in the antenna sensor design for signal
   modulation. The operation power of the RFID chip is captured from
   wireless reader interrogation signal, so the sensor operation is
   completely battery-free (passive) and wireless. For strain and crack
   sensing of a structure, the antenna sensor is bonded on the structure
   surface like a regular strain gage. Since the antenna resonance
   frequency is directly related with antenna dimension, which deforms when
   strain occurs on the structural surface, the deformation/strain can be
   correlated with antenna resonance frequency shift measured by an RFID
   reader. The slotted patch antenna sensor performance is first evaluated
   through mechanics-electromagnetics coupled simulation. Extensive
   experiments are then conducted to validate the antenna sensor
   performance, including tensile and compressive strain sensing, wireless
   interrogation range, and fatigue crack sensing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper revisits the variational theory of traffic flow, now under
   the presence of continuum lateral inflows and outflows to the freeway.
   It is found that a VT solution apply only in Eulerian coordinates when
   source terms are exogenous, but not when they are a function of traffic
   conditions, e.g. as per a merge model. In discrete time, however, these
   dependencies become exogenous, which allowed us to propose improved
   numerical solution methods. In space-Lagrangian and time-Lagrangian
   coordinates, VT solutions may not apply even if source terms are
   exogenous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since the discovery of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) by Wang's
   group in January 2012, various breakthroughs have been achieved in the
   fundamental mechanisms of TENG as well as the demonstrated self-powered
   systems. TENG has shown many advantages in micro-scale energy harvesting
   for applications in sensors and portable devices. As a self-sufficient
   power source, TENG can be used in conjunction with electrochemical
   processes as self-powered electrochemistry without the use of external
   power source. This review mainly focuses on the updated progress in
   TENGs for both high performance energy conversion and self-powered
   electrochemical systems in application such as water splitting, sea
   water desalination, air pollution cleaning, degradation of organic
   pollutant, collecting of heavy metal ions and many more. The idea of
   performing electrochemistry without using an external power could be
   useful for large-scale application in environmental science.}},

Abstract = {{Centralized data repositories have proven useful in promoting
   reproducibility and transparency in many fields of research,
   particularly the life sciences. Nanomaterials research is frequently
   difficult to reproduce because of the complexity of the systems under
   study and a lack of standardization due to the exploratory nature of the
   field. One system that exemplifies this problem is that of the poly
   (3-hexylthiophene)-based organic field effect transistor, a platform
   used to study the process structure -property relationships in
   semicrystalline polymeric semiconductors. Performance in this system is
   judged principally by charge carrier mobility, a fitted model parameter
   that describes how quickly charge can move through the active layer of a
   given transistor. Reported values of this electrical property vary by
   over six orders of magnitude for one material and are impacted by
   intrinsic material properties, processing conditions, device
   architectures and calculation methods. A database containing over 200 of
   these devices from 19 studies was compiled to demonstrate the impact of
   these parameters on reported performance as well as the utility of
   having such a database to search and explore. We confirm well-known
   trends such as the effect of polymer molecular weight, transistor
   channel length and thin film deposition method before going on to
   identify a standard device that can be compared across multiple studies.
   We find that an organized database of process-property information can
   be used to identify unpublished heuristic knowledge, to help authors
   standardize their reporting of methods, and to guide hypothesis
   generation and experimental design. A repository of the data used in
   this study is available at

Abstract = {{Untreated cavities can have far-reaching negative consequences for
   people's ability to eat, speak, and learn. By adolescence, 27 percent of
   low-income children in the United States will have untreated cavities.
   School-based sealant programs typically provide dental sealants (a
   protective coating that adheres to the surface of molars) at little or
   no cost to students attending schools in areas with low socioeconomic
   status. These programs have been shown to increase the number of
   students receiving sealants and to prevent cavities. We analyzed the
   cost-effectiveness of school sealant programs using data (from school
   programs in fourteen states between 2013 and 2014) on children's cavity
   risk, including the effects of untreated cavities on a child's quality
   of life. We found that providing sealants in school programs to 1,000
   children would prevent 485 fillings and 1.59 disability-adjusted
   life-years. School-based sealant programs saved society money and
   remained cost-effective across a wide range of reasonable values.}},

Abstract = {{Organometal halide perovskites have shown excellent optoelectronic
   properties and have been used to demonstrate a variety of semiconductor
   devices. Colorful solar cells are desirable for photovoltaic integration
   in buildings and other aesthetically appealing applications. However,
   the realization of colorful perovskite solar cells is challenging
   because of their broad and large absorption coefficient that commonly
   leads to cells with dark-brown colors. Herein, for the first time, we
   report a simple and efficient strategy to achieve colorful perovskite
   solar cells by using the transparent conducting polymer
   (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) as
   a top electrode and simultaneously as an spectrally selective
   antireflection coating. Vivid colors across the visible spectrum are
   attained by engineering optical interference effects among the
   transparent PEDOT:PSS polymer electrode, the hole-transporting layer and
   the perovskite layer. The colored perovskite solar cells display power
   conversion efficiency values from 12.8 to 15.1\% (from red to blue) when
   illuminated from the FTO glass side and from 11.6 to 13.8\% (from red to
   blue) when illuminated from the PEDOT:PSS side. The new approach
   provides an advanced solution for fabricating colorful perovskite solar
   cells with easy processing and high efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in liquid-phase reactions over heterogeneous catalysts is
   growing rapidly, partially because of the desire to find efficient
   methods for biomass conversion to renewable fuels and chemicals. The
   presence of a solvent can affect reactions at surfaces by competing with
   reactants and products for adsorption sites and solvating adsorbed
   species. Mass transport limitations can also have a pronounced effect on
   liquid-phase reaction rates. Because many heterogeneous catalysts were
   designed to be stable under gas-phase reaction conditions, their
   operation in liquid reaction media at moderately elevated temperatures
   can result in unexpected structural changes. In some cases, components
   derived from the evolving catalyst contribute significantly to the
   catalytic activity. Solvents, as well as byproducts from biomass
   feedstocks, can also act as homogeneous catalysts to alter the intrinsic
   reactivity of the heterogeneous catalyst. In this contribution, we
   discuss each of these phenomena and provide illustrative examples.}},

Abstract = {{Computational modeling of heart valve dynamics incorporating both fluid
   dynamics and valve structural responses has been challenging. In this
   study, we developed a novel fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction
   (FSI) model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). A previously
   developed nonlinear finite element (FE) model of tran-scatheter aortic
   valves (TAV) was utilized to couple with SPH to simulate valve leaflet
   dynamics throughout the entire cardiac cycle. Comparative simulations
   were performed to investigate the impact of using FE-only models vs. FSI
   models, as well as an isotropic vs. an anisotropic leaflet material
   model in TAV simulations. From the results, substantial differences in
   leaflet kinematics between FE-only and FSI models were observed, and the
   FSI model could capture the realistic leaflet dynamic deformation due to
   its more accurate spatial and temporal loading conditions imposed on the
   leaflets. The stress and the strain distributions were similar between
   the FE and FSI simulations. However, the peak stresses were different
   due to the water hammer effect induced by the fluid inertia in the FSI
   model during the closing phase, which led to 13-28\% lower peak stresses
   in the FE-only model compared to that of the FSI model. The simulation
   results also indicated that tissue anisotropy had a minor impact on
   hemodynamics of the valve. However, a lower tissue stiffness in the
   radial direction of the leaflets could reduce the leaflet peak stress
   caused by the water hammer effect. It is hoped that the developed FSI
   models can serve as an effective tool to better assess valve dynamics
   and optimize next generation TAV designs.}},

Title = {{An equivalent boundary model for effects of adjacent spans on wind
   reliability of wood utility poles in overhead distribution lines}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{441-452}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Overhead distribution lines in the United States are primarily supported
   by wood poles. These utility poles are vulnerable to high wind loads
   from hurricanes which has resulted in a large number of power outages
   during past hurricanes, especially in coastal areas. Risk management of
   distribution systems requires development of distribution line models to
   reliably assess their performance under hurricanes. However, modeling
   the entire distribution line is not practically feasible as they are
   very long and consist of a large number of spans. The present study
   proposes analytical models to capture boundary effects of adjacent spans
   on the wind response of the pole of interest via equivalent springs and
   wind-induced forces. The stiffness of conductors (cables) is derived
   through a simplified solution that considers the shape of the conductors
   under lateral static gust wind and gravity loadings; this model is shown
   to be very accurate when compared to the exact analytical as well as
   Finite Element solutions. Deterministic and probabilistic studies are
   performed to assess the impact of boundary conditions on the performance
   of the poles; results indicate that pole boundaries may have a
   considerable impact on the estimates of failure probabilities especially
   when the extent of difference in the properties of adjacent spans is not
   negligible. Specifically, neglecting boundary effects from neighboring
   spans may result in underestimation of failure probabilities of stronger
   poles and overestimation of failure probabilities of weaker poles as
   load sharing effects among the poles are not considered. The proposed
   boundary model enables more reliable hurricane risk assessment of power
   distribution systems to effectively manage the risk of outages. (C) 2016

   leader-follower networks, where the external control inputs are injected

   the controllability of such systems to the graph distances between the
   agents. More specifically, we present a graph topological lower bound on
   the rank of the controllability matrix. This lower bound is tight, and
   it is applicable to systems with arbitrary network topologies, coupling
   weights, and number of leaders. An algorithm for computing the lower
   bound is also provided. Furthermore, as a prominent application, we
   present how the proposed bound can be utilized to select a minimal set
   of leaders for achieving controllability, even when the coupling weights

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a potential cell
   source for tendon/ligament tissue engineering. Extrinsic cues, such as
   the chemical and physical properties of scaffolds, as well as external
   forces, play an important role in fibroblastic differentiation of these
   cells. In this study, we employed a collagen-fibre scaffold that mimics
   the chemical and fibrous structure and mechanical properties of
   tendon/ligament, and studied how imparting cyclic tension to these
   fibrous collagen scaffolds affects tendon/ligament fibroblastic
   differentiation of MSCs. Human MSCs attached and spread on the surface
   of the scaffolds, and appeared aligned along the fibres 24h after
   seeding. Cyclic tension was then applied to cell-laden scaffolds over a
   period of 14 days (10\% strain, 1Hz, 3h on/3h off). Real time RT-PCR
   analysis indicated that scleraxis, a transcription factor associated
   with the tendon fibroblast phenotype, was found to be significantly
   upregulated only under cyclic tension. Immunohistochemical staining
   demonstrated that MSCs cultured under cyclic tension after 14 days
   secreted more extracellular matrix, including collagen I, collagen III
   and tenascin-C, compared to constructs in static culture, after 14 days
   in vitro. Our data indicate that cyclic tension can promote fibroblastic
   differentiation of MSCs in these fibrous collagen-based scaffolds, which
   may have significant applications in the development of
   tissue-engineered graft alternatives for tendon and ligament injuries.

Abstract = {{Using three-dimensional computer simulations, we probe biomimetic free
   swimming of an internally actuated flexible plate in the regime near the
   first natural frequency. The plate is driven by an oscillating internal
   moment approximating the actuation mechanism of a piezoelectric macro
   fiber composite (MFC) bimorph. We show in our simulations that the
   addition of a passive attachment increases both swimming velocity and
   efficiency. Specifically, if the active and passive sections are of
   similar size, the overall performance is the best. We determine that
   this optimum is a result of two competing factors. If the passive
   section is too large, then the actuated portion is unable to generate
   substantial deflection to create sufficient thrust. On the other hand, a
   large actuated section leads to a bending pattern that is inefficient at
   generating thrust especially at higher frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{A primary purpose of the lymphatic system is to transport fluid from
   peripheral tissues to the central venous system in order to maintain
   tissue-fluid balance. Failure to perform this task results in lymphedema
   marked by swelling of the affected limb as well as geometric remodeling
   and reduced contractility of the affected lymphatic vessels. The
   mechanical environment has been implicated in the regulation of
   lymphatic contractility, but it is unknown how changes in the mechanical
   environment are related to loss of contractile function and remodeling
   of the tissue. The purpose of this paper was to introduce a new
   theoretical framework for acute and long-term adaptations of lymphatic
   vessels to changes in mechanical loading. This theoretical framework
   combines a simplified version of a published lumped parameter model for
   lymphangion function and lymph transport, a published microstructurally
   motivated constitutive model for the active and passive mechanical
   behavior of isolated rat thoracic ducts, and novel models for acute
   mechanically mediated vasoreactive adaptations and long-term volumetric
   growth to simulate changes in muscle contractility and geometry of a
   single isolated rat thoracic duct in response to a sustained elevation
   in afterload. The illustrative examples highlight the potential role of
   the mechanical environment in the acute maintenance of contractility and
   long-term geometric remodeling, presumably aimed at meeting fluid flow
   demands while also maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Results
   demonstrate that contractility may adapt in response to shear stress to
   meet fluid flow demands and show that pressure-induced long-term
   geometric remodeling may attenuate these adaptations and reduce fluid
   flow. The modeling framework and illustrative simulations help suggest
   relevant experiments that are necessary to accurately quantify and
   predict the acute and long-term adaptations of lymphangions to altered
   mechanical loading.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of mitral valve (MV) geometries and multitude of surgical
   options for correction of MV diseases necessitates the use of
   computational modeling. Numerical simulations of the MV would allow
   surgeons and engineers to evaluate repairs, devices, procedures, and
   concepts before performing them and before moving on to more costly
   testing modalities. Constructing, tuning, and validating these models
   rely upon extensive in vitro characterization of valve structure,
   function, and response to change due to diseases. Micro-computed
   tomography (mu CT) allows for unmatched spatial resolution for soft
   tissue imaging. However, it is still technically challenging to obtain
   an accurate geometry of the diastolic MV. We discuss here the
   development of a novel technique for treating MV specimens with
   glutaraldehyde fixative in order to minimize geometric distortions in
   preparation for mu CT scanning. The technique provides a resulting MV
   geometry which is significantly more detailed in chordal structure,
   accurate in leaflet shape, and closer to its physiological diastolic
   geometry. In this paper, computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
   simulations are used to show the importance of more detailed
   subject-specific MV geometry with 3D chordal structure to simulate a
   proper closure validated against mu CT images of the closed valve. Two
   computational models, before and after use of the aforementioned
   technique, are used to simulate closure of the MV.}},

Abstract = {{Direct metal laser sintering can produce porous Ti-6Al-4V orthopedic and
   dental implants. The process requires reduced resources and time and can
   provide greater structural control than machine manufacturing. Implants
   in bone are colonized by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can
   differentiate into osteoblasts and contribute to osseointegration. This
   study examined osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization of
   human MSCs cultured on laser-sintered Ti-6Al-4V constructs with varying
   porosity and at different time scales. 2D solid disks and low, medium
   and high porosity (LP, MP, and HP) 3D constructs based on a human
   trabecular bone template were laser sintered from Ti-6Al-4V powder and
   further processed to have micro- and nanoscale roughness. hMSCs
   exhibited greater osteoblastic differentiation and local factor
   production on all 3D porous constructs compared to 2D surfaces, which
   was sustained for 9 days without use of exogenous factors. hMSCs
   cultured for 8 weeks on MP constructs in osteogenic medium (OM), OM
   supplemented with BMP2 or collagen-coated MP constructs in OM exhibited
   bone-like extracellular matrix mineralization. Use of bio-inspired
   porosity for the 3D architecture of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V
   enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs beyond surface roughness
   alone. This study suggests that a 3D architecture may enhance the
   osseointegration of orthopedic and dental implants in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to determine the effect of injection
   volume, formulation composition, and time on circumferential spread of
   particles, small molecules, and polymeric formulation excipients in the
   suprachoroidal space (SCS) after microneedle injection into New Zealand
   White rabbit eyes ex vivo and in vivo. Microneedle injections of 25-150
   mu L Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 0.2 mu m red
   fluorescent particles and a model small molecule (fluorescein) were
   performed in rabbit eyes ex vivo, and visualized via flat mount.
   Particles with diameters of 0.02-2 mu m were co-injected into SCS in
   vivo with fluorescein or a polymeric formulation excipient: fluorescein
   isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Discovisc or FITC-labeled carboxymethyl
   cellulose (CMC). Fluorescent fundus images were acquired over time to
   determine area of particle, fluorescein, and polymeric formulation
   excipient spread, as well as their co-localization. We found that
   fluorescein covered a significantly larger area than co-injected
   particles when suspended in HBSS, and that this difference was present
   from 3 min post-injection onwards. We further showed that there was no
   difference in initial area covered by FITC-Discovisc and particles; the
   transport time (i.e., the time until the FITC-Discovisc and particle
   area began dissociating) was 2 d. There was also no difference in
   initial area covered by FITC-CMC and particles; the transport time in
   FITC-CMC was 4 d. We also found that particle size (20 nm-2 mu m) had no
   effect on spreading area when delivered in HBSS or Discovisc. We
   conclude that (i) the area of particle spread in SCS during injection
   generally increased with increasing injection volume, was unaffected by
   particle size, and was significantly less than the area of fluorescein
   spread, (ii) particles suspended in low-viscosity HBSS formulation were
   entrapped in the SCS after injection, whereas fluorescein was not and
   (iii) particles co-injected with viscous polymeric formulation
   excipients co-localized near the site of injection in the SCS, continued
   to co-localize while spreading over larger areas for 2-4 days, and then
   no longer co-localized as the polymeric formulation excipients were
   cleared within 1-3 weeks and the particles remained largely in place.
   These data suggest that particles encounter greater barriers to flow in
   SCS compared to molecules and that co-localization of particles and
   polymeric formulation excipients allows spreading over larger areas of
   the SCS until the particles and excipients dissociate. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A portable tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomographic PIV)
   system is described. The system was successfully deployed in Antarctica
   to study shelled Antarctic pteropods (Limacina helicina antarctica)-a
   delicate organism with an unusual propulsion mechanism. The experimental
   setup consists of a free-standing frame assembled with optical rails,
   thus avoiding the need for heavy and bulky equipment (e.g. an optical
   table). The cameras, lasers, optics, and tanks are all rigidly supported
   within the frame assembly. The results indicate that the pteropods flap
   their parapodia (or ``wings{''}) downward during both power and recovery
   strokes, which is facilitated by the pitching of their shell. Shell
   pitching significantly alters the flapping trajectory, allowing the
   pteropod to move vertically and/or horizontally. The pronation and
   supination of the parapodia, together with the figure-eight motion
   during flapping, suggest similarities with insect flight. The volumetric
   velocity field surrounding the freely swimming pteropod reveals the
   generation of an attached vortex ring connecting the leading-edge vortex
   to the trailing-edge vortex during power stroke and a presence of a
   leading-edge vortex during recovery stroke. These vortex structures play
   a major role in accelerating the organism vertically and indicate that
   forces generated on the parapodia during flapping constitute both lift
   and drag. After completing each stroke, two vortex rings are shed into
   the wake of the pteropod. The complex combination of body kinematics
   (parapodia flapping, shell pitch, sawtooth trajectory), flow structures,
   and resulting force balance may be significantly altered by thinning of
   the pteropod shell, thus making pteropods an indicator of the
   detrimental effects of ocean acidification.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic information is crucial in the execution of precise dexterous
   manipulations. Laparoscopic surgery, a type of minimally invasive
   surgery, requires that the surgeon senses force information about tissue
   through forceps, because he or she cannot touch the organs directly. We
   propose the concept of surgical grasping forceps with enhanced
   sensorimotor capability based on attaching a vibrator to the forceps'
   grip by evoking a stochastic resonance (SR) effect. To apply appropriate
   vibrations, a summing network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons was built to
   investigate the system's response when white noise was applied to each
   of the four types of tactile receptor. The relation among the tactile
   sensitivity, noise intensity, and amplitude of input signal is discussed
   by the simulation with the neural network composed of different tactile
   receptors. The simulation results revealed that the working range of the
   SR effect is extended by taking advantage of having multiple receptors
   with different characteristics in skins. It was also found that improved
   tactile sensitivity could be obtained even without a strict set of
   vibration intensity values. Based on the findings from the simulation,
   we developed surgical forceps with sensorimotor-enhancing capability
   taking advantage of the SR effect. The forceps are equipped with a lead
   zirconate titanate actuator at the grip as a vibration source. We
   conducted touch testing, texture discrimination testing, and tumor
   detection testing to verify their improved tactile sensitivity. The
   experiments conducted with the proposed forceps showed that maintaining
   the noise intensity within the optimal range could improve tactile
   sensitivity, and confirmed the usefulness of the SR application for
   medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method utilizing geomagnetic field effects
   commonly found in nature to help the visually impaired persons (VIPs)
   navigate safely and efficiently; both indoor and outdoor applications
   are considered. Magnetic information indicating special locations can be
   incorporated as waypoints on a map to provide a basis to help the user
   follow a map that amalgamates the waypoints into spatial information.
   Along with a magnetic tensor sensor (MTS), a navigation system for
   helping VIPs more effectively comprehend their surroundings is
   presented. With the waypoint-enhanced map and an improved
   dynamic-time-warping algorithm, this system estimates the user's
   locations from real-time measured magnetic data. Methods using image
   data to enhance waypoints at dangerous locations are discussed. The
   MTS-enhanced method can be integrated into existing personal mobile
   devices (with built-in sound, image, video, and vibration alert
   capabilities) to take advantages of the rapidly developing internet,
   global positioning systems, and computing technologies to overcome
   several shortcomings of blind-assistive devices. A prototype
   MTS-enhanced system for indoor/outdoor navigation has been developed and
   demonstrated experimentally. Although the MTS and algorithm are
   presented in the context of way-finding for a VIP, the findings
   presented here provide a basis for a wide range of applications where
   geomagnetic field effects offer an advantage.}},

Abstract = {{Low-power is one of the key driving forces in modern very large scale
   integration systems. Recent studies show that 3-D integrated circuits
   (ICs) offer a significant power saving over 2-D ICs. However, these
   studies are mainly limited to two-tier (2-tier) designs. Thus, in this
   paper, we extend our target to three-tier (3-tier) 3-D ICs. This paper
   first shows that the one additional tier available in 3-tier 3-D ICs
   does offer more power saving compared with their 2-tier 3-D IC
   counterparts, but more careful floorplanning, through-silicon via
   management, and block folding considerations are required. Second, we
   find that the 3-tiers can be bonded in several different ways: 1)
   face-to-back only; 2) face-to-face and face-to-back combined; and 3)
   back-to-back and face-to-face combined. This paper shows that these
   choices pose additional challenges in design optimizations for more
   power saving. Lastly, we develop effective computer-aided-design
   solutions that are seamlessly integrated into commercial 2-D IC tools to
   handle 3-tier 3-D IC power optimization under various bonding style
   options. With our low-power design methods combined, our 3-tier 3-D ICs
   provide -14.8\% more power reduction over 2-tier 3-D ICs, and -36.0\%
   over 2-D ICs in microprocessor cores under the same performance. In
   full-chip microprocessors, our 3-tier 3-D ICs provide -27.2\% more power
   reduction over 2-D ICs.}},

Abstract = {{Clouds are becoming an important platform for scientific workflow
   applications. However, with many nodes being deployed in clouds,
   managing reliability of resources becomes a critical issue, especially
   for the real-time scientific workflow execution where deadlines should
   be satisfied. Therefore, fault tolerance in clouds is extremely
   essential. The PB (primary backup) based scheduling is a popular
   technique for fault tolerance and has effectively been used in the
   cluster and grid computing. However, applying this technique for
   real-time workflows in a virtualized cloud is much more complicated and
   has rarely been studied. In this paper, we address this problem. We
   first establish a real-time workflow fault-tolerant model that extends
   the traditional PB model by incorporating the cloud characteristics.
   Based on this model, we develop approaches for task allocation and
   message transmission to ensure faults can be tolerated during the
   workflow execution. Finally, we propose a dynamic fault-tolerant
   scheduling algorithm, FASTER, for real-time workflows in the virtualized
   cloud. FASTER has three key features: 1) it employs a backward shifting
   method to make full use of the idle resources and incorporates task
   overlapping and VM migration for high resource utilization, 2) it
   applies the vertical/horizontal scaling-up technique to quickly
   provision resources for a burst of workflows, and 3) it uses the
   vertical scaling-down scheme to avoid unnecessary and ineffective
   resource changes due to fluctuated workflow requests. We evaluate our
   FASTER algorithm with synthetic workflows and workflows collected from
   the real scientific and business applications and compare it with six
   baseline algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that FASTER
   can effectively improve the resource utilization and schedulability even
   in the presence of node failures in virtualized clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium niobate is a multi-functional material with wide reaching
   applications in acoustics, optics, and electronics. Commercial
   applications for lithium niobate require high crystalline quality
   currently limited to bulk and ion sliced material. Thin film lithium
   niobate is an attractive option for a variety of integrated devices, but
   the research effort has been stagnant due to poor material quality. Both
   lattice matched and mismatched lithium niobate are grown by molecular
   beam epitaxy and studied to understand the role of substrate and
   temperature on nucleation conditions and material quality. Growth on
   sapphire produces partially coalesced columnar grains with atomically
   flat plateaus and no twin planes. A symmetric rocking curve shows a
   narrow linewidth with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8.6 arcsec
   (0.0024A degrees), which is comparable to the 5.8 arcsec rocking curve
   FWHM of the substrate, while the film asymmetric rocking curve is 510
   arcsec FWHM. These values indicate that the individual grains are
   relatively free of long-range disorder detectable by x-ray diffraction
   with minimal measurable tilt and twist and represents the highest
   structural quality epitaxial material grown on lattice mismatched
   sapphire without twin planes. Lithium niobate is also grown on lithium
   tantalate producing high quality coalesced material without twin planes
   and with a symmetric rocking curve of 193 arcsec, which is nearly equal
   to the substrate rocking curve of 194 arcsec. The surface morphology of
   lithium niobate on lithium tantalate is shown to be atomically flat by
   atomic force microscopy.}},

   rocket flow}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work focuses on the development of a semi-analytical model that is
   appropriate for the rotational, steady, inviscid, and compressible
   motion of an ideal gas, winch is accelerated uniformly along the length
   of a right-cylindrical rocket chamber. By overcoming some of the
   difficulties encountered in previous work on the subject, the present
   analysis leads to an improved mathematical formulation, which enables us
   to retrieve an exact solution for the pressure field. Considering a
   slender porous chamber of circular cross-section, the method that we
   follow reduces the problem's mass, momentum, energy, ideal gas, and
   isentropic relations to a single integral equation that is amenable to a
   direct numerical evaluation. Then, using an Abel transformation, exact
   closed-form representations of the pressure distribution arc obtained
   for particular values of the specific heat ratio. Throughout this
   effort, Saint-Robert's power law is used to link the pressure to the
   mass injection rate at the wall. This allows us to compare the results
   associated with the axisymmetric chamber configuration to two
   closed-form analytical solutions developed under either one-or
   two-dimensional, isentropic flow conditions. The comparison is carried
   out assuming, first, a uniformly distributed mass flux and, second, a
   constant radial injection speed along the simulated propellant grain.
   Our amended formulation is consequently shown to agree with a
   one-dimensional solution obtained for the case of uniform wall mass
   flux, as well as numerical simulations and asymptotic approximations for
   a constant wall injection speed. The numerical simulations include three
   particular models: a strictly inviscid solver, which closely agrees with
   the present formulation, and both k-omega and Spalart-Alimaras
   computations.}},

Title = {{Prediction of viscous cracking and cyclic fatigue of salt polycrystals
   using a joint-enriched finite element model}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{28-43}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present a new Joint-enriched Finite Element Method (JFEM) to predict
   viscous damage and fatigue in halite polycrystals in 2D. Different
   visco-plastic finite elements are used to represent grains of different
   orientations, and joint elements are used for modeling crack
   propagation. Simulations of uniaxial creep tests show that, as it could
   be predicted theoretically, viscous shear deformation in grains causes
   geometric incompatibilities. Numerical results also show that the
   transition between secondary and tertiary creep corresponds to
   inter-granular crack coalescence. The JFEM model captures the mechanical
   behavior of halite under cyclic loading, mainly: (a) Higher stress
   amplitude, lower confining stress, and lower loading frequency increase
   deformation and damage; (b) The polycrystal's Young's modulus decreases
   exponentially with the number of cycles; (c) The behavior is similar for
   different loading directions. Simulations with intra- and inter-granular
   joint elements show that most stress concentrations occur in
   intra-granular joints where several angular grains are in contact.
   Results of creep tests obtained with the JFEM are compared to those
   obtained with an inclusion-matrix model that accounts for damage
   accommodation due to grain breakage. Both the JFEM and inclusion-matrix
   models are calibrated against experimental creep tests to: (a) Produce a
   Young's modulus of 23 GPa for the polycrystal; (b) Match secondary creep
   strain rates; (c) Match the time of tertiary creep initiation. In the
   inclusion-matrix model, the absence of grain geometric rearrangement
   results in a brutal failure just after the first grain breakage that
   triggers tertiary creep. Moreover, the JFEM model highlights the
   development of crack patterns upon viscous deformation. The JFEM is of
   great promise to understand complex phenomena of viscous accommodation
   coupled with grain interface debonding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the past few decades, analysis of heart sound signals (i.e. the
   phonocardiogram or PCG), especially for automated heart sound
   segmentation and classification, has been widely studied and has been
   reported to have the potential value to detect pathology accurately in
   clinical applications. However, comparative analyses of algorithms in
   the literature have been hindered by the lack of high-quality,
   rigorously validated, and standardized open databases of heart sound
   recordings. This paper describes a public heart sound database,
   assembled for an international competition, the PhysioNet/Computing in
   Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2016. The archive comprises nine different
   heart sound databases sourced from multiple research groups around the
   world. It includes 2435 heart sound recordings in total collected from
   1297 healthy subjects and patients with a variety of conditions,
   including heart valve disease and coronary artery disease. The
   recordings were collected from a variety of clinical or nonclinical
   (such as in-home visits) environments and equipment. The length of
   recording varied from several seconds to several minutes. This article
   reports detailed information about the subjects/patients including

Abstract = {{A new method for the preparation of freestanding thin film samples for
   mechanical testing in transmission electron microscopes is presented. It
   is based on a combination of focused ion beam.(FIB) milling and
   electron-beam-assisted etching with xenon difluoride (XeF2) precursor
   gas. The use of the FIB allows for the target preparation of
   microstructural defects and enables well-defined sample geometries which
   can be easily adapted in order to meet the requirements of various
   testing setups. In contrast to existing FIB-based preparation
   approaches, the area of interest is never exposed to ion beam
   irradiation which preserves a pristine microstructure. The method can be
   applied to a wide range of thin film material systems compatible with
   XeF2 etching. Its feasibility is demonstrated for gold and alloyed
   copper thin films and its practical application is discussed. (C) 2016

Title = {{Chemical characterization and toxicity of particulate matter emissions

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Roadside trash burning is largely unexamined as a factor that influences
   air quality, radiative forcing, and human health even though it is
   ubiquitously practiced across many global regions, including throughout
   India. The objective of this research is to examine characteristics and
   redox activity of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with
   roadside trash burning in Bangalore, India. Emissions from smoldering
   and flaming roadside trash piles (n = 24) were analyzed for organic and
   elemental carbon (OC/EC), brown carbon (BrC), and toxicity (i.e. redox
   activity, measured via the dithiothreitol ``DTI{''} assay). A subset of
   samples (n = 8) were further assessed for toxicity by a cellular assay
   (macrophage assay) and also analyzed for trace organic compounds.
   Results show high variability of chemical composition and toxicity
   between trash-burning emissions, and characteristic differences from
   ambient samples. OC/EC ratios for trash-burning emissions range from 0.8
   to 1500, while ambient OC/EC ratios were observed at 5.4 +/- 1.8. Trace
   organic compound analyses indicate that emissions from trash-burning
   piles were frequently composed of aromatic di-acids (likely from burning
   plastics) and levoglucosan (an indicator of biomass burning), while the
   ambient sample showed high response from alkanes indicating notable
   representation from vehicular exhaust. Volume-normalized DTT results
   (i.e., redox activity normalized by the volume of air pulled through the
   filter during sampling) were, unsurprisingly, extremely elevated in all
   trash-burning samples. Interestingly, DIT results suggest that on a
   per-mass basis, fresh trash-burning emissions are an order of magnitude
   less redox-active than ambient air (13.4 +/- 14.8 pmol/min/mu gOC for
   trash burning; 107 +/- 25 pmol/min/mu gOC for ambient). However, overall
   results indicate that near trash burning sources, exposure to
   redox-active PM can be extremely high. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, we reported a facile method for synthesizing poly
   (sodium acrylate) (PAANa)-modified TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibril
   (TOCN) aerogel spheres. The water absorbent capacity of the spheres
   could be as high as 1030 g/g, which has never been reported before.
   Practically, the 1 wt\% TOCN suspension was simply dropped into an HCl
   solution to prepare physically crosslinked TOCN hydrogel spheres.
   Afterwards, PAANa, an anionic monomer, was added into TOCN gel spheres
   by solution replacement, and the monomer was polymerized and grafted to
   the TOCN spheres in the presence of N,N-methylenebisacrylamide as a
   crosslinker through in situ free radical polymerization. The physical
   crosslinking (through hydrogen bonding) of the spheres was replaced by
   chemical crosslinking after washing the gel spheres to neutral, which
   resulted in high volume expansion (about 27 times v/v) of the washed
   sphere. The expansion rate and morphologies of the obtained hybrid gel
   spheres were strongly dependent on the dosage of the crosslinker and
   monomer. The structure and morphologies of the hybrid spheres were
   characterized by FTIR, TGA and SEM. The water-absorbing behaviors of the
   hybrid spheres were dependent on the pH, concentration of the salt
   solution and crosslinker content. The freeze-dried aerogel spheres were
   highly porous (approximately 99.88 \%) with density as low as 1.5
   mg/cm(3). All results indicated that TOCN-PAANa hybrid aerogel spheres
   could serve as a new type of superabsorbent.}},

Abstract = {{As a biodegradable, inexpensive and universally accessible material,
   paper is used widely in many applications, including packaging, office
   supplies and household products. However, the hydrophilic and oleophilic
   nature of paper often limits its use in applications that involve direct
   contact with liquids. The main purpose of this study was to create
   highly amphiphobic paper for products such as low cost medical testing
   strips, liquid packaging, and breathable and disposable medical apparel.
   A three-step process was developed to create paper with contact angles
   greater than 150A degrees for water and motor oil, and greater than 140A
   degrees for n-hexadecane. First, a commercially available debonding
   agent was used to manipulate the dimensions of the fiber network through
   efficient fines removal and modification of inter-fiber hydrogen
   bonding. Then an oxygen plasma was used to create nano-scale roughness
   on the micrometer-sized fibers and to remove residual fines that were
   blocking the inter-fiber pores. Finally, the paper was immersed in a
   fluorosilane solution to obtain a thin, low surface energy coating. XPS,
   SEM, mercury porosimetry and profilometry were used to evaluate changes
   in the fiber network after each step. This study marks the first report
   that uses debonder agents specifically to modify the anti-wetting
   properties of paper substrates by controlling the topology of the fiber
   network. The processes used in this procedure are simple, cost effective
   and amenable to scale-up.}},

Abstract = {{The high co-sintering temperature of BZCYYb electrolyte membranes
   supported by anode substrates usually causes a series of problems
   including undesirable electrolyte-anode reactions/diffusion and
   Ba-evaporation, posing a challenge for seeking alternative fabrication
   approaches. In this study, BZCYYb electrolyte membranes supported by
   anode substrates are fabricated by a large-scale and cost-effective
   atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process. The 25 pm thick BZCYYb
   membrane has negligible electrolyte-anode reactions/diffusion due to the
   APS process free of high-temperature co-firing. The Ba-evaporation
   problem is also resolved during APS process because of the adoption of

   results demonstrate that BSCFN is chemical and physical compatible with
   La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta(LSGM) electrolyte. The BSCFN cathodes
   exhibit excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and mobility.

Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The pursuit of Faster Fast Track or Flash Track is deemed necessary in
   today's industry for reasons such as emergency rebuilds, competitive
   market advantage, and regulatory compliance. Flash Tracking has been
   defined as a time-driven project, which by necessity requires a
   heightened degree of concurrency between engineering, procurement, and
   construction. This paper reports on Flash Track readiness assessment
   algorithms that were developed to enable an organization to assess its
   readiness to execute time-critical or Flash Track projects. The
   readiness assessment algorithms were developed by defining the relative
   importance of 47 essential Flash Track practices, grouped into 6
   categories using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weights of
   the practices and categories were determined by a 15-member industry
   expert panel, comprised of 15 Construction Industry Institute (CII)
   member companies representing owners, contractors, and engineering
   organizations. The algorithms were ultimately integrated into a Flash
   Track toolkit. In a validation exercise, representatives from 13
   completed Flash Track projects used the toolkit with reference to their
   projects. Project representatives' retrospective self-assessment of
   readiness to perform the projects on a Flash Track basis were moderately
   to strongly correlated (r=0.76) with their readiness assessment
   forecasted by this research's algorithms. This research provides the
   first quantitative measurement suitable to assess an organization's
   readiness to undertake the unique challenges of a Flash Track project.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality is an important aspect of health assessment of rivers,
   lakes, and estuaries, which requires systematic data collection from
   various components of the aquatic environment. The analysis of this data
   is used to judge the health state of these environments. It is well
   known that long-term surveillance of surface waters is costly. Thus,
   sound strategies are necessary to select the best locations of
   monitoring stations to collect the most reliable data efficiently to
   improve the performance of a monitoring system. This can be accomplished
   by optimizing the location of monitoring stations with respect to the
   hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of the surface water system.
   It is expected that such an approach may improve the effectiveness and
   also reduce the overall cost of the monitoring system. Since the
   hydrodynamics and the contaminant migration pathways in surface waters
   are complex, the optimal solution of this problem is also complex. To
   analyze this problem, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation model is
   developed using the finite-element method. The best monitoring locations
   are selected that minimize the detection time of the potential
   contaminant presence in the surface water body and maximizes the
   reliability of the system performance. Due to the nonlinear nature of
   the hydrodynamics, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for the solution of
   the optimization problem. Examples are provided for wind-driven
   hydraulic circulation for a circular lake, and tidal and wind-driven
   circulation in a natural tidal estuary. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {{Digital reconstruction of a complex heterogeneous media from the limited
   statistical information, mostly provided by different imaging
   techniques, is the key to the successful computational analysis of this
   important class of materials. In this study, a novel approach is
   presented for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of a three-phase
   microstructure from its statistical information provided by
   two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections. In this three-step method, first
   two-point correlation functions (TPCFs) are extracted from the
   cross-section(s) using a spectral method suitable for the three-phase
   media. In the next step, 3D TPCFs are approximated for all vectors in a
   representative volume element (RVE). Finally, the 3D microstructure is
   realized from the full-set TPCFs obtained in the previous step, using a
   modified phase-recovery algorithm. The method is generally applicable to
   any complex three-phase media, here illustrated for an SOFC anode
   microstructure. The capabilities and shortcomings of the method are then
   investigated by performing a qualitative comparison between example
   cross-sections obtained computationally and their experimental
   equivalents. Finally, it is shown that the method almost conserves key
   microstructural properties of the media including tortuosity,
   percolation and three-phase boundary length (TPBL).
   Lay description There are some situations where three-dimensional (3D)
   information of the heterogeneous media (such as composites) is not
   existed. So analysis of the various properties of the media (such as
   mechanical and thermal) are impossible. The proposed method in this
   paper is capable of reconstruction the 3D media based on two-dimensional
   images using some mathematical relations. This method uses one
   cut-section for isotropic media and two for anisotropic one. The
   capabilities of the proposed method is demonstrated by calculation of
   the reconstructed media properties and comparison of the attained values
   with the original one.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Betavoltaic energy converters (i.e., beta-batteries) are attractive
   power sources because of their potential for high energy densities (>200
   MWh/kg) and long duration continuous discharge (>1 year). However,
   conversion efficiencies have been historically low (<3\%). High
   efficiency devices can be achieved by matching beta-radiation transport
   length scales with the device physics length scales. In this work, the
   efficiency of c-Si devices using high-energy (>1 MeV) electrons emitted
   from Sr-90 as a power source is investigated. We propose a design for a
   >10\% efficient betavoltaic device, which generates 1 W of power. A
   Varian Clinac iX is used to simulate the high-energy electrons emitted
   from Sr-90, and a high efficiency c-Si photovoltaic cell is used as the
   converter. The measured conversion efficiency is 16\%. This relatively
   high value is attributed to proper length scale matching and the
   generation of secondary electrons in c-Si by the primary a-particles.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{The eastern coastal areas of China have high-density population,
   developed society and economy, and large water pollution emissions. How
   to reduce water pollution and realize the coordinated development of the
   economy and environment has become the national focus. Effective
   environmental policies should consider regional differences in
   development stage and sustainability performance. Here, we first
   analyzed the water pollution emissions intensity of the eastern coastal
   areas of China and the urgency of emissions reduction using 8-year
   environmental statistics from 2003 to 2010. We characterized development
   stages of the eastern coastal areas based on the relationships between
   water pollution emissions intensity and economic development. Further,
   we built a coordination degree index of economic development and water
   environment protection as a measure of sustainability. Results show that
   water pollution emissions intensity decreases as the economy grows from
   2003 to 2010. The less-developed regions have a better coordination
   degree than some more-developed regions, especially those most-developed
   ones (e.g., Shanghai show more pressures on long-term sustainability
   than Hebei). The less-developed regions should take advantage of
   economic growth to invest more advanced environment protection
   technologies. The more-developed regions need to upgrade its economic
   structures and municipal infrastructures. Overall, the study provided a
   comprehensive approach to understand regional difference in development
   stage and sustainability performance in the eastern coastal region of
   China as well as the need of different environmental policies to reduce
   water pollution emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The growth of voids has a great impact on the mechanical properties of
   ductile materials by altering their microstructures. Exploring the
   process of void growth at the nanoscale helps in understanding the
   dynamic fracture of metals. While some very recent studies looked into
   the effects of the initial geometry of an elliptic void on the plastic
   deformation of face-centered cubic metals, a systematic study of the
   initial void ellipticity and orientation angle in body-centered cubic
   (BCC) metals is still lacking. In this paper, large scale molecular
   dynamics simulations with millions of atoms are conducted, investigating
   the void growth process during tensile loading of metallic thin films in
   BCC alpha-Fe. Our simulations elucidate the intertwined influences on
   void growth of the initial ellipticity and initial orientation angle of
   the void. It is shown that these two geometric parameters play an
   important role in the stress-strain response, the nucleation and
   evolution of defects, as well as the void size/outline evolution in
   alpha-Fe thin films. Results suggest that, together with void size,
   different initial void geometries should be taken into account if a
   continuum model is to be applied to nanoscale damage progression.}},

Abstract = {{Nitroaromatic compounds are typically toxic and resistant to
   degradation. Bradyrhizobium species strain JS329 metabolizes
   5-nitroanthranilic acid (5NAA), which is a molecule secreted by
   Streptomyces scabies, the plant pathogen responsible for potato scab.
   The first biodegradation enzyme is 5NAA-aminohydrolase (5NAA-A), a
   metalloprotease family member that converts 5NAA to 5-nitrosalicylic
   acid. We characterized 5NAA-A biochemically and obtained snapshots of
   its mechanism. 5NAA-A, an octamer that can use several divalent
   transition metals for catalysis in vitro, employs a nucleophilic
   aromatic substitution mechanism. Unexpectedly, the metal in 5NAA-A is
   labile but is readily loaded in the presence of substrate. 5NAA-A is
   specific for 5NAA and cannot hydrolyze other tested derivatives, which
   are likewise poor inhibitors. The 5NAA-A structure and mechanism expand
   our understanding of the chemical ecology of an agriculturally important
   plant and pathogen, and will inform bioremediation and biocatalytic
   approaches to mitigate the environmental and ecological impact of
   nitroanilines and other challenging substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70), a member of
   the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) family, plays an essential role in
   early T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Defects in ZAP-70 lead to
   impaired thymocyte development and peripheral T cell activation. To
   better understand its activation dynamics and regulation, we visualized
   ZAP-70 activities in single live T cells with a Forster resonance energy
   transfer (FRET)aEurobased biosensor, which was designed for probing
   kinase activities of the Syk family. We observed in Jurkat E6.1 T cells
   rapid and specific FRET changes following anti-CD3 stimulation and
   subsequent piceatannol inhibition. The initiation of ZAP-70 activation
   was prompt (within 10 s) and correlates with the accompanied
   intracellular calcium elevation, as revealed by simultaneous imaging of
   the biosensor and calcium. Different from the previously reported ZAP-70
   activation in the immunological synapse and the opposite pole
   (anti-synapse), we have observed rapid and sustained ZAP-70 activation
   only at the synapse with superantigen-pulsed Raji B cells. Furthermore,
   ZAP-70 signaling was impaired by cholesterol depletion, further
   supporting the importance of membrane organization in TCR signaling.
   Together our results provide a direct characterization of the
   spatiotemporal features of ZAP-70 activity in real time at subcellular
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Self-powered ZnO/perovskite heterostructured ultraviolet (UV)
   photodetectors (PDs) based on the pyro-phototronic effect have been
   recently reported as a promising solution for energy-efficient,
   ultrafast-response, and high-performance UV PDs. In this study, the
   temperature dependence of the pyro-phototronic effect on the
   photo-sensing performance of self-powered ZnO/perovskite
   heterostructured PDs was investigated. The current responses of these
   PDs to UV light were enhanced by 174.1\% at 77 K and 28.7\% at 300 K
   owing to the improved pyro-phototronic effect at low temperatures. The
   fundamentals of the pyro-phototronic effect were thoroughly studied by
   analyzing the chargetransfer process and the time constant of the
   current response of the PDs upon UV illumination. This work presents
   in-depth understandings about the pyrophototronic effect on the
   ZnO/perovskite heterostructure and provides guidance for the design and
   development of corresponding optoelectronics for ultrafast photo
   sensing, optothermal detection, and biocompatible optoelectronic probes.}},

   transfer for energy harvesting}},
Journal = {{NANO RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The process of charge transfer based on triboelectrification (TE) and
   contact electrification (CE) has been recently utilized as the basis for
   a new and promising energy harvesting technology, i.e., triboelectric
   nanogenerators, as well as selfpowered sensors and systems. The
   electrostatic charge transfer between two surfaces can occur in both the
   TE and the CE modes depending on the involvement of relative sliding
   friction. Does the sliding behavior in TE induce any fundamental
   difference in the charge transfer from the CE? Few studies are available
   on this comparison because of the challenges in ruling out the effect of
   the contact area using traditional macro-scale characterization methods.
   This paper provides the first study on the fundamental differences in CE
   and TE at the nanoscale based on scanning probe microscopic methods. A
   quantitative comparison of the two processes at equivalent contact time
   and force is provided, and the results suggest that the charge transfer
   from TE is much faster than that from CE, but the saturation value of
   the transferred charge density is the same. The measured frictional
   energy dissipation of similar to 11 eV when the tip scans over distance
   of 1 sheds light on a potential mechanism: The friction may facilitate
   the charge transfer process via electronic excitation. These results
   provide fundamental guidance for the selection of materials and device
   structures to enable the TE or the CE in different applications; the CE
   mode is favorable for frequent moderate contact such as vibration energy
   harvesting and the TE mode is favorable for instant movement such as
   harvesting of energy from human walking.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter ( MMC) has become one of the most
   promising topologies for high-voltage applications. Although the MMC has
   a modular and redundant structure, which can significantly enhance its
   reliability and fault tolerance, its fault handling capability can be
   further improved by adopting a postfault strategy. In this paper, a
   postfault strategy based on the neutral-shift method is proposed, which,
   subsequent to bypassing the faulty submodule( s), aims at improving the
   maximum attainable line-to-line voltages of the MMC. Based on a newly
   developed internal variable analysis method, the impact of the
   neutral-shift strategy on the operation of the MMC is analyzed. In
   conjunction with the proposed postfault strategy, a modified circulating
   current suppression ( CCS) method is used to mitigate the
   double-frequency component of the circulating currents. Performance and
   effectiveness of the proposed neutral-shift strategy with and without
   the CCS method is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in
   the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.}},

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The pooling problem is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem with
   numerous applications. The nonlinearities of the problem arise from
   bilinear constraints that capture the blending of raw materials.
   Bilinear constraints are well-studied and significant progress has been
   made in solving large instances of the pooling problem to global
   optimality. This is due in no small part to reformulations of the
   problem. Recently, Alfaki and Haugland proposed a multi-commodity flow
   formulation of the pooling problem based on input commodities. The
   authors proved that the new formulation has a stronger linear relaxation
   than previously known formulations. They also provided computational
   results which show that the new formulation outperforms previously known
   formulations when used in a global optimization solver. In this paper,
   we generalize their ideas and propose new multi-commodity flow
   formulations based on output, input and output and (input,
   output)-commodities. We prove the equivalence of formulations, and we
   study the partial order of formulations with respect to the strength of
   their LP relaxations. In an extensive computational study, we evaluate
   the performance of the new formulations. We study the trade-off between
   disaggregating commodities and therefore increasing the size of
   formulations versus strengthening the relaxed linear programs and
   improving the computational performance of the nonlinear programs. We
   provide computational results which show that output commodities often
   outperform input commodities, and that disaggregating commodities
   further only marginally strengthens the linear relaxations. In fact,
   smaller formulations often show a significantly better performance when
   used in a global optimization solver.}},

Abstract = {{Part I of this paper (Zhang and Shi, 2015, ``Stream of Variation
   Modeling and Analysis for Compliant Composite Part Assembly-Part I:
   Single-Station Processes,{''}ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng.,) has studied the
   variation modeling and analysis of compliant composite part assembly in
   a single-station process. In practice, multiple assembly stations are
   involved in assembling the final product. This paper aims to develop a
   variation propagation model for stream of variation analysis in a
   multistation assembly process for composite parts. This model takes into
   account major variation factors, including part manufacturing error
   (PME), fixture position error (FPE), and relocation-induced error (RIE).
   With the help of a finite element method (FEM), a state space model
   (SSM) is established to represent the relationships between the sources
   of variation and the final assembly variation. The developed methodology
   is illustrated by using a case study of three composite laminated plates
   assembled in a two-station assembly system. The validity of the
   developed SSM is verified by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), which is
   implemented on the basis of FEM. The SSM provides a potential
   application for diagnosis of variation sources and variation reduction.}},

   (Mallick, 1993, Fiber-Reinforced Composites: Materials, Manufacturing,
   and Design, Marcel Dekker, New York). However, the lack of methodologies
   for variation modeling and analysis of composite part assembly has
   imposed a significant constraint on developing dimensional control for
   composite assembly processes. This paper develops a modeling method to
   predict assembly deviation for compliant composite parts in a
   single-station assembly process. The approach is discussed in two steps:
   considering the part manufacturing error (PME) only and considering both
   the PME and the fixture position error (FPE). Finite element method
   (FEM) and homogenous coordinate transformation are used to reveal the
   impact of the PME and the FPE. The validity of the method is verified
   with two case studies on assembly deviation prediction of two composite
   laminated plates considering the PME only and both the PME and the FPE,
   respectively. The proposed method provides the basis for assembly
   deviation prediction in the multistation composite assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium difficile has emerged as a major cause of infectious
   diarrhea in hospitalized patients, with increasing mortality rate and
   annual healthcare costs exceeding \$3 billion. Since C. difficile
   infections are associated with the use of antibiotics, there is an
   urgent need to develop treatments that can inactivate the bacterium
   selectively without affecting commensal microflora. Lytic enzymes from
   bacteria and bacteriophages show promise as highly selective and
   effective antimicrobial agents. These enzymes often have a modular
   structure, consisting of a catalytic domain and a binding domain. In the
   current work, using consensus catalytic domain and cell-wall binding
   domain sequences as probes, we analyzed in silico the genome of C.
   difficile, as well as phages infecting C. difficile. We identified two
   genes encoding cell lytic enzymes with possible activity against C.
   difficile. We cloned the genes in a suitable expression vector,
   expressed and purified the protein products, and tested enzyme activity
   in vitro. These newly identified enzymes were found to be active against
   C. difficile cells in a dose-dependent manner. We achieved a more than
   4-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria within 5h of
   application. Moreover, we found that the enzymes were active against a
   wide range of C. difficile clinical isolates. We also characterized the
   biocatalytic mechanism by identifying the specific bonds cleaved by
   these enzymes within the cell wall peptidoglycan. These results suggest
   a new approach to combating the growing healthcare problem associated
   with C. difficile infections. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 2568-2576.

Abstract = {{Buckling analysis of axially-compressed functionally graded carbon
   nanotube-reinforced composite (FGCNTRC) conical panels is presented
   employing the variational differential quadrature (VDQ) method. The
   material properties of nanocomposite conical panel are assumed to be
   graded along the thickness direction and are estimated through the
   micromechanical model. To present the energy functional of the
   structure, the first-order shear deformation theory is utilized.
   Applying the generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method in axial
   and circumferential directions, the discretized form of energy
   functional is obtained. Then, based on Hamilton's principle and matrix
   relations, the reduced form of stiffness matrices is derived. A
   comparison between the obtained results and those given in the
   literature shows the accuracy of the present approach. Numerical results
   indicate that volume fractions and distribution patterns of CNTs have
   significant effects on the buckling load of FG-CNTRC conical panels. (C)

Abstract = {{Microstructured implant surfaces created by grit blasting and acid
   etching titanium (Ti) support osseointegration. This effect is further
   enhanced by storing in aqueous solution to retain hydrophilicity, but
   this also leads to surface nanostructure formation. The purpose of this
   study was to assess the contributions of nanostructures on the improved
   osteogenic response of osteoblast lineage cells to hydrophilic
   microstructured Ti. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and normal human
   osteoblasts (NHOsts) were cultured separately on
   non-nanostructured/hydrophobic (SLA), nanostructured/hydrophilic
   (modSLA), or nanostructured/hydrophobic (SLAnano) Ti surfaces. XPS
   showed elevated carbon levels on SLA and SLAnano compared to modSLA.
   Contact angle measurements indicated only modSLA was hydrophilic.
   Confocal laser microscopy revealed minor differences in mean surface
   roughness. SEM showed the presence of nanostructures on modSLA and
   SLAnano. MSCs and NHOst cells exhibited similar morphology on the
   substrates and osteoblastic differentiation and maturation were greatest
   on modSLA. These results suggest that when the appropriate
   microstructure is present, hydrophilicity may play a greater role in
   stimulating MSC and NHOst osteoblastic differentiation and maturation
   than the presence of nanostructures generated during storage in an
   aqueous environment. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

   consider quasi-static deformations of the ambient space and show that a
   quasi-static deformation of the ambient space results in stresses, in

Abstract = {{An X-band power amplifier (PA) implemented in a silicon-germanium (SiGe)
   heterojunction bipolar transistor technology is presented. The SiGe PA
   was designed for inverse class-F mode using thin-film microstrip (TFMS)
   lines, eliminating the use of conventional band-limiting lumped
   inductors and transformers. Thus, simultaneous high efficiency and
   minimized in-band variation were achieved for X-band (8-12 GHz)
   applications. In addition, for boosting peak output power (P-out), the
   common-base transistor in the PA core was designed to operate in a weak
   avalanche region, which allowed dynamic collector-to-base voltage to
   swing beyond the collector-base breakdown voltage with open emitter
   without performance degradation. The fabricated SiGe PA demonstrates a
   high power-added efficiency (PAE) of 43.2\% and a peak P-out of 24.3 dBm
   at 10 GHz. Benefitting from the utilization of TFMS lines, the PA
   exhibits a flat response for both PAE (33.3-44\%) and peak P-out
   (23.1-24.5 dBm) for the entire X-band frequency range. (c) 2016 Wiley

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Microscale surface roughness has been shown to enhance osseointegration
   of titanium implants through increased osteoblast differentiation while
   osteoblast proliferation remains greater on smooth titanium. Taking
   advantage of these phenomena, we developed a shape memory (meth)acrylate
   copolymer with thermomechanical properties that created a time-dependent
   dynamic surface change from smooth to rough under in vitro cell culture
   conditions and evaluated the effect of the shape recovery on osteoblast
   response. Rough topographies were created using soft lithography
   techniques to mimic those found on clinically-used Ti surfaces (machined
   smooth; acid-etched; grit-blasted). The surface roughness was then
   reduced to smooth via compression and shown to fully recover within 24 h
   in culture conditions. When grown under static conditions, osteoblast
   number, alkaline phosphatase specific activity (ALP), and
   osteoprotegerin (OPG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   production were unaffected by polymer surface roughness, but osteocalcin
   (OCN) was increased on the grit-blasted polymer mimic. Under dynamic
   conditions, DNA was reduced but OCN and OPG were increased on the
   compressed grit blasted polymer at 3 days compared to static surfaces.
   The present study indicates that responses to polymer surface are
   sensitive to time-dependent changes in topography. The use of a shape
   memory polymer with dynamic surface roughness may improve
   osseointegration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two-phase Taylor flow pattern has been studied extensively. However,
   limited information is available for flows in intermediate diameter
   channels (5 less than or similar to Bo less than or similar to 40, or 6
   mm less than or similar to D less than or similar to 27 mm for ambient
   gas water flows), as found in air-lift and bubble pumps. Previous
   investigations have primarily evaluated Taylor flow models in terms of
   overall pressure drop, which incorporates hydrostatic and multiple
   hydrodynamic components. Thus, individual sub-models and sources of
   error could not be directly assessed. In this investigation,
   volume-of-fluid (VOF) based Taylor flow simulations are performed over a
   wide range of laminar and turbulent conditions in the intermediate Bond
   number regime (5 < Bo < 20, 250 < N-f < 1000, and 20 < Re-j < 8100).
   Results are applied to individually evaluate hydrodynamic sub models for
   bubble-region frictional pressure drop gradient (del p(f,b)), slug
   frictional pressure drop gradient (del p(f,b)), and flow transition
   pressure loss (Delta p(trans)). Based on these results, recommendations
   are provided for selection of hydrodynamic sub-models. These
   hydrodynamic closure models are integrated with kinematic flow models to
   yield a complete intermediate Bond number Taylor flow formulation for
   which all submodels were independently validated. The resulting model
   achieves improved accuracy for predicting experimental liquid flow rates
   compared with previous Taylor flow models (81\% of cases within 50\% of
   measured flows rates). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Embedded single phase microfluidic thermal management for non-uniform
   heating and hotspots using microgaps with variable pin fin clustering}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{1359-1370}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The presence of variable heat fluxes, such as localized hotspots in
   integrated circuit (IC) architectures poses a key challenge for thermal
   management of existing (2D) and emerging three-dimensionally (3D)
   stacked chips. The use of conventional microchannel or uniform pin fin
   arrays for microfluidic cooling do not provide adequate surface area for
   heat transfer in the vicinity of regions of concentrated high power
   (hotspots), and therefore significant temperature gradients might arise
   in such zones. In the present investigation, the concept of using a
   single microfluidic loop for the combined and efficient cooling of
   hotspot and moderate power (background) areas is proposed,
   experimentally demonstrated, and supported by a comprehensive numerical
   model. Two different thermal device vehicles (TDVs) are considered for a
   range of operating conditions, in which the surface area is locally
   increased by clustering a dense array of pin fins in the hotspot region
   for one configuration, while for the other the clustering is uniform in
   the spanwise direction. De-ionized (DI) water is used as the coolant
   through a silicon (Si) microgap with 200 tm spacing; the hotspot heat
   flux is varied from 250 to 750 W/cm(2), while the background heat flux
   is fixed at 250 W/cm2. Results indicate the capability of the proposed
   designs to keep the maximum temperature of the combined device below 65
   degrees C for an inlet water temperature of 21.3 degrees C, with
   moderate temperature gradients and pressure drop. In addition, a robust
   computational fluid dynamics/heat transfer (CFD-HT) model capable of
   predicting spatially resolved temperature fields arising from
   heterogeneous heating is validated with relevant experimental data.
   Detailed benchmark simulations are provided, so they can be reproduced
   and used for reference in numerical studies with variable pin fin
   densities. The described methodology represents a cost-effective thermal
   modeling technique that may be applicable to virtually any type of heat
   flux distribution or power map, and IC architecture. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{236}},
Pages = {{284-291}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{From pure experimental isotherms and ideal adsorbed solution theory
   (IAST), we confirmed a recent report that Co-MOF-74 provides the highest
   Xe uptake as well as the highest Xe/Kr selectivity among the three
   M-MOF-74 series (M = Co, Mg, and Zn). From breakthrough experiments, we
   then showed the first demonstration of the potential of Co-MOF-74 for
   Xe/Kr separations under mixture flow conditions. Remarkably, the
   experimental breakthrough curves for three consecutive cycles' are
   essentially unchanged even if the column was regenerated under helium
   flows at room temperature between each cycle. Isosteric heat of
   adsorption (Q(st)) for Xe, adsorbed Xe molecules per metal, and binding
   strengths and electronic density of states (DOS) analyses from first
   principles calculations all indicate that unsaturated Co2+ sites attract
   Xe more strongly than do unsaturated Mg2+ and Zn2+ sites. The DOS
   analyses show that the d orbital of the Co2+ is the main contributors
   for the strong interaction. These results suggest that Co-MOF-74 is a
   promising adsorbent for separations of Xe and Kr. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we measured and analyzed glass interposer power
   distribution network (PDN) resonance effects on a high-speed through
   glass via (TGV) channel for the first time. To verify the glass
   interposer PDN resonance effects on the TGV channel, glass interposer
   test vehicles were fabricated. With these test vehicles, glass
   interposer PDN impedance, channel loss, far-end crosstalk, and eye
   diagram are measured. Based on these measurements, glass interposer PDN
   resonance effects on the signal integrity of the high-speed TGV channel
   are analyzed. Due to low loss of the glass substrate, sharp high PDN
   impedance peaks are generated at the resonance frequencies. High PDN
   impedance peaks at the PDN resonance frequencies, which affect return
   current of the TGV channel, increase channel loss, crosstalks, and PDN
   noise coupling in the frequency domain and degrade eye diagram in the
   time domain. To suppress these glass interposer PDN resonance effects, a
   ground shielded-TGV scheme is proposed. The proposed ground shielded-TGV
   scheme includes two ground TGVs 200 mu m away from the signal TGV
   considering the design rules and includes package ground underneath the
   glass interposer. Effectiveness of the suggested grounding scheme on the
   resonance effects suppression is verified with three-dimensional
   electromagnetic simulation. The proposed shielded-TGV design
   successfully suppressed the glass interposer PDN resonance effects that
   results in the suppression of insertion loss, shielding of the
   crosstalk, and improvement of the eye diagram of the high-speed TGV
   channel.}},

   of the major obstacles to widespread use of BNs for system reliability
   assessment, namely the exponentially increasing amount of information

   increases. The proposed compression and inference algorithms are
   described and applied to example systems to investigate their

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, several extensive laboratory studies have been
   conducted of the microwave opacity of ammonia and water vapor in
   preparation for interpretation of the precise measurements of jovian
   microwave emission to be made with the Microwave Radiometer (MWR)
   instrument aboard the NASA Juno Mission. (See, e.g., Hanley et al.
   {[}2009] Icarus, 202, 316-335; Karpowicz and Steffes {[}2011a] Icarus
   212, 210-223; Karpowicz and Steffes 12011b] Icarus 214, 783; Devaraj et
   al. {[}2014] Icarus, 241, 165-179) These works included models for the
   opacity of these constituents valid over the pressure and temperature
   ranges measured in the laboratory experiments (temperatures up to 500 K
   and pressures up to 100 bars). However, studies of the microwave
   emission made using these models indicate that significant contributions
   to the emission at the 24-cm and 50-cm wavelengths to be measured by the
   Juno MWR will be made by layers of the atmosphere with temperatures at
   or exceeding 600 K. While the ammonia opacity models described by Hanley
   et al. (2009) and Devraj et al. (2014) give consistent results at
   temperatures up to 500 K (within 6\%), they diverge significantly at
   temperatures and pressures exceeding 550 K and 50 bars, respectively.
   Similarly, at temperatures above 500 K, the model for water vapor
   opacity developed by Karpowicz and Steffes (2011a,b) exhibits
   non-physical attributes. To resolve these ambiguities, we have conducted
   laboratory measurements of the microwave opacity of ammonia at
   temperatures up to 600 K and that for water vapor at temperatures up to
   600 K. Additionally, since the microwave opacity of ammonia is
   influenced by pressure-broadening from methane (a significant
   constituent in jovian atmospheres), measurements of the effects of
   methane on the ammonia absorption spectrum have also been conducted.
   These measurements have resulted in updated models for the opacities of
   ammonia and water vapor under conditions of the deep jovian atmosphere.

   enable a reduction in CdS thickness while maintaining near-maximum
   device voltage and fill factor. SnO2- and ZnO-based alloys were tested
   as HRT layers on a fluorine-doped tin oxide transparent conducting
   oxide. SnO2-based alloy HRT layers were deposited via atmospheric
   pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). Alloying ZnO with MgO to
   create Mg5Zn1-xO) (MZO) via radio-frequency sputter deposition Was
   explored as a way to reduce the electron affinity of ZnO HRT layers. To
   fully understand the behavior of these materials, many devices were
   fabricated with either no CdS layer, a sublimated CdS layer, or a
   sputtered, oxygenated CdS layer. MZO layers resulted in high
   open-circuit voltage and device efficiency even with the complete
   elimination of the CdS layer. In both HRT systems, controlling electron
   affinity to optimize front contact band alignment is an important
   consideration. Band measurements using photoelectron spectroscopy and
   synchrotron techniques correlate band alignment measurements with
   efficiency parameters in the design of HRT and CdS layers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A variety of massive datasets, such as social networks and biological
   data, are represented as graphs that reveal underlying connections,
   trends, and anomalies. Community detection is the task of discovering
   dense groups of vertices in a graph. Its one specific form is seed set
   expansion, which finds the best local community for a given set of seed
   vertices. Greedy, agglomerative algorithms, which are commonly used in
   seed set expansion, have been previously designed only for a static,
   unchanging graph. However, in many applications, new data are constantly
   produced, and vertices and edges are inserted and removed from a graph.
   We present an algorithm for dynamic seed set expansion, which maintains
   a local community over time by incrementally updating as the underlying
   graph changes. We show that our dynamic algorithm outputs high-quality
   communities that are similar to those found when using a standard static
   algorithm. It works well both when beginning with an already existing
   graph and in the fully streaming case when starting with no data. The
   dynamic approach is also faster than re-computation when low latency
   updates are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to introduce a new linear time-frequency
   transform to improve the detection of fault components in electric
   machines transient currents. Linear transforms are analysed from the
   perspective of the atoms used. A criterion to select the atoms at every
   point of the time-frequency plane is proposed, taking into account the
   characteristics of the searched component at each point. This criterion
   leads to the definition of the Adaptive Slope Transform, which enables a
   complete and optimal capture of the different components evolutions in a
   transient current. A comparison with conventional linear transforms
   (Short-Time Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform) is carried out,
   showing their inherent limitations. The approach is tested with
   laboratory and field motors, and the Lower Sideband Harmonic is captured
   for the first time during an induction motor startup and subsequent load
   oscillations, accurately tracking its evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for
   nonpreemptive single machine scheduling problems is presented. The model
   is a generalisation of the classical time indexed (TI) model to one in
   which at most two jobs can be processing in each time period. Like the
   TI model, the new model, called the bucket indexed (BI) model,
   partitions the planning horizon into periods of equal length, or
   buckets. Unlike the TI model, the length of a period is a parameter of
   the BI model and can be chosen to be as long as the processing time of
   the shortest job. The two models are equivalent if a period is of unit
   length, but when longer periods are used in the BI model, it can have
   significantly fewer variables and nonzeros than the corresponding TI
   model. A computational study using weighted tardiness instances, and
   weighted completion time instances with release dates, reveals that the
   BI model significantly outperforms the TI model on instances where the
   minimum processing time of the jobs is large. Furthermore, the
   performance of the BI model is less vulnerable to increases in average
   processing time when the ratio of the largest processing time to the
   smallest is held constant.}},

Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Phonon-surface scattering is the fundamental mechanism behind thermal
   transport phenomena at the nanoscale. Despite its significance, typical
   approaches to describe the interaction of phonons with surfaces do not
   consider all relevant physical quantities involved in the phonon-surface
   interaction, namely, phonon momentum, incident angle, surface roughness,
   and correlation length. Here, we predict thermal conduction properties
   of thin films by considering an accurate description of phonon-surface
   scattering effects based on the rigorous Beckmann-Kirchhoff scattering
   theory extended with surface shadowing. We utilize a Boltzmann transport
   based reduced mean-free-path model for phonon transport in thin-films to
   predict the wavelength and mean-free-path heat spectra in Si and SiGe
   films for different surface conditions and show how the thermal energy
   distribution can be tailored by the surface properties. Using the
   predicted wavelength spectra, we also introduce a measure to quantify
   phonon-confinement effects and show an enhanced confinement in Ge
   alloyed Si thin films. The impact of surface roughness and correlation
   lengths on thermal conductivities is also studied, and our numerical
   predictions show excellent agreement with experimental measurements. The
   results allow to elucidate and quantitatively predict the amount of
   thermal energy carried by different phonons at the nanoscale, which can
   be used to design improved optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.

Abstract = {{The standard approach to the analysis of genome-wide association studies
   (GWAS) is based on testing each position in the genome individually for
   statistical significance of its association with the phenotype under
   investigation. To improve the analysis of GWAS, we propose a combination
   of machine learning and statistical testing that takes correlation
   structures within the set of SNPs under investigation in a
   mathematically well-controlled manner into account. The novel two-step
   algorithm, COMBI, first trains a support vector machine to determine a
   subset of candidate SNPs and then performs hypothesis tests for these
   SNPs together with an adequate threshold correction. Applying COMBI to
   data from a WTCCC study (2007) and measuring performance as replication
   by independent GWAS published within the 2008-2015 period, we show that
   our method outperforms ordinary raw p-value thresholding as well as
   other state-of-the-art methods. COMBI presents higher power and
   precision than the examined alternatives while yielding fewer false
   (i.e. non-replicated) and more true (i.e. replicated) discoveries when
   its results are validated on later GWAS studies. More than 80\% of the
   discoveries made by COMBI upon WTCCC data have been validated by
   independent studies. Implementations of the COMBI method are available
   as a part of the GWASpi toolbox 2.0.}},

Abstract = {{A stable suspension has been obtained by disbursing Mn1.5Co1.5O4 (MCO)
   particles (100-300 nm in diameter) in ethanol using a ball milling
   process. The suspension is used for deposition of a uniform MCO coating
   (5-8 mu m thick) on a steel (T441) substrate preheated to 200 degrees C
   by aerosol spraying. It is found that the grain size of spinel crystals
   in the MCO coatings ranges from 100 nm to 1 Am, and remains uniform and
   stable when exposed to air at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. However, a
   Cr-rich oxide scale of approximately 0.75 mu m thick appears between the
   MCO coating and the T441 substrate during the exposure. In contrast, a
   bare T441 sample (without the MCO coating) is oxidized significantly
   more under the same exposure, forming an oxide scale of 4 mu m thick.
   The result indicates that the spinel coating had effectively improved
   the oxidation resistance of T441 by inhibiting the transport of Cr.
   Besides, the results also suggest that aerosol spraying is a simple and
   cost-effective method for deposition of thin and dense protective
   coating. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Discovering mechanistic insights from phenotypic information is critical
   for the understanding of biological processes. For model organisms,
   unlike in cell culture, this is currently bottlenecked by the
   non-quantitative nature and perceptive biases of human observations, and
   the limited number of reporters that can be simultaneously incorporated
   in live animals. An additional challenge is that isogenic populations
   exhibit significant phenotypic heterogeneity. These difficulties limit
   genetic approaches to many biological questions. To overcome these
   bottlenecks, we developed tools to extract complex phenotypic traits
   from images of fluorescently labelled subcellular landmarks, using C.
   elegans synapses as a test case. By population-wide comparisons, we
   identified subtle but relevant differences inaccessible to subjective
   conceptualization. Furthermore, the models generated testable hypotheses
   of how individual alleles relate to known mechanisms or belong to new
   pathways. We show that our model not only recapitulates current
   knowledge in synaptic patterning but also identifies novel alleles
   overlooked by traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{A tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals take actions to
   maximize their payoffs even as their combined payoff is less than the
   global maximum had the players coordinated. The originating example is
   that of overgrazing of common pasture lands. In game-theoretic
   treatments of this example, there is rarely consideration of how
   individual behavior subsequently modifies the commons and associated
   payoffs. Here, we generalize evolutionary game theory by proposing a
   class of replicator dynamics with feedback-evolving games in which
   environment-dependent payoffs and strategies coevolve. We initially
   apply our formulation to a system in which the payoffs favor unilateral
   defection and cooperation, given replete and depleted environments,
   respectively. Using this approach, we identify and characterize a class
   of dynamics: an oscillatory tragedy of the commons in which the system
   cycles between deplete and replete environmental states and cooperation
   and defection behavior states. We generalize the approach to consider
   outcomes given all possible rational choices of individual behavior in
   the depleted state when defection is favored in the replete state. In so
   doing, we find that incentivizing cooperation when others defect in the
   depleted state is necessary to avert the tragedy of the commons. In
   closing, we propose directions for the study of control and influence in
   games in which individual actions exert a substantive effect on the
   environmental state.}},

Abstract = {{The design of high bandgap electrochromic polymers (ECPs) that switch
   from a high energy absorbing colored state to a near-IR absorbing
   colorless state requires a challenging balance to be struck between
   achieving large changes in the absorption profile while maintaining
   sufficiently low oxidation potentials for use in full-color
   electrochromic devices. Previous studies on high bandgap ECPs have
   investigated structure- property relationships in dioxythiophenes
   copolymerized with various arylenes. Here, we expand this understanding
   by looking more closely at the effect of the dioxythiophene moiety as
   well as by varying the substituents on the arylene moiety. Three ECPs
   have been synthesized to perform this study with repeat units composed
   of electron-rich dimethoxyphenylene in alternation with dimers of
   3,4-dialkoxy- and 3,4-propylenedioxythiophenes, yielding high gap
   polymers that are vibrant yellow or orange in the charge neutral state.
   Comparing these newly synthesized polymers to a structurally similar set
   previously reported, we elucidate the subtle steric and electronic
   effects that govern bandgap and redox properties in dioxythiophene
   copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrated the assembly of amphiphilic hyperbranched protic ionic
   liquids (HBP-ILs) based on aliphatic hyperbranched polyester (HBP) in
   aqueous media in a wide range of pH and ionic conditions. The series of
   new branched polyionic liquids with different terminal groups, HBP-ILs,
   was synthesized by neutralization, of carboxylic and sulfonic terminal
   acid groups of hypebranched core with N-methylimidazole (Im) and
   1,2,4-1H-triazole (Tr). HBP-IL compounds with triazole and imidazole
   counterions form 12-16 nm core-corona micelles at pH 11.6. We found that
   the introduction of long hydrophobic terminal groups such as
   n-octadecylurethane tails to initial hydrophobic HBP core has larger
   effect on the size of micellar assemblies than the introduction of ionic
   terminals groups. Furthermore, tuning the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
   balance of HBP-ILs can be achieved by changing the degree of ionization
   of terminal groups and counterions by reducing pH from 11.6 to 5.2 or
   ionic strength to 0.1 M. These changes caused the formation of much
   larger micellar aggregates with the size of 150-200 nm due to reduced
   ionization of carboxylic groups. At the same time, for
   sulfonate-containing HBP-ILs the micelle size increased modestly (to
   25-40 nm) because of the higher degree of ionization of sulfonate
   terminal groups. The diverse aggregation behavior of these branched
   polymeric ionic liquids enables control over their micellar morphologies
   in solution and bulk states.}},

Abstract = {{Decorating 1D nanostructures (e.g., wires and tubes) with metal
   nanoparticles serves as a hierarchical approach to integrate the
   functionalities of metal oxides, semiconductors, and metals. This paper
   examines a simple and low-temperature approach to self-assembling gold
   nanoparticles (Au-np)-a common catalytic material-onto silicon nanowires
   (SiNWs). A conformal ultra-thin film (i.e., <15nm thick) is deposited
   onto SiNWs and thermally dewetted, forming nanoparticles in the 6-70 nm
   range. Two parameters of its morphology are dependent upon dewetting
   conditions: particle size and particle contact angle. Using transmission
   electron microscopy imaging, it is found that annealing temperature
   profile has a strong effect on the particle size. Additionally, the
   contact angle is found to be dependent on particle size and temperature
   even below the eutectic temperature of the Au-Si alloy. Molecular
   dynamics simulations were performed to investigate potential
   explanations for such experimental observation. In this temperature
   regime, the simulations reveal the formation of an amorphous phase at
   the interface between the catalyst and SiNW that is sensitive to
   temperature. This amorphous layer increases the adhesion energy at the
   interface and explains the contact angle dependence on temperature.

   the photoconductivity and the surface triboelectric density of the
   perovskite-based composite thin film are significantly altered under
   solar illumination, resulting in considerable enhancement of the
   electrical output. The triboelectric output open-circuit voltage (V-oc),
   short circuit current (I-sc), and amount of electric charge (Q) were
   increased by 11\%, 11\%, and 9\%, respectively, after illumination under
   full-sun conditions. Our work provides an approach for the enhancement

Abstract = {{Blood vessels are the only system to provide nutrients and oxygen to
   every part of the body. Many diseases can have significant effects on
   blood vessel formation, so that the vascular network can be a cue to
   assess malicious tumor and ischemic tissues. Various imaging techniques
   can visualize blood vessel structure, but their applications are often
   constrained by either expensive costs, contrast agents, ionizing
   radiations, or a combination of the above. Photoacoustic imaging
   combines the high-contrast and spectroscopic-based specificity of
   optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging,
   and image contrast depends on optical absorption. This enables the
   detection of light absorbing chromophores such as hemoglobin with a
   greater penetration depth compared to purely optical techniques. We
   present here a skeletonization algorithm for vessel architectural
   analysis using non-invasive photoacoustic 3D images acquired without the
   administration of any exogenous contrast agents. 3D photoacoustic images
   were acquired on rats (n = 4) in two different time points: before and
   after a burn surgery. A skeletonization technique based on the
   application of a vesselness filter and medial axis extraction is
   proposed to extract the vessel structure from the image data and six
   vascular parameters (number of vascular trees (NT), vascular density
   (VD), number of branches (NB), 2D distance metric (DM), inflection count
   metric (ICM), and sum of angles metric (SOAM)) were calculated from the
   skeleton. The parameters were compared (1) in locations with and without
   the burn wound on the same day and (2) in the same anatomic location
   before (control) and after the burn surgery. Four out of the six
   descriptors were statistically different (VD, NB, DM, ICM, p < 0.05)
   when comparing two anatomic locations on the same day and when
   considering the same anatomic location at two separate times (i.e.
   before and after burn surgery). The study demonstrates an approach to
   obtain quantitative characterization of the vascular network from 3D
   photoacoustic images without any exogenous contrast agent which can
   assess microenvironmental changes related to disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the performance of a readout system, Fixed Pulse Shape
   Efficient Readout (FIPSER), to digitize signals from detectors with a
   fixed pulse shape. In this study we are mainly interested in the readout
   of fast photon detectors like photomultipliers or Silicon
   photomultipliers. But the concept can be equally applied to the
   digitization of other detector signals. FIPSER is based on the flash
   analog to digital converter (FADC) concept, but has the potential to
   lower costs and power consumption by using an order of magnitude fewer
   discrete voltage levels. Performance is bolstered by combining the
   discretized signal with the knowledge of the underlying pulse shape.
   Simulated FIPSER data was reconstructed with two independent methods.
   One using a maximum likelihood method and the other using a modified
   chi(2) test. Both methods show that utilizing 12 discrete voltage levels
   with a sampling rate of 4 samples per full width half maximum (FWHM) of
   the pulse achieves an amplitude resolution that is better than the
   Poisson limit for photon-counting experiments. The time resolution
   achieved in this configuration ranges between 0.02 and 0.16 FWHM and
   depends on the pulse amplitude. In a situation where the waveform is
   composed of two consecutive pulses the pulses can be separated if they
   are at least 0.05-0.30 FWHM apart with an amplitude resolution that is
   better than 20\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) nanometal scaffolds have gained considerable
   attention recently because of their promising application in
   high-performance supercapacitors compared with plain metal foils. Here,
   a highly oriented nickel (Ni) nanowire array (NNA) film was prepared via
   a simple magnetic-field-driven aqueous solution deposition process and
   then used as the electrode scaffold for the vapor-phase polymerization
   of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT). Benefiting from the unique 3D open
   porous structure of the NNA that provided a highly conductive and
   oriented backbone for facile electron transfer and fast ion diffusion,
   the as-obtained poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) exhibited an
   ultra-long cycle life (95.7\% retention of specific capacitance after 20
   000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A/g) and superior capacitive
   performance. Furthermore, two electrodes were fabricated into an aqueous
   symmetric supercapacitor, which delivered a high energy density (30.38
   Wh/kg at 529.49 W/kg) and superior long-term cycle ability (13.8\% loss
   of capacity after 20 000 cycles). Based on these results, the
   vapor-phase polymerization of EDOT on metal nanowire array current
   collectors has great potential for use in supercapacitors with enhanced
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer composites with high thermal conductivity have attracted much
   attention, along with the rapid development of electronic devices toward
   higher speed and better performance. However, high interfacial thermal
   resistance between fillers and matrix or between fillers and fillers has
   been one of the primary bottlenecks for the effective thermal conduction
   in polymer composites. Herein, we report on engineering interfacial
   structure of silicon carbide nanowire/cellulose microcrystal paper by
   generating silver nanostructures. We show that silver
   nanoparticle-deposited silicon carbide nanowires as fillers can
   effectively enhance the thermal conductivity of the matrix. The in-plane
   thermal conductivity of the resultant composite paper reaches as high as
   34.0 W/m K, which is one order magnitude higher than that of
   conventional polymer composites. Fitting the measured thermal
   conductivity with theoretical models qualitatively demonstrates that
   silver nanoparticles bring the lower interfacial thermal resistances
   both at silicon carbide nanowire/cellulose microcrystal and silicon
   carbide nanowire/silicon carbide nanowire interfaces. This interfacial
   engineering approach provides a powerful tool for sophisticated
   fabrication of high-performance thermal-management materials.}},

Title = {{Genomic differentiation among wild cyanophages despite widespread
   horizontal gene transfer}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genetic recombination is a driving force in genome
   evolution. Among viruses it has a dual role. For genomes with higher
   fitness, it maintains genome integrity in the face of high mutation
   rates. Conversely, for genomes with lower fitness, it provides immediate
   access to sequence space that cannot be reached by mutation alone.
   Understanding how recombination impacts the cohesion and dissolution of
   individual whole genomes within viral sequence space is poorly
   understood across double-stranded DNA bacteriophages (a.k.a phages) due
   to the challenges of obtaining appropriately scaled genomic datasets.
   Results: Here we explore the role of recombination in both maintaining
   and differentiating whole genomes of 142 wild double-stranded DNA marine
   cyanophages. Phylogenomic analysis across the 51 core genes revealed ten
   lineages, six of which were well represented. These phylogenomic
   lineages represent discrete genotypic populations based on comparisons
   of intra-and inter-lineage shared gene content, genome-wide average
   nucleotide identity, as well as detected gaps in the distribution of
   pairwise differences between genomes. McDonald-Kreitman selection tests
   identified putative niche-differentiating genes under positive selection
   that differed across the six well-represented genotypic populations and
   that may have driven initial divergence. Concurrent with patterns of
   recombination of discrete populations, recombination analyses of both
   genic and intergenic regions largely revealed decreased genetic exchange
   across individual genomes between relative to within populations.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that discrete double-stranded DNA
   marine cyanophage populations occur in nature and are maintained by
   patterns of recombination akin to those observed in bacteria, archaea
   and in sexual eukaryotes.}},

Abstract = {{Phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) is widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, and

   growing and resting cells, was established to produce PPA from
   L-phenylalanine using the engineered Escherichia coli constructed
   previously. First, the biotransformation conditions for growing cells
   were optimized (L-phenylalanine concentration 20.0 g.L-1, temperature 35
   degrees C) and a two-stage temperature control strategy (keep 20 degrees
   C for 12 h and increase the temperature to 35 degrees C until the end of
   biotransformation) was performed. The biotransformation conditions for
   resting cells were then optimized in 3-L bioreactor and the optimized
   conditions were as follows: agitation speed 500 rpm, aeration rate 1.5
   vvm, and L-phenylalanine concentration 30 g.L-1. The total maximal
   production (mass conversion rate) reached 29.8 +/- 2.1 g.L-1 (99.3\%)
   and 75.1 +/- 2.5 g.L-1 (93.9\%) in the flask and 3-L bioreactor,
   respectively. Finally, a kinetic model was established, and it was
   revealed that the substrate and product inhibition were the main
   limiting factors for resting cell biotransformation.}},

Abstract = {{T cells rapidly undergo contraction upon viral clearance, but how T cell
   function and fate are determined during this phase is unclear. During
   the contraction phase of an acute infection with lymphocytic
   choriomeningitis virus, we found that virus-specific CD8(+) T cells
   within the splenic red pulp (RP) had higher two-dimensional (2D)
   effective affinity than those within the white pulp (WP). This increased
   antigen recognition of RP-derived CD8(+) T cells correlated with more
   efficient target cell killing and improved control of viremia. FoxP3(+)
   regulatory T cells and cytokine TGF-beta limited the 2D-affinity in the
   WP during the contraction phase. Anatomical location drove gene
   expression patterns in CD8(+) T cells that led to preferential
   differentiation of memory precursor WP T cells into long-term memory
   cells. These results highlight that intricate regulation of T cell
   function and fate is determined by anatomic compartmentalization during
   the early immune contraction phase.}},

Title = {{Multiple Roles of Cu(II) in Catalyzing Hydrolysis and Oxidation of
   beta-Lactam Antibiotics}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{12156-12165}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The widely used beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and
   cephalosporins are known to be susceptible to Cu-II-catalyzed hydrolysis
   at their four-membered beta-lactam ring. However, this study elucidates
   that Cu-II can in fact play multiple roles in promoting the hydrolysis
   and/or oxidation of beta-lactam antibiotics under environmental aquatic
   conditions (pH 5.0-9.0 and 22 degrees C), depending on beta-lactams'
   structural characteristics and solution pH. Most significantly, the
   beta-lactam antibiotics that contain a phenylglycine primary amine group
   on the side chain can undergo direct oxidation by Cu-II via this
   functional group. On the other hand, the beta-lactam ring of penicillins
   is susceptible to Cu-II-catalyzed hydrolysis, followed by oxidation of
   the hydrolysis product by Cu-II. In contrast, the beta-lactam ring of
   cephalosporins is susceptible to Cu-II-catalyzed hydrolysis only.
   Solution pH influences the Cu-II-promoted transformation by affecting
   the beta-lactam and Cu-II complexation through protonation/deprotonation
   of critical organic functional groups. When Cu-II acts as an oxidant to
   promote the transformation of beta-lactam antibiotics to yield Cu-I, the
   overall role of Cu-II appears catalytic if the reaction occurs under
   ambient atmospheric condition, due to quick oxidation of Cu-I by oxygen
   to regenerate Cu-II. Compared to earlier literature that largely assumed
   only the hydrolytic catalyst role of Cu-II in promoting degradation of
   beta-lactam antibiotics, the oxidative roles of Cu-II identified by this
   study mark important contributions to a more accurate mechanistic
   understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-matrix adhesion complexes are multi-protein structures linking the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. They are essential to
   both cell motility and function by bidirectionally sensing and
   transmitting mechanical and biochemical stimulations. Several types of
   cell-matrix adhesions have been identified and they share many key
   molecular components, such as integrins and actin-integrin linkers.
   Mechanochemical coupling between ECM molecules and the actin
   cytoskeleton has been observed from the single cell to the single
   molecule level and from immune cells to neuronal cells. However, the
   mechanisms underlying force regulation of integrin-mediated
   mechanotransduction still need to be elucidated. In this review article,
   we focus on integrin-mediated adhesions and discuss force regulation of
   cell-matrix adhesions and key adaptor molecules, three different
   force-dependent behaviors, and molecular mechanisms for mechanochemical
   coupling in force regulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a plasmonic absorber consisting of a
   metal-dielectric-metal stack with a top layer of Sierpinski nanocarpet
   is theoretically investigated. Such a compact absorber depicts broadband

   Including several feature sizes, such a fractal-like structure shows an
   average simulated extinction response of 0.85 for either transverse
   electric or magnetic polarization states under normal incidence.
   Underlying mechanisms of absorbance due to excited surface plasmon modes
   as well as electric/magnetic dipole resonances are well revealed by
   investigating electric field, magnetic field, and current distributions.
   The proposed absorber opens a path to realize high-performance ultrathin

Title = {{A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Head Movements in
   Cervical Dystonia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Cervical dystonia (CD) is a neurological disorder characterized by
   abnormal movements and postures of the head. The brain regions
   responsible for these abnormal movements are not well understood,
   because most imaging techniques for assessing regional brain activity
   cannot be used when the head is moving. Recently, we mapped brain
   activation in healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging during isometric head rotation, when muscle contractions occur
   without actual head movements. In the current study, we used the same
   methods to explore the neural substrates for head movements in subjects
   with CD who had predominantly rotational abnormalities (torticollis).
   Isometric wrist extension was examined for comparison. Electromyography
   of neck and hand muscles ensured compliance with tasks during scanning,
   and any head motion was measured and corrected. Data were analyzed in
   three steps. First, we conducted with-in-group analyses to examine
   task-related activation patterns separately in subjects with CD and in
   healthy controls. Next, we directly compared task-related activation
   patterns between participants with CD and controls. Finally, considering
   that the abnormal head movements in CD occur in a consistently patterned
   direction for each individual, we conducted exploratory analyses that
   involved normalizing data according to the direction of rotational CD.
   The between-group comparisons failed to reveal any significant
   differences, but the normalization procedure in subjects with CD
   revealed that isometric head rotation in the direction of dystonic head
   rotation was associated with more activation in the ipsilateral anterior
   cerebellum, whereas isometric head rotation in the opposite direction
   was associated with more activity in sensorimotor cortex. These findings
   suggest that the cerebellum contributes to abnormal head rotation in CD,
   whereas regions in the cerebral cortex are involved in opposing the
   involuntary movements.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Traditionally, assessment of psychiatric symptoms has been
   relying on their retrospective report to a trained interviewer. The
   emergence of smartphones facilitates passive sensor-based monitoring and
   active real-time monitoring through time-stamped prompts; however there
   are few validated self-report measures designed for this purpose.
   Methods: We introduce a novel, compact questionnaire, Mood Zoom (MZ),
   embedded in a customised smart-phone application. MZ asks participants
   to rate anxiety, elation, sadness, anger, irritability and energy on a
   7-point Likert scale. For comparison, we used four standard clinical
   questionnaires administered to participants weekly to quantify mania
   (ASRM), depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (EQ-5D).
   We monitored 48 Bipolar Disorder (BD), 31 Borderline Personality
   Disorders (BPD) and 51 Healthy control (HC) participants to study
   longitudinal (median +/- iqr: 313 +/- 194 days) variation and
   differences of mood traits by exploring the data using diverse
   time-series tools.
   Results: MZ correlated well (vertical bar R vertical bar>0. 5, p <
   0.0001) with QIDS, GAD-7, and EQ-5D. We found statistically strong
   (vertical bar R vertical bar>0. 3, p < 0.0001) differences in
   variability in all questionnaires for the three cohorts. Compared to HC,
   BD and BPD participants exhibit different trends and variability, and on
   average had higher self-reported scores in mania, depression, and
   anxiety, and lower quality of life. In particular, analysis of MZ
   variability can differentiate BD and BPD which was not hitherto possible
   using the weekly questionnaires.
   Limitations: All reported scores rely on self-assessment; there is a
   lack of ongoing clinical assessment by experts to validate the findings.
   Conclusions: MZ could be used for efficient, long-term, effective daily
   monitoring of mood instability in clinical psychiatric practice. (C)

Abstract = {{The deactivation and regeneration of the ZSM-5-based catalyst was
   investigated in the reaction of acrolein diethyl acetal and ammonia
   toward pyridine and 3-picoline. The coke was the main reason leading to
   deactivation for all the tested catalysts, and it was basically
   combusted at high temperature under the air and water streams in order
   to recover the initial catalytic performance. The best catalyst through
   the reaction-regeneration treatment could effectively promote the
   formation of pyridine and 3-picoline. The results showed that the total
   yield of pyridine and 3-picoline was raised above 20\% while the
   reaction was operated the 10th reaction-regeneration cycle relative to
   the 1st reaction at TOS (time on stream) = 1-3 h. The catalysts were
   characterized by means of XRD, N-2-physisorption, FT-IR and NH3-TPD
   techniques. By relating the performance and structure of the catalyst,
   it was found that the dealumination and the residual coke were
   responsible for boosting the catalytic activity after several
   reaction-regeneration cycles. The dealumination generated more mesopores
   and less acidity while the residual coke resulted in lowering the
   acidity. The relationship between the catalyst and the regeneration was
   well established. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on industrial electricity consumption, we model industrial
   networks by Granger causality method and MST (minimum spanning tree),
   and then further stick onto an industrial coupling mechanism from
   energy-consumption perspective.
   First, we construct Granger causality networks of five provinces in
   South China of GD, GX, GZ, HN and YN based on their industrial
   electricity consumption data, and we demonstrate from a network-topology
   perspective: the distribution of weight of links of all industrial
   electricity-consumption Granger causality networks approximately follows
   power-law distribution, revealing a phenomenon that few industries may
   bring a tremendous influence on the rest. Moreover, correlation analysis
   between weight and degree of a node shows that in most Granger causality
   networks, both span and strength of influence of a given industry will
   significantly increase.
   Further, we analyze the relationship between the thresholds of Granger
   causality significance and density of corresponding networks. Results
   show GD and HN could be classified into a group with relatively greater
   global differentiation in industries and unbalanced industrial
   development, however, GX, GZ and YN are grouped as second cluster with
   relatively balanced industrial development.
   Furthermore, using Chu-Liu-EdmondsMST algorithm, we extract graphs of
   MSTs or maximal cliques from industrial electricity-consumption Granger
   causality networks, and research on energy transmission structure,
   feedback loop, and bootstrap reliability. By analyzing MSTs, we find
   that only GD, GX and YN can be extracted with MST graphs, and capture
   the probable transmission routes of key nodes. Besides we illustrate all
   three MST graphs are involved with feedback loops structures with
   various characteristics: GX has complete feed-forward section, feed-back
   section and feedback loop section; YN has only feed-forward section and
   feedback loop section; GD has multiple feedback loops section.
   Finally, we conduct bootstrap reliability tests on MSTs. Results show
   branches of reliability of GD, GX and YN are decentralized while those
   feedback loops sections are only concentrated on highly-reliable
   branches. As neither HN nor GZ can be extracted with MST graphs, we
   characterize them by maximal cliques. It is demonstrated that both
   industrial systems of HN and GZ are significantly grouped into two
   independent branches and those internal industries inside independent
   branches are highly correlated. However from perspectives of whole South
   China, the causal relationship is only converged on a few of industries.
   For regions without MST graphs like HN and GZ, the reliability of links
   is also greater than that of GD, GX and YN. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Plant-derived sterols, often referred to as phytosterols, are important
   constituents of plant membranes where they assist in maintaining
   phospholipid bilayer stability. Consumption of phytosterols has been
   suggested to positively affect human health by reducing cholesterol
   levels in blood via inhibition of its absorption in the small intestine,
   thus protecting against heart attack and stroke. Sterols are challenging
   analytes for mass spectrometry, since their low polarity makes them
   difficult to ionize by both electrospray ionization (ESI) and
   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), typically requiring
   derivatization steps to overcome their low ionization efficiencies. We
   present a fast and reliable method to characterize the composition of
   phytosterols in vegetable oils and enriched margarines. The method
   requires no derivatization steps or sample extraction procedures thanks
   to the use of transmission mode direct analysis in real time mass
   spectrometry (TM-DART-MS). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly crystalline graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with decreased
   structural imperfections benefits from the suppression of electron-hole
   recombination, which enhances its hydrogen generation activity. However,
   producing such g-C3N4 materials by conventional heating in an electric
   furnace has proven challenging. Herein, we report on the synthesis of
   high-quality g-C3N4 with reduced structural defects by judiciously
   combining the implementation of melamine-cyanuric acid (MCA)
   supramolecular aggregates and microwaveassisted thermolysis. The g-C3N4
   material produced after optimizing the microwave reaction time can
   effectively generate H-2 under visible-light irradiation. The highest
   H-2 evolution rate achieved was 40.5 mu mol h(-1), which is two times
   higher than that of a g-C3N4 sample prepared by thermal polycondensation
   of the same supramolecular aggregates in an electric furnace. The
   microwave-assisted thermolysis strategy is simple, rapid, and robust,
   thereby providing a promising route for the synthesis of high-efficiency
   g-C3N4 photocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer between two objects separated by a nanoscale vacuum gap
   holds great promise especially in energy harvesting applications such as
   near-field thermophotovoltaic systems. However, experimental validation
   of nanoscale radiative heat transfer has been largely limited to
   tip-plate configurations due to challenges of maintaining small gap
   spacing over a relatively large area. Here, we report measurements of
   heat transfer near room temperature between two 1 cm by 1 cm doped-Si
   parallel plates, separated by a vacuum gap from about 200 nm to 780 nm.
   The measured strong near-field radiative transfer is in quantitative
   agreement with the theoretical prediction based on fluctuational
   electrodynamics. The largest measured radiative heat flux is 11 times as
   high as the blackbody limit for the same hot and cold surface
   temperatures. Our experiments have produced the highest radiative heat
   transfer rate observed to date across submicron distances between
   objects near room temperature. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Tuning carrier lifetime in InGaN/GaN LEDs via strain compensation for
   high-speed visible light communication}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, visible light communication (VLC) technology has
   attracted intensive attention due to its huge potential in superior
   processing ability and fast data transmission. The transmission rate
   relies on the modulation bandwidth, which is predominantly determined by
   the minority-carrier lifetime in III-group nitride semiconductors. In
   this paper, the carrier dynamic process under a stress field was studied
   for the first time, and the carrier recombination lifetime was
   calculated within the framework of quantum perturbation theory. Owing to
   the intrinsic strain due to the lattice mismatch between InGaN and GaN,
   the wave functions for the holes and electrons are misaligned in an
   InGaN/GaN device. By applying an external strain that ``cancels{''} the
   internal strain, the overlap between the wave functions can be maximized
   so that the lifetime of the carrier is greatly reduced. As a result, the
   maximum speed of a single chip was increased from 54 MHz up to 117 MHz
   in a blue LED chip under 0.14\% compressive strain. Finally, a bandwidth
   contour plot depending on the stress and operating wavelength was

Abstract = {{This work examines how the optimization of molecular dimensions and
   chemical functionality of the organic ligands of quantum dots (QDs) can
   be explored for dramatic enhancement of the optical properties of QD
   films, particularly, optical gain. We show that the replacement of
   traditional QD organic ligands with a much shorter ligand, butylamine,
   yields a dense QD-packing that results in a two-fold increase in optical
   gain. Overall, the highly packed QD films exhibit very large net gain
   values (similar to 500 cm(-1)) which greatly exceed typical Cd-based QD
   films with traditional ligands. In addition, thresholds for
   amplified-spontaneous emission (ASE) down to 50 mu J cm(-2) were
   observed, which is exceptionally low for ns-pulse pumped QD systems. Our
   results confirm an additional route for obtaining high optical gain
   using QDs, and outline a strategy for modifying the optical gain
   characteristics by ligand exchange without needing to modify the QD
   selection. Consideration of the ligands along with QD compositional
   design could make it possible to fabricate photonic systems with
   exceptionally low lasing thresholds, and offers a route toward achieving
   high gain using steady state pumping, an extremely difficult feat to
   achieve in traditional QD systems.}},

Title = {{Genome of the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), a
   globally significant invasive species, reveals key functional and
   evolutionary innovations at the beetle-plant interface}},
Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Relatively little is known about the genomic basis and
   evolution of wood- feeding in beetles. We undertook genome sequencing
   and annotation, gene expression assays, studies of plant cell wall
   degrading enzymes, and other functional and comparative studies of the
   Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, a globally
   significant invasive species capable of inflicting severe feeding damage
   on many important tree species. Complementary studies of genes encoding
   enzymes involved in digestion of woody plant tissues or detoxification
   of plant allelochemicals were undertaken with the genomes of 14
   additional insects, including the newly sequenced emerald ash borer and
   bull-headed dung beetle.
   Results: The Asian longhorned beetle genome encodes a uniquely diverse
   arsenal of enzymes that can degrade the main polysaccharide networks in
   plant cell walls, detoxify plant allelochemicals, and otherwise
   facilitate feeding on woody plants. It has the metabolic plasticity
   needed to feed on diverse plant species, contributing to its highly
   invasive nature. Large expansions of chemosensory genes involved in the
   reception of pheromones and plant kairomones are consistent with the
   complexity of chemical cues it uses to find host plants and mates.
   Conclusions: Amplification and functional divergence of genes associated
   with specialized feeding on plants, including genes originally obtained
   via horizontal gene transfer from fungi and bacteria, contributed to the
   addition, expansion, and enhancement of the metabolic repertoire of the
   Asian longhorned beetle, certain other phytophagous beetles, and to a
   lesser degree, other phytophagous insects. Our results thus begin to
   establish a genomic basis for the evolutionary success of beetles on
   plants.}},

Title = {{X-RAY BACKGROUND AT HIGH REDSHIFTS FROM POP III REMNANTS: RESULTS FROM
   POP III STAR FORMATION RATES IN THE RENAISSANCE SIMULATIONS}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{832}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Due to their long mean free paths, X-rays are expected to have global
   impacts on the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) by their
   large-scale heating and ionizing processes. At high redshifts, X-rays
   from Population (Pop) III binaries might have important effects on
   cosmic reionization and the Ly alpha forest. As a continuation of our
   previous work on Pop III binary X-rays, we use the Pop III distribution
   and evolution from the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of
   self-consistent cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the
   formation of the first galaxies, to calculate the X-ray luminosity
   density and background over the redshift range 20 >= z >= 7.6. As we
   find that Pop III star formation continues at a low, nearly constant
   rate to the end of reionization, X-rays are being continuously produced
   at significant rates compared to other possible X-ray sources, such as
   AGNs and normal X-ray binaries during the same period of time. We
   estimate that Pop III binaries produce approximately 6 eV of energy in
   the X-rays per hydrogen atom. We calculate the X-ray background for
   different monochromatic photon energies. KeV X-rays redshift and
   accumulate to produce a strong X-ray background spectrum extending to
   roughly 500 eV. The X-ray background is strong enough to heat the IGM to
   similar to 1000 K and to ionize a few percent of the neutral hydrogen.
   These effects are important for an understanding of the neutral hydrogen
   hyperfine transition 21 cm line signatures, the Ly alpha forest, and the
   Thomson optical depth to the CMB.}},

   with high molecular orientation were well-embedded across the
   cross-section and contributed remarkable thermal stabilities to the MCS
   membrane. Thus, no outbreaks were found in its dimension and ionic
   resistance up to 200 and 250 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the MCS
   membrane (at similar to 200 degrees C), as a lithium ion battery (LIB)
   separator, showed superior thermal and electrochemical stabilities
   compared with a widely used commercial separator (similar to 120 degrees
   C). The average capacity decay rate of LIB for 500 cycles was calculated
   to be approximately 0.030 mAh/g/cycle. This value demonstrated
   exceptional long-term stability compared with commercial LIBs and with
   two other types (single core-shell and co-electrospun separators
   incorporating with functionalized TiO2) of PI/PVdF composite separators.
   The proper architecture and synergy effects of multiple PI nanofibrils
   as a thermally stable polymer in the PVdF shell as electrolyte
   compatible polymers are responsible for the superior thermal performance
   and long-term stability of the LIB.}},

Title = {{Dual-wavelength pump-probe microscopy analysis of melanin composition}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Pump-probe microscopy is an emerging technique that provides detailed
   chemical information of absorbers with sub-micrometer spatial
   resolution. Recent work has shown that the pump-probe signals from
   melanin in human skin cancers correlate well with clinical concern, but
   it has been difficult to infer the molecular origins of these
   differences. Here we develop a mathematical framework to describe the
   pump-probe dynamics of melanin in human pigmented tissue samples, which
   treats the ensemble of individual chromophores that make up melanin as
   Gaussian absorbers with bandwidth related via Frenkel excitons. Thus,
   observed signals result from an interplay between the spectral
   bandwidths of the individual underlying chromophores and spectral
   proximity of the pump and probe wavelengths. The model is tested using a
   dual-wavelength pump-probe approach and a novel signal processing method
   based on gnomonic projections. Results show signals can be described by
   a single linear transition path with different rates of progress for
   different individual pump-probe wavelength pairs. Moreover, the combined
   dual-wavelength data shows a nonlinear transition that supports our
   mathematical framework and the excitonic model to describe the optical
   properties of melanin. The novel gnomonic projection analysis can also
   be an attractive generic tool for analyzing mixing paths in biomolecular
   and analytical chemistry.}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{44}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{The chemical and physical properties of cellulose nanofibril (CNF) films
   cross-linked with wet strength cross-linker polyamide-epichlorohydrin
   resin (PAE) were investigated. In addition to the expected wet strength
   improvement, a unique stress-strain behavior for dry cross-linked films
   was observed. This stress-strain behavior indicates that varying
   stress-bearing mechanisms arise from the formation of new bonds caused
   by cross-linking at different levels of cross-linker addition.
   Cross-linked films showed an approximate 150\% increase in dry strength,
   when compared to non-cross-linked CNF films. The cross-linked films
   showed a transition of both surface and bulk properties from hydrophilic
   to hydrophobic. The water contact angle increased from 50 degrees to 110
   degrees, while the water retention value decreased by approximately 25\%
   for the cross-linked films. Moreover, water vapor permeability also
   showed a 2-fold decrease. Possible mechanisms for the changes in
   behavior are discussed in detail.}},

Title = {{Co-designing a scalable quantum computer with trapped atomic ions}},
Journal = {{NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The first generation of quantum computers are on the horizon, fabricated
   from quantum hardware platforms that may soon be able to tackle certain
   tasks that cannot be performed or modelled with conventional computers.
   These quantum devices will not likely be universal or fully
   programmable, but special-purpose processors whose hardware will be
   tightly co-designed with particular target applications. Trapped atomic
   ions are a leading platform for first-generation quantum computers, but
   they are also fundamentally scalable to more powerful general purpose
   devices in future generations. This is because trapped ion qubits are
   atomic clock standards that can be made identical to a part in 1015, and
   their quantum circuit connectivity can be reconfigured through the use
   of external fields, without modifying the arrangement or architecture of
   the qubits themselves. In this forwardlooking overview, we show how a
   modular quantum computer with thousands or more qubits can be engineered
   from ion crystals, and how the linkage between ion trap qubits might be
   tailored to a variety of applications and quantum-computing protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Following injury, adult skeletal muscle undergoes a well-coordinated
   sequence of molecular and physiological events to promote repair and
   regeneration. However, a thorough understanding of the in vivo
   epigenomic and transcriptional mechanisms that control these reparative
   events is lacking. To address this, we monitored the in vivo dynamics of
   three histone modifications and coding and non-coding RNA expression
   throughout the regenerative process in a mouse model of traumatic muscle
   injury. We first illustrate how both coding and noncoding RNAs in
   tissues and sorted satellite cells are modified and regulated during
   various stages after trauma. Next, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation
   followed by sequencing to evaluate the chromatin state of cis-regulatory
   elements (promoters and enhancers) and view how these elements evolve
   and influence various muscle repair and regeneration transcriptional
   programs. These results provide a comprehensive view of the central
   factors that regulate muscle regeneration and underscore the multiple
   levels through which both transcriptional and epigenetic patterns are
   regulated to enact appropriate repair and regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Nanowires-dispersed polycrystalline graphene has been recently explored
   as a transparent conducting material for applications such as solar
   cells, displays, and touch-screens. Metal nanowires and polycrystalline
   graphene play synergetic roles during the charge transport in the
   material by compensating for each other's limitations. In the present
   work, we develop and employ an extensive computational framework to
   study the essential characteristics of the charge transport not only on
   an aggregate basis but also on individual constituents' levels in these
   types of composite thin-films. The method allows the detailed
   visualization of the percolative current pathways in the material and
   provides the direct evidence of current crowding in the 1-D nanowires
   and 2-D polygraphene sheet. The framework is used to study the effects
   of several important governing parameters such as length, density and
   orientation of the nanowires, grain density in polygraphene, grain
   boundary resistance, and the contact resistance between nanowires and
   graphene. We also present and validate an effective medium theory based
   generalized analytical model for the composite. The analytical model is
   in agreement with the simulations, and it successfully predicts the
   overall conductance as a function of several parameters including the
   nanowire network density and orientation and graphene grain boundaries.
   Our findings suggest that the longer nanowires (compared to grain size)
   with low angle orientation (<40 degrees) with respect to the main
   carrier transport direction provide significant advantages in enhancing
   the conductance of the polygraphene sheet. We also find that above a
   certain value of grain boundary resistance (>60 x intra-grain
   resistance), the overall conductance becomes nearly independent of grain
   boundary resistance due to nanowires. The developed model can be applied
   to study other emerging transparent conducting materials such as
   nanowires, nanotubes, polygraphene, graphene oxide, and their hybrid
   nanostructures. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Isoforms of the Fc gamma receptor III (Fc gamma RIII or CD16) are cell
   surface receptors for the Fc portion of IgG and important regulators of
   humoral immune responses. Different ligand binding kinetics of Fc gamma
   RIII isoforms are obtained in three dimensions by surface plasmon
   resonance and in two dimensions by a micropipette adhesion frequency
   assay. We show that the anchor structure of CD16 isoforms isolated from
   the cell membrane affects their binding affinities in a ligand-specific
   manner. Changing the receptor anchor structure from full to partial to
   none decreases the ligand binding affinity for human IgG1 (hIgG1) but
   increases it for murine IgG2a (mIgG2a). Removing N-glycosylation from
   the CD16 protein core by tunicamycin also increases the ligand binding
   affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that deglycosylation
   at Asn-163 of CD16 removes the steric hindrance for the CD16-hIgG1 Fc
   binding and thus increases the binding affinity. These results highlight
   an unexpected sensitivity of ligand binding to the receptor anchor
   structure and glycosylation and suggest their respective roles in
   controlling allosterically the conformation of the ligand binding pocket
   of CD16.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the optical properties of silver nanodisk (Ag ND) Langmuir
   Blodgett monolayers that were transferred to substrates in different
   coupling regimes. Ag ND monolayers deposited in the liquid
   expanded-gaseous (Le-G) phase demonstrated individual plasmon resonance
   behavior while monolayers deposited in the liquid condensed-liquid
   expanded (Lc-Le) and solid-liquid condensed (S-Lc) phases exhibited
   plasmon coupling between closely packed adjacent nanoparticles, which
   caused a red shift in their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
   spectra. The initial presence of excess polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
   surfactant micelles on the Ag ND monolayers could be eliminated by first
   compressing the monolayers to high surface pressures, resulting in blue
   shifted extinction spectra and increased sensitivity as micelles
   depleted into the subphase. Ag ND monolayers were then used in
   conjunction with a conjugated poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)
   medium to reversibly modulate the LSPR by changing the local refractive
   index around the nanoparticles. Ultimately, a high reversible LSPR shift
   of 27 nm was observed with an applied electropotential of +/- 500 mV to
   the P3HT-coated Ag ND monolayer. A high refractive index sensitivity
   (RIS) of 141 nm per RIU was found for monolayers deposited in the Lc-Le
   phase due to an increase in hot spot formation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we introduce a kinetic model to study the effectiveness of
   ester-mediated amide bond formation under prebiotic conditions. In our
   previous work, we found that a simple system composed of alpha-hydroxy
   acids and alpha-amino acids is capable of forming peptide bonds via
   esterification followed by the ester-amide exchange reaction. To further
   understand the kinetic behavior of this copolymerization, we first
   tracked the growth of initial species from a valine/lactic acid mixture
   in a closed system reactor. A mathematical model was developed to
   simulate the reactions and evaluate the rate constants at different
   temperatures. We found these reactions can be described by the empirical
   Arrhenius equation even when reaction occurred in the solid (dry) state.
   Further calculations for activation parameters showed that the
   ester-mediated pathway facilitates amide bond formation by lowering
   activation entropies. These results provide a theoretical framework that
   illustrates why the ester-mediated pathway for peptide bond formation is
   efficient and why it would have been more favorable on the early Earth,
   compared to peptide bond formation without the aid of hydroxy acids.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbed blood flow (d-flow) induces atherosclerosis by altering the
   expression of mechanosensitive genes in the arterial endothelium.
   Previously, we identified >580 mechanosensitive genes in the mouse
   arterial endothelium, but their role in endothelial inflammation is
   incompletely understood. From this set, we obtained 84 Drosophila RNAi
   lines that silences the target gene under the control of upstream
   activation sequence (UAS) promoter. These lines were crossed with
   C564-GAL4 flies expressing GFP under the control of drosomycin promoter,
   an NF-kappa B target gene and a marker of pathogen-induced inflammation.
   Silencing of psmd12 or ERN1 decreased infection-induced drosomycin
   expression, while Bap60 silencing significantly increased the drosomycin
   expression. Interestingly, knockdown of Bap60 in adult flies using
   temperature-inducible Bap60 RNAi (C564ts-GAL4-Bap60-RNAi) enhanced
   drosomycin expression upon Gram-positive bacterial challenge but the
   basal drosomycin expression remained unchanged compared to the control.
   In the mammalian system, smarcd3 (mammalian ortholog of Bap60)
   expression was reduced in the human-and mouse aortic endothelial cells
   exposed to oscillatory shear in vitro as well as in the d-flow regions
   of mouse arterial endothelium in vivo. Moreover, siRNA-mediated
   knockdown of smarcd3 induced endothelial inflammation. In summary, we
   developed an in vivo Drosophila RNAi screening method to identify
   flow-sensitive genes that regulate endothelial inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{AgI sensitized BiOI-Bi2O3 composite (AgI/BiOI-Bi2O3) with
   multi-heterojunctions was prepared using simple etching-deposition
   process. Different characterization techniques were performed to
   investigate the structural, optical and electrical properties of the
   as-prepared photocatalysts. It was found that the ternary Agl/BiOI-Bi2O3
   composite exhibited: (1) improved photocurrent response, (2) smaller
   band gap, (3) greatly reduced charge transfer resistance and (4)
   negative shift of flat band potential, which finally led to easier
   generation and more efficient separation of photo-generated
   electron-hole pairs at the hetero-interfaces. Thus, for the reduction of
   Cr(VI), Agl/BiOI-Bi2O3 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity under
   visible light irradiation at near neutral pH. AgI/BiOI-Bi2O3 was
   optimized when the initial molar ratio of KI to Bi2O3 and AgNO3 to Bi2O3
   was 1:1 and 10\%, respectively. The estimated k(Cr(VI)) on optimized
   Agl/BiOI-Bi2O3 was about 16 times that on pure Bi2O3. Good stability was
   also observed in cyclic runs, indicating that the current
   multi-heterostructured photocatalyst is highly desirable for the
   remediation of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Studies on recognizing different kind of handwritten texts have been
   conducted and achieved great success for some letters. This paper
   reviews the segmentation techniques on English handwritten recognition,
   which is one of the most successful one up to date. Also, considering
   the very much relations between Arabic and Uyghur which we are aiming to
   get progress on its handwritten recognition technology, references from
   Arabic handwritten recognition are very much hoped to get.
   Characteristics of Uyghur handwriting texts and some of the encountered
   difficulties are described. Then referencing the successful work on
   English and Arabic basic unit segmentation, this paper tries to give
   some suggestions for Uyghur basic unit segmentation research.}},

Abstract = {{3D packaging is one of the most growing areas in the semiconductor
   industry that offers several possibilities of increasing a system
   miniaturization using the current integration nodes. Exploring the 3D
   dimension is a topic that was addressed years ago using vertical dies
   stacking and through substrate via technologies such as through silicon
   via (TSV) technology. This paper addresses the technology of the glass
   interposer-based 3D packaging which is a novel approach of chips
   assembly and still in progress and improvement in terms of dimensions,
   additional used materials and techniques of assembly. In our work, we
   first introduce this technology. Afterwards, we present our developed
   system both in the substrate level and the assembly level. The different
   processes are optimized in order to offer a low cost packaging solution.
   In progress with the fabrication steps, we will present several
   characterizations and a reliability testing in order to ensure that the
   developed test vehicles provide a measureable electrical connectivity
   and meet the minimal conditions of reliability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This study proposes a new methodology for estimating the additional
   shear strength (or cohesion) exerted by vegetation roots on slope
   stability analysis within a coupled hydrological-stability model. The
   mechanical root cohesion is estimated within a Fiber Bundle Model
   framework that allows for the evaluation of the root strength as a
   function of stress-strain relationships of populations of fibers. The
   use of such model requires the knowledge of the root architecture. A
   branching topology model based on Leonardo's rule is developed,
   providing an estimation of the amount of roots and the distribution of
   diameters with depth. The proposed methodology has been implemented into
   an existing distributed hydrological-stability model able to simulate
   the dynamics of factor of safety as a function of soil moisture
   dynamics. The model also accounts for the hydrological effects of
   vegetation, which reduces soil water content via root water uptake, thus
   increasing the stability. The entire methodology has been tested in a
   synthetic hillslope with two configurations of vegetation type, i.e.,
   trees and shrubs, which have been compared to a configuration without
   vegetation. The vegetation has been characterized using roots data of
   two mediterranean plant species. The results demonstrate the
   capabilities of the topological model in accurately reproducing the
   observed root structure of the analyzed species. For the environmental
   setting modeled, the effects of root uptake might be more significant
   than the mechanical reinforcement; the additional resistance depends
   strictly on the vegetation root depth. Finally, for the simulated
   climatic environment, landslides are seasonal, in agreement with past
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in tropical forests play an
   important role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Past attempts to quantify
   the net C exchange with the atmosphere in regional and global budgets do
   not systematically account for dynamic feedbacks among linked
   hydrological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical processes, which
   control the fate of SOC. Here we quantify effects of geomorphic
   perturbations on SOC oxidation and accumulation in two adjacent wet
   tropical forest watersheds underlain by contrasting lithology
   (volcaniclastic rock and quartz diorite) in the Luquillo Critical Zone
   Observatory. This study uses the spatially explicit and physically based
   model of SOC dynamics tRIBS-ECO (Triangulated Irregular Network-based
   Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator-Erosion and Carbon Oxidation) and
   measurements of SOC profiles and oxidation rates. Our results suggest
   that hillslope erosion at the two watersheds may drive C sequestration
   or CO2 release to the atmosphere, depending on the forest type and land
   use. The net erosion-induced C exchange with the atmosphere was
   controlled by the spatial distribution of forest types. The two
   watersheds were characterized by significant erosion and dynamic
   replacement of upland SOC stocks. Results suggest that the landscape
   underlain by volcaniclastic rock has reached a state close to geomorphic
   equilibrium, and the landscape underlain by quartz diorite is
   characterized by greater rates of denudation. These findings highlight
   the importance of the spatially explicit and physical representation of
   C erosion driven by local variation in lithological and geomorphological
   characteristics and in forest cover.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe pneumonia and
   bronchiolitis in infants, children and older adults. The use of metallic
   nanoparticles as potential therapeutics is being explored against
   respiratory viruses like Influenza, Parainfluenza and Adenovirus. In
   this study, we showed that gold nanorods (GNRs) inhibit RSV in HEp-2
   cells and BALB/c mice by 82\% and 56\%, respectively. The RSV inhibition
   correlated with marked upregulated antiviral genes due to GNR mediated
   TLR, NOD-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways.
   Transmission electron microscopy of lungs showed GNRs in the endocytotic
   vesicles and histological analyses indicated infiltration by
   neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes correlating with clearance of
   RSV. In addition, production of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs
   indicates recruitment of immune cells to counter RSV replication. To our
   knowledge, this is the first in vitro and in vivo report that provides
   possible antiviral mechanisms of GNRs against RSV. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. MicroRNA (miRNAs) have been previously implicated in scleral
   remodeling in normal eye growth. They have the potential to be
   therapeutic targets for prevention/retardation of exaggerated eye growth
   in myopia by modulating scleral matrix remodeling. To explore this
   potential, genome-wide miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) scleral profiles
   in myopic and control eyes from mice were studied.
   METHODS. C57BL/6J mice (n = 7; P28) reared under a 12L: 12D cycle were
   form-deprived (FD) unilaterally for 2 weeks. Refractive error and axial
   length changes were measured using photorefraction and 1310-nm
   spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, respectively. Scleral RNA
   samples from FD and fellow control eyes were processed for microarray
   assay. Statistical analyses were performed using National Institute of
   Aging array analysis tool; group comparisons were made using ANOVA, and
   gene ontologies were identified using software available on the Web.
   Findings were confirmed using quantitative PCR in a separate group of
   mice (n = 7).
   RESULTS. Form-deprived eyes showed myopic shifts in refractive error
   (-2.02 +/- 0.47 D; P < 0.01). Comparison of the scleral RNA profiles of
   test eyes with those of control eyes revealed 54 differentially
   expressed miRNAs and 261 mRNAs fold-change > 1.25 (maximum fold change =
   1.63 and 2.7 for miRNAs and mRNAs, respectively) (P < 0.05; minimum, P =
   0.0001). Significant ontologies showing gene over-representation (P <
   0.05) included intermediate filament organization, scaffold protein
   binding, detection of stimuli, calcium ion, G protein, and
   phototransduction. Significant differential expression of Let-7a and
   miR-16-2, and Smok4a, Prph2, and Gnat1 were confirmed.
   CONCLUSIONS. Scleral mi- and mRNAs showed differential expression linked
   to myopia, supporting the involvement of miRNAs in eye growth
   regulation. The observed general trend of relatively small fold-changes
   suggests a tightly controlled, regulatory mechanism for scleral gene
   expression.}},

Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Tonotopic map plasticity in the adult auditory cortex (AC) is a well
   established and oft-cited measure of auditory associative learning in
   classical conditioning paradigms. However, its necessity as an enduring
   memory trace has been debated, especially given a recent finding that
   the areal expansion of core AC tuned to a newly relevant frequency range
   may arise only transiently to support auditory learning. This has been
   reinforced by an ethological paradigm showing that map expansion is not
   observed for ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) or for ultrasound
   frequencies in postweaning dams for whom USVs emitted by pups acquire
   behavioral relevance. However, whether transient expansion occurs during
   maternal experience is not known, and could help to reveal the
   generality of cortical map expansion as a correlate for auditory
   learning. We thus mapped the auditory cortices of maternal mice at
   postnatal time points surrounding the peak in pup USV emission, but
   found no evidence of frequency map expansion for the behaviorally
   relevant high ultrasound range in AC. Instead, regions tuned to low
   frequencies outside of the ultrasound range show progressively greater
   suppression of activity in response to the playback of ultrasounds or
   pup USVs for maternally experienced animals assessed at their pups'
   postnatal day 9 (P9) to P10, or postweaning. This provides new evidence
   for a lateral-band suppression mechanism elicited by behaviorally
   meaningful USVs, likely enhancing their population-level signal-to-noise
   ratio. These results demonstrate that tonotopic map enlargement has
   limits as a construct for conceptualizing how experience leaves neural
   memory traces within sensory cortex in the context of ethological
   auditory learning.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, generator maintenance scheduling has been implemented
   using highly conservative maintenance policies based on manufacturing
   specifications and engineering expertise on the type of generators.
   However, recent advances in sensor technology, signal processing, and
   embedded online diagnosis provide more unit-specific information on the
   degradation characteristics of the generators. In this two-paper study,
   we propose a new generation maintenance framework that integrates the
   sensor-driven predictive maintenance technologies with optimal
   maintenance scheduling models. In Part I, we propose a new mixed-integer
   optimization model for generation maintenance scheduling, which
   effectively incorporate the dynamic information of generators' health
   and maintenance cost provided by the Bayesian prognostic models. In Part
   II, we propose a framework that extends the maintenance model presented
   herein, and consider the effects of maintenance on network operation by
   coordinating generator maintenance schedules with the unit commitment
   and dispatch decisions. We introduce new reformulations and efficient
   algorithms for solving large-scale instances of the proposed maintenance
   scheduling model. Extensive computational studies using real-world
   degradation data demonstrates the effectiveness of the new framework.}},

   Single-Cell Analysis of the Side Population Assay}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The side population (SP) assay, a technique used in cancer and stem cell
   research, assesses the activity of ABC transporters on Hoechst staining
   in the presence and absence of transporter inhibition, identifying SP
   and non-SP cell (NSP) subpopulations by differential staining intensity.
   The interpretation of the assay is complicated because the
   transporter-mediated mechanisms fail to account for cell-to-cell
   variability within a population or adequately control the direct role of
   transporter activity on staining intensity. We hypothesized that
   differences in dye kinetics at the single-cell level, such as ABCG2
   transporter-mediated efflux and DNA binding, are responsible for the
   differential cell staining that demarcates SP/NSP identity. We report
   changes in A549 phenotype during time in culture and with TGF beta
   treatment that correlate with SP size. Clonal expansion of individually
   sorted cells re-established both SP and NSPs, indicating that SP
   membership is dynamic. To assess the validity of a purely kinetics-based
   interpretation of SP/NSP identity, we developed a computational approach
   that simulated cell staining within a heterogeneous cell population;
   this exercise allowed for the direct inference of the role of
   transporter activity and inhibition on cell staining. Our simulated SP
   assay yielded appropriate SP responses for kinetic scenarios in which
   high transporter activity existed in a portion of the cells and little
   differential staining occurred in the majority of the population. With
   our approach for single-cell analysis, we observed SP and NSP cells at
   both ends of a transporter activity continuum, demonstrating that
   features of transporter activity as well as DNA content are determinants
   of SP/NSP identity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are concerned with finding exact solutions for the
   stress fields of nonlinear solids with non- symmetric distributions of
   defects (or more generally finite eigenstrains) that are small
   perturbations of symmetric distributions of defects with known exact
   solutions. In the language of geometric mechanics, this corresponds to
   finding a deformation that is a result of a perturbation of the metric
   of the Riemannian material manifold. We present a general framework that
   can be used for a systematic analysis of this class of anelasticity
   problems. This geometric formulation can be thought of as a material
   analogue of the classical smallon-large theory in nonlinear elasticity.
   We use the present small-on-large anelasticity theory to find exact
   solutions for the stress fields of some non- symmetric distributions of
   screw dislocations in incompressible isotropic solids.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaics have developed
   rapidly because of novel device architectures and robust surface
   passivation schemes. Achieving controlled net doping remains an
   important unsolved challenge for this field. Herein we present a general
   molecular doping platform for CQD solids employing a library of metal
   organic complexes. Low effective ionization energy and high electron
   affinity complexes are shown to produce n- and p-doped CQD solids. We
   demonstrate the obvious advantage in solar cells by p-doping the CQD
   absorber layer. Employing photoemission spectroscopy, we identify two
   doping concentration regimes: lower concentrations lead to efficient
   doping, while higher concentrations also cause large surface dipoles
   creating energy barriers to carrier flow. Utilizing the lower
   concentration regime, we remove midgap electrons leading to 25\%
   enhancement in the power conversion efficiency relative to undoped
   cells. Given the vast number of available metal-organic complexes, this
   approach opens new and facile routes to tuning the properties of CQDs
   for various applications without necessarily resorting to new ligand

Abstract = {{Recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have also led to the
   development of novel nanomaterials, which ultimately increase potential
   health and environmental hazards. Interest in developing environmentally
   benign procedures for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles has been
   increased. The purpose is to minimize the negative impacts of synthetic
   procedures, their accompanying chemicals and derivative compounds. The
   exploitation of different biomaterials for the synthesis of
   nanoparticles is considered a valuable approach in green nanotechnology.
   Biological resources such as bacteria, algae fungi and plants have been
   used for the production of low-cost, energy-efficient, and nontoxic
   environmental friendly metallic nanoparticles. This review provides an
   overview of various reports of green synthesised zero valent metallic
   iron (ZVMI) and iron oxide (Fe2O3/Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) and
   highlights their substantial applications in environmental pollution
   control. This review also summarizes the ecotoxicological impacts of

Abstract = {{Research on green production methods for metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs)
   is growing, with the objective to overcome the potential hazards of
   these chemicals for a safer environment. In this study, facile,
   ecofriendly synthesis of copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles was
   successfully achieved using aqueous extract of Pterospermum acerifolium
   leaves. P. acerifolium-fabricated CuO nanoparticles were further
   characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Plant-mediated CuO
   nanoparticles were found to be oval shaped and well dispersed in
   suspension. XPS confirmed the elemental composition of P.
   acerifolium-mediated copper nanoparticles as comprised purely of copper
   and oxygen. DLS measurements and ion release profile showed that P.
   acerifolium-mediated copper nanoparticles were more stable than the
   engineered CuO NPs. Copper oxide nanoparticles are used in many
   applications; therefore, their potential toxicity cannot be ignored. A
   comparative study was performed to investigate the bio-toxic impacts of
   plant-synthesized and engineered CuO nanoparticles on water flea
   Daphnia. Experiments were conducted to investigate the 48-h acute
   toxicity of engineered CuO NPs and plant-synthesized nanoparticles.
   Lower EC50 value 0.102 +/- 0.019 mg/L was observed for engineered CuO
   NPs, while 0.69 +/- 0.226 mg/L was observed for plant-synthesized CuO
   NPs. Additionally, ion release from CuO nanoparticles and 48-h
   accumulation of these nano CuOs in daphnids were also calculated. Our
   findings thus suggest that the contribution of released ions from
   nanoparticles and particles/ions accumulation in Daphnia needs to be
   interpreted with care.}},

Abstract = {{Similarity measures are fundamental tools for identifying relationships
   within or across patent portfolios. Many bibliometric indicators are
   used to determine similarity measures; for example, bibliographic
   coupling, citation and co-citation, and co-word distribution. This paper
   aims to construct a hybrid similarity measure method based on multiple
   indicators to analyze patent portfolios. Two models are proposed:
   categorical similarity and semantic similarity. The categorical
   similarity model emphasizes international patent classifications (IPCs),
   while the semantic similarity model emphasizes textual elements. We
   introduce fuzzy set routines to translate the rough technical (sub-)
   categories of IPCs into defined numeric values, and we calculate the
   categorical similarities between patent portfolios using membership
   grade vectors. In parallel, we identify and highlight core terms in a 3
   level tree structure and compute the semantic similarities by comparing
   the tree-based structures. A weighting model is designed to consider: 1)
   the bias that exists between the categorical and semantic similarities,
   and 2) the weighting or integrating strategy for a hybrid method. A case
   study to measure the technological similarities between selected firms
   in China's medical device industry is used to demonstrate the
   reliability our method, and the results indicate the practical meaning
   of our method in a broad range of informetric applications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Multifilter phase imaging with partially coherent light (MFPI-PC) is a

   transfer function is derived. This enables the MFPI-PC to be extended to
   the realistic nonparaxial case. Simulations over a wide range of test
   phase objects as well as experimental measurements on a microlens array
   verify higher levels of imaging accuracy compared to the paraxial
   method. Unlike the paraxial version, the nonparaxial MFPI-PC with
   obliquity factor correction exhibits no systematic error. In addition,
   due to its analytical expression, the increase in computation time
   compared to the paraxial version is negligible. (C) 2016 Optical Society

   Production Management}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Traditional construction planning, which depends on historical data and
   heuristic modification, prevents the integration of managerial details
   such as productivity dynamics. Specifically, the distance between
   planning and execution brings cost overruns and duration extensions. To
   minimize variations, this research presents a Building Information
   Modeling (BIM)-integrated simulation framework for predicting
   productivity dynamics at the construction planning phase. To develop
   this framework, we examined critical factors affecting productivity at
   the operational level, and then forecast the productivity dynamics. The
   resulting plan includes specific commands for retrieving the required
   information from BIM and executing operation simulations. It consists of
   the following steps: (1) preparing a BIM model to produce input data;
   (2) composing a construction simulation at the operational level; and
   (3) obtaining productivity dynamics from the BIM-integrated simulation.
   To validate our framework, we applied it to a structural steel model;
   this was due to the significance of steel erections. By integrating BIM
   with construction operation simulations, we were able to create reliable
   construction plans that adapted to project changes. Our results show
   that the developed framework facilitates the reliable prediction of
   productivity dynamics, and can contribute to improved schedule
   reliability, optimized resource allocation, cost savings associated with
   buffers, and reduced material waste.}},

   Evaluation Based on Vorticity Field. Part II: Transport Analysis}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Mixing characteristics of multi-chambered contact tank are analyzed
   employing the validated three-dimensional numerical model developed in
   the companion paper. Based on the flow characterization, novel
   volumetric mixing efficiency definitions are proposed for the assessment
   of the hydrodynamic and chemical transport properties of the contact
   tank and its chambers. Residence time distribution functions are
   analyzed not only at the outlet of each chamber but also inside the
   chambers using the efficiency definitions for both Reynolds averaged
   Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) results. A novel
   tracer mixing index is defined to characterize short circuiting and
   mixing effects of the contact system. Comparisons of the results of
   these indexes for RANS and LES solutions indicate that mixing
   characteristics are stronger in LES due to the unsteady turbulent eddy
   mixing even though short circuiting effects are also more prominent in
   LES results. This result indicates that the mixing analysis based on the
   LES results simulates the mixing characteristics instantaneously, which
   is more realistic than that in RANS. Since LES analysis can capture
   turbulent eddy mixing better than RANS analysis, the interaction of
   recirculation and jet zones are captured more effectively in LES, which
   tends to predict higher turbulent mixing in the contact system. The
   analysis also shows that the mixing efficiency of each chamber of the
   contact tank is different, thus it is necessary to consider distinct
   chemical release and volumetric designs for each chamber in order to
   maximize the mixing efficiency of the overall process in a contact tank
   system.}},

Title = {{Unified Analysis of Multi-Chamber Contact Tanks and Mixing Efficiency
   Based on Vorticity Field. Part I: Hydrodynamic Analysis}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multi-chamber contact tanks have been extensively used in industry for
   water treatment to provide potable water to communities, which is
   essential for human health. To evaluate the efficiency of this treatment
   process, flow and tracer transport analysis have been used in the
   literature using Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy
   simulations (LES). The purpose of this study is two-fold. First a
   unifying analysis of the flow field is presented and similarities and
   differences in the numerical results that were reported in the
   literature are discussed. Second, the vorticity field is identified as
   the key parameter to use in separating the mean flow (jet zone) and the
   recirculating zones. Based on the concepts of vorticity gradient and
   flexion product, it is demonstrated that the separation of the
   recirculation zone and the jet zone, fluid-fluid flow separation, is
   possible. The separation of the recirculation zones and vortex core
   lines are characterized using the definition of the Lamb vector. The
   separated regions are used to characterize the mixing efficiency in the
   chambers of the contact tank. This analysis indicates that the
   recirculation zone and jet zone formation are three-dimensional and
   require simulations over a long period of time to reach stability. It is
   recognized that the characteristics of the jet zones and the
   recirculation zones are distinct for each chamber and they follow a
   particular pattern and symmetry between the alternating chambers.
   Hydraulic efficiency coefficients calculated for each chamber show that
   the chambers having an inlet adjacent to the free surface may be
   designed to have larger volumes than the chambers having wall bounded
   inlets to improve the efficiency of the contact tank. This is a simple
   design alternative that would increase the efficiency of the system.
   Other observations made through the chamber analysis are also
   informative in redefining the characteristics of the efficiency of the
   contact tank system.}},

Title = {{Harmonic Differential Quadrature Analysis of Soft-Core Sandwich Panels
   under Locally Distributed Loads}},
Journal = {{Applied Sciences-Basel}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sandwich structures are widely used in practice and thus various
   engineering theories adopting simplifying assumptions are available.
   However, most engineering theories of beams, plates and shells cannot
   recover all stresses accurately through their constitutive equations.
   Therefore, the soft-core is directly modeled by two-dimensional (2D)
   elasticity theory without any pre-assumption on the displacement field.
   The top and bottom faces act like the elastic supports on the top and
   bottom edges of the core. The differential equations of the 2D core are
   then solved by the harmonic differential quadrature method (HDQM). To
   circumvent the difficulties in dealing with the locally distributed load
   by point discrete methods such as the HDQM, a general and rigorous way
   is proposed to treat the locally distributed load. Detailed formulations
   are provided. The static behavior of sandwich panels under different
   locally distributed loads is investigated. For verification, results are
   compared with data obtained by ABAQUS with very fine meshes. A high
   degree of accuracy on both displacement and stress has been observed.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although many psychometric tests, like the Raven's Progressive Matrices
   test, are commonly evaluated according to total score, additional
   variables can lend insight into the underlying cognitive processes of
   the test takers. We examine conceptual errors on the Raven's Standard
   Progressive Matrices (SPM) test. We present a new, complete
   classification of error types on the SPM using a two-kind coding scheme.
   We also present a new method for analyzing group errors patterns on
   these kinds of tests. We present two examples of this analysis using our
   SPM error classification. The first looks at the errors made by an
   artificial intelligence model of Raven's problem solving. The second
   example looks at the errors made by children and adults who are
   typically developing or have been diagnosed with autism. We close by
   discussing implications of this error classification and analysis method
   for the interpretation of SPM scores, towards a better understanding of
   the diversity of cognitive processes involved in Raven's problem
   solving. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NASA is actively funding research into advanced, unconventional aircraft
   and engine architectures to achieve drastic reductions in vehicle fuel
   burn, noise, and emissions. One such concept is being explored by The
   Boeing Company, the General Electric Company, Virginia Polytechnic
   Institute and State University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology
   under the Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research Project. A major
   cornerstone of this research is evaluating the potential performance
   benefits that can be attributed to using hybrid-electric propulsion.
   Hybrid-electric propulsion in this context involves a non-Brayton power
   generation or storage source, such as a battery or a fuel cell that can
   be used to provide additional propulsive energy to a conventional
   Brayton-cycle-powered turbofan engine. This research constructs an
   integrated Numerical Propulsion System Simulation hybrid-electric
   propulsion model capable of predicting hybrid-electric engine
   performance throughout the operational envelope. The system consists of
   a battery-powered motor partially driving the low-pressure shaft of a
   conventional turbofan engine. The applied motor power adds an additional
   degree of freedom, along with power setting, available to the aircraft
   designer during mission analysis. Modeling features and issues unique to
   hybrid-electric propulsion systems are described, and a vehicle trade
   study is carried out to determine the optimum engine cycle for both a
   cryogenic and conventionally driven motor system.}},

Abstract = {{A nonnegligible fraction of the charged particles in the Hall current
   thruster plume completes the electrical circuit through the conductive
   wall of a ground-based vacuum test facility. The resultant electrical
   circuit is different from the electrical circuit completed by the Hall
   current thruster in the onorbit environment. To understand the
   electrical circuit created in ground-based testing, this work examines
   the effect of an electrically biased metal plate, placed in the
   far-field plume of a Hall current thruster, on the plasma plume
   characteristics, the Hall current thruster thrust, and the electron
   termination pathways. An Aerojet Rocketdyne T-140 Hall current thruster
   is operated at 300V and 10.3 A on xenon propellant. The operational
   neutral background pressure is 7.3x10-6torr, corrected for xenon. Two
   aluminum plates, one representative of the radial wall of the vacuum
   chamber and one representative of the axial wall of the vacuum chamber,
   are placed 2.3m radially outward from the thruster centerline and 4.3m
   axially downstream from the discharge channel exit plane, respectively.
   At each axial bias plate voltage, measurements of thrust, electrical
   characteristics of the Hall current thruster, thruster body electrical
   waveform, and radial-axial plate waveforms are recorded. A Langmuir
   probe, a Faraday probe, and an emissive probe are placed 1m downstream
   of the Hall current thruster exit plane. The cathode-to-ground voltage
   and plasma potential behavior closely follow the trends observed from
   in-flight measurements of the Small Missions for Advanced Research in
   Technology-1 PPS-1350 Hall current thruster. This investigation
   experimentally quantifies the impact of the varying in-flight plasma
   plume conditions on Hall current thruster operation in a ground-based
   vacuum facility.}},

Abstract = {{A well-known intragranular dislocation source, the Frank-Read (FR)
   source plays an important role in size-dependent dislocation
   multiplication in crystalline materials. Despite a number of studies in
   this topic, a systematic investigation of multiple aspects of the FR
   source in different materials is lacking. In this paper, we employ large
   scale quasistatic concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) simulations to
   model an edge dislocation bowing out from an FR source in Cu, Ni, and
   Al. First, a number of quantities that are important for the FR source
   process are quantified in the coarse-grained domain. Then, two key
   characteristics of the FR source, including the critical shear stress
   and critical dislocation configuration, are investigated. In all
   crystalline materials, the critical stresses and the aspect ratio of the
   dislocation half-loop height to the FR source length scale well with
   respect to the FR source length. In Al, the critical stress calculated
   by CAC simulations for a given FR source length agrees reasonably well
   with a continuum model that explicitly includes the dislocation core
   energy. Nevertheless, the predictions of the isotropic elastic theory do
   not accurately capture the FR source responses in Cu and Ni, which have
   a relatively large stacking fault width and elastic anisotropy. Our
   results highlight the significance of directly simulating the FR source
   activities using fully 3D models and shed light on developing more
   accurate continuum models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   cell) augmented with cyclic-Bloch boundary conditions. Analogously, the
   equations of electrostatics appearing in Kohn-Sham theory can be reduced
   to the fundamental domain augmented with cyclic boundary conditions. By
   making use of this symmetry cell reduction, we show that the electronic
   ground-state energy and the Hellmann-Feynman forces on the atoms can be
   calculated using quantities defined over the fundamental domain. We
   develop a symmetry-adapted finite-difference discretization scheme to
   obtain a fully functional numerical realization of the proposed
   approach. We verify that our formulation and implementation of Cyclic
   DFT is both accurate and efficient through selected examples.
   The connection of cyclic symmetries with uniform bending deformations
   provides an elegant route to the ab-initio study of bending in
   nanostructures using Cyclic DFT. As a demonstration of this capability,
   we simulate the uniform bending of a silicene nanoribbon and obtain its
   energy-curvature relationship from first principles. A self-consistent
   ab-initio simulation of this nature is unprecedented and well outside
   the scope of any other systematic first principles method in existence.
   Our simulations reveal that the bending stiffness of the silicene
   nanoribbon is intermediate between that of graphene and molybdenum
   disulphide a trend which can be ascribed to the variation in effective
   thickness of these materials. We describe several future avenues and
   applications of Cyclic DFT, including its extension to the study of
   non-uniform bending deformations and its possible use in the study of
   the nanoscale flexoelectric effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes three strong second order cone programming (SOCP)
   relaxations for the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem. These three
   relaxations are incomparable to each other and two of them are
   incomparable to the standard SDP relaxation of OPF. Extensive
   computational experiments show that these relaxations have numerous
   advantages over existing convex relaxations in the literature: (i) their
   solution quality is extremely close to that of the standard SDP
   relaxation (the best one is within 99. 96\% of the SDP relaxation on
   average for all the IEEE test cases) and consistently outperforms
   previously proposed convex quadratic relaxations of the OPF problem,
   (ii) the solutions from the strong SOCP relaxations can be directly used
   as a warm start in a local solver such as IPOPT to obtain a high quality
   feasible OPF solution, and (iii) in terms of computation times, the
   strong SOCP relaxations can be solved an order of magnitude faster than
   the standard SDP relaxation. For example, one of the proposed SOCP
   relaxations together with IPOPT produces a feasible solution for the
   largest instance in the IEEE test cases (the 3375-bus system) and also
   certifies that this solution is within 0.13\% of global optimality, all
   this computed within 157.20 seconds on a modest personal computer.
   Overall, the proposed strong SOCP relaxations provide a practical
   approach to obtain feasible OPF solutions with extremely good quality
   within a time framework that is compatible with the real-time operation
   in the current industry practice.}},

Title = {{Optimality Gap of Constant-Order Policies Decays Exponentially in the
   Lead Time for Lost Sales Models}},
Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1556-1565}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Inventory models with lost sales and large lead times have traditionally
   been considered intractable due to the curse of dimensionality.
   Recently, Goldberg and coauthors laid the foundations for a new approach
   to solving these models, by proving that as the lead time grows large, a
   simple constant-order policy is asymptotically optimal. However, the
   bounds proven there require the lead time to be very large before the
   constant-order policy becomes effective, in contrast to the good
   numerical performance demonstrated by Zipkin even for small lead time
   values. In this work, we prove that for the infinite-horizon variant of
   the same lost sales problem, the optimality gap of the same
   constant-order policy actually converges exponentially fast to zero,
   with the optimality gap decaying to zero at least as fast as the
   exponential rate of convergence of the expected waiting time in a
   related single-server queue to its steady-state value. We also derive
   simple and explicit bounds for the optimality gap, and demonstrate good
   numerical performance across a wide range of parameter values for the
   special case of exponentially distributed demand. Our main proof
   technique combines convexity arguments with ideas from queueing theory.}},

Title = {{Inferring phage-bacteria infection networks from time-series data}},
Journal = {{Royal Society Open Science}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In communities with bacterial viruses (phage) and bacteria, the
   phage-bacteria infection network establishes which virus types infect
   which host types. The structure of the infection network is a key
   element in understanding community dynamics. Yet, this infection network
   is often difficult to ascertain. Introduced over 60 years ago, the
   plaque assay remains the gold standard for establishing who infects whom
   in a community. This culture-based approach does not scale to
   environmental samples with increased levels of phage and bacterial
   diversity, much of which is currently unculturable. Here, we propose an
   alternative method of inferring phage-bacteria infection networks. This
   method uses time-series data of fluctuating population densities to
   estimate the complete interaction network without having to test each
   phage-bacteria pair individually. We use in silico experiments to
   analyse the factors affecting the quality of network reconstruction and
   find robust regimes where accurate reconstructions are possible. In
   addition, we present a multi-experiment approach where time series from
   different experiments are combined to improve estimates of the infection
   network. This approach also mitigates against the possibility of
   evolutionary changes to relevant phenotypes during the time course of
   measurement.}},

   analyzing the degree of mixing of two streams, one with fluorescence and

   beads orbiting at a high velocity as compared to flow down the channel
   cause the fluid to form circular coronae that stretch across the

Abstract = {{We present a Matlab implementation of topology optimization for fluid
   flow problems in the educational computer code PolyTop (Talischi et al.
   2012b). The underlying formulation is the well-established porosity
   approach of Borrvall and Petersson (2003), wherein a dissipative term is
   introduced to impede the flow in the solid (non-fluid) regions.
   Polygonal finite elements are used to obtain a stable low-order
   discretization of the governing Stokes equations for incompressible
   viscous flow. As a result, the same mesh represents the design field as
   well as the velocity and pressure fields that characterize its response.
   Owing to the modular structure of PolyTop, incorporating new physics, in
   this case modeling fluid flow, involves changes that are limited mainly
   to the analysis routine. We provide several numerical examples to
   illustrate the capabilities and use of the code. To illustrate the
   modularity of the present approach, we extend the implementation to
   accommodate alternative formulations and cost functions. These include
   topology optimization formulations where both viscosity and inverse
   permeability are functions of the design; and flow control where the
   velocity at a certain location in the domain is maximized in a
   prescribed direction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops Lyapunov and converse Lyapunov theorems for
   stochastic semistable nonlinear dynamical systems. Semistability is the
   property whereby the solutions of a stochastic dynamical system almost

   conditions. Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient Lyapunov
   conditions for stochastic semistability and show that stochastic

Abstract = {{We report on in situ observations of nucleation, growth, and aggregation
   of hybrid organic inorganic perovskites by liquid-cell transmission
   electron microscopy. Direct crystallization of hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 nanop
   articles is achieved through an electron beam-assisted solvent
   evaporation approach. Time-lapse liquid-cell TEM imaging of the nanop
   articles reveals a growth trend which is not entirely consistent with
   the classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner growth model. Significantly
   complex dynamical behaviors are observed during the coalescence process
   of CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles. We propose that the chemical instability
   inherent in the hybrid perovskite iodides should be considered to
   understand this phenomenon in addition to the oriented attachment
   mechanism. This study provides a useful reference for understanding the
   intriguing chemical and physical properties of hybrid organic inorganic
   perovskites.}},

Abstract = {{It remains a challenge to synthesize Ag nanocubes in an aqueous system,
   although the polyol process was successfully adopted more than one
   decade ago. Here, we report an aqueous method for the synthesis of Ag
   nanocubes with an average edge length of 35-95 nm. It involves the
   formation of AgCl octahedra by mixing CF3COOAg with
   cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, followed by the nucleation and growth
   of Ag nanocrystals in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and FeCl3. The
   Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair is responsible for the removal of multiply twinned
   seeds through oxidative etching. The Cl- ions play two critical roles in
   the nucleation and growth of Ag nanocubes with a single-crystal
   structure. First, the Cl- ions react with Ag+ ions to generate
   nanometer-sized AgCl octahedra in the initial stage of a synthesis. In
   the presence of room light and a proper reducing agent such as AA, the
   AgCl can be reduced to generate Ag nuclei followed by their evolution
   into single-crystal seeds and then Ag nanocrystals. Second, the Cl- ions
   can act as a specific capping agent toward the Ag(100) surface, enabling
   the formation of Ag nanocubes with sharp corners and edges. Based on the
   results from a set of time-lapse studies and control experiments, we
   formulate a plausible mechanism to account for the formation of Ag
   nanocubes that resembles the formation and development of latent image
   centers in silver halide grains in the photographic process.}},

Abstract = {{The pyro-phototronic effect is based on the coupling among photo

   dramatically enhanced by 18\% and 152\% under indoor light illumination,
   respectively. This study realizes the performance enhancement of
   pyroelectric semiconductor materials-based solar cells via a

Abstract = {{Recently, a self-charging power unit consisting of an energy harvesting
   device and an energy storage device set the foundation for building a
   self-powered wearable system. However, the flexibility of the power unit
   working under extremely complex deformations (e.g., stretching,
   twisting, and bending) becomes a key issue. Here, we present a prototype
   of an all-in-one shape-adaptive self-charging power unit that can be
   used for scavenging random body motion energy under complex mechanical
   deformations and then directly storing it in a supercapacitor unit to
   build up a self-powered system for wearable electronics. A kirigami
   paper based supercapacitor (KP-SC) was designed to work as the flexible
   energy storage device (stretchability up to 215\%). An ultrastretchable
   and shape-adaptive silicone rubber triboelectric nanogenerator (SR-TENG)
   was utilized as the flexible energy harvesting device. By combining them
   with a rectifier, a stretchable, twistable, and bendable, self-charging
   power package was achieved for sustainably driving wearable electronics.
   This work provides a potential platform for the flexible self-powered
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{We report the measurement of the 1(1)sigma 2(1)sigma transition of CaH+
   by resonance-enhanced photodissociation of CaH+ that is co-trapped with
   laser-cooled Ca+. We observe four resonances that we assign to
   transitions from the vibrational v=0 ground state to the v=1-4 excited
   states based on theoretical predictions. A simple theoretical model that
   assumes instantaneous dissociation after resonant excitation yields
   results in good agreement with the observed spectral features except for
   the unobserved v=0 peak. This discrepancy is attributed to an
   insufficient understanding of the dissociation process, and further
   experimental and theoretical studies are required to confirm the
   assignment. The resolution of our experiment is limited by the
   mode-locked excitation laser, but this survey spectroscopy enables
   future rotationally resolved studies with applications in astrochemistry
   and precision measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining low and smooth impedance over a wide range of frequency is
   one of the main issues in designing high-speed digital systems or mixed
   signal integrated circuits. Cavity resonances of a printed circuit board
   coupled with discontinuous return current paths, series inductance of
   the power distribution network, and parasitic inductance make potentials
   at power/ground planes unstable. One possible solution to improve power
   integrity and electromagnetic interference is to utilize a
   magnetodielectric absorber on the perimeter of the board. A
   mode-matching method and an impedance boundary condition are employed to
   obtain a computationally inexpensive model of the system. A contour plot
   of transfer impedance versus normalized surface impedance is introduced
   to provide useful information for determining the most suitable
   absorber. Numerical and measurement results are discussed. The results
   from the proposed modeling agree with those from the measurement and the
   simulation. The selected absorber effectively reduces self-impedance and
   transfer impedance at resonant frequencies, but resonances are not
   completely eliminated at low frequencies due to the low loss of the
   absorber.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a fast and robust phase estimation algorithm (PEA),
   a counterpart of the phase-locked loop (PLL), for heavily distorted grid
   conditions. The PEA, named as the WLSE-PEA, consists of the moving
   average filter (MAF), the weighted least squares estimation (WLSE), the
   frequency-locked loop (FLL), and the zero crossing detection (ZCD). The
   MAF can eliminate all the odd-order harmonics in the distorted grid
   voltages. The WLSE is employed to estimate the fundamental
   positive-sequence component. The combination of the ZCD and the FLL
   enables the WLSE-PEA to be adaptive to frequency deviations. Compared
   with some advanced phase-locked loops, the proposed WLSE-PEA has a
   faster response. Also, it is robust to common grid disturbances
   including three-phase unbalances, dc offsets, harmonics, phase jumps,
   and voltage sags. Simulation and experimental results have verified the
   effectiveness and advantages of the WLSE-PEA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and thorough on-wafer characterization of
   two G-band low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) implemented using 0.13-mu m
   silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) with
   peak f(T)/f(max) of 300/500 GHz. The impact of the substrate network and
   optimized via interconnections on the SiGe HBT performance is
   investigated to ensure that maximum performance is extracted from each
   SiGe HBT. The two LNAs are separately implemented using only cascode
   pairs and only common-emitter (CE) SiGe HBTs to determine which
   configuration yields better performance in a multistage G-band LNA. The
   cascode LNA achieves a peak gain of 24.0 dB at 158 GHz with a mean noise
   figure (NF) of 8.2 dB from 145 to 165 GHz, while the CE LNA achieves a
   17.2 dB of gain at 183 GHz with a mean NF of 8.0 dB across 165-200 GHz.
   A novel implementation of blackbody noise sources for on-wafer Y-factor
   NF measurements reduces the waveguide length needed to transition
   between the antenna and the probe, which significantly reduces the
   sensitivity to jitter. To the authors' knowledge, these LNAs achieve the
   lowest reported NF of all SiGe LNAs at these frequencies to date, and
   the results demonstrate that SiGe HBTs are viable options for
   millimeter-wave performance-constrained applications.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-stream carrier aggregation (MSCA) has been recently proposed as a
   mechanism to increase the amount of bandwidth available to users for
   heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in 5G wireless systems. Previous
   studies have focused only on maximizing the network capacity and
   fairness, without considering the energy efficiency of the MSCA. In this
   paper, the use of MSCA to minimize the energy consumption in a
   multi-layer HetNet is studied. The convexity of the energy minimization
   problem is examined, leading to the need of a quasi-convex relaxation.
   With this approximation, an algorithm bisection method for energy
   minimization is designed to solve the energy minimization problem and
   obtains an optimum cell-association policy. Since the operators are
   generally interested in a balance between the energy minimization and
   capacity maximization, such multi-objective optimization is needed, and
   we studied it in this paper. The two aforementioned conflicting
   objectives can be jointly analyzed and solved through scalarization,
   even though the energy minimization has a quasi-convex objective
   function, and not a convex one. Performance evaluation is provided to
   identify the achievable energy savings of our proposed algorithm and to
   characterize the tradeoffs between the energy minimization and capacity
   maximization in a multilayer HetNet in 5G systems that support MSCA.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogel scaffolds encapsulating C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells have
   been engineered as in vitro constructs towards regenerative medicine
   therapies for the enhancement and inducement of functional skeletal
   muscle formation. Previous work has largely involved two-dimensional
   (2D) muscle strips, naturally occurring hydrogels and incomplete
   examination of the effects of the scaffold and/or biological
   functionalization on myogenic differentiation in a controllable manner.
   The goal of this study was to identify key properties in functionalized
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-maleimide (MAL) synthetic hydrogels that
   promote cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation for the
   formation of multinucleated myotubes and functional skeletal muscle
   tissue constructs. Significant differences in myoblast viability were
   observed as a function of cell seeding density, polymer weight
   percentage and bioadhesive ligands. The identified optimized conditions
   for cell survival, required for myotube development, were carried over
   for differentiation assays. PEG hydrogels (5\% weight/volume),
   functionalized with 2.0mm RGD adhesive peptide and crosslinked with
   protease-cleavable peptides, incubated for 3days before supplementation
   with 2\% horse serum, significantly increased expression of
   differentiated skeletal muscle markers by 50\%; 17\% more multinucleated
   cells and a 40\% increase in the number of nuclei/differentiated cell
   compared to other conditions. Functionality of cell-laden hydrogels was
   demonstrated by a 20\% decrease in the extruded length of the hydrogel
   when stimulated with a contractile agent, compared to 7\% for a saline
   control. This study provided strategies to engineer a three-dimensional
   (3D) microenvironment, using synthetic hydrogels to promote the
   development of differentiated muscle tissue from skeletal muscle
   progenitor cells to form contractile units. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Abstract = {{Solution-based fabrication methods can greatly reduce the cost and

   fabricated by spin coating methods on glass substrates with two
   different ITO sources: ( 1) a commercial ITO nanopowder water dispersion
   and ( 2) a sol-gel ITO solution. A simple and fast air annealing process
   was used to treat as-coated ITO films on a controlled temperature hot
   plate. Thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray diffraction showed that
   highly crystalline ITO films were formed after the annealing steps. The
   final ITO films had a good combination of optical properties and
   electrical properties, especially for films made from five layers of
   sol-gel ITO (92.66\% transmittance and 8.7. x. 10(-3) Omega cm
   resistivity). The surface morphology and conducting network on the ITO
   films were characterized by non-contact and current atomic force
   microscopy. It was found that conducting paths were only partially
   connected for the nanoparticle ITO dispersion films, whereas the sol-gel
   ITO films had a more uniformly distributed conducting network on the
   surface. We also used the sol-gel ITO films to fabricate a simple liquid
   crystal display (LCD) device to demonstrate the excellent properties of
   our films.}},

   the framework of Jones calculus. It is analytically shown that the
   building block of such a metamirror needs to simultaneously break the
   n-fold rotational (n > 2) symmetry and mirror symmetry. By combining two
   layers of anisotropic metamaterial structures, a circular dichroism
   metamirror is designed in the mid-infrared region, which shows perfect
   reflectance for left-handed circularly polarized light without reversing
   its handedness, while it almost completely absorbs right-handed
   circularly polarized light. These findings offer a new methodology to
   implement novel photonic devices for a variety of applications,
   including polarimetric imaging, molecular spectroscopy, and quantum
   information processing.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature-induced gelation of chitosan/glycerophosphate (Chs/GP)
   systems through physical interactions has shown great potential for
   various biomedical applications. In the present work, hydroxyethyl
   cellulose (HEC) was added to the thermosensitive Chs/GP solution to
   improve the mechanical strength and gel properties of the incipient
   Chs/HEC/GP gel in comparison with the Chs/GP hydrogel at body
   temperature. The physical features of the macro molecular complexes
   formed by the synergistic interaction between chitosan and hydroxyethyl
   cellulose in the presence of beta-glycerophosphate disodium salt
   solution have been studied essentially from a rheological point of view.
   The temperature and time sweep rheological characterizations of the
   thermogelling systems revealed that the sol-gel transition temperature
   of the Chs/HEC/GP blends is equal to 37 degrees C at neutral pH; with
   increasing HEC content in the solutions, more compact networks with
   considerably improved gel strength are formed without influencing the
   gelation time. The formed hydrogel matrix has enough mechanical
   integrity and adequate strength for using it as injectable in situ
   forming matrices for biomedical applications. The classical
   Winter-Chambon (W-C) and Fredrickson-Larson (F-L) theories were applied
   to determine the gel point. In view of the obtained results, it is shown
   that the F-L theory can be employed as a robust and less tedious method
   than the W-C approach to precisely determine the gel point in these
   systems. At the end, molecular simulation studies were conducted by
   using ab initio quantum mechanics (QM) calculations carried out on Chs
   and HEC models, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of solvated
   Chs/HEC blend systems showed the binding behavior of Chs/HEC polymers.
   Analyses of interaction energy, radial distribution function, and
   hydrogen bonding from simulation studies strongly supported the
   experimental results; they all disclosed that hydrogen-bond formation
   between Chs moieties with regard to HEC chains plays an important role
   for the stabilization of the complexes.}},

Title = {{Fractal dimensions of metropolitan area road networks and the impacts on
   the urban built environment}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},

Abstract = {{The fractal dimension of road networks emerges as a measure of the
   complexity of road transport infrastructures. In this study, we measured
   fractal dimensions of both the geometric form (i.e., the layout of the
   roads) and structure hierarchy (i.e., the connections among roads) of
   the major road networks in the, largest 95 U.S. metro areas. We
   explained the causes of the variances in these fractal dimensions,
   especially the one for structure hierarchy. Further, we hypothesized the
   impacts of these fractal dimensions on the urban built environment and
   validated our hypotheses using path analysis. We found that a larger
   geometric fractal dimension (D-g) shows a more uniform distribution of
   roads over the metro area, which provides the accessibility to suburban
   areas and incentives to low-density development. A larger structural
   fractal dimension (D-s) indicates the highly-connected roads (e.g.,
   highways) tend to join to other highly-connected roads so that most
   roads can be reached by a small number of neighboring roads (i.e., the
   small-world phenomenon). As D-s increases and the small-world effect
   become more significant, daily vehicle miles traveled per capita
   (DVMT/Cap) decline. However, D-s should be kept low in order to reduce
   the DVMT/Cap as population size increases. We consider that the low D-s
   can contribute to more mixed, polycentric and more uniform on an urban
   area-wide basis. Overall, higher D-g and D-s of the major road network
   in a metro area leads to higher per capita carbon emissions of
   transport, and lower quality of life as population increases. In the
   end, we conclude that fractal dimensions can provide valuable insight
   into the nature of the transportation land use nexus. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a dual-carrier vital sign detection scheme based on
   phase-locked loop to automatically reduce the noise introduced by
   residual phase noise and transmission paths. Two phase-locked microwave
   signals at 5.76 and 5.68 GHz are adopted to suppress noise and extract
   the vital sign, respectively. When the feedback beat signal is locked to
   the highly stable low-noise reference, the residual phase noise and path
   noise of the corresponding 5.76-GHz wave are reduced, providing
   low-noise circumstances for the 5.68-GHz carrier, which has the same
   path. Additionally, the 5.68-GHz carrier is phase modulated by the vital
   sign, thus its demodulation leads to a vital sign of low noise level and
   high spectral purity. The experimental results show that our system
   based on discrete components introduces no extra noise, has a 12-dB
   improvement in the signal to noise ratio at the 10-Hz frequency offset,
   and can effectively measure both respiration and heartbeat signals in
   four physical orientations at a distance of 50 cm. In addition, by
   suppressing the residual phase noise and path noise, the detection
   distance of the weak heartbeat signal from the front of the human
   subject is extended to at least 250 cm, which is more than double the
   distance of a system without the noise suppression scheme.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{542}},
Pages = {{884-895}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Hershfield factor (H) is a multiplier aiming to correct the error
   between fixed time interval maxima (F-maxima) and sliding maxima
   (S-maxima) as a direct consequence of temporal discretization of
   hydrometeorological time series. Rainfall is typically recorded over
   discrete intervals, e.g., over fixed 24-h intervals, and the historical
   series express average values over these intervals. This temporal
   discretization introduces an important systematic error on rainfall
   characteristics such as the annual maxima. Research to date suggests
   that our understanding of this error across different time scales is
   limited. In this study we revisit the probabilistic nature of the
   H-factor in an unprecedentedly large analysis comprising thousands of
   up-to-date hourly records across the US. We study the probabilistic
   behavior of F- and S-maxima of the historical records. We quantify the
   discretization error of the rainfall maxima and its statistical
   properties at different time scales. We revisit the classical
   definitions of the H-factor and we investigate the exact probability
   distribution of H-factor. We introduce a bounded exponential
   distribution with an atom at one, which closely depicts the empirical
   distribution of the H-factor. Notable is the result that the proposed
   mixed-type distribution is invariant across a range of time scales. This
   work clarifies the probabilistic nature of the rainfall maxima
   correction. The results may have wide use across a range of hydrological
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method, referred to here as back-EMF method,
   for sensing the multi-DOF motion of a permanent magnet spherical motor
   (PMSM). With an explicit model characterizing the magnetic flux in the
   PMSM, a relationship between the electromotive force (EMF) induced in
   the winding of electro-magnets and the motion of the rotor permanent
   magnets is derived; and closed-form solutions that solves for multi-DOF
   Euler angles and angular velocities of the rotor are presented. This
   method allows for simultaneous estimation of both quantities in
   real-time by only measuring the voltages across the electro-magnets.
   Requiring no installation of additional sensors or fixtures on the
   rotor, the back-EMF method retains the structural simplicity of the
   PMSM. This method has been experimentally investigated on a prototype
   PMSM; the estimated Euler angles and angular velocities compare
   favorably with measurements from a commercialized gyroscope. As an
   immediate application, the motion states acquired using the back-EMF
   method are used for parameter estimation of the PMSM. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This problem involves optimizing product collection and redistribution
   from production locations to a set of processing plants over a planning
   horizon. This horizon consists of several days, and the
   collection-redistribution is performed on a repeating daily basis. A
   single routing plan must be prepared for the whole horizon, taking into
   account the seasonal variations in the supply. We model the problem
   using a sequence of periods, each corresponding to a season. We propose
   an adaptive large-neighborhood search with several specifically designed
   operators and features. The results show the excellent performance of
   the algorithm in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract = {{Less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers operate networks of consolidation
   terminals, and route each customer shipment through a sequence of
   transfer terminals. At each terminal stop, a shipment is unloaded from
   an inbound trailer and reloaded onto an outbound trailer. A load plan
   determines the specific path of terminals to be used to transfer freight
   moving between each origin and destination. The design of the load plan
   determines the line-haul transportation and handling costs required to
   serve customers. This paper develops an effective neighborhood search
   heuristic for solving a natural integer programming model for LTL load
   plan design. During each iteration of the heuristic, a modified version
   of the integer programming model is solved to find improving changes
   freight transfer paths for a subset of the origin-destination terminal
   pairs. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, the modified model
   solved here allows the simultaneous rerouting of freight destined for
   multiple terminals during each neighborhood search iteration, yet
   remains computationally practical. Computational experiments using data
   from a large U.S. carrier show substantial cost improvements generated
   by increased freight consolidation, in the order of 6\%-7\%, accounting
   for over \$300,000 per week.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the remarkable progress in shape-controlled synthesis of
   noble-metal nanocrystals, there still exists a major gap between
   academic studies and industrial applications. This gap can be largely
   attributed to the inability to produce nanocrystals in large quantities
   while retaining uniformity and good control over both size and shape.
   Here we provide a new perspective on increasing the volume of production
   during a synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals via seed-mediated growth.
   We demonstrate that the yield of Pd octahedra and Pd@Pt3-4L (L: atomic
   layers) core-shell octahedra with different sizes can be increased from
   ca. 2mg to over 500mg without compromising the product quality.
   Specifically, we apply geometric and stoichiometric analyses to
   calculate the minimum amounts of reagents needed for the complete
   evolution of Pd cubic seeds into Pd octahedra, and subsequently for the
   formation of Pd@Pt3-4L core-shell octahedra through conformal Pt
   coating. The simple analyses allow us to obtain uniform products by
   avoiding homogeneous nucleation while minimizing the waste of reagents.}},

Abstract = {{In the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) for statistical learning
   and classification, aleatory uncertainty, because of randomness and
   epistemic uncertainty that is due to the lack of knowledge are not
   differentiated. In this paper, a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM)
   in the context of generalized interval probability theory is proposed.
   The parameters of GHMM are in the form of generalized interval
   probability, which provides a concise representation for the two kinds
   of uncertainty simultaneously. The generalized versions of the
   forward-backward, Viterbi, and Baum-Welch algorithms in GHMM are
   developed. The proposed algorithms take advantage of the algebraic
   property in the generalized interval probability. These algorithms
   provide an efficient approach to train the GHMM. The trained GHMM is
   used for state recognition with the criterion of maximum log-likelihood.
   A case study on recognizing the cutting states in manufacturing
   processes is provided to demonstrate the application of GHMM. The
   interval forms of the cutting signal are considered as the inputting of
   GHMM. The cutting states are recognized based on the learning algorithm
   of GHMM With the two uncertainty components quantified, the reliability
   of GHMM in state recognition is superior to that of HMM.}},

Abstract = {{Third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of polymethine dyes have
   been widely studied for applications such as all-optical switching.
   However, the limited accuracy of the current computational methodologies
   has prevented a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the lowest
   excited states and their influence on the molecular optical and NLO
   properties. Here, attention is paid to the lowest excited-state energies
   and their energetic ratio, as these characteristics impact the
   figure-of-merit for all-optical switching. For a series of model
   polymethines, we compare several algebraic diagrammatic construction
   (ADC) schemes for the polarization propagator with approximate
   second-order coupled cluster (CC2) theory, the widely used INDO/MRDCI
   approach and the symmetry adapted cluster configuration interaction
   (SAC-CI) algorithm incorporating singles and doubles linked excitation
   operators (SAC-CI SD-R). We focus in particular on the ground-to-excited
   state transition dipole moments and the corresponding state dipole
   moments, since these quantities are found to be of utmost importance for
   an effective description of the third-order polarizability gamma and
   two-photon absorption spectra. A sum-overstates expression has been
   used, which is, found to quickly converge. While ADC(3/2) has been found
   to be the most appropriate method to calculate these properties, CC2
   performs poorly.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There has been considerable research in the literature focused on
   computing and forecasting sea-level changes in terms of constant trends
   or rates. The Antarctic ice sheet is one of the main contributors to
   sea-level change with highly uncertain rates of glacial thinning and
   accumulation. Geodetic observing systems such as the Gravity Recovery
   and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the Global Positioning System (GPS)
   are routinely used to estimate these trends. In an effort to improve the
   accuracy and reliability of these trends, this study investigates a
   technique that allows the estimated rates, along with co-estimated
   seasonal components, to vary in time. For this, state space models are
   defined and then solved by a Kalman filter (KF). The reliable estimation
   of noise parameters is one of the main problems encountered when using a
   KF approach, which is solved by numerically optimizing likelihood. Since
   the optimization problem is non-convex, it is challenging to find an
   optimal solution. To address this issue, we limited the parameter search
   space using classical least-squares adjustment (LSA). In this context,
   we also tested the usage of inequality constraints by directly verifying
   whether they are supported by the data. The suggested technique for
   time-series analysis is expanded to classify and handle time-correlated
   observational noise within the state space framework. The performance of
   the method is demonstrated using GRACE and GPS data at the CAS1 station
   located in East Antarctica and compared to commonly used LSA. The
   results suggest that the outlined technique allows for more reliable
   trend estimates, as well as for more physically valuable
   interpretations, while validating independent observing systems.}},

Title = {{Local filtration based scatter correction for cone-beam CT using primary
   modulation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6199-6209}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Excessive scatter contamination fundamentally limits the image
   quality of cone-beam CT (CBCT), hindering its quantitative use in
   clinical applications. The author has previously proposed an effective
   scatter correction method for CBCT using primary modulation. A Fourier
   transform-based algorithm (FTPM) was implemented to estimate scatter
   from modulated projections, with a few limitations including the
   assumption of uniform modulation frequency and magnitude that becomes
   less accurate in the presence of beam-hardening and other nonideal
   effects. This paper aims to overcome the above drawbacks by developing a
   new algorithm for the primary modulation method with improved accuracy
   and reliability.
   Methods: Incident x-ray intensities for each detector pixel with and
   without the interception of the modulator blocker are estimated from a
   modulated flat-field image. A new signal relationship is then developed
   to obtain a first scatter estimate from a modulated projection using a
   spatially varying modulation distribution. The method empirically
   adjusts the effective modulation magnitude for each projection ray to
   account for the beam-hardening effects. Estimated scatter signals with
   high expected errors are discarded in the generation of the final
   scatter distribution. The author proposes a technique of local
   filtration to accelerate major portions of the signal processing, and
   the new algorithm is referred to as local filtration based primary
   modulation (LFPM).
   Results: The study on the Catphan (R) 600 phantom shows that LFPM
   effectively removes scatter-induced cupping artifacts on CBCT images and
   reduces the CT image error from 222 to 15 HU. In addition, the image
   contrast on eight contrast rods of the phantom is enhanced by a factor
   of 2 on average. On an anthropomorphic head phantom, LFPM reduces the CT
   image error from 153 to 18 HU and eliminates the streak artifacts
   observed on the result of FTPM with substantially improved image
   uniformity. On the Rando (R) phantom, LFPM reduces the CT image error
   from 278 to 4 HU around the object center.
   Conclusions: As compared with the previously developed FTPM algorithm,
   LFPM enhances the imaging performance by using a more flexible data
   processing framework that does not require projection data downsampling
   or uniform modulation frequency and magnitude. It also becomes possible
   to discard suspicious scatter estimate values prior to the generation of
   a final scatter distribution and to model the beam-hardening effects on
   modulation for improved scatter estimation accuracy. The presented
   research further exploits the potential of the primary modulation method
   on scatter correction and facilitates its clinical adoption in CBCT
   imaging. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor-liquid-solid nanowire growth below the bulk metal-semiconductor
   eutectic temperature is known for several systems; however, the
   fundamental processes that govern this behavior are poorly understood.
   Here, we show that hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the Ge nanowire sidewall
   enable AuGe catalyst supercooling and control Au transport. Our approach
   combines in situ infrared spectroscopy to directly and quantitatively
   determine hydrogen atom coverage with a ``regrowth{''} step that allows
   catalyst phase to be determined with ex situ electron microscopy.
   Maintenance of a supercooled catalyst with only hydrogen radical
   delivery confirms the centrality of sidewall chemistry. This work
   underscores the importance of the nanowire sidewall and its chemistry on
   catalyst state, identifies new methods to regulate catalyst composition,
   and provides synthetic strategies for subeutectic growth in other
   nanowire systems.}},

Abstract = {{We use persistent homology to build a quantitative understanding of
   large complex systems that are driven far-from-equilibrium. In
   particular, we analyze image time series of flow field patterns from
   numerical simulations of two important problems in fluid dynamics:
   Kolmogorov flow and Rayleigh-Benard convection. For each image we
   compute a persistence diagram to yield a reduced description of the flow
   field; by applying different metrics to the space of persistence
   diagrams, we relate characteristic features in persistence diagrams to
   the geometry of the corresponding flow patterns. We also examine the
   dynamics of the flow patterns by a second application of persistent
   homology to the time series of persistence diagrams. We demonstrate that
   persistent homology provides an effective method both for quotienting
   out symmetries in families of solutions and for identifying multiscale
   recurrent dynamics. Our approach is quite general and it is anticipated
   to be applicable to a broad range of open problems exhibiting complex
   spatio-temporal behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{In the existing fragility assessment, most bridges are short-span
   bridges and a few bridges have long spans such as cable-stayed bridges.
   In this study, a procedure is proposed to conduct the component and
   system seismic fragility analysis of long-span cable-stayed bridges.
   Three critical issues are addressed in the procedure: (1) the optimal
   intensity measure of cable-stayed bridges, (2) limit state models of
   various components, and (3) contribution of individual components to the
   entire system failure of bridges. This study chooses a long-span
   cable-stayed bridge with the most common configuration in China and
   builds the numerical model of its multiple components using OpenSEES
   that can account for their nonlinear response and uncertainties in the
   ground motion and material properties. Four typical intensity measures
   are compared with respect to four characteristic properties including
   efficiency, practicality, sufficiency, and proficiency. Peak ground
   velocity turns out to be the optimal intensity measure. Limit states of
   pylon sections are derived by a numerical simulation based on pushover
   analysis and China's guidelines. The pushover results indicate that the
   limit state of their section curvature depends highly on the section
   type and axial compression coefficient. A joint probabilistic seismic
   demand model and Monte Carlo simulation are employed to obtain an
   accurate system fragility estimate of cable-stayed bridges by accounting
   for the contribution of each component to the overall bridge system. The
   system fragility curves based on Monte Carlo simulation lie much closer
   to the upper bound fragilities given small correlation coefficients,
   implying that seismic demands of various components conditioned on the
   peak ground velocity are not correlated.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is an important chemical species in the
   troposphere as it aids the long-range transport of NOx and subsequent
   formation of O-3 in relatively clean remote regions. Over the past few
   decades observations from aircraft campaigns and surface sites have been
   used to better understand the regional distribution of PAN. However,
   recent measurements made by satellites allow for a global assessment of
   PAN in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS). In this study,
   we investigate global PAN distributions from two independent retrieval
   methodologies, based on measurements from the Michelson Interferometer
   for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument, on board Envisat
   from the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK), Karlsruhe
   Institute of Technology, and the Department of Physics and Astronomy,
   University of Leicester (UoL). Retrieving PAN from MIPAS is challenging
   due to the weak signal in the measurements and contamination from other
   species. Therefore, we compare the two MIPAS datasets with observations
   from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer
   (ACE-FTS), in situ aircraft data and the 3-D chemical transport model
   TOMCAT. MIPAS shows peak UTLS PAN concentrations over the biomass
   burning regions (e.g. ranging from 150 to >200 pptv at 150 hPa) and
   during the summertime Asian monsoon as enhanced convection aids the
   vertical transport of PAN from the lower atmosphere. At 150 hPa, we find
   significant differences between the two MIPAS datasets in the tropics,
   where IMK PAN concentrations are larger by 50-100 pptv. Comparisons
   between MIPAS and ACE-FTS show better agreement with the UoL MIPAS PAN
   concentrations at 200 hPa, but with mixed results above this altitude.
   TOMCAT generally captures the magnitude and structure of climatological
   aircraft PAN profiles within the observational variability allowing it
   to be used to investigate the MIPAS PAN differences. TOMCAT-MIPAS
   comparisons show that the model is both positively (UoL) and negatively
   (IMK) biased against the satellite products. These results indicate that
   satellite PAN observations are able to detect realistic spatial
   variations in PAN in the UTLS, but further work is needed to resolve
   differences in existing retrievals to allow quantitative use of the
   products.}},

Abstract = {{Gold nanocages (AuNCs) are comparatively novel nanostructures, as many
   of their characteristics are still to be exploited. The purpose of
   present study was to systematically investigate the toxicological
   effects of AuNCs on human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) utilizing Dark
   Field (DF)/Bright Field (BF) imaging and flow cytometry cell cycle
   techniques. We have applied surface modification, concentration, and
   incubation time of AuNCs as variables to investigate their effect on the
   cellular imaging and cell cycle response of HaCaT cells. The results
   indicate that the AuNCs interact with HaCaT cells in accordance to their
   surface charge and concentration. Cellular uptake is evident from DF
   images which'lead to the cell cycle perturbations and apoptosis in HaCaT
   cells. AuNCs cause a prominent G2/M phase arrest after 24 h of
   incubation. To the best of our knowledge toxicological effects of AuNCs
   on cell cycle of HaCaT cell line in vitro are not reported previously.

Abstract = {{Oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represent a major advance in
   hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. Along with recent updates in HCV
   screening policy and expansions in insurance coverage, treatment demand
   in the United States is changing rapidly. Our objective was to project
   the characteristics and number of people needing antiviral treatment and
   HCV-associated disease burden in the era of oral DAAs. We used a
   previously developed and validated Hepatitis C Disease Burden Simulation
   model (HEP-SIM). HEP-SIM simulated the actual clinical management of HCV
   from 2001 onward, which included antiviral treatment with pegylated
   interferon (Peg-IFN)-based therapies as well as the recent oral DAAs,
   risk-based and birth-cohort HCV screening, and the impact of the
   Affordable Care Act. We also simulated two hypothetical scenariosno
   treatment and treatment with Peg-IFN-based therapies only. We estimated
   that in 2010, 2.5 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.9-3.1) million
   noninstitutionalized people were viremic, which dropped to 1.9 (95\% CI,
   1.4-2.6) million in 2015, and projected to drop below 1 million by 2020.
   A total of 1.8 million HCV patients will receive HCV treatment from the
   launch of oral DAAs in 2014 until 2030. Based on current HCV management
   practices, it will take 4-6 years to treat the majority of patients
   aware of their disease. However, 560,000 patients would still remain
   unaware by 2020. Even in the oral DAA era, 320,000 patients will die,
   157,000 will develop hepatocellular carcinoma, and 203,000 will develop
   decompensated cirrhosis in the next 35 years. Conclusions:
   HCV-associated disease burden will still remain substantial in the era
   of oral DAAs. Increasing HCV screening and treatment capacity is
   essential to further decreasing HCV burden in the United States.

Abstract = {{The edit distance under the DCJ model can be computed in linear time for
   genomes with equal content or with Indels. But it becomes NP-Hard in the
   presence of duplications, a problem largely unsolved especially when
   Indels (i.e., insertions and deletions) are considered. In this paper,
   we compare two mainstream methods to deal with duplications and
   associate them with Indels: one by deletion, namely DCJ-Indel-Exemplar
   distance; versus the other by gene matching, namely DCJ-Indel-Matching
   distance. We design branch-and-bound algorithms with set of optimization
   methods to compute exact distances for both. Furthermore, median
   problems are discussed in alignment with both of these distance methods,
   which are to find a median genome that minimizes distances between
   itself and three given genomes. Lin-Kernighan heuristic is leveraged and
   powered up by sub-graph decomposition and search space reduction
   technologies to handle median computation. A wide range of experiments
   are conducted on synthetic data sets and real data sets to exhibit pros
   and cons of these two distance metrics per se, as well as putting them
   in the median computation scenario.}},

Abstract = {{In light of intense hurricane activity along the US Atlantic coast,
   attention has turned to understanding both the economic effect and the
   behaviour of these storms. The compound Poisson-log-normal process has
   been proposed as a model for aggregate storm damage but does not shed
   light on regional analysis since storm path data are not used. We
   propose a fully Bayesian regional prediction model which uses
   conditional auto-regressive models to account for both storm paths and
   spatial patterns for storm damage. When fitted to historical data, the
   analysis from our model both confirms previous findings and reveals new
   insights on regional storm tendencies. Posterior predictive samples can
   also be used for pricing regional insurance premiums, which we
   illustrate by using three different risk measures.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein behavior
   through modulation of protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activity,
   and protein stability essential in the translation of genotype to
   phenotype in eukaryotes. Currently, less than 4\% of all eukaryotic PTMs
   are reported to have biological function - a statistic that continues to
   decrease with an increasing rate of PTM detection. Previously, we
   developed SAPH-ire (Structural Analysis of PTM Hotspots) - a method for
   the prioritization of PTM function potential that has been used
   effectively to reveal novel PTM regulatory elements in discrete protein
   families (Dewhurst et al., 2015). Here, we apply SAPH-ire to the set of
   eukaryotic protein families containing experimental PTM and 3D structure
   data -capturing 1,325 protein families with 50,839 unique PTM sites
   organized into 31,747 modified alignment positions (MAPs), of which 2010
   (similar to 6\%) possess known biological function. Here, we show that
   using an artificial neural network model (SAPH-ire NN) trained to
   identify MAP hotspots with biological function results in prediction
   outcomes that far surpass the use of single hotspot features, including
   nearest neighbor PTM clustering methods. We find the greatest
   enhancement in prediction for positions with PTM counts of five or less,
   which represent 98\% of all MAPs in the eukaryotic proteome and 90\% of
   all MAPs found to have biological function. Analysis of the top 1092 MAP
   hotspots revealed 267 of truly unknown function (containing 5443
   distinct PTMs). Of these, 165 hotspots could be mapped to human KEGG
   pathways for normal and/or disease physiology. Many high-ranking
   hotspots were also found to be disease-associated pathogenic sites of
   amino acid substitution despite the lack of observable PTM in the human
   protein family member. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate
   that the functional relevance of a PTM can be predicted very effectively
   by neural network models, revealing a large but testable body of
   potential regulatory elements that impact hundreds of different
   biological processes important in eukaryotic biology and human health.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{611-630}},

Abstract = {{When solving a sequence of related linear systems by iterative methods,
   it is common to reuse the preconditioner for several systems, and then
   to recompute the preconditioner when the matrix has changed
   significantly. Rather than recomputing the preconditioner from scratch,
   it is potentially more efficient to update the previous preconditioner.
   Unfortunately, it is not always known how to update a preconditioner,
   for example, when the preconditioner is an incomplete factorization. A
   recently proposed iterative algorithm for computing incomplete
   factorizations, however, is able to exploit an initial guess, unlike
   existing algorithms for incomplete factorizations. By treating a
   previous factorization as an initial guess to this algorithm, an
   incomplete factorization may thus be updated. We use a sequence of
   problems from model order reduction. Experimental results using an
   optimized GPU implementation show that updating a previous factorization
   can be inexpensive and effective, making solving sequences of linear
   systems a potential niche problem for the iterative incomplete
   factorization algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Determining a suitable airport and planning a trajectory in detail all
   the way down to landing is a difficult task to do well, especially in
   emergencies. While a variety of planning aids have been proposed to aid
   in this task, their evaluation with pilots has led to the question: How
   do we support a human in a task that is too hard for them to perform
   well in the time provided, but is too open-ended for automation to
   perform perfectly in every situation? This paper specifically focuses on
   whether procedure context information can help pilots evaluate an
   emergency descent trajectory provided by automation, building on prior
   studies finding that such information can encourage a more
   interpretative strategy for evaluating and appropriately following (or
   not exactly following) procedures. Here, pilots were asked to quickly
   evaluate emergency flight plans presented both spatially and as a
   procedure (list of discrete actions). The procedures were presented in a
   variety of formats, where some explicitly presented the rationale for
   critical actions and/or emphasized which actions need to be done in a
   particular sequence. The results indicate that including rationale with
   a suggested plan can improve some aspects of a human's reasoning about
   an automatically generated plan. This finding has implications for both
   the design of plans and procedures, and the design of mixed-initiative
   planning aids: capturing the underlying rationale for key actions when
   generating a plan or procedure can then be beneficial when it can be
   portrayed to the human planner.}},

Abstract = {{The precision reactor oscillation and spectrum experiment, PROSPECT, is
   designed to make a precise measurement of the antineutrino spectrum from
   a highly-enriched uranium reactor and probe eV-scale sterile neutrinos
   by searching for neutrino oscillations over a distance of several
   meters. PROSPECT is conceived as a 2-phase experiment utilizing
   segmented Li-6-doped liquid scintillator detectors for both efficient
   detection of reactor antineutrinos through the inverse beta decay
   reaction and excellent background discrimination. PROSPECT Phase. I
   consists of a movable 3 ton antineutrino detector at distances of 7-12 m
   from the reactor core. It will probe the best-fit point of the v(e)
   disappearance experiments at 4 sigma in 1 year and the favored region of
   the sterile neutrino parameter space at >3 sigma in 3 years. With a
   second antineutrino detector at 15-19. m from the reactor, Phase II of
   PROSPECT can probe the entire allowed parameter space below 10 eV(2) at
   5 sigma in 3 additional years. The measurement of the reactor
   antineutrino spectrum and the search for short-baseline oscillations
   with PROSPECT will test the origin of the spectral deviations observed
   in recent theta(13) experiments, search for sterile neutrinos, and
   conclusively address the hypothesis of sterile neutrinos as an
   explanation of the reactor anomaly.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a novel hybrid printing technology that realizes a
   microstrip patch antenna is introduced. The proposed hybrid printing
   technology uses both two-and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) printing
   technologies. The antenna's dielectric materials are built using a 3D
   printer. The metallic pattern is printed using a commercial inkjet
   printer. Polylactic acid (PLA) is used for the filament of the 3D
   printer and silver nanoparticle ink is printed on paper using the inkjet
   printer. For a highly efficient antenna design with lossy PLA material,
   the mesh PLA is printed and its electromagnetic parameters are
   characterized. Finally, the printed patch antenna shows a return loss of
   24 dB and a peak gain of 7 dBi at 1.9 GHz. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Epothilones are thiazole-containing natural productswith anticancer
   activity that are biosynthesized by polyketide synthase
   (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes EpoA-F. A
   cyclization domain of EpoB (Cy) assembles the thiazole functionality
   from an acetyl group and L-cysteine via condensation, cyclization, and
   dehydration. The PKS carrier protein of EpoA contributes the acetyl
   moiety, guided by a docking domain, whereas an NRPS EpoB carrier protein
   contributes L-cysteine. To visualize the structure of a cyclization
   domain with an accompanying docking domain, we solved a 2.03-a
   resolution structure of this bidomain EpoB unit, comprising
   residuesM1-Q497 (62 kDa) of the 160-kDa EpoB protein. We find that the
   N-terminal docking domain is connected to the V-shaped Cy domain by a
   20-residue linker but otherwise makes no contacts to Cy. Molecular
   dynamic simulations and additional crystal structures reveal a high
   degree of flexibility for this docking domain, emphasizing the modular
   nature of the components of PKS-NRPS hybrid systems. These structures
   further reveal two 20-angstrom-long channels that run from distant sites
   on the Cy domain to the active site at the core of the enzyme, allowing
   two carrier proteins to dock with Cy and deliver their substrates
   simultaneously. Through mutagenesis and activity assays, catalytic
   residues N335 and D449 have been identified. Surprisingly, these
   residues do not map to the location of the conserved HHxxxDG motif in
   the structurally homologous NRPS condensation (C) domain. Thus, although
   both C and Cy domains have the same basic fold, their active sites
   appear distinct.}},

Abstract = {{Advances toward low friction surfaces are in growing demand from many
   economic sectors for energy efficiency and environmental safety.
   However, the traditional approach of multi-grade oil formulation is
   limited by its inability to induce pollution-free generation of uniform
   oil-retaining films needed to improve surface lubricity. Here, a direct
   route to the formation of a surface layer of superior lubricity is
   presented as an alternative to the use of oil additives for friction
   reduction. The deformation-induced generation of a surface film
   consisting of low-shear-strength oil-retaining compounds is obtained via
   supplying chemically beneficial elements during a widely used surface
   finishing mechanical treatment. An ultra-low friction coefficient of
   about 0.01 is obtained with base oil lubrication after tailoring the
   surface chemistry by shot peening using a mixture of Cu2S and Al2O3;
   this result opens new horizons for surface engineering.}},

   solution-based methods, barring significant concessions to device
   performance and process scalability. In this paper, we present and
   implement a novel hybridization of continuous (e.g., slot die) and
   on-demand (e.g., inkjet) techniques designed to address these
   shortcomings, wherein. outflow from localized regions of an extrusion
   die is actuated in real time to produce patterns. Pattern features were
   produced with aqueous solutions of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and
   poly(3,4-ethyl-enedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),
   and deposition phenomena were observed in situ using a specialized roll
   feed imaging system. Minimum feature size is shown to be directionally
   dependent, with transient flow effects dominating along the axis
   coincident with substrate motion, and sensitive to several process
   inputs as well as coating material properties. Strategies for managing
   residual fluid in the die cavity and beneath the die lip are
   illustrated, through flow actuation mechanisms and exploitation of
   deposition phenomena, to optimize pattern fidelity. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the rapid advancement of sensing and computing technology and the
   wide adoption of mobile computing, the construction industry has faced a
   rise in the amount of information and data generated during the
   lifecycle of the construction project. To deal with a large variety of
   project data and information to support efficient and effective decision
   making, visualization, information modeling, and simulation (VIMS) has
   become critical in the development of capital facilities and
   infrastructures. The objective of this paper is to identify and
   investigate grand challenges in VIMS for the construction industry, to
   assist the academic and industry communities in establishing a future
   research agenda to solve VIMS challenges. In particular, 17 VIMS grand
   challenges were identified by an expert task force in the VIMS committee
   of the ASCE Computing and Information Technology Division, and then VIMS
   experts in the civil and construction areas from both academia and
   industry participated in a survey to assess the identified challenges,
   examine the relative importance of the identified challenges, and
   investigate current practices and future directions of VIMS. The survey
   results indicate that several knowledge gaps regarding VIMS challenges
   between academia and industry still exist, and it is the contention of
   this research that these particular gaps need to be addressed in future
   research. These research directions apply to technical issues and
   sociological/cultural/organizational issues in VIMS challenges. The
   major contribution of this paper is its claim that the provision of
   shared views on VIMS challenges lays a firm foundation in which
   collaborative actions between academia and industry can take place,
   which will, in turn, advance VIMS for the construction industry. By
   incorporating the whole project lifecycle, not only project execution
   but also planning, operation, and maintenance, the analysis provides
   meaningful hints for VIMS challenges in architecture, engineering, and
   facility management industries.}},

   Fine-Grained Sediments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to interparticle forces between clay particles in fine-grained
   sediments, erodibility and transport mechanisms for fine sediments are
   different from those for coarse sediments, and the capability to predict
   the erosion resistance of fine sediments is still in question. In this
   study, sediment specimens with different kaolinite contents were
   prepared by mixing ground silica and Georgia kaolin with tap water.
   Geotechnical tests were carried out to obtain the sediment physical
   properties. The erosional and yield strengths of the specimens were
   determined through hydraulic flume experiments and rheometer tests,
   respectively. Relationships among the erosional and yield strengths and
   the sediment physical properties were developed. In dimensionless form,
   erosional and yield strengths of fine sediments are predicted by
   sediment properties including clay-size fraction and water content. In
   addition, a relationship is obtained to predict Shields' parameter as a
   function of the corresponding dimensionless yield stress. This procedure
   can be used potentially in engineering applications such as estimating
   river bank stability and evaluating erosion risk of river beds in
   proximity to flow obstructions for fine sediments.}},

   Optimization Using the Ground Structure Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Topology optimization can be divided into continuum and discrete types,
   the latter being the emphasis of the present work. In the field of
   discrete structural topology optimization of trusses, the generation of
   an initial ground structure is crucial. Thus, this paper examines the
   generation of ground structures for generic structural domains in two
   and three dimensions. It compares two methods of discretization,
   Voronoi-based and structured quadrilateral discretizations, and proposes
   two simple and effective ground structure generation approaches: the
   macroelement and macropatch approaches. Both can be implemented with
   either type of discretization. This work presents several features of
   these approaches, including the efficient generation of initial ground
   structures, a reduction in matrix bandwidth for the global stiffness
   matrix, finer control of bar connectivity, and a reduction in the number
   of overlapped bars. Generic examples and practical structural
   engineering designs are presented. They display the features of the
   proposed approaches and highlight the comparison with results from
   either the literature, the traditional ground structure generation, or
   the continuum optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{Integrally skinned asymmetric (ISA) thin films, for nanofiltration (NF),
   were fabricated by the infusion of PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer (Pluronic
   F127) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) in bisphenol A diglycidyl
   ether (DGEBA) crosslinked poly (vinyl alcohol) nanocellular structure.
   The thin film permeation, salt rejection and chlorine resistance
   performance were evaluated by using indigenously fabricated NF assembly.
   ISA4 (0.08 wt\% ZnO-NPs/Pluronic F127 6 wt\%) was considered as an
   optimal thin film that exhibited a much higher permeation flux
   (1.96m(3)/m(2)/day) and salt rejection (98.7\%) compared to the single
   layer crosslinked thin film. The chlorine exposure tests of thin films
   under accelerated conditions indicated that the stability of ISA4 was
   enhanced effectively in chlorinated water. Thin films were characterized
   by ATR-FTIR, SEM, AFM, and contact angle analysis. These
   characterizations determine the successful interactions between polymer
   chains and other components, morphology, topography and wettability. It
   was found that the thin film surface became smoother, more hydrophilic
   and reduced surface roughness compared to the nanocellular crosslinked
   thin film. The SEM micrograph analysis showed average pore size <100 nm
   in 1SA4 thin film without any mottled surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a whole-core, three-dimensional, code-to-code
   benchmark problem based on the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR)
   developed by AREVA NP. The core specifications were taken directly from
   the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) submitted to the Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the reactor core was modeled in a
   stylized manner while maintaining full heterogeneity at the pin and
   assembly level. Three different fresh core control rod configurations
   are presented in this paper All Rods Out (ARO), Some Rods In (SRI), and
   All Rods In (ARI). Detailed Monte Carlo results are presented and
   include core eigenvalues, pin fission densities, and assembly averaged
   fission distributions. The benchmark results together with the provided
   macroscopic cross section libraries are useful for testing the numerical
   accuracy of transport solution methods for criticality analysis. The
   benchmark description includes the material atom densities and other
   relevant parameters for cross section studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Most mechanical systems produce vibrations as an inherent side effect of
   operation. Though some vibrations are acceptable in operation, others
   can cause damage or signal a machine's imminent failure. These
   vibrations would optimally be monitored in real-time, without human
   supervision to prevent failure and excessive wear in machinery. This
   paper explores a new alternative to currently-used machine-monitoring
   equipment, namely a piezoelectric foam sensor system. These sensors are
   made of a silicone-based foam embedded with nano- and micro-scale
   conductive particles. Upon impact, they emit an electric response that
   is directly correlated with impact energy, with no electrical power
   input. In the present work, we investigated their utility as
   self-sensing bushings on machinery. These sensors were found to
   accurately detect both the amplitude and frequency of typical machine
   vibrations. The bushings could potentially save time and money over
   other vibration sensing mechanisms, while simultaneously providing a
   potential control input that could be utilized for correcting
   vibrational imbalance.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{435-447}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Distance covariance and distance correlation have been widely adopted in
   measuring dependence of a pair of random variables or random vectors. If
   the computation of distance covariance and distance correlation is
   implemented directly accordingly to its definition then its
   computational complexity is O(n(2)), which is a disadvantage compared to
   other faster methods. In this article we show that the computation of
   distance covariance and distance correlation of real-valued random
   variables can be implemented by an O(nlogn) algorithm and this is
   comparable to other computationally efficient algorithms. The new
   formula we derive for an unbiased estimator for squared distance
   covariance turns out to be a U-statistic. This fact implies some nice
   asymptotic properties that were derived before via more complex methods.
   We apply the fast computing algorithm to some synthetic data. Our work
   will make distance correlation applicable to a much wider class of
   problems. A supplementary file to this article, available online,
   includes a Matlab and C-based software that realizes the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel procedure that uses dynamic 3-D computer graphics
   as a diagnostic tool for assessing disease severity in schizophrenia
   patients, based on their reduced influence of top-down cognitive
   processes in interpreting bottom-up sensory input. Our procedure uses
   the hollow-mask illusion, in which the concave side of the mask is
   misperceived as convex, because familiarity with convex faces dominates
   sensory cues signaling a concave mask. It is known that schizophrenia
   patients resist this illusion and their resistance increases with
   illness severity. Our method uses virtual masks rendered with two
   competing textures: (a) realistic features that enhance the illusion;
   (b) random-dot visual noise that reduces the illusion. We control the
   relative weights of the two textures to obtain psychometric functions
   for controls and patients and assess illness severity. The primary
   novelty is the use of a rotating mask that is easy to implement on a
   wide variety of portable devices and avoids the use of elaborate
   stereoscopic devices that have been used in the past. Thus our method,
   which can also be used to assess the efficacy of treatments, provides
   clinicians the advantage to bring the test to the patient's own
   environment, instead of having to bring patients to the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{In the present contribution we investigate the variation in the Global
   Positioning System (GPS) derived ionospheric Total Electron Content
   (TEC) over Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region on the rare
   occasional astronomical phenomenon of total solar eclipse of 22 July
   2009. The aim is to study and identify the wave like structure
   enumerated due to solar eclipse induced gravity waves in the F-region
   ionosphere altitude. The work is aimed to understand features of
   horizontal and vertical variation of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs)
   properties over the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region in Indian
   low latitude region. The ionospheric observations is from the site of
   Allahabad (lat 25.4 degrees N; lon. 81.9 degrees E; dip 38.6 degrees N)
   located at the fringe of eclipse totality path. The estimated vertical
   electron density profile from FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC GPS-RO satellite,
   considering all the satellite line of sight around the time of eclipse
   totality shows maximum depletion of 43\%. The fast fourier transform and
   wavelet transform of GPS DTEC data from Allahabad station (Allahabad:
   lat 25.4 N; lon. 81.9 E) shows the presence of periodic waves of similar
   to 20 to 45 min and similar to 70 to 90 min period at F-region altitude.
   The shorter period correspond to the sunrise time morning terminator and
   longer period can be associated with solar eclipse generated AGWs. The
   most important result obtained is that our results along with previous
   result for wave like signatures in D-region ionosphere from Allahabad
   station show that AGWs generated by sunrise time terminator have
   similarity in the D and F region of the ionosphere but solar eclipse
   induced AGWs show higher period in the F-region compared to D-region
   ionosphere. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Tongue implant for assistive technologies: Test of migration, tissue
   reactivity and impact on tongue function}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a new wearable assistive
   technology (AT), developed to translate voluntary tongue movements to
   user-defined computer commands by tracking the position of a
   titanium-encased magnetic tracer (Ti-Mag) implanted into the tongue. TDS
   application, however, is constrained by limited information on
   biological consequence and safety of device implantation into the tongue
   body. Here we implant a stainless-steel pellet in the rat tongue and
   assay pellet migration, tongue lick function, and tongue histology to
   test the safety and biocompatibility of unanchored tongue implants.
   Design: Water consumption, weight and lick behavior were measured before
   and for >24 days after implantation of a stainless-steel spherical
   pellet (0.5 mm) into the anterior tongue body of twelve adult male rats.
   X-rays were obtained weekly to assess pellet migration. Pellet location
   and tissue reaction to implantation were determined by post-mortem
   dissection and histology of the anterior tongue.
   Results: By dissection pellets were distributed across the transverse
   plane of the tongue. Measures of water consumption, weight, and lick
   behavior were unchanged by implantation except for a decrease in
   consumption immediately post-implantation in some animals. By X-ray,
   there was no migration of the implant, a finding supported by pellet
   encapsulation demonstrated histologically. Measures of lick behavior
   were minimally impacted by implantation.
   Conclusion: A smooth spherical stainless-steel implant in the anterior
   tongue of the rat does not migrate, is encapsulated and does not
   substantially impact lick behavior. These findings support the
   implantation of small tracers in the anterior tongue in humans for
   operating wearable assistive technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Elevated particulate matter (PM) concentrations have been associated
   with cardiopulmonary risks. In this study, alveolar macrophages and
   ventricular myocytes were exposed to PM extracts from 104 ambient
   filters collected in multiple rural and urban sites in the greater
   Atlanta area. PM-induced reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) were
   measured to investigate the effect of chemical composition and determine
   whether chemical assays are representative of cellular responses. For
   summer samples, the area under the ROS/RNS dose-response curve per
   volume of air (AUC(volume)) was significantly correlated with
   dithiothreitol (DTT) activity, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC),
   brown carbon, titanium, and iron, while a relatively flat response was
   observed for winter samples. EC50 was also correlated with max response
   for all filters investigated, which suggests that certain PM
   constituents may be involved in cellular protective pathways. Although
   few metal correlations were observed, exposure to laboratory-prepared
   metal solutions induced ROS/RNS production, indicating that a lack of
   correlation does not necessarily translate to a lack of response.
   Collectively, these results suggest that complex interactions may occur
   between PM species. Furthermore, the strong correlation between organic
   species and ROS/RNS response highlights a need to understand the
   contribution of organic aerosols, especially photochemically driven
   secondary organic aerosols (SOA), to PM-induced health effects. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass is a combined effect
   of several factors such as high crystallinity and high degree of
   polymerization of cellulose, lignin content and structure, and the
   available surface area for enzymatic degradation (i.e., accessibility).
   Genetic improvement of feedstock cell wall properties is a path to
   reducing recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass and improving
   conversion to various biofuels. An advanced understanding of the
   cellulose biosynthesis pathway is essential to precisely modify
   cellulose properties of plant cell walls. Here we report on the impact
   of modified expression of candidate cellulose biosynthesis pathway genes
   on the ultra-structure of cellulose, a key carbohydrate polymer of
   Populus cell wall using advanced nuclear magnetic resonance approaches.
   Noteworthy changes were observed in the cell wall characteristics of
   downregulated KORRIGAN 1 (KOR) and KOR 2 transgenic plants in comparison
   to the wild-type control. It was observed that all of the transgenic
   lines showed variation in cellulose ultrastructure, increase in
   cellulose crystallinity and decrease in the cellulose degree of
   polymerization. Additionally, the properties of cellulose allomorph
   abundance and accessibility were found to be variable. Application of
   such cellulose characterization techniques beyond the traditional
   measurement of cellulose abundance to comprehensive studies of cellulose
   properties in larger transgenic and naturally variable populations is
   expected to provide deeper insights into the complex nature of
   lignocellulosic material, which can significantly contribute to the
   development of precisely tailored plants for enhanced biofuels
   production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal charging performance of paraffin wax combined with
   compressed expanded natural graphite foam was studied for different
   graphite bulk densities. Constant heat fluxes between 0.39 W/cm(2) and
   1.55 W/cm(2) were applied, as well as a constant boundary temperature of
   60 degrees C. Thermal charging experiments indicate that, in the design
   of thermal batteries, thermal conductivity of the composite alone is an
   insufficient metric to determine the influence of the graphite foam on
   the thermal energy storage. By dividing the latent heat of the composite
   by the time to end of melt for each applied boundary condition, the
   energy storage performance was calculated to show the effects of
   composite thermal conductivity, graphite bulk density, and latent heat
   capacity. For the experimental volume, the addition of graphite beyond a
   graphite bulk density of 100 kg/m(3) showed limited benefit on the
   energy storage performance due to the decrease in latent heat storage
   capacity. These experimental results are used to validate a numerical
   model to predict the time to melt and for future use in the design of
   heat exchangers with graphite-foam based phase change material
   composites. Size scale effects are explored parametrically with the
   validated model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Do Surface Porosity and Pore Size Influence Mechanical Properties and
   Cellular Response to PEEK?}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Despite its widespread use in orthopaedic implants such as soft tissue
   fasteners and spinal intervertebral implants, polyetheretherketone
   (PEEK) often suffers from poor osseointegration. Introducing porosity
   can overcome this limitation by encouraging bone ingrowth; however, the
   corresponding decrease in implant strength can potentially reduce the
   implant's ability to bear physiologic loads. We have previously shown,
   using a single pore size, that limiting porosity to the surface of PEEK
   implants preserves strength while supporting in vivo osseointegration.
   However, additional work is needed to investigate the effect of pore
   size on both the mechanical properties and cellular response to PEEK.
   (1) Can surface porous PEEK (PEEK-SP) microstructure be reliably
   controlled? (2) What is the effect of pore size on the mechanical
   properties of PEEK-SP? (3) Do surface porosity and pore size influence
   the cellular response to PEEK?
   PEEK-SP was created by extruding PEEK through NaCl crystals of three
   controlled ranges: 200 to 312, 312 to 425, and 425 to 508 A mu m.
   Micro-CT was used to characterize the microstructure of PEEK-SP.
   Tensile, fatigue, and interfacial shear tests were performed to compare
   the mechanical properties of PEEK-SP with injection-molded PEEK
   (PEEK-IM). The cellular response to PEEK-SP, assessed by proliferation,
   alkaline phosphatase activity, vascular endothelial growth factor
   production, and calcium content of osteoblast, mesenchymal stem cell,
   and preosteoblast (MC3T3-E1) cultures, was compared with that of
   machined smooth PEEK and Ti6Al4V.
   Micro-CT analysis showed that PEEK-SP layers possessed pores that were
   284 +/- A 35 A mu m, 341 +/- A 49 A mu m, and 416 +/- A 54 A mu m for
   each pore size group. Porosity and pore layer depth ranged from 61\% to
   69\% and 303 to 391 A mu m, respectively. Mechanical testing revealed
   tensile strengths > 67 MPa and interfacial shear strengths > 20 MPa for
   all three pore size groups. All PEEK-SP groups exhibited > 50\% decrease
   in ductility compared with PEEK-IM and demonstrated fatigue strength >
   38 MPa at one million cycles. All PEEK-SP groups also supported greater
   proliferation and cell-mediated mineralization compared with smooth PEEK
   and Ti6Al4V.
   The PEEK-SP formulations evaluated in this study maintained favorable
   mechanical properties that merit further investigation into their use in
   load-bearing orthopaedic applications and supported greater in vitro
   osteogenic differentiation compared with smooth PEEK and Ti6Al4V. These
   results are independent of pore sizes ranging 200 A mu m to 508 A mu m.
   PEEK-SP may provide enhanced osseointegration compared with current
   implants while maintaining the structural integrity to be considered for
   several load-bearing orthopaedic applications such as spinal fusion or
   soft tissue repair.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{331}},
Pages = {{167-179}},

Abstract = {{The performance and stability of the mixed ionic and electronic
   conducting (MIEC) membrane devices, such as solid oxide cells (SOCs) and
   oxygen separation membranes (OSMs) interplay tightly with the transport
   properties and the three-dimensional (3D) microstructure of the
   membrane. However, development of the MIEC devices is hindered by the
   limited knowledge about the distribution of electrochemical fields
   within the 3D local microstructures, especially at surface and
   interface. In this work, a generic model conforming to local
   thermodynamic equilibrium is developed to calculate the electrochemical
   fields, such as electric potential and oxygen chemical potential, within
   the 3D microstructure of the MIEC membrane. Stability of the MIEC
   membrane is evaluated by the distribution of oxygen partial pressure.
   The cell-level performance such as polarization resistance and voltage
   vs. current curve can be further calculated. Case studies are performed
   to demonstrate the capability of the framework by using X-ray computed
   tomography reconstructed 3D microstructures of a SOC and an OSM. The
   calculation method demonstrates high computational efficiency for large
   size 3D tomographic microstructures, and permits parallel calculation.
   The framework can serve as a powerful tool for correlating the transport
   properties and the 3D microstructure to the performance and the
   stability of MIEC devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers two single-machine scheduling problems with a new
   type of aging effect, which is dominated by the processing speed of the
   machine. During the whole scheduling horizon, the machine is subject to
   an optional maintenance, and the duration of the maintenance depends on
   the length of the uptime before it. The objective is to schedule all
   jobs and find the location of the maintenance so as to minimize the
   makespan or the total completion times. The two problems are proved to
   be NP-complete, and two dynamic programming algorithms are proposed to
   solve the problems. We analyze the computation complexity of the
   algorithms, and show that the problems under study are solvable in
   polynomial time if the processing loads of all jobs are uniformly
   bounded. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alpha-keto (alpha-keto) acids are used widely in feeds, food additives,
   pharmaceuticals, and in chemical synthesis processes. Although most
   alpha-keto acids are currently produced by chemical synthesis, their
   biotechnological production from renewable carbohydrates is a promising

   the recent progresses in the biotechnological production of some
   important alpha-keto acids; namely, pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate,
   alpha-ketoisovalerate, alpha-ketoisocaproate, phenylpyruvate,
   alpha-keto-gamma-met hylthiobutyrate, and 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate.
   Finally, we discuss the future prospects as well as favorable directions
   for the biotechnological production of keto acids that ultimately would
   be more environment-friendly and simpler compared with the production by
   chemical synthesis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   participates in co-translational protein folding, regulation of
   premature translation termination, and ribosome biogenesis. The loss of
   Ssb or disruption of RAC results in the increased formation of {[}PSI
   (+)], a prion form of the translation termination factor Sup35 (eRF3).
   This implicates co-translational protein misfolding in de novo prion
   formation. However, RAC disruption also destabilizes pre-existing {[}PSI
   (+)] prions, as Ssb, released from ribosomes to the cytosol in the
   absence of RAC, antagonizes the function of the major cytosolic
   chaperone, Ssa, in prion propagation. The mechanism of the Ssa/Ssb
   antagonism is currently under investigation and may include a
   competition for substrates and/or co-chaperones. Notably, yeast cells
   with wild-type RAC also release Ssb to the cytosol in certain
   unfavorable growth conditions, and Ssb contributes to increased prion
   loss in these conditions. This indicates that the circulation of Ssb
   between the ribosome and cytosol may serve as a physiological regulator
   of the formation and propagation of self-perpetuating protein
   aggregates. Indeed, RAC and Ssb modulate toxicity of some aggregating
   proteins in yeast. Mammalian cells lack the Ssb ortholog but contain a
   RAC counterpart, apparently recruiting other Hsp70 protein(s). Thus,
   amyloid modulation by ribosome-associated chaperones could be applicable
   beyond yeast.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the free vibration characteristics of embedded
   functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC)
   spherical shells are studied based on a numerical approach. The elastic
   foundation is considered to be Pasternak-type. Moreover, the extended
   rule of mixture is used so as to obtain the material properties of
   FG-CNTRC. The shell is also modeled according to the first-order shear
   deformation shell theory. The energy functional of the structure is
   obtained first. Using differential operators, the discretized form of
   the energy functional is derived. By means of the variational
   differential quadrature (VDQ) method, the reduced forms of mass and
   stiffness matrices are then obtained. Selected numerical results are
   given to investigate the effects of different parameters such as elastic
   foundation coefficients, boundary conditions, CNT volume fraction,
   thickness-to-radius ratio and type of distribution of CNT on the
   vibrations of FG-CNTRC spherical shells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Printed electronics is being explored as a rapid, facile means for
   manufacturing thermoelectric generators (TEGs) that can recover useful
   electrical energy from waste heat. This work examines the relevant
   electrical conductivity, thermal resistance, thermovoltage, and Seebeck
   coefficient of printed films for use in such printed flexible TEGs. The
   thermoelectric performance of TEGs printed using commercially relevant
   nickel, silver, and carbon inks is evaluated. The microstructure of the
   printed films is investigated to better understand why the electrical
   conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are degraded. Thermal conduction is
   shown to be relatively insensitive to the type of metalized coating and
   nearly equivalent to that of an uncoated polymer substrate. Of the
   commercially available conductive ink materials examined, carbon-nickel
   TEGs are shown to exhibit the highest thermovoltage, with a value of
   10.3 mu V/K. However, silver-nickel TEGs produced the highest power
   generation of 14.6 mu W {[}from 31 junctions with temperature difference
   (Delta T) of 113A degrees C] due to their low electrical resistance. The
   voltage generated from the silver-nickel TEG was stable under continuous
   operation at 275A degrees C for 3 h. We have also demonstrated that,
   after a year of storage in ambient conditions, these devices retain
   their performance. Notably, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck
   coefficient measured for individual materials were consistent with those
   measured from actual printed TEG device structures, validating the need
   for further fundamental materials characterization to accelerate
   flexible TEG device optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Charged particle irradiation is a frequently used experimental tool to
   study damage accumulation in metals expected during neutron irradiation.
   Understanding the correspondence between displacement rate and
   temperature during such studies is one of several factors that must be
   taken into account in order to design experiments that produce
   equivalent damage accumulation to neutron damage conditions. In this
   study, spatially resolved stochastic cluster dynamics (SRSCD) is used to
   simulate damage evolution in alpha-Fe and find displacement
   rate/temperature pairs under `target' and `proxy' conditions for which
   the local distribution of vacancies and vacancy clusters is the same as
   a function of displacement damage. The SRSCD methodology is chosen for
   this study due to its computational efficiency and ability to simulate
   damage accumulation in spatially inhomogeneous materials such as thin
   films. Results are presented for Frenkel pair irradiation and
   displacement cascade damage in thin films and bulk a alpha-Fe. Holding
   all other material and irradiation conditions constant, temperature
   adjustments are shown to successfully make up for changes in,
   displacement rate such that defect concentrations and cluster sizes
   remain relatively constant. The methodology presented in this study
   allows for a first-order prediction of the temperature at which ion
   irradiation experiments ('proxy' conditions) should take place in order
   to approximate neutron irradiation ('target' conditions). (c) 2016

Volume = {{301}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Forced convection of copper-water nanofluid through a channel partially
   filled by a centrally located, porous insert is considered. Constant
   heat flux boundary conditions are imposed on the channel walls and the
   nanofluid flow is assumed to be hydrodynamically and thermally fully
   developed. The investigated system is under the local thermal
   non-equilibrium and two well-established interface models are employed
   to specify the thermal boundary conditions at the interface of the
   porous insert and nanofluid flow. Analytical expressions are derived for
   the temperature fields, Nusselt number and, total and local entropy
   generations. A parametric study reveals that variations in nanoparticles
   volumetric concentration only affect the temperature of the nanofluid
   flow within the clear region, It also shows that regardless of the
   choice of the porous-nanofluid interface model, addition of
   nanoparticles can improve the Nusselt number by up to around 15\%.
   However, the local and total entropy generations are found to be
   strongly dependent upon the employed interface model and increase
   considerably by increasing the concentration of the nanoparticles. It is
   shown that at high Biot numbers the effects of the interface model upon
   the thermal and entropic behaviours of the system diminish. This is
   argued to be related to the approach of the system towards local thermal
   equilibrium at larger values of Biot number. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Blind gain and phase calibration (BGPC) is a structured bilinear inverse
   problem, which arises in many applications, including inverse rendering
   in computational relighting (albedo estimation with unknown lighting),
   blind phase and gain calibration in sensor array processing, and
   multichannel blind deconvolution. The fundamental question of the
   uniqueness of the solutions to such problems has been addressed only
   recently. In a previous paper, we proposed studying the identifiability
   in bilinear inverse problems up to transformation groups. In particular,
   we studied several special cases of blind gain and phase calibration,
   including the cases of subspace and joint sparsity models on the
   signals, and gave sufficient and necessary conditions for
   identifiability up to certain transformation groups. However, there were
   gaps between the sample complexities in the sufficient conditions and
   the necessary conditions. In this paper, under a mild assumption that
   the signals and models are generic, we bridge the gaps by deriving tight
   sufficient conditions with optimal or near optimal sample complexities.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Filtering of Time-Varying Sparse Signals via l(1) Minimization}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of sparsity signal models and the increasing
   prevalence of high-dimensional streaming data, there are relatively few
   algorithms for dynamic filtering of time-varying sparse signals. Of the
   existing algorithms, fewer still provide strong performance guarantees.
   This paper examines two algorithms for dynamic filtering of sparse
   signals that are based on efficient l(1) optimization methods. We first
   present an analysis for one simple algorithm (BPDN-DF) that works well
   when the system dynamics are known exactly. We then introduce a novel
   second algorithm (RWL1-DF) that is more computationally complex than
   BPDN-DF but performs better in practice, especially in the case where
   the system dynamics model is inaccurate. Robustness to model inaccuracy
   is achieved by using a hierarchical probabilistic data model and
   propagating higher-order statistics from the previous estimate (akin to
   Kalman filtering) in the sparse inference process. We demonstrate the
   properties of these algorithms on both simulated data as well as natural
   video sequences. Taken together, the algorithms presented in this paper
   represent the first strong performance analysis of dynamic filtering
   algorithms for time-varying sparse signals as well as state-of-the-art
   performance in this emerging application.}},

Title = {{A heuristic model for working memory deficit in schizophrenia}},

Abstract = {{Background: The life of schizophrenia patients is severely affected by
   deficits in working memory. In various brain regions, the reciprocal
   interactions between excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory
   GABAergic neurons are crucial. Other neurotransmitters, in particular
   dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine, modulate the
   local balance between glutamate and GABA and therefore regulate the
   function of brain regions. Persistent alterations in the balances
   between the neurotransmitters can result in working memory deficits.
   Methods: Here we present a heuristic computational model that accounts
   for interactions among neurotransmitters across various brain regions.
   The model is based on the concept of a neurochemical interaction matrix
   at the biochemical level and combines this matrix with a mobile model
   representing physiological dynamic balances among neurotransmitter
   systems associated with working memory.
   Results: The comparison of clinical and simulation results demonstrates
   that the model output is qualitatively very consistent with the
   available data. In addition, the model captured how perturbations
   migrated through different neurotransmitters and brain regions. Results
   showed that chronic administration of ketamine can cause a variety of
   imbalances, and application of an antagonist of the D-2 receptor in PFC
   can also induce imbalances but in a very different manner.
   Conclusions: The heuristic computational model permits a variety of
   assessments of genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological perturbations
   and serves as an intuitive tool for explaining clinical and biological
   observations.
   General significance: The heuristic model is more intuitive than
   biophysically detailed models. It can serve as an important tool for
   interdisciplinary communication and even for psychiatric education of
   patients and relatives. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled

Abstract = {{To explore the driving forces behind deformation twinning in Mg AZ31, a
   machine learning framework is utilized to mine data obtained from
   electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) scans in order to extract
   correlations in physical characteristics that cause twinning. The
   results are intended to inform physics-based models of twin nucleation
   and growth. A decision tree learning environment is selected to capture
   the relationships between microstructure and twin formation; this type
   of model effectively highlights the more influential characteristics of
   the local microstructure. Trees are assembled to analyze both twin
   nucleation in a given grain, and twin propagation across grain
   boundaries. Each model reveals a unique combination of crystallographic
   attributes that affect twinning in the Mg. Twin nucleation is found to
   be mostly controlled by a combination of grain size, basal Schmid
   factor, and bulk dislocation density while twin propagation is affected
   most by grain boundary length, basal Schmid factor, angle from grain
   boundary plane to the RD plane, and grain boundary misorientation. The
   machine learning framework can be readily adapted to investigate other
   relationships between microstructure and material response. (C) 2016

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{116-129}},

Abstract = {{A simulated microstructure-sensitive fatigue study has been performed
   for two titanium alloy microstructures. The investigated materials
   exhibit a Widmanstatten structure and include the alpha-beta alloy
   Ti-6Al-4V and the near 0 alloy Ti-18 in a beta-annealed, slow-cooled,
   and aged condition (BASCA). In other work {[}1], crystal plasticity
   models implemented into ABAQUS (2011) {[}2] UserMATerial subroutines
   have been calibrated to experimental cyclic deformation data for both
   materials. The current study utilizes calibrated crystal plasticity
   models to simulate fatigue loading of varying microstructures for each
   material to study the influence of key morphological and
   crystallographic aspects on the fatigue performance, e.g., the mean
   colony size, phase volume fraction, and crystallographic texture.
   Localized stress and plastic strain are studied via computation of
   fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs), which represent the driving force
   for fatigue crack formation and early propagation in the microstructure.
   The maximum FIP values are sampled over several stochastic simulations
   and are utilized to determine extreme value statistical distributions
   which demonstrate the trends in the microstructural influence on fatigue
   performance. Marked radial correlation functions developed by Przybyla
   and McDowell {[}3] have also been employed to study the correlation
   between favorably oriented slip systems and the extreme value FIP
   locations within the instantiated microstructures. The simulation
   results suggest that reduced lamellar colony sizes, reduced a-phase, and
   a transverse texture within a reference plane normal to the applied
   uniaxial loading direction can enhance resistance to formation and early
   growth of fatigue cracks. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of C-3-C-4 alcohol synthesis from syngas are elucidated over
   a Mg/Al mixed metal oxide (MMO) supported K/MoS2 catalyst via
   C-13(2)-ethanol and C-13(2)-ethylene co-feeds. K/bulk-MoS2 is used as a
   control catalyst to provide insight into the role of K/MoS2 and
   K/MoS2-MMO sites on higher alcohol formation pathways. Analysis of the
   products via C-13 NMR show preferential enrichment of terminal carbons
   in C-3-C-4 alcohols with both co-feeds, suggesting that CO insertion is
   the primary higher alcohol synthesis pathway, and that olefin
   carbonylation proceeds through the same pathway as alcohol formation.
   The observation of C-13(4)-1-butanol species during the CO hydrogenation
   reactions with C-13(2)-ethanol co-feeds provides conclusive evidence of
   ethanol self-coupling to 1-butanol as a secondary pathway. Additionally,
   acetate species are shown to be formed via an acyl precursor reacting
   with an alkoxy anion. Hydrogenation of an acetyl species (CH3CO{*}) to
   an ethoxy intermediate (C2H5O{*}) is shown to be largely irreversible
   under the reaction conditions employed, as no preferential enrichment is
   observed for the acetyl group in acetate species. Propionate species are
   shown to be formed via esterification of propionate with the
   corresponding alcohol, while isobutyl alcohol formation observed over
   both the K/bulk-MoS2 and the MMO supported catalysts occurs via methanol
   coupling with 1-propanol or 1-propanol derived species. (C) 2016

Title = {{A novel path to chronic proprioceptive disability with oxaliplatin:
   Distortion of sensory encoding}},
Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{54-65}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Persistent neurotoxic side effects of oxaliplatin (OX) chemotherapy,
   including sensory ataxia, limit the efficacy of treatment and
   significantly diminish patient quality of life. The common explanation
   for neurotoxicity is neuropathy, however the degree of neuropathy varies
   greatly among patients and appears insufficient in some cases to fully
   account for disability. We recently identified an additional mechanism
   that might contribute to sensory ataxia following OX treatment. In the
   present study, we tested whether that mechanism, selective modification
   of sensory signaling by muscle proprioceptors might result in behavioral
   deficits in rats. OX was administered once per week for seven weeks
   (cumulative dose i.p. 70 mg/kg) to adult female Wistar rats. Throughout
   and for three weeks following treatment, behavioral analysis was
   performed daily on OX and sham control rats. Compared to controls, OX
   rats demonstrated errors in placing their hind feet securely and/or
   correctly during a horizontal ladder rung task. These behavioral
   deficits occurred together with modification of proprioceptor signaling
   that eliminated sensory encoding of static muscle position while having
   little effect on encoding of dynamic changes in muscle length. Selective
   inability to sustain repetitive firing in response to static muscle
   stretch led us to hypothesize that OX treatment impairs specific ionic
   currents, possibly the persistent inward Na currents (NaPIC) that are
   known to support repetitive firing during static stimulation in several
   neuron types, including the class of large diameter dorsal root ganglion
   cells that includes muscle proprioceptors. We tested this hypothesis by
   determining whether the chronic effects of OX on the firing behavior of
   muscle proprioceptors in vivo were mimicked by acute injection of NaPIC
   antagonists. Both riluzole and phenytoin, each having multiple drug
   actions but having only antagonist action on NaPIC in common, reproduced
   selective modification of proprioceptor signaling observed in OX rats.
   Taken together, these findings lead us to propose that OX chemotherapy
   contributes to movement disability by modifying sensory encoding,
   possibly via a chronic neurotoxic effect on NaPIC in the sensory
   terminals of muscle proprioceptors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a performance-regulation method for a class of
   stochastic timed event-driven systems aimed at output tracking of a
   given reference setpoint. The systems are either Discrete Event Dynamic
   Systems (DEDS) such as queueing networks or Petri nets, or Hybrid
   Systems (HS) with time-driven dynamics and event-driven dynamics, like
   fluid queues and hybrid Petri nets. The regulator, designed for
   simplicity and speed of computation, is comprised of a single integrator
   having a variable gain to ensure effective tracking under time-varying
   plants. The gain's computation is based on the Infinitesimal
   Perturbation Analysis (IPA) gradient of the plant function with respect
   to the control variable, and the resultant tracking can be quite robust
   with respect to modeling inaccuracies and gradient-estimation errors.
   The proposed technique is tested on examples taken from various
   application areas and modeled with different formalisms, including
   queueing models, Petri-net model of a production-inventory control
   system, and a stochastic DEDS model of a multicore chip control.
   Simulation results are presented in support of the proposed approach.

Title = {{An experimental study of buoyancy-Marangoni convection in confined and
   volatile binary fluids}},

Abstract = {{Marangoni convection in a volatile liquid film subject to a horizontal
   temperature gradient confined in a rectangular cavity is a basic problem
   of heat transfer and fluid mechanics with applications in evaporative
   cooling. The Marangoni stresses that drive this flow are due to surface
   tension gradients at the liquid-vapor interface. The thermocapillary
   stresses due to variations in surface tension with temperature for the
   most part drive the liquid away from hot regions. A volatile
   binary-fluid mixture can, however, be designed so that the
   solutocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with
   concentration drive the liquid instead towards hot regions, and hence
   oppose thermocapillary stresses. In thicker liquid layers, the flow is
   also affected by buoyancy. This work details an experimental study of
   buoyancy-Marangoni convection in a similar to 0.31 cm deep layer of
   methanol-water (MeOH-H2O) in a sealed rectangular cuvette driven by a
   temperature difference of similar to 6 degrees C over a horizontal
   distance of 4.9 cm. Particle pathline visualizations and particle-image
   velocimetry (PIV) were used to study this flow and determine how the
   liquid composition, quantified in terms of the MeOH concentration C-M,
   and noncondensables (i.e., air), quantified by the concentration of air
   in the gas space above the liquid c(a), affect the flow. Solutocapillary
   effects are strong enough to drive the liquid near the free surface
   towards the heated end over the entire horizontal extent of the liquid
   layer at low ca (i.e., c(a) < 6\%), suggesting that binary-fluid
   coolants could significantly reduce film dryout. This flow, driven by
   thermocapillarity, solutocapillarity and buoyancy, is classified into
   four distinct flow regimes that are summarized in a ca vs. CM flow
   regime map. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{585-595}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A thermodynamic analysis was performed for thick walled microchannels
   using the velocity slip and temperature jump at the interface of the
   solid fluid phases. The slip velocity and temperature jump effects were
   assumed to be equal for both the upper and lower walls. A Darcy-Brinkman
   model was used in the application of the momentum equation in the porous
   section of the channel and the effects of the magnetic field were
   considered. The thermal boundary conditions for two separate cases were
   proposed; case one assumed a constant high temperature for the lower
   wall and a constant low temperature for the upper wall, and case two
   which assumed constant heat flux boundary conditions for the lower wall
   and convective heat transfer for the upper wall. Constant, but
   different, internal heat generations were incorporated into the energy
   equations for all three parts of the system, and a combined analytical
   numerical solution procedure was then applied. A comprehensive
   investigation of the effects of the slip velocity and temperature jump
   on the velocity field, temperature distribution, Nusselt number, and
   local entropy generation rate was performed. The results indicate that a
   variation on the magnetic field may change the fluid velocity at the
   solid fluid interface. Interestingly, it was shown that by using a
   specific value for the temperature jump coefficient and variations in
   the thickness of the upper and/or lower wall thickness, it may be
   possible to achieve the maximum Nusselt number. However, depending on
   the value of the temperature jump, the Nusselt number may continuously
   increase or decrease, depending on the wall thickness. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   water desalination}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},

Abstract = {{A novel Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane with
   unique performance and characteristics was synthesized for water
   desalination. PVA thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes were
   fabricated by the infusion of Pluronic F-127 and multi-wall carbon
   nano-tubes (MWCNTs) in a single layer crosslinked by bisphenol A
   diglycidyl ether (DGEBA). The overall RO performance of the membranes
   including hydrophilicity, surface roughness, water permeability, salt
   rejection, chlorine resistance and biofouling resistance was evaluated
   using a dead end RO filtration unit. The incorporation of Pluronic F-127
   and MWCNTs improved the overall RO performance of the membranes. It was
   found that the modified membranes surface became smoother and highly
   hydrophilic compared to the pristine PVA membranes surfaces. This study
   indicated that the membranes that contain 0.08 and 0.1 wt\% MWCNTs
   provided excellent permeation, salt rejection, Chlorine and biofouling
   resistance and mechanical strength. The most striking result to emerge
   from this study is that the overall RO performance enhancement has
   transpired while utilizing PVA as an active RO separation layer without
   a polymeric or ceramic substrate. This study shows that proper
   crosslinking of PVA coupled with mechanical strength enhancement
   overcomes the common PVA drawbacks, mainly swelling and rupture under
   very high pressure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The subsurface damage and surface integrity of a spherical diamond
   indenter sliding against a face centred cubic copper (100) surface
   considering the pore and second-phase particle effects is investigated
   by means of molecular dynamic simulations of nanoindentation followed by
   nanomachining. In this investigation, we establish an analytical model
   for pore healing, and provide a criteria to determine whether or not
   pore can be healed. The results show that with increase of machining
   distance pore becomes smaller and then closes due to machining-induced
   compressive stress, resulting in low material damage and strong
   structure stability. Compared to free pore workpiece, machining force
   slightly relies upon the existence of pore and second-phase particle
   while friction coefficient strongly depends on the existence of that. In
   addition, particle induces work hardening due to Lomere-Cottrel lock and
   dislocation slip during machining metal matrix composites. It is helpful
   to understand the relation of machining performance and material
   parameter for obtaining higher surface integrity and lower subsurface
   damage during machining porous metals and particle reinforced metal

   developing countries, which could largely be prevented by the use of
   vaccines. While immunization rates have risen since the introduction of
   the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), there remain major
   challenges to more effective vaccination in developing countries. As a
   possible solution, microneedle patches containing an array of
   micron-sized needles on an adhesive backing have been developed to be
   used for vaccine delivery to the skin. These microneedle patches can be
   easily and painlessly applied by pressing against the skin and, in some
   designs, do not leave behind sharps waste. The patches are single-dose,
   do not require reconstitution, are easy to administer, have reduced size
   to simplify storage, transportation and waste disposal, and offer the
   possibility of improved vaccine immunogenicity, dose sparing and
   thermostability. This review summarizes vaccination challenges in
   developing countries and discusses advantages that microneedle patches
   offer for vaccination to address these challenges. We conclude that
   microneedle patches offer a powerful new technology that can enable more
   effective vaccination in developing countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Purpose: Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) is abundant
   in the subretinal space and binds retinoids and lipophilic molecules.
   The expression of IRBP begins precociously early in mouse eye
   development. IRBP-deficient (KO) mice show less cell death in the inner
   retinal layers of the retina before eyelid opening compared to wild-type
   C57BL/6J (WT) controls and eventually develop profound myopia. Thus,
   IRBP may play a role in eye development before visually-driven
   phenomena. We report comparative observations during the course of the
   natural development of eyes in WT and congenic IRBP KO mice that suggest
   IRBP is necessary at the early stages of mouse eye development for
   correct function and development to exist in later stages.
   Methods: We observed the natural development of congenic WT and IRBP KO
   mice, monitoring several markers of eye size and development, including
   haze and clarity of optical components in the eye, eye size, axial
   length, immunohistological markers of differentiation and eye
   development, visually guided behavior, and levels of a putative eye
   growth stop signal, dopamine. We conducted these measurements at several
   ages. Slit-lamp examinations were conducted at post-natal day (P) 21.
   Fundus and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images
   were compared at P15, P30, P45, and P80. Enucleated eyes from P5 to P10
   were measured for weight, and ocular dimensions were measured with a
   noncontact light-emitting diode (LED) micrometer. We counted the cells
   that expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH-positive cells) at P23-P36 using
   immunohistochemistry on retinal flatmounts. High-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze the amounts of dopamine (DA)
   and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) at P7-P60. Monocular form
   deprivation in the right eye was induced using head-mounted goggles from
   P28 to P56.
   Results: Eye elongation and eye size in the IRBP KO mice began to
   increase at P7 compared to the WT mice. This difference increased until
   P12, and the difference was maintained thereafter. SD-OCT images in live
   mice confirmed previously reported retinal thinning of the outer nuclear
   layer in the IRBP KO mice compared to the WT mice from P15 to P80.
   Slit-lamp and fundoscopy examination outcomes did not differ between the
   WT and KO mice. SD-OCT measurements of the optical axis components
   showed that the only factor contributing to excess optical axis length
   was the depth of the vitreous body. No other component of optical axis
   length (including corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, and lens
   thickness) was different from that of the WT mouse. The refractive power
   of the IRBP KO mice did not change in response to form deprivation. The
   number of retinal TH-positive cells was 28\% greater in the IRBP KO
   retinas compared to the WT mice at P30. No significant differences were
   observed in the steady-state retinal DA or DOPAC levels or in the
   DOPAC/DA ratios between the WT and IRBP KO mice.
   Conclusions: The IRBP KO mouse eye underwent precocious development and
   rapid eye size growth temporally about a day sooner than the WT mouse
   eye. Eye size began to differ between the WT and KO mice before eyelid
   opening, indicating no requirement for focus-dependent vision, and
   suggesting a developmental abnormality in the IRBP KO mouse eye that
   precedes form vision-dependent emmetropization. Additionally, the
   profoundly myopic KO eye did not respond to form deprivation compared to
   the non-deprived contralateral eye. Too much growth occurred in some
   parts of the eye, possibly upsetting a balance among size,
   differentiation, and focus-dependent growth suppression. Thus, the loss
   of IRBP may simply cause growth that is too rapid, possibly due to a
   lack of sequestration or buffering of morphogens that normally would
   bind to IRBP but are unbound in the IRBP KO eye. Despite the development
   of profound myopia, the DA levels in the IRBP KO mice were not
   statistically different from those in the WT mice, even with the excess
   of TH-positive cells in the IRBP KO mice compared to the WT mice.
   Overall, these data suggest that abnormal eye elongation in the IRBP KO
   mouse is independent of, precedes, and is epistatic to the process(es)
   of visually-driven refractive development.}},

Title = {{A model for cyclic mechanical reinforcement}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical force regulates a broad range of molecular interactions in
   biology. Three types of counterintuitive mechanical regulation of
   receptor-ligand dissociation have been described. Catch bonds are
   strengthened by constant forces, as opposed to slip bonds that are
   weakened by constant forces. The phenomenon that bonds become stronger
   with prior application of cyclic forces is termed cyclic mechanical
   reinforcement (CMR). Slip and catch bonds have respectively been
   explained by two-state models. However, they assume fast equilibration
   between internal states and hence are inadequate for CMR. Here we
   propose a three-state model for CMR where both loading and unloading
   regulate the transition of bonds among the short-lived, intermediate,
   and long-lived state. Cyclic forces favor bonds in the long-lived state,
   hence greatly prolonging their lifetimes. The three-state model explains
   the force history effect and agrees with the experimental CMR effect of
   integrin alpha beta(1)-fibronectin interaction. This model helps
   decipher the distinctive ways by which molecular bonds are mechanically
   strengthened: catch bonds by constant forces and CMR by cyclic forces.
   The different types of mechanical regulation may enable the cell to fine
   tune its mechanotransduction via membrane receptors.}},

Abstract = {{In this Research Article, the effect of two techniques for top-electrode
   deposition in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) cells with the configuration
   ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/top-electrode is analyzed. One
   deposition was made by evaporation under high vacuum, meanwhile the
   other was carried out at normal room atmosphere; for the former, a
   double layer of Ca and the eutectic alloy Field's metal (FM) was
   thermally evaporated, while for the latter FM was deposited just by
   melting and dropping it on top of the delimited active area at
   temperatures about 90 degrees C. The average short circuit photocurrent
   density, open circuit voltage and fill factor for devices with either
   Ca/FM (evaporated) or FM (by dripping) cathode, were very similar:
   around 13.20 mA/cm(2), 840 mV, and 0.6, respectively. Average efficiency
   for devices with the mentioned evaporated cathode was of 6.4\% (largest
   value 7.0\%), meanwhile for devices with the cathode deposited by
   dripping, it was of 6.1\% (largest value 6.5\%). Morphological analysis,
   by atomic force microscopy on the surface of a FM electrode, detached
   from an OPV device, shows inhomogeneities and pinholes in its surface
   with an average roughness of 16 nm. OPV photocurrent was studied by
   means of laser beam induced current (LBIC), it showed that OPVs devices
   with FM top electrode exhibits an inhomogeneous response. An impedance
   analysis was also carried out and results were correlated with defects
   observed at the studied interface. In spite of the mentioned
   deficiencies at FM interface, overall PV performance of devices with
   this electrode highlights the convenience of using FM because of its
   easy, fast, and low-cost deposition (vacuum free) characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{We report a simple and versatile system for generating highly
   concentrated H2O2 on the surface of nanoparticles through enzymatic
   oxidation of glucose. It involves immobilization of glucose oxidase, a
   negatively charged enzyme, on the surface of a positively charged metal
   nanoparticle via electrostatic attraction. Upon the introduction of
   glucose at a concentration of 1.7 mM, this system is able to produce
   enzymatic H2O2 on the surface of the nanoparticle, with oxidation power
   equivalent to that of aqueous H2O2 at a concentration of 5 M when it is
   directly added into the reaction solution. We have evaluated the system
   for the etching of both twinned and single-crystal Ag nanocubes. We
   identified that the highly localized and concentrated H2O2 generated on
   the surfaces of Ag twinned cubes would lead to selective etching from
   the \{111\} facets parallel to the twin plane, in a fashion identical to
   the growth process but in the reversed order. For Ag single crystals
   nanocubes, the etching would initiate from the corners to gradually
   transform the cubes into spheres. This study offers the opportunity to
   control the etching of metal nanocrystals with selectivity for
   elucidating the mechanism and diversifying the nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{We report novel dual-responsive plasmonic core shell anisotropic
   nanostructures composed of gold nanorod (AuNR) and responsive
   polyaniline (PANT) shells with plasmonic mode appearance reversibly
   modulated through orthogonal stimuli (i.e., electrical potential and pH
   change). In this system, the PANT shells provide AuNR cores with three
   different refractive index environments depending on stimuli (pH and
   electrical potential). Therefore, no additional secondary responsive
   component is necessary to induce the dual-responsive properties of AuNR
   cores. Furthermore, in this study, dual-responsive properties can be
   realized for nanostructures fixed on substrates, whereas previously
   reported dual-responsive plasmonic systems can only be controlled in
   solution. Here, the highest localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR)
   shift of the AuNR cores can be induced by changing both local pH and
   applying electric potential. Notably, a significant plasmon band shift
   by 107 nm is realized with only 8 nm thick PANI shell due to the large
   refractive index change at the gold polymer interface. A maximum shift
   of the longitudinal plasmon mode of 149 nm is obtained by applying a
   modest electrical potential (below +/- 1 V), a large shift rarely
   reported in the literature for metal nanostructures. Moreover, our
   anisotropic core/shell nanostructures exhibit stable and reversible
   dual-responsive LSPR behavior over 100 cycles without degradation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{We compare the effect of single qubit incoherent and coherent errors on
   the logical error rate of the Steane {[}{[}7,1,3]] quantum error
   correction code by performing an exact full-density-matrix simulation of
   an error correction step. We find that the effective 1-qubit process
   matrix at the logical level reveals the key differences between the
   error models and provides insight into why the Pauli twirling
   approximation is a good approximation for incoherent errors and a poor
   approximation for coherent ones. Approximate channels composed of
   Clifford operations and Pauli measurement operators that are pessimistic
   at the physical level result in pessimistic error rates at the logical
   level. In addition, we observe that the pseudothreshold can differ by a
   factor of 5 depending on whether the error is calculated using the
   fidelity or the distance.}},

Title = {{Non-negligible Contributions to Thermal Conductivity From Localized
   Modes in Amorphous Silicon Dioxide}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity is important for almost all applications involving
   heat transfer. The theory and modeling of crystalline materials is in
   some sense a solved problem, where one can now calculate their thermal
   conductivity from first principles using expressions based on the phonon
   gas model (PGM). However, modeling of amorphous materials still has many
   open questions, because the PGM itself becomes questionable when one
   cannot rigorously define the phonon velocities. In this report, we used
   our recently developed Green-Kubo modal analysis (GKMA) method to study
   amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO2). The predicted thermal conductivities
   exhibit excellent agreement with experiments and anharmonic effects are
   included in the thermal conductivity calculation for all the modes in
   a-SiO2 for the first time. Previously, localized modes (locons) have
   been thought to have a negligible contribution to thermal conductivity,
   due to their highly localized nature. However, in a-SiO2 our results
   indicate that locons contribute more than 10\% to the total thermal
   conductivity from 400 K to 800 K and they are largely responsible for
   the increase in thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 above room temperature.
   This is an effect that cannot be explained by previous methods and
   therefore offers new insight into the nature of phonon transport in
   amorphous/glassy materials.}},

Abstract = {{IceTop is an air-shower array located on the Antarctic ice sheet at the
   geographic South Pole. IceTop can detect an astrophysical flux of
   neutrons from Galactic sources as an excess of cosmic-ray air showers
   arriving from the source direction. Neutrons are undeflected by the
   Galactic magnetic field and can typically travel 10 (E/PeV) pc before
   decay. Two searches are performed using 4 yr of the IceTop data set to
   look for a statistically significant excess of events with energies
   above 10 PeV (10(16) eV) arriving within a small solid angle. The
   all-sky search method covers from -90 degrees to approximately -50
   degrees in declination. No significant excess is found. A targeted
   search is also performed, looking for significant correlation with
   candidate sources in different target sets. This search uses a
   higher-energy cut (100 PeV) since most target objects lie beyond 1 kpc.
   The target sets include pulsars with confirmed TeV energy photon fluxes
   and high-mass X-ray binaries. No significant correlation is found for
   any target set. Flux upper limits are determined for both searches,
   which can constrain Galactic neutron sources and production scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Precious metals are widely used as catalysts in industry. It is of
   critical importance to keep the precious metal ions leached from
   catalysts at a level below one part per million (ppm) in the final
   products and to recycle the expensive precious metals. Here we
   demonstrate a simple and effective method for scavenging precious metal
   ions from an aqueous solution and thereby reduce their concentrations
   down to the parts per billion (ppb) level. The key component is a
   filtration membrane comprised of titania (TiO2) nanofibers whose surface
   has been functionalized with a silane bearing amino or thiol group. When
   operated under continuous flow at a rate of 1mLmin(-1) and at room
   temperature, up to 99.95\% of the Pd2+ ions could be removed from a
   stock solution with an initial concentration of 100ppm. This work offers
   a viable strategy not only for the removal of precious metal ions but
   also for recovering and further recycling them for use as catalysts. For
   example, the captured Pd2+ ions could be converted to nanoparticles and
   used as catalysts for organic reactions such as Suzuki coupling in a
   continuous flow reactor. This system can be potentially applied to
   pharmaceutical industry and waste stream treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation is fundamental to life. All organisms adapt over timescales
   that span from evolution to generations and lifetimes to
   moment-by-moment interactions. The nervous system is particularly adept
   at rapidly adapting to change, and this in fact may be one of its
   fundamental principles of organization and function. Rapid forms of
   sensory adaptation have been well documented across all sensory
   modalities in a wide range of organisms, yet we do not have a
   comprehensive understanding of the adaptive cellular mechanisms that
   ultimately give rise to the corresponding percepts, due in part to the
   complexity of the circuitry. In this Perspective, we aim to build links
   between adaptation at multiple scales of neural circuitry by
   investigating the differential adaptation across brain regions and
   sub-regions and across specific cell types, for which the explosion of
   modern tools has just begun to enable. This investigation points to a
   set of challenges for the field to link functional observations to
   adaptive properties of the neural circuit that ultimately underlie
   percepts.}},

Title = {{Wall Teichoic Acids Are Involved in the Medium-Induced Loss of Function
   of the Autolysin CD11 against Clostridium difficile}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial lysins are potent antibacterial enzymes with potential
   applications in the treatment of bacterial infections. Some lysins lose
   activity in the growth media of target bacteria, and the underlying
   mechanism remains unclear. Here we use CD11, an autolysin of Clostridium
   difficile, as a model lysin to demonstrate that the inability of this
   enzyme to kill C. difficile in growth medium is not associated with
   inhibition of the enzyme activity by medium, or the modification of the
   cell wall peptidoglycan. Rather, wall teichoic acids (WTAs) appear to
   prevent the enzyme from binding to the cells and cleaving the cell wall
   peptidoglycan. By partially blocking the biosynthetic pathway of WTAs
   with tunicamycin, cell binding improved and the lytic efficacy of CD11
   was significantly enhanced. This is the first report of the mechanism of
   lysin inactivation in growth medium, and provides insights into
   understanding the behavior of lysins in complex environments, including
   the gastrointestinal tract.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy eyes contain a population of limbal stem cells (LSCs) that
   continuously renew the corneal epithelium. However, each year, 1 million
   Americans are afflicted with severely reduced visual acuity caused by
   corneal damage or disease, including LSC deficiency (LSCD). Recent
   advances in corneal transplant technology promise to repair the cornea
   by implanting healthy LSCs to encourage regeneration; however, success
   is limited to transplanted tissues that contain a sufficiently high
   percentage of LSCs. Attempts to screen limbal tissues for suitable
   implants using molecular sternness markers are confounded by the poorly
   understood signature of the LSC phenotype. For cells derived from the
   corneal limbus, we show that the performance of cell stiffness as a
   stemness indicator is on par with the performance of Delta NP63 alpha, a
   common molecular marker. In combination with recent methods for sorting
   cells on a biophysical basis, the biomechanical sternness markers
   presented here may enable the rapid purification of LSCs from a
   heterogeneous population of corneal cells, thus potentially enabling
   clinicians and researchers to generate corneal transplants with
   sufficiently high fractions of LSCs, regardless of the LSC percentage in
   the donor tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and convenient detection of explosive components is vital for a
   wide spectrum of applications ranging from national security and
   demilitarization to environmental monitoring and restoration. With the
   increasing use of DNAN as. a replacement for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)
   in insensitive explosive formulations, there has been a growing interest
   in strategies to minimize its release and to understand and predict its
   behavior in the environment. Consequently, a convenient tool. for its
   detection and destruction could enable development of More effective
   decontamination and demilitarization strategies. Biosensors and
   biocatalysts have limited applicability to the more traditional
   explosives because of the inherent limitations of the relevant enzymes.
   Here, we report a highly specific, convenient and robust biocatalyst
   based on a novel ether hydrolase enzyme, DNAN demethylase (that requires
   no cofactors), from a Nocardioides strain that can mineralize DNAN.
   Biogenic silica encapsulation was used to stabilize the enzyme and
   enable it to be packed into a Model microcolumn for application as a
   biosensor or as a bioreactor for continuous destruction of DNAN. The
   immobilized enzyme was stable and not inhibited by other insensitive
   munitions constituents. An alternative method for DNAN detection
   involved coating the encapsulated enzyme on cellulose filter paper. The
   hydrolase based biocatalyst could provide the basis for a wide spectrum
   of applications including detection, identification; destruction Or
   inertion of explosives containing DNAN (demilitarization operations),
   and for environmental restorations.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically Inspired Design (biomimicry) and Industrial Ecology both
   look to natural systems to enhance the sustainability and performance of
   engineered products, systems and industries. Bioinspired design (BID)
   traditionally has focused on a unit operation and single product level.
   In contrast, this paper describes how principles of network Organization
   derived from analysis of ecosystem properties can be applied to
   industrial system networks. Specifically, this paper examines the
   applicability of particular food web matrix properties as design rules
   for economically and biologically sustainable industrial networks, using
   an optimization model developed for a carpet recycling network. Carpet
   recycling network designs based on traditional cost and emissions based
   optimization are compared to designs obtained using optimizations based
   solely. on ecological food web metrics. The analysis suggests that
   networks optimized using food web metrics also were superior from a
   traditional cost, and emissions perspective; correlations between
   optimization using ecological metrics and traditional optimization
   ranged generally from 0.70:to 0.96, with flow-based metrics being
   superior to structural parameters. Four structural food parameters
   provided correlations nearly the same as that obtained using all
   structural parameters, but individual structural parameters provided
   much less. satisfactory correlations. The analysis indicates that
   bioinspired design principles from ecosystems can lead to both
   environmentally and economically sustainable industrial resource
   networks, and represent guidelines for designing sustainable, industry
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the
   inhibitory effect of furfural (FF), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF),
   syringic acid (SA), vanillic acid (VA), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA);
   which are problematic lignocellulose-derived byproducts, on
   exoelectrogenesis in the bioanode of a microbial electrolysis cell. The
   five compound mixture at an initial total concentration range from 0.8
   to 8.0 g/L resulted in an up to 91\% current decrease as a result of
   exoelectrogenesis inhibition; fermentative, nonexoelectrogenic
   biotransformation pathways of the five compounds were not affected.
   Furthermore, the parent compounds at a high concentration, as opposed to
   their biotransformation products, were responsible for the observed
   inhibition. All five parent compounds contributed to the observed
   inhibition of the mixture. The IC50 (i.e., concentration resulting in
   50\% current decrease) of individually tested parent compounds was 2.7
   g/L for FF, 3.0 g/L for HMF, 1.9 g/L for SA, 2.1 g/L for VA and 2.0 g/L
   for HBA. However,the parent compounds, when tested below their
   respective noninhibitory concentration, jointly resulted in significant
   inhibition as a mixture. Catechol and phenol, which were persistent
   biotransformation products, inhibited exoelectrogenesis only at high
   concentrations, but to a lesser extent than the parent compounds.
   Exoelectrogenesis recovery from inhibition by all compounds was observed
   at different rates, with the exception of catechol, which resulted in
   irreversible inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a setting in which a company not only has a fleet of
   capacitated vehicles and drivers available to make deliveries, but may
   also use the services of occasional drivers who are willing to make a
   single delivery using their own vehicle in return for a small
   compensation if the delivery location is not too far from their own
   destination. The company seeks to make all the deliveries at minimum
   total cost, i.e., the cost associated with its own vehicles and drivers
   plus the compensation paid to the occasional drivers. The option to use
   occasional drivers to make deliveries gives rise to a new and
   interesting variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing
   problem. We design and implement a multi-start heuristic which produces
   solutions with small errors when compared with optimal solutions
   obtained by solving an integer programming formulation with a commercial
   solver. A comprehensive computational study provides valuable insight
   into the potential of using occasional drivers to reduce delivery costs,
   focusing primarily on the number and flexibility of occasional drivers
   and the compensation scheme employed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The 3-Omega measurement technique was applied to a fabricated
   metal-coated glass fiber for the purpose of low power gas sensing. The
   sensor performance was evaluated for mixtures of CO2, Ar, He and CH4 in
   N-2 in an isothermal chamber, where mass flow controllers precisely
   controlled concentrations. The metal coated fiber was fabricated by
   depositing a thin layer of gold (similar to 150 nm) onto a glass fiber,
   using a custom designed deposition lathe installed in a standard
   sputtering system. A custom 3-Omega conditioning circuit controls the AC
   heating current and detection of the 3-Omega voltage signal. The
   amplitude and phase lag, and the in-phase and out-of-phase components of
   the 3-Omega voltage signal are presented for different gas mixtures and
   are related directly to their concentrations. Using this gas sensing
   technique, we have demonstrated the uncertainty in concentration (i.e.,
   sensitivity) to be better than 50 ppm, and as low at 10 ppm for some
   gases. The dependence of the different 3-Omega signals on the
   thermophysical properties of the system is briefly described. The low
   power, high sensitivity nature of the sensor is also demonstrated as the
   metal-coated fiber sensor consumes similar to 10\% of the power consumed
   by conventional thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs), and unlike those,
   it operates at near room temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Dynamic response of a full-scale reinforced concrete building frame

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{125}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Many existing reinforced concrete buildings designed in accordance with
   pre-1971 codes are generally dominated by weak column-strong beam
   behavior under seismic loading due to inadequate reinforcement
   detailing. This behavior can lead to premature failure under seismic
   loads from damage concentrated in the first story of the structure. This
   paper presents the results of an experimental investigation into the
   seismic response of a full-scale, two-story non-ductile reinforced
   concrete frame. The frame was retrofitted with a fiber-reinforced
   polymer jacketing system on the first story columns to mitigate seismic
   vulnerability. Shake weight testing was performed to investigate the
   dynamic performance of the retrofitted building structure in terms of
   the modal response, inter-story drift, and effectiveness of the
   fiber-reinforced polymer jacketing system. The results demonstrate that
   the retrofit scheme helped develop a more uniform story drift
   distribution, working to counter the soft-story mechanism commonly found
   in reinforced concrete frames designed during this period. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{An experimental study of plane-strain circular indentation of a model
   strain hardening material was made to provide direct in situ
   observations of the evolving deformation field and associated material
   response. High-resolution images of the deformation zone and
   simultaneous load measurement were captured during the indentation
   process using an in situ imaging platform. Particle image velocimetry
   enabled mapping of the deformation zone in terms of the evolving
   displacement, strain rate and strain fields from the optical images. The
   quantitative image analyses revealed the presence and evolution of
   material stagnation zones in the deformation field, as well as the
   accumulation of deformation in the form of banded segments underneath
   the indenter that exhibited high incremental strains. These experimental
   measurements enabled calibration of an expanding cavity model for
   describing the deformation in terms of the underlying deformation zone
   geometry. The calibrated expanding cavity model was shown to provide for
   better predictive estimates of the deformation and loading response in
   comparison to a traditional expanding cavity model approach. (C) 2016

   is modulated within the lattice. Undulation is specifically considered
   in relation to its ability to induce anisotropy in the equivalent

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},

Abstract = {{Sulfonamide antibiotks have been frequently detected in the aquatic
   environment and are of emerging concern due to their adverse bio-effect
   and potential of inducing antibiotic resistance. This study investigated
   the degradation kinetics of sulfonamide antibiotics in synthetic
   wastewater and hydrolyzed human urine by low pressure (LP) UV, UV/H2O2
   and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS). Direct photolysis rates of sulfonamide
   antibiotics varied and depended on the structures. Sulfonamides with a
   five-membered heterocyclic group underwent faster direct photolysis. For
   indirect photolysis processes, second-order rate constants of
   sulfonamide antibiotics with hydroxyl radical, sulfate radical and
   carbonate radical were determined, which were (6.21-9.26) x 10(9),
   (0.77-16.1) x 10(10) and (1.25-8.71) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively. A
   dynamic model was applied and successfully predicted the degradation
   kinetics of sulfonamides in different water matrices. In synthetic
   wastewater, carbonate radical contributed to approximately 10\% of the
   overall removal, whereas in synthetic hydrolyzed urine, carbonate
   radical was the dominant reactive species to degrade sulfonamides.
   Sulfonamide antibiotics were eliminated more efficiently in synthetic
   hydrolyzed urine than in synthetic wastewater and UV/PDS was more
   efficient than UV/H2O2 to degrade most sulfonamides. Energy evaluation
   showed that UV/PDS costs less energy than LPUV and UV/H2O2 under the
   experimental conditions applied in this study, particularly for
   sulfonamides whose indirect photolysis overweighed direct photolysis. By
   varying UV dose and oxidant dose, the UV/H2O2 process can be optimized
   to achieve higher efficiency than the UV/PDS process in synthetic
   wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   an AAD (average absolute deviation between calculated and experimental

Abstract = {{Suppose that we wish to estimate a vector x is an element of C-n from a
   small number of noisy linear measurements of the form y = Ax + z, where
   z represents measurement noise. When the vector x is sparse, meaning
   that it has only s nonzeros with s << n, one can obtain a significantly
   more accurate estimate of x by adaptively selecting the rows of A based
   on the previous measurements provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is
   sufficiently large. In this paper, we consider the case where we wish to
   realize the potential of adaptivity but where the rows of A are subject
   to physical constraints. In particular, we examine the case where the
   rows of A are constrained to belong to a finite set of allowable
   measurement vectors. We demonstrate both the limitations and advantages
   of adaptive sensing in this constrained setting. We prove that for
   certain measurement ensembles, the benefits offered by adaptive designs
   fall far short of the improvements that are possible in the
   unconstrained adaptive setting. On the other hand, we also provide both
   theoretical and empirical evidence that in some scenarios, adaptivity
   does still result in substantial improvements even in the constrained
   setting. To illustrate these potential gains, we propose practical
   algorithms for constrained adaptive sensing by exploiting connections to
   the theory of optimal experimental design and show that these algorithms
   exhibit promising performance in some representative applications.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy can be generated from the mixing of seawater with river

   exchange membranes (IEMs) are key factors to the success of future RED
   energy generation. This research presents the synthesis and
   characterization of a new kind of nanocomposite cation exchange membrane
   (CEM) by using oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs) blended
   with sulfonated poly (2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (SPPO). The nano
   composite CEM showed simultaneous improvement of membrane anti-fouling
   performance and energy generation performance in RED systems. The
   physicochemical and electrochemical properties of nano composite CEMs
   were enhanced compared to pristine SPPO CEMs. The results indicated that
   the optimal inorganic loadings were 0.3-0.5 wt\%, which showed the best
   anti-fouling performance and highest power density in RED. The results
   show that O-MWCNTs are promising materials to improve properties of
   IEMs, and nanocomposite IEMs are competitive candidates for application

Abstract = {{Antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) effectively suppresses replication of
   both the immunodeficiency viruses, human (HIV) and simian (SIV);
   however, virus rebounds soon after ART is withdrawn. SIV-infected
   monkeys were treated with a 90-day course of ART initiated at 5 weeks
   post infection followed at 9 weeks post infection by infusions of a
   primatized monoclonal antibody against the alpha(4)beta(7) integrin
   administered every 3 weeks until week 32. These animals subsequently
   maintained low to undetectable viral loads and normal CD4(+) T cell
   counts in plasma and gastrointestinal tissues for more than 9 months,
   even after all treatment was withdrawn. This combination therapy allows
   macaques to effectively control viremia and reconstitute their immune
   systems without a need for further therapy.}},

Title = {{Flutter Phenomenon in Flow Driven Energy Harvester- A Unified
   Theoretical Model for ``Stiff{''} and ``Flexible{''} Materials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Here, we report a stable and predictable aero-elastic motion in the
   flow-driven energy harvester, which is different from flapping and
   vortex-induced-vibration (VIV). A unified theoretical frame work that
   describes the flutter phenomenon observed in both ``stiff{''} and
   ``flexible{''} materials for flow driven energy harvester was presented
   in this work. We prove flutter in both types of materials is the results
   of the coupled effects of torsional and bending modes. Compared to
   ``stiff{''} materials, which has a flow velocity-independent flutter
   frequency, flexible material presents a flutter frequency that almost
   linearly scales with the flow velocity. Specific to ``flexible{''}
   materials, pre-stress modulates the frequency range in which flutter
   occurs. It is experimentally observed that a double-clamped
   ``flexible{''} piezoelectric P(VDF-TrFE) thin belt, when driven into the
   flutter state, yields a 1,000 times increase in the output voltage
   compared to that of the non-fluttered state. At a fixed flow velocity,
   increase in prestress level of the P(VDF-TrFE) thin belt up-shifts the
   flutter frequency. In addition, this work allows the rational design of
   flexible piezoelectric devices, including flow-driven energy harvester,
   triboelectric energy harvester, and self-powered wireless flow speed
   sensor.}},

Title = {{Enhanced proliferation of PC12 neural cells on untreated, nanotextured

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic injury to the central nervous system is a significant health
   problem. There is no effective treatment available partly because of the
   complexity of the system. Implementation of multifunctional micro-and
   nano-device based combinatorial therapeutics can provide biocompatible
   and tunable approaches to perform on-demand release of specific drugs.
   This can help the damaged cells to improve neuronal survival,
   regeneration of axons, and their reconnection to appropriate targets.
   Nano-topological features induced rapid cell growth is especially
   important towards the design of effective platforms to facilitate
   damaged neural circuit reconstruction. In this study, for the first
   time, feasibility of neuron-like PC12 cell growth on untreated and easy
   to prepare nanotextured surfaces has been carried out. The PC12
   neuron-like cells were cultured on micro reactive ion etched.
   nanotextured glass coverslips. The effect of nanotextured topology as
   physical cue for the growth of PC12 cells was observed exclusively,
   eliminating the possible influence(s) of the enhanced concentration of
   coated materials on the surface. The cell density was observed to
   increase by almost 200\% on nanotextured coverslips compared to plain
   coverslips. The morphology study indicated that PC12 cell attachment and
   growth on the nanotextured substrates did not launch any apoptotic
   machinery of the cell. Less than 5\% cells deformed and depicted
   condensed nuclei with apoptotic bodies on nanotextured surfaces which is
   typical for the normal cell handling and culture. Enhanced PC12 cell
   proliferation by such novel and easy to prepare substrates is not only
   attractive for neurite outgrowth and guidance, but may be used to
   increase the affinity of similar cancerous cells (ex: B35 neuroblastoma)
   and rapid proliferation thereafter-towards the development of
   combinatorial theranostics to diagnose and treat aggressive cancers like
   neuroblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{Online social networks are today's fastest growing communications
   channel and a popular source of information for many, so understanding
   their contribution to building awareness and shaping public perceptions
   of climate change is of utmost importance. Today's online social
   networks are composed of complex combinations of entities and
   communication channels and it is not clear which communicators are the
   most influential, what the patterns of communication flow are, or even
   whether the widely accepted two-step flow of communication model applies
   in this new arena. This study examines the diffusion of energy saving
   practices in a large online social network across organizations, opinion
   leaders, and the public by tracking 108,771 communications on energy
   saving practices among 1,084 communicators, then analyzing the flow of
   information and influence over a 28 day period. Our findings suggest
   that diffusion networks of messages advocating energy saving practices
   are predominantly led by the activities of dedicated organizations but
   their attempts do not result in substantial public awareness, as most of
   these communications are effectively trapped in organizational loops in
   which messages are simply shared between organizations. Despite their
   comparably significant influential values, opinion leaders played a weak
   role in diffusing energy saving practices to a wider audience. Thus, the
   two-step flow of communication model does not appear to describe the
   sharing of energy conservation practices in large online heterogeneous
   networks. These results shed new light on the underlying mechanisms
   driving the diffusion of important societal issues such as energy
   efficiency, particularly in the context of large online social media
   outlets.}},

Abstract = {{High-coverage whole-genome sequence studies have so far focused on a
   limited number(1) of geographically restricted populations(2-5), or been
   targeted at specific diseases, such as cancer(6). Nevertheless, the
   availability of high-resolution genomic data has led to the development
   of new methodologies for inferring population history(7-9) and refuelled
   the debate on the mutation rate in humans(10). Here we present the
   Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset of 483
   high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including
   379 new genomes from 125 populations, which we group into diversity and
   selection sets. We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of
   continent-wide patterns of heterozygosity, long-and short-distance gene
   flow, archaic admixture, and changes in effective population size
   through time as well as for signals of positive or balancing selection.
   We find a genetic signature in present-day Papuans that suggests that at
   least 2\% of their genome originates from an early and largely extinct
   expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) out of Africa. Together
   with evidence from the western Asian fossil record(11), and admixture
   between AMHs and Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion(12),
   our results contribute to the mounting evidence for the presence of AMHs
   out of Africa earlier than 75,000 years ago.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient processes for adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin
   mixtures are likely to have many advantages Over traditional separation
   techniques for these commodity chemicals. Although some metal, organic
   frameworks (MOFs) have been studied experimentally for this process, a
   large-scale computational screening study has not been reported due to
   the inherent difficulty in describing the critical role of interactions
   of olefins with open metal sites (OMS). In this paper, we introduce new
   density functional theory (DFT) derived force fields (FFs) that
   accurately describe adsorption of C-2 and C-3 olefins and paraffins in
   CuBTC. Using detailed DFT calculations for MOF-505 and PCN-16, we show
   that the energetics predicted by our FFs are transferable to other
   related MOFs that contain Cu OMS. Next, we evaluate the performance of
   94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane
   separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties
   as adsorbents. Finally, we show that the ideal adsorbed solution theory
   is inaccurate for inhomogeneous olefin/MOF systems and present extensive
   binary propane/propylene adsorption isotherms for the top-performing
   MOFs identified in our calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting biomechanical energy especially in vivo is of special
   significance for sustainable powering of wearable/implantable
   electronics. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is one of the most
   promising solutions considering its high efficiency, low cost, light
   weight, and easy fabrication, but its performance will be greatly
   affected if there is moisture or liquid leaked into the device when
   applied in vivo. Here, we demonstrate a multiple encapsulation process
   of the TENG to maintain its output performance in various harsh
   environments. Through systematic studies, the,encapsulated TENG showed
   great reliability in humid or even harsh environment over 30 days with a
   stability index of more than 95\%. Given its outstanding reliability,
   the TENG has the potential to be applied in variety of circumstances to
   function as a sustainable power source for self-powered biomedical
   electronics and environmental sensing systems.}},

Title = {{Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Silicon Nitride Barrier Films on
   Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Substrates}},
Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{40}},

Abstract = {{A singular critical onset strain value has been used to characterize the
   strain limits of barrier films used in flexible electronics. However,
   such metrics do not account for time-dependent or environmentally
   assisted cracking, which can be critical in determining the overall
   reliability of these thin-film coatings. In this work, the time
   dependent channel crack growth behavior of silicon nitride barrier films
   on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates is investigated in dry
   and humid environments by tensile tests with in situ Optical microscopy
   and numerical models. The results reveal the occurrence of
   environmentally assisted crack growth at strains well below the critical
   onset crack strain and in the absence of polymer-relaxation-assisted,
   time-dependent crack growth. The crack growth rates in laboratory air
   are about 1 order of magnitude larger than those tested in dry
   environments (dry air or dry nitrogen). In laboratory air, crack growth
   rates increase from similar to 200 nm/s to 60 mu m/s for applied stress
   intensity factors, K, ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 MPa.m(1/2), below the
   measured fracture toughness K-c of 1.8 MPa.m(1/2). The crack growth
   rates in dry environments were also strongly dependent on the prior
   storage of the specimens, with larger rates for specimens exposed to
   laboratory air (and therefore moisture) prior to testing compared to
   specimens stored in a dry environment. This behavior is attributed to
   moisture-assisted cracking, with a measured power law exponent of
   similar to 22 in laboratory air. This study also reveals that much
   larger densities of channel cracks develop in the humid environment,
   suggesting an easier initiation of channel cracks in the presence of
   water vapor. The results obtained in this work are critical to address
   the time-dependent and environmental reliability issues of thin brittle
   barriers on PET substrates for flexible electronics applications.}},

Title = {{Direct Capture of CO2 from Ambient Air}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL REVIEWS}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{The increase in the global atmospheric CO2 concentration resulting from
   over a century of combustion of fossil fuels has been associated with
   significant global climate change. With the global population increase
   driving continued increases in fossil fuel use,, humanity's primary
   reliance on fossil energy for the next several decades is assured.
   Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and
   postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the
   rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the
   direct removal of CO2 from the air, or ``direct air capture{''} (DAC),
   can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration. The past
   decade has seen a steep rise in the use of chemical sorbents that are
   cycled through sorption and desorption cycles for CO, removal from
   ultradilute gases such as air. This Review provides a historical
   overview of the field of DAC, along with an exhaustive description of
   the use of chemical sorbents targeted at this application. Solvents and
   solid sorbents that interact strongly with CO2 are described, including
   basic solvents, supported amine and ammonium materials, and
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the primary classes of chemical
   sorbents. Hypothetical processes for the deployment of such sorbents are
   discussed, as well as the limited array of technoeconomic analyses
   published on DAC. Overall, it is concluded that there are many new
   materials that could play a role in emerging DAC technologies. However,
   these materials need to be further investigated and developed with a
   practical sorbent-air contacting process in mind if society is to make
   rapid progress in deploying DAC as a means of mitigating climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) has been
   determined using X-ray fiber diffraction (XRFD) combined with molecular
   modeling. Analysis of the XRFD data suggested the space group was P2(1),
   with a monoclinic unit cell where a = 5.784 angstrom, b = 6.780
   angstrom, c = 20.296 angstrom, and gamma = 103.3 degrees, giving a
   calculated unit cell density of the crystal phase was 1.562 g/cm(3). The
   repeating unit consisted of two monomers related to each other by a 2(1)
   screw axis. It was also shown that two PEF chains were included in each
   unit cell, with the center-chain being staggered with respect to the
   corner-chain. Polymer chains were found to be near planar, although
   careful evaluation showed that the best fit with the data required the
   cell to contain a mixture of 3/12 and 5/12 center-chain-staggering. (C)

   different tip geometries}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{317-325}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{It has become increasingly common to use atomic force microscopy
   measurements to probe mechanical properties at the nano-micro level. The
   data obtained from these measurements, however, must be subjected to
   specific models for deconvolution of the effect of the probe's tip size
   and shape. While analytical models have been developed to assist in this
   endeavor, a thorough understanding of the limits of these models is
   essential to fit data accurately. In this report, we explore the
   relationship between three different analytical tip shape models for the
   AFM tip (spherical, parabolic, and conical indenters) and present an
   analysis of mechanical testing on selected materials. Along with this,
   we present a simple numerical method for computing the contact radius
   for true spherical contact. The role of tip size (large vs small radius)
   on the limitations of data analysis and the benefits and drawbacks
   inherent to different tip sizes is discussed. Our analysis demonstrates
   the ability to accurately apply multiple models to a given data set,
   while also showing the limitations of simple analytical models to
   accurately describe tip-sample interactions outside of certain
   indentation regimes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Gradient Mn-La-Pt catalysts with three-layered structure of manganese
   dioxide (MnO2), lanthanum oxide (La2O3), and Platinum (Pt) for Li-O-2
   battery are prepared in this study. The mass ratio of the catalysts is
   respectively 5:2:3, 4:2:4, and 3:2:5 (MnO2: La2O3: Pt) which is start
   from the side of the electrolyte. The relationship between morphology
   structure and electrochemical performance of gradient catalyst is
   investigated by energy dispersive spectrometry and constant current
   charge/discharge test. The Li-O-2 battery based on gradient Mn-La-Pt
   catalysts shows high discharge specific capacity (2707 mAh
   g(-1)),specific energy density (8400 Wh kg(-1)) and long cycle life (56
   cycles). The improvement of the Li-O-2 battery discharge capacity is
   attributed to the gradient distribution of MnO2 and Pt and the
   involvement of La2O3 that can improve the energy density of the battery.
   More important, this work will also provide new ideas and methods for
   the research of other metal-air battery.}},

Title = {{Regulation of actin catch-slip bonds with a RhoA-formin module}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic turnover of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated
   cooperatively by force and biochemical signaling. We previously
   demonstrated that actin depolymerization under force is governed by
   catch-slip bonds mediated by force-induced K113:E195 salt-bridges. Yet,
   the biochemical regulation as well as the functional significance of
   actin catch bonds has not been elucidated. Using AFM force-clamp
   experiments, we show that formin controlled by RhoA switches the actin
   catch-slip bonds to slip-only bonds. SMD simulations reveal that the
   force does not induce the K113: E195 interaction when formin binds to
   actin K118 and E117 residues located at the helical segment extending to
   K113. Actin catch-slip bonds are suppressed by single residue
   replacements K113E and E195K that interrupt the force-induced K113: E195
   interaction; and this suppression is rescued by a K113E/E195K double
   mutant (E/K) restoring the interaction in the opposite orientation.
   These results support the biological significance of actin catch bonds,
   as they corroborate reported observations that RhoA and formin switch
   force-induced actin cytoskeleton alignment and that either K113E or
   E195K induces yeast cell growth defects rescued by E/K. Our study
   demonstrates how the mechano-regulation of actin dynamics is modulated
   by biochemical signaling molecules, and suggests that actin catch bonds
   may be important in cell functions.}},

Title = {{Facet-Specific Stability of ZIF-8 in the Presence of Acid Gases

Abstract = {{ZIF-8 is a crystalline microporous material that has been widely studied
   because of its thermal and chemical stability relative to other
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and its potential for use in a number of
   gas adsorption, separation, and catalysis applications. However, most
   studies focus on characterization of the bulk structure of ZIF-8,
   ignoring the potential effect of the particle shape and the external
   surface on these applications. This report describes studies that
   examined the stability of the \{110\} and \{100\} crystallographic
   facets of ZIF-8 under mildly acidic conditions. Though the \{110\} facet
   is more thermodynamically stable than the \{100\} facet, it is found to
   be more susceptible to degradation by acid exposure. It is hypothesized
   that the mechanism of particle degradation follows a shrinking-core
   model, with surface imidazolates being replaced by hydroxyls, as
   suggested by complementary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy characterization. Computational
   investigations support this hypothesis and suggest that the reaction
   energy for insertion of water into the Zn-MeIm bond is more favorable on
   the \{110\} facet than on the \{100\} facet because of steric
   constraints. Additionally, the reaction energies are more favorable on
   both surfaces in the presence of SO2. These findings have implications
   for the formation of surface barriers that can affect mass transfer into
   or out of the ZIF crystals. This study represents the first
   comprehensive investigation of differences between exposed surface
   facets of a MOF.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear dynamics and intermittency in a turbulent reacting wake with
   density ratio as bifurcation parameter}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{The flame or flow behavior of a turbulent reacting wake is known to be
   fundamentally different at high and low values of flame density ratio
   (rho(u)/rho(b)), as the flow transitions from globally stable to
   unstable. This paper analyzes the nonlinear dynamics present in a
   bluff-body stabilized flame, and identifies the transition
   characteristics in the wake as rho(u)/rho(b) is varied over a Reynolds
   number (based on the bluff-body lip velocity) range of 1000-3300.
   Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) of the experimentally obtained
   time series of the flame edge fluctuations reveals that the time series
   is highly aperiodic at high values of rho(u)/rho(b) and transitions to
   increasingly correlated or nearly periodic behavior at low values. From
   the RQA of the transverse velocity time series, we observe that
   periodicity in the flame oscillations are related to periodicity in the
   flow. Therefore, we hypothesize that this transition from aperiodic to
   nearly periodic behavior in the flame edge time series is a
   manifestation of the transition in the flow from globally stable,
   convective instability to global instability as rho(u)/rho(b) decreases.
   The recurrence analysis further reveals that the transition in
   periodicity is not a sudden shift; rather it occurs through an
   intermittent regime present at low and intermediate rho(u)/rho(b).
   During intermittency, the flow behavior switches between aperiodic
   oscillations, reminiscent of a globally stable, convective instability,
   and periodic oscillations, reminiscent of a global instability. Analysis
   of the distribution of the lengths of the periodic regions in the
   intermittent time series and the first return map indicate the presence
   of type-II intermittency.}},

Title = {{Cleaning patch-clamp pipettes for immediate reuse}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Patch-clamp recording has enabled single-cell electrical, morphological
   and genetic studies at unparalleled resolution. Yet it remains a
   laborious and low-throughput technique, making it largely impractical
   for large-scale measurements such as cell type and connectivity
   characterization of neurons in the brain. Specifically, the technique is
   critically limited by the ubiquitous practice of manually replacing
   patch-clamp pipettes after each recording. To circumvent this
   limitation, we developed a simple, fast, and automated method for
   cleaning glass pipette electrodes that enables their reuse within one
   minute. By immersing pipette tips into Alconox, a commercially-available
   detergent, followed by rinsing, we were able to reuse pipettes 10 times
   with no degradation in signal fidelity, in experimental preparations
   ranging from human embryonic kidney cells to neurons in culture, slices,
   and in vivo. Undetectable trace amounts of Alconox remaining in the
   pipette after cleaning did not affect ion channel pharmacology. We
   demonstrate the utility of pipette cleaning by developing the first
   robot to perform sequential patch-clamp recordings in cell culture and
   in vivo without a human operator.}},

Title = {{Rabies vaccination in dogs using a dissolving microneedle patch}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{19-26}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Because humans get rabies primarily through dog bites, stray dog
   population control and mass or mandatory vaccination of domestic dogs
   and other animals has virtually eliminated human rabies in
   industrialized countries. However, thousands of people in developing
   countries die of rabies each year due to the inability to control dog
   populations and implement mass vaccination because of financial,
   logistical and other challenges. The availability of an
   easier-to-administer and more cost-effective vaccine may help to address
   some of these issues. Here, we propose the use of dissolving microneedle
   patches for simple and potentially cost-effective rabies vaccination,
   and assess the safety and immunogenicity of microneedle patch
   vaccination using a rabies DNA vaccine in dogs. The vaccine was stable
   upon formulation and storage for at least 3 weeks at 4 degrees C in a
   microneedle patch. For vaccination, the patches were applied to the
   inner ear by hand without an applicator. Microneedle patches were well
   tolerated in the skin, with mild erythema, minimal wheal formation and
   complete resolution of skin reactions within 7 days, and generated no
   systemic adverse events. Microneedle patches were at least as
   immunogenic as intramuscular injection at the same dose, as demonstrated
   by similar serum neutralizing antibody titers. A ten-fold lower vaccine
   dose administered by microneedle patch generated a weaker immune
   response compared to full-dose intramuscular vaccination. We conclude
   that dissolving microneedle patches may provide an innovative approach
   to mass vaccination of dogs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{804}},
Pages = {{712-748}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{A buoyancy-induced, columnar vortex is deliberately triggered in the
   unstably stratified air layer over a heated ground plane and is anchored
   within, and scales with, an azimuthal array of vertical, stator-like
   planar flow vanes that form an open-top enclosure and impart tangential
   momentum to the radially entrained air flow. The columnar vortex
   comprises three coupled primary flow domains: a spiraling surface
   momentum boundary layer of ground-heated air, an inner thermally driven
   vertical vortex core and an outer annular flow that is bounded by a
   helical shear layer and the vanes along its inner and outer edges,
   respectively, and by the spiraling boundary layer from below. In common
   with free buoyant columnar (dust devil) vortices that occur
   spontaneously over solar-heated terrain in the natural environment, the
   stationary anchored vortex is self-sustained by the conversion of the
   potential energy of the entrained surface-heated air layer to the
   kinetic energy of the induced vortical flow that persists as long as the
   thermal stratification is maintained. This conversion occurs as radial
   vorticity produced within the surface boundary layer is tilted
   vertically near the vortex centreline by the buoyant air to form the
   core of the columnar vortex. The structure and dynamics of the buoyant
   vortex are investigated using high-resolution stereo particle image
   velocimetry with specific emphasis on the evolution of the vorticity
   distributions and their effects on the characteristic scales of the
   ensuing vortex and on the kinetic energy of the induced flow.}},

Abstract = {{Divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and
   among eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs is focused in expansion segments (ESs).
   Eukaryotic ribosomes are significantly larger than prokaryotic ribosomes
   partly because of their ESs. We hypothesize that larger rRNAs of complex
   organisms could confer increased functionality to the ribosome. Here, we
   characterize the binding partners of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expansion
   segment 7 (ES7), which is the largest and most variable ES of the
   eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit and is located at the surface of the
   ribosome. In vitro RNA-protein pull-down experiments using ES7 as a bait
   indicate that ES7 is a binding hub for a variety of non-ribosomal
   proteins essential to ribosomal function in eukaryotes. ES7-associated
   proteins observed here cluster into four groups based on biological
   process, (i) response to abiotic stimulus (e.g., response to external
   changes in temperature, pH, oxygen level, etc.), (ii) ribosomal large
   subunit biogenesis, (iii) protein transport and localization, and (iv)
   transcription elongation. Seven synthetases, Ala-, Arg-, Asp-, Asn-,
   Leu-, Lys- and TyrRS, appear to associate with ES7. Affinities of AspRS,
   TyrRS and LysRS for ES7 were confirmed by in vitro binding assays. The
   results suggest that ES7 in S. cerevisiae could play a role analogous to
   the multi-synthetase complex present in higher order organisms and could
   be important for the appropriate function of the ribosome. Thermal
   denaturation studies and footprinting experiments confirm that isolated
   ES7 is stable and maintains a near-native secondary and tertiary
   structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As the needs for low-cost rapidly-produced microfluidics are growing
   with the trend of Lab-on-a-Chip and distributed healthcare, the fully
   inkjet-printing of microfluidics can be a solution to it with numerous
   potential electrical and sensing applications. Inkjet-printing is an
   additive manufacturing technique featuring no material waste and a low
   equipment cost. Moreover, similar to other additive manufacturing
   techniques, inkjet-printing is easy to learn and has a high fabrication
   speed, while it offers generally a great planar resolution down to below
   20 mu m and enables flexible designs due to its inherent thin film
   deposition capabilities. Due to the thin film feature, the printed
   objects also usually obtain a high vertical resolution (such as 4.6 mu
   m). This paper introduces a low-cost rapid three-dimensional fabrication
   process of microfluidics, that relies entirely on an inkjet-printer
   based single platform and can be implemented directly on top of
   virtually any substrates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Elastic/acoustic metamaterials made from locally resonant arrays can
   exhibit bandgaps at wavelengths much longer than the lattice size for
   various applications spanning from low-frequency vibration/sound
   attenuation to wave guiding and filtering in mechanical and
   electromechanical devices. For an effective use of such locally resonant
   metamaterial concepts in finite structures, it is required to bridge the
   gap between the lattice dispersion characteristics and modal behavior of
   the host structure with its resonators. To this end, we develop a novel
   argument for bandgap formation in finite-length elastic metamaterial
   beams, relying on the modal analysis and the assumption of infinitely
   many resonators. We show that the dual problem to wave propagation
   through an infinite periodic beam is the modal analysis of a finite beam
   with an infinite number of resonators. A simple formula that depends
   only on the resonator natural frequency and total mass ratio is derived
   for placing the bandgap in a desired frequency range, yielding an
   analytical insight and a rule of thumb for design purposes. A method for
   understanding the importance of a resonator location and mass is
   discussed in the context of a Riemann sum approximation of an integral,
   and a method for determining the optimal number of resonators for a
   given set of boundary conditions and target frequency is introduced. The
   simulations of the theoretical framework are validated by experiments
   for bending vibrations of a locally resonant cantilever beam. Published

Abstract = {{We report the facile synthesis of Pd@Pt core-shell nanocubes with
   concave facets on the surface and their enhanced activities toward the
   oxygen reduction reaction. The success of this synthesis depends
   critically on our ability to manipulate both the deposition rate of
   atoms and the surface diffusion rate of the adatoms. In the first step,
   Pd nanocubes with side faces capped by Br- ions are transformed into
   concave nanocubes by seed-mediated growth. The PdCl42- precursor is
   added in one shot, and the growth is conducted at 40 degrees C to
   accelerate deposition and decelerate surface diffusion. For the
   synthesis of Pd@Pt core-shell concave nanocubes, the PtCl42- precursor
   is added dropwise into a suspension of the Pd concave nanocubes and
   reduced by citric acid at 90 degrees C. As such, we can deposit an
   ultrathin Pt shell on the surface of each Pd concave nanocube. Despite
   their much larger size, the Pd@Pt concave nanocubes exhibit greater
   specific electrochemical surface areas than a commercial Pt/C catalyst,
   which implies the more efficient dispersion of Pt atoms on the surface.
   In addition to excellent durability, the catalyst based on Pd@Pt concave
   nanocubes shows enhanced catalytic activities toward the oxygen
   reduction reaction.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of Pt cubic
   nanoframes with ultrathin ridges less than 2 nm in thickness. The
   nanoframes were synthesized through site-selected deposition of Pt onto
   the corner and edge sites of Pd nanocubes, followed by selective removal
   of the Pd cores via chemical etching. The Br- ions chemisorbed on the
   side faces of a Pd nanocube played a critical role in enabling the
   site-selected deposition. In addition, the kinetics of deposition and
   the diffusion of Pt adatoms was optimized by carefully controlling the
   injection rate of the Pt precursor and the reaction temperature,
   respectively, to obtain the frame-like structure. When benchmarked
   against a commercial Pt/C comprised of Pt particles 2-3 nm in size, the
   Pt frame/C catalyst exhibited not only enhanced mass activity toward
   oxygen reduction, but also substantially improved catalytic durability.
   In an accelerated durability test, the Pt frame/C catalyst showed a mass
   activity more than 6 V greater than for the Pt/C reference after 20000
   cycles of repeated potential sweeping. This improvement can be largely
   attributed to the frame-like structure, which is unique in suppressing
   both the detachment and aggregation of catalytic particles owing to the
   significantly enhanced interaction with carbon support.}},

Title = {{Identification of gene-drug interactions that impact patient survival in
   TCGA}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: With the advent of large scale biological data collection
   for various diseases, data analysis pipelines and workflows need to be
   established to build frameworks for integrative analysis. Here the
   authors present a pipeline for identifying disease specific gene-drug
   interactions using CNV (Copy Number Variation) and clinical data from
   the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) project. Two cancer types were
   selected for analysis, LGG (Brain lower grade glioma) and GBM
   (Glioblastoma multiforme), due to the possible progression from LGG to
   GBM in some cases. The copy number and clinical data were then used to
   preform survival analysis on a gene by gene basis on sub-populations of
   patients exposed to a given drug.
   Results: Several gene-drug interactions are identified, where the copy
   number of a gene is associated to survival of a patient exposed to a
   certain drug. Both Irinotecan/HAS2 (Hyaluronan synthase 2) and
   Bevacizumab/PGAM1 (Phosphoglycerate mutase 1) are interactions found in
   this study with independent confirmation. Independent work in colon,
   breast cancer and leukemia (Gyorffy, Breast Cancer Res Treat
   123:725-731, 2010; Mueller, Mol Cancer Ther 11:3024-3032, 2010;
   Hitosugi, Cancer Cell 13:585-600, 2012) showed these two interactions
   can lead to increased survival.
   Conclusion: While the pipeline produced several possible interactions
   where increased survival is linked to normal or increased copy number of
   a given gene for patients treated with a given drug, no instance of low
   copy number or full deletion was linked to increased survival. The
   development of this pipeline shows a promising utility to identify
   possible beneficial gene-drug interactions that could improve patient
   survival and may illustrate some of the problems inherent in this kind
   of analysis on these data.}},

Abstract = {{For existing triboelectric nanogenerators ( TENGs), it is important to
   explore unique methods to further enhance the output power under
   realistic environments to speed up their commercialization. We report
   here a practical TENG composed of three layers, in which the key layer,
   an electric double layer, is inserted between a top layer, made of
   Al/polydimethylsiloxane, and a bottom layer, made of Al. The efficient
   charge separation in the middle layer, based on Volta's electrophorus,
   results from sequential contact configuration of the TENG and direct
   electrical connection of the middle layer to the earth. A sustainable
   and enhanced output performance of 1.22mA and 46.8 mW cm(-2) under low
   frequency of 3 Hz is produced, giving over 16-fold enhancement in output
   power and corresponding to energy conversion efficiency of 22.4\%.
   Finally, a portable power-supplying system, which provides enough d.c.
   power for charging a smart watch or phone battery, is also successfully
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is an abundant element that exhibits one of the highest
   gravimetric and volumetric capacities for Li storage, making it a
   potentially attractive anode material for high capacity Li-ion
   batteries. However, while phosphorus carbon composite anodes have been
   previously explored, the influence of the inactive materials on
   electrode cycle performance is still poorly understood. Here, we report
   and explain the significant impacts of polymer binder chemistry, carbon
   conductive additives, and an underlayer between the Al current collector
   and ball milled P electrodes on cell stability. We focused our study on
   the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and poly(acrylic acid)
   (PAA) binders as well as exfoliated graphite (ExG) and carbon nanotube
   (CNT) additives. The mechanical properties of the binders were found to
   change drastically because of interactions with both the slurry and
   electrolyte solvents, significantly effecting the electrochenlical cycle
   stability of the electrodes. Binder adhesion was also found to be
   critical in achieving stable electrochemical cycling. The best anodes
   demonstrated similar to 1400 mAh/g-P gravimetric capacity after 200
   cycles at C/2 rates in Li half cells.}},

Abstract = {{A new route to make cotton fabric self-cleaning and permanently stiff by
   coating cellulose-TiO2 on its surface is demonstrated herein.
   Cellulose-TiO2 dispersion was used for coating and was prepared by
   mixing TiO2 nanoparticles with cellulose in 60\% H2SO4 solution. The
   surface morphology of cellulose-TiO2 nanoparticles coated sample was
   analyzed by SEM. The appearance of white TiO2 particles on the surface
   of the cotton fabric confirmed the successful coating process. The
   Orange II dye was used as stain and its degradation was observed under
   UV light. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that cellulose II content
   increases slightly (by 5.3\%) after the solvent treatment. Washing
   fastness study showed that the fabric stiffness was permanent and
   self-cleaning properties were stable with 1, 3 and 5\% TiO2 coated
   samples. Air and water vapor permeability was not decreased
   considerably, whereas tensile strength was increased significantly after
   coating. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A greater understanding of the genetic regulation of plant cell wall
   remodeling and the impact of modified cell walls on plant performance is
   important for the development of sustainable biofuel crops. Here, we
   studied the impact of down-regulating KORRIGAN-like cell wall
   biosynthesis genes, belonging to the endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene
   family, on Populus growth, metabolism and the ability to interact with
   symbiotic microbes. The reductions in cellulose content and lignin
   syringyl-to-guaiacyl unit ratio, and increase in cellulose crystallinity
   of cell walls of PdKOR RNAi plants corroborated the functional role of
   PdKOR in cell wall biosynthesis. Altered metabolism and reduced growth
   characteristics of RNAi plants revealed new implications on carbon
   allocation and partitioning. The distinctive metabolome phenotype
   comprised of a higher phenolic and salicylic acid content, and reduced
   lignin, shikimic acid and maleic acid content relative to control. Plant
   sustainability implications of modified cell walls on beneficial
   plant-microbe interactions were explored via co-culture with an
   ectomycorrhizal fungus, Laccaria bicolor. A significant increase in the
   mycorrhization rate was observed in transgenic plants, leading to
   measurable beneficial growth effects. These findings present new
   evidence for functional interconnectedness of cellulose biosynthesis
   pathway, metabolism and mycorrhizal association in plants, and further
   emphasize the consideration of the sustainability implications of plant
   trait improvement efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Optical microcavity (OMC) structures have spectral properties that are
   directly related to their physical dimensions and material refractive

   for asymmetrical OMC (AOMC) structures were investigated to optimize and
   assess their feasibility for dynamic sensing. Structural and material
   effects were studied in terms of spectral properties, structure
   stabilities and fabrication process. From this study, it was shown that
   an AOMC structure with a SiO2 cavity layer and Ag mirror layers,
   fabricated with thin adhesion Al2O3 layers exhibited the best structural
   stability and spectral properties. Under dynamic compressive loading of
   similar to 4 GPa, the structure exhibited a blueshift of 22 nm and a

Abstract = {{Although standing balance is important in many daily activities, there
   has been little effort in developing detailed musculoskeletal models and
   simulations of balance control compared to other whole-body motor
   activities. Our objective was to develop a musculoskeletal model of
   human balance that can be used to predict movement patterns in reactive
   balance control. Similar to prior studies using torque driven models, we
   investigated how movement patterns during a reactive balance response
   are affected by high-level task goals (e.g., reducing center-of-mass
   movement, maintaining vertical trunk orientation, and minimizing
   effort). We generated 23 forward dynamics simulations where optimal
   muscle excitations were found using cost functions with different
   weights on minimizing these high-level goals. Variations in hip and
   ankle angles observed experimentally (peak hip flexion=7.9-53.1 degrees,
   peak dorsiflexion= 0.5-4.7 degrees) could be predicted by varying the
   priority of these high-level goals. More specifically, minimizing
   center-of-mass motion produced a hip strategy (peak hip flexion and
   ankle dorsiflexion angles of 45.5 degrees and 23 degrees, respectively)
   and the response shifted towards an ankle strategy as the priority to
   keep the trunk vertical was increased (peak hip and ankle angles of 13.7
   degrees and 8.5 degrees, respectively). We also found that increasing
   the priority to minimize muscle stress always favors a hip strategy.
   These results are similar to those from sagittal-plane torque-driven
   models. Our muscle-actuated model facilitates the investigation of
   neuromechanical interactions governing reactive balance control to
   predict muscle activity and movement patterns based on interactions
   between neuromechanical elements such as spinal reflexes, muscle
   short-range stiffness, and task-level sensorimotor feedback. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based system that
   can estimate the 3-D position of an object from the measurements of
   received signal strength (RSS). This work presents an alternative and
   relatively cheap approach for remotely estimating the location of an
   object. Unlike other LED-based positioning systems, the proposed method
   employs a single base station, including a few LEDs with different
   orientations. In addition, the proposed system does not require a
   ceiling on which the positioning LEDS are installed. To illustrate the
   performance capabilities of the proposed system, we support our scheme

Abstract = {{Computer-aided materials design requires new modeling approaches to
   characterize and represent fine-grained geometric structures and
   material compositions at multiple scales. Recently, a dual-Rep approach
   was developed to model materials microstructures based on a new basis
   function, called surfacelet. As a combination of implicit surface and
   wavelets, surfacelets can efficiently identify and represent planar,
   cylindrical, and ellipsoidal geometries in material microstructures and
   describe the distribution of compositions and properties. In this paper,
   these primitive surfacelets are extended and composite surfacelets are
   proposed to model more complex geometries. Composite surfacelets are
   constructed by Boolean operations on the primitives. The surfacelet
   transform is applied to match geometric features in three-dimensional
   images. The composition of the material near the identified features can
   then be modeled. A cubic surfacelet and a v-joint surfacelet are
   developed to demonstrate the reverse engineering process of retrieving
   material compositions from material images (C) 2016 Society of CAD/CAM

Abstract = {{Flagellated bacteria have been suggested as one of the means to deliver
   information at nanoscales due to their ability to store massive amounts
   of data in their DNA strands and their mobility properties. In this
   paper, the propagation delay and message loss rates are mathematically
   derived for bacterial nanocommunications. The mobility pattern of the
   flagellated bacteria is investigated and a stochastic model of the
   bacteria mobility is developed. The proposed model is then used to
   derive the performance metrics of interest such as the link reliability
   as well as the propagation delay distribution for the case where N
   bacteria are used to deliver the messages between two nanomachines. Our
   solution reveals that at communication distances inherent for
   bacteria-based nanonetworks (1 similar to 10mm) reliable links can be
   established using just few hundreds of bacteria. The presented approach
   provides the so-far missing analytical building block for performance
   analysis of prospective bacteria-based nanonetworks.}},

Abstract = {{Emphasizing the university research center model, from 2009 to 2014 the
   US Department of Energy (DOE) funded a first round of over 40 Energy
   Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) spread out among 100 institutions.
   Early in its implementation, however, the EFRC model received criticism
   from scholars warning that the arrangements of the EFRCs did not provide
   adequate governance structures for coordinating research efforts. In
   this article, we seek to begin answering a call for `systematic and
   rigorous study of the implementation of EFRCs' by studying a sample of
   five EFRCs and their individual members. We find that despite lacking
   formal mechanisms for coordinating research, EFRCs increase
   coauthorships among EFRC members, especially new coauthorships.
   Moreover, EFRC members' research quality increases after each EFRC is
   formed. Through negative-binomial regression analysis on individual
   researcher outcomes, we find that stronger preexisting networks increase
   coauthorship among EFRC members. This finding supports the idea that
   preexisting research collaboration networks are indicative of research
   coordination mechanisms that researchers have discovered or established
   for themselves prior to becoming members of a research center. We posit
   that new research centers may leverage research coordination mechanisms
   embedded in preexisting coauthorship relations, rather than imposing new
   research coordination mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Remora fishes have a unique dorsal suction pad that allows them to form
   robust, reliable, and reversible attachment to a wide variety of host
   organisms and marine vessels. Although investigations of the suction pad
   have been performed, the primary force that remoras must resist, namely
   fluid drag, has received little attention. This work provides a
   theoretical estimate of the drag experienced by an attached remora using
   computational fluid dynamics informed by geometry obtained from
   micro-computed tomography. Here, simulated flows are compared to
   measured flow fields of a euthanized specimen in a flow tank.
   Additionally, the influence of the host's boundary layer is
   investigated, and scaling relationships between remora features are
   inferred from the digitized geometry. The results suggest the drag on an
   attached remora is similar to that of a streamlined body, and is
   minimally influenced by the host's viscous boundary layer. Consequently,
   this evidence does not support the hypothesis that remoras discriminate
   between attachment locations based on hydrodynamic considerations.
   Comparison of the simulated drag with experimental friction tests show
   that even at elevated swimming speeds it is unlikely that remoras are
   dislodged by drag alone, and furthermore that larger remoras may be more
   difficult to dislodge than smaller remoras indicating that they become
   more suited to attachment as they mature. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All

Journal = {{FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) estimates of sulfates,
   nitrates, ammonium, and organic carbon are highly influenced by
   uncertainties in modeled secondary formation processes, such as chemical
   mechanisms, volatilization, and condensation rates. These compounds
   constitute the majority of PM2.5 mass, and reducing bias in estimated
   concentrations has benefits for policy measures and epidemiological
   studies. In this work, a method for adjusting source impacts on
   secondary species is developed that provides estimates of source
   contributions and reduces bias in modeled concentrations compared to
   observations. The bias correction adjusts concentrations and source
   impacts based on the difference between modeled concentrations and
   observations while taking into account uncertainties at the location of
   interest; and it is applied both spatially and temporally. We apply the
   method over the US for 2006. The mean bias for initial CMAQ
   concentrations compared to observations is -0.28 (OC), 0.11 (NO3), 0.05
   (NH4), and -0.08 (SO4). The normalized mean bias in modeled
   concentrations compared to observations was effectively zero for OC,
   NO3, NH4, and SO4 after applying the secondary bias correction. Ten-fold
   cross-validation was conducted to determine the performance of the
   spatial application of the bias correction. Cross-validation performance
   was favorable; correlation coefficients were greater than 0.69 for all
   species when comparing observations and concentrations based on kriged
   correction factors. The methods presented here address model
   uncertainties by improving simulated concentrations and source impacts
   of secondary particulate matter through data assimilation.
   Secondary-adjusted concentrations and source impacts from 20 emissions
   sources are generated for 2006 over continental US. (C) Higher Education

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether a collaborative learning
   strategy-derived clinical practice guideline can reduce the duration of
   endotracheal intubation following infant heart surgery.
   Design: Prospective and retrospective data collected from the Pediatric
   Heart Network in the 12 months pre- and post-clinical practice guideline
   implementation at the four sites participating in the collaborative
   (active sites) compared with data from five Pediatric Heart Network
   centers not participating in collaborative learning (control sites).
   Setting: Ten children's hospitals.
   Patients: Data were collected for infants following two-index
   operations: 1) repair of isolated coarctation of the aorta (birth to 365
   d) and 2) repair of tetralogy of Fallot (29-365 d). There were 240
   subjects eligible for the clinical practice guideline at active sites
   and 259 subjects at control sites.
   Interventions: Development and application of early extubation clinical
   practice guideline.
   Measurements and Main Results: After clinical practice guideline
   implementation, the rate of early extubation at active sites increased
   significantly from 11.7\% to 66.9\% (p < 0.001) with no increase in
   reintubation rate. The median duration of postoperative intubation among
   active sites decreased from 21.2 to 4.5 hours (p < 0.001). No
   statistically significant change in early extubation rates was found in
   the control sites 11.7\% to 13.7\% (p = 0.63). At active sites, clinical
   practice guideline implementation had no statistically significant
   impact on median ICU length of stay (71.9 hr pre- vs 69.2 hr
   post-implementation; p = 0.29) for the entire cohort. There was a trend
   toward shorter ICU length of stay in the tetralogy of Fallot subgroup
   (71.6 hr pre- vs 54.2 hr postimplementation, p = 0.068).
   Conclusions: A collaborative learning strategy designed clinical
   practice guideline significantly increased the rate of early extubation
   with no change in the rate of reintubation. The early extubation
   clinical practice guideline did not significantly change postoperative
   ICU length of stay.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid perovskites form an extremely attractive class of materials for
   large scale, low-cost photovoltaic applications. Fullerene-based charge
   extraction layers have emerged as a viable n-type charge collection
   layer, and in ``inverted{''} p-i-n device architectures the solar cells
   are approaching efficiencies of 20\%. However, the regular n-i-p devices
   employing fullerenes still lag behind in performance. Here, we show that
   partial solubility of fullerene derivatives in the aprotic solvents used
   for the perovskites makes it challenging to retain integral films in
   multilayer solution processing. To overcome this issue we introduce
   cross-linkable fullerene derivatives as charge collection layers in
   n-i-p planar junction perovskite solar cells. The cross-linked fullerene
   layers are insolubilized and deliver improved performance in solar cells
   enabled by a controllable film thickness.}},

Abstract = {{A new wireless electrophysiology data acquisition system, built around a
   standard homecage, is presented in this paper, which can power up and
   communicate with sensors and actuators/stimulators attached to or
   implanted in small freely behaving animal subjects, such as rodents. Key
   abilities of the energized homecage (EnerCage) system is enabling
   longitudinal experiments with minimal operator involvement or
   interruption, while providing test subjects with an enriched environment
   closer to their natural habitat, without the burden of being tethered or
   carrying bulky batteries. The magnetic resonant multi-coil design used
   in the new EnerCage-HC2 automatically localizes the transmitted
   electromagnetic power from a single transmitter (Tx) coil at the bottom
   of the cage toward the receiver coil (Rx), carried on/in the animal
   body, obviating the need for tracking the animal or switching the coils.
   In order to increase the resonators' quality factor (Q > 166) at the
   desired operating frequency of 13.56 MHz, while maintaining a high
   self-resonance frequency (SRF > 42 MHz), they are made of wide copper
   foils and optimally segmented based on a set of design rules that can be
   adopted for experimental arenas with different shapes and dimensions.
   The Rx rectified voltage is regulated at a user-defined window (4.1 +/-
   0.3 V) by a Tx-Rx closed-loop power control (CLPC) mechanism that
   creates a volume inside the homecage with 42mW of power delivered to the
   load (PDL), and a homogeneous power transfer efficiency (PTE) plane of
   14\% on average at similar to 7 cm height, plus stability against
   angular mis-alignments of up to 80 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting the decomposition components in air-insulated switchgear is an
   effective method to evaluate the discharge severity of air-insulated
   switchgear. Experimental and theoretical studies are conducted to
   investigate the types of decomposition components and generation
   mechanism under the partial and disruptive discharge conditions. The
   discharge experiments use a needle-plate discharge tank, and the effect
   of relative humidity (50, 70 and 90\%) and voltage (6, 6.5, 7 and 7.5
   kV) are studied in detail. Considering the partial discharge process,
   the concentrations of CO and NO2 increase with the applied voltage and
   partial discharge time. The CO concentration increases with the increase
   of humidity, while NO2 concentration shows the reverse change trend.
   During the disruptive discharge process, the decomposition component NO
   increases with humidity. The dissipation of these decomposition
   components is also investigated using experiment. The small part of CO
   dissipation is from the adsorption with H2O molecules and onto the
   surface of discharge tank. The reaction between NO and O free radical,
   O-2 and O-3 consumes the concentration of NO and produces NO2. And the
   reaction between NO2 and H2O consumes most of the generated NO2 in the
   discharge tank. In the theoretical research, the reaction energy of CO,
   NO and NO2 generation is computed to analyze the generation and
   dissipation mechanism of decomposition components using Materials
   Studio.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an inkjet-printed electromagnet-based touchpad employing
   spiral resonators is proposed. The proposed touchpad is fabricated by a
   direct patterning method using an inkjet printer with a conductive
   silver nanoparticle ink. The conductive patterns are easily printed on a
   paper substrate and sintered for achieving good conductivity. The
   proposed touchpad is composed of two spiral resonators that resonate at
   0.94 GHz (f(1)) and 1.83 GHz (f(2)), respectively. When the first
   resonator is touched, f(1) decreases from 0.94 to 0.81 GHz because of
   electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the finger and the spiral
   resonator. Similarly, when the second resonator is touched, f(2)
   decreases from 1.83 to 1.55 GHz. Owing to the EM coupling distance
   between the spiral resonator and the finger, the frequency changes
   although the finger does not reach beyond a height of 1.27 mm on the
   spiral resonator. The performance of the proposed touchpad is validated
   using simulation and measurement results. {[}2016-0035]}},

Title = {{Reconstructing Historical VOC Concentrations in DrinkingWater for
   Epidemiological Studies at a US Military Base: Summary of Results}},

Abstract = {{A U.S. government health agency conducted epidemiological studies to
   evaluate whether exposures to drinking water contaminated with volatile
   organic compounds (VOC) at U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North
   Carolina, were associated with increased health risks to children and
   adults. These health studies required knowledge of contaminant
   concentrations in drinking water-at monthly intervals-delivered to
   family housing, barracks, and other facilities within the study area.
   Because concentration data were limited or unavailable during much of
   the period of contamination (1950s-1985), the historical reconstruction
   process was used to quantify estimates of monthly mean
   contaminant-specific concentrations. This paper integrates many efforts,
   reports, and papers into a synthesis of the overall approach to, and
   results from, a drinking-water historical reconstruction study. Results
   show that at the Tarawa Terrace water treatment plant (WTP)
   reconstructed (simulated) tetrachloroethylene (PCE) concentrations
   reached a maximum monthly average value of 183 micrograms per liter (mu
   g/L) compared to a one-time maximum measured value of 215 mu g/L and
   exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's current maximum
   contaminant level (MCL) of 5 mu g/L during the period November
   1957-February 1987. At the Hadnot Point WTP, reconstructed
   trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations reached a maximum monthly average
   value of 783 mu g/L compared to a one-time maximum measured value of
   1400 mu g/L during the period August 1953-December 1984. The Hadnot
   Point WTP also provided contaminated drinking water to the Holcomb
   Boulevard housing area continuously prior to June 1972, when the Holcomb
   Boulevard WTP came on line (maximum reconstructed TCE concentration of
   32 mu g/L) and intermittently during the period June 1972-February 1985
   (maximum reconstructed TCE concentration of 66 mu g/L). Applying the
   historical reconstruction process to quantify contaminant-specific
   monthly drinking-water concentrations is advantageous for
   epidemiological studies when compared to using the classical exposed
   versus unexposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of similarities between electrical and
   hydraulic pressurized networks. The primary objective is to examine
   whether or not it is possible to use electrical laboratory networks
   measuring voltage to study leak-region detection strategies measuring
   flow in water-distribution networks. In this paper, the strategy used to
   compare the networks is error-domain model falsification, a previously
   developed methodology for data interpretation that combines engineering
   knowledge with models and data to enhance decision making. Simulation
   results obtained for a part of the water-supply network from the city of
   Lausanne are compared with an analogous electric network. The electrical
   network is simulated using resistors to mimic the pipes. The consequence
   is that the electrical model is linear. The resistance values are
   obtained by computing the hydraulic resistance for each pipe, given by
   the Hazen-Williams equation. The compatibility of the two networks is
   evaluated through simulations in three ways: (1) comparing flow
   predictions obtained by simulating several leak scenarios; (2) comparing
   the expected identifiability (performance) of the two networks; and (3)
   comparing sensor placement configurations. The analyses show that even
   though the models have varying characteristics of underlying physical
   principles (the electrical model is linear while the hydraulic model is
   non-linear), the results are within generally accepted engineering
   limits of similarity (10\%). This indicates that measurements on
   electrical laboratory networks have the potential to illustrate the
   efficiency and adaptability of leak-detection methodologies for
   full-scale water-supply and other pressurized hydraulic networks.
   Finally, two electrical laboratory physical networks, including an
   electrical model of part of the water network in Lausanne, were
   constructed and used in case studies to illustrate this adaptability.

Abstract = {{A simplified thermodynamic analysis of adsorption processes in
   temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA)
   modes as a function of adsorbate concentration and the
   adsorbent-adsorbate interaction strength is presented in this article.
   The thermodynamic separation efficiency of a TSA process is optimal at
   dilute feed conditions, and becomes more thermodynamically efficient
   with increasing adsorbate affinity even though the energy of separation
   increases. The adsorption process is spontaneous, and for a strong
   isotherm, the energy required to reverse the adsorption is nearly
   independent of the adsorbate concentration as adsorbate loading in
   nearly-saturated materials is essentially constant with feed
   concentration. PSA units are efficient thermodynamically and the
   efficiency increases with the concentration of the desired adsorbate.
   This thermodynamic treatment has implications for separation processes
   that address carbon emissions. TSA systems operate more efficiently
   (thermodynamically) in the ``air capture{''} case because they apply
   work to the concentrated product rather than the dilute feed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We present a critical analysis of the observations and interpretation of
   VLF subionospheric measurements related to the main Nepal Gorkha
   earthquake which occurred on 25 April 2015 (M(w)7.8) and its major
   aftershock on 12 May 2015 (M(w)7.3). The VLF narrowband signal used is
   from North West Cape (NWC) (19.8 kHz) VLF transmitter located in
   Australia and recorded at Allahabad (latitude 25.41 degrees N, longitude
   81.93 degrees E). Allahabad is located very close (similar to 360 km) to
   these earthquake epicenters. Two widely used analysis, viz., (1)
   terminator time and (2) nighttime fluctuation techniques, are applied to
   extract seismic related effects in the NWC narrowband VLF data. The
   terminator time analysis yields statistically significant shifts of
   similar to 45 and similar to 26 min, respectively, in evening terminator
   time in the NWC VLF amplitude signal, 1 day before both the earthquakes.
   The nighttime fluctuation method shows a consistent, statistically
   significant, increase in three parameters 1 day before the earthquake.
   The observed terminator time and nighttime fluctuation shifts were
   associated with these earthquakes only after scrutinizing possible
   contributions from other potential sources such as solar activity; other
   earthquakes on the signal path; and meteorological disturbances such as
   lightning activity, wind speed, and temperature along the
   transmitter-receiver great circle path. The VLF subionospheric signal
   analysis results unambiguously point toward the presence of seismically
   excited atmospheric gravity waves during these major earthquakes and
   their important role in providing the coupling between the seismic
   source region and overlying ionosphere.}},

Abstract = {{In upwelling regions, wind relaxations lead to poleward propagating warm
   water plumes that are important to coastal ecosystems. The coastal ocean
   response to wind relaxation around Pt. Conception, CA is simulated with
   a Regional Ocean Model (ROMS) forced by realistic surface and lateral
   boundary conditions including tidal processes. The model reproduces well
   the statistics of observed subtidal water column temperature and
   velocity at both outer and inner-shelf mooring locations throughout the
   study. A poleward-propagating plume of Southern California Bight water
   that increases shelf water temperatures by similar to 5 degrees C is
   also reproduced. Modeled plume propagation speed, spatial scales, and
   flow structure are consistent with a theoretical scaling for coastal
   buoyant plumes with both surface-trapped and slope-controlled dynamics.
   Plume momentum balances are distinct between the offshore (>30 m depth)
   region where the plume is surface-trapped, and onshore of the 30 m
   isobath (within 5 km from shore) where the plume water mass extends to
   the bottom and is slope controlled. In the onshore region, bottom stress
   is important in the alongshore momentum equation and generates vertical
   vorticity that is an order of magnitude larger than the vorticity in the
   plume core. Numerical experiments without tidal forcing show that
   modeled surface temperatures are biased 0.5 degrees C high, potentially
   affecting plume propagation distance and persistence.}},

Abstract = {{What allows a planet to be both within a potentially habitable zone and
   sustain habitability over long geologic time? With the advent of
   exoplanetary astronomy and the ongoing discovery of terrestrial-type
   planets around other stars, our own solar system becomes a key testing
   ground for ideas about what factors control planetary evolution. Mars
   provides the solar system's longest record of the interplay of the
   physical and chemical processes relevant to habitability on an
   accessible rocky planet with an atmosphere and hydrosphere. Here we
   review current understanding and update the timeline of key processes in
   early Mars history. We then draw on knowledge of exoplanets and the
   other solar system terrestrial planets to identify six broad questions
   of high importance to the development and sustaining of habitability
   (unprioritized): (1) Is small planetary size fatal? (2) How do magnetic
   fields influence atmospheric evolution? (3) To what extent does starting
   composition dictate subsequent evolution, including redox processes and
   the availability of water and organics? (4) Does early impact
   bombardment have a net deleterious or beneficial influence? (5) How do
   planetary climates respond to stellar evolution, e.g., sustaining early
   liquid water in spite of a faint young Sun? (6) How important are the
   timescales of climate forcing and their dynamical drivers? Finally, we
   suggest crucial types of Mars measurements (unprioritized) to address
   these questions: (1) in situ petrology at multiple units/sites; (2)
   continued quantification of volatile reservoirs and new isotopic
   measurements of H, C, N, O, S, Cl, and noble gases in rocks that sample
   multiple stratigraphic sections; (3) radiometric age dating of units in
   stratigraphic sections and from key volcanic and impact units; (4)
   higher-resolution measurements of heat flux, subsurface structure, and
   magnetic field anomalies coupled with absolute age dating. Understanding
   the evolution of early Mars will feed forward to understanding the
   factors driving the divergent evolutionary paths of the Earth, Venus,
   and thousands of small rocky extrasolar planets yet to be discovered.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The objectives of this pilot study were to (1)
   evaluate the feasibility and investigate the efficacy of a 3-week,
   high-volume (450 minutes per week) Adapted Tango intervention for
   community-dwelling individuals with mild-moderate Parkinson disease (PD)
   and (2) investigate the potential efficacy of Adapted Tango in modifying
   electromyographic (EMG) activity and center of body mass (CoM)
   displacement during automatic postural responses to support surface
   perturbations.
   Methods: Individuals with PD (n = 26) were recruited for high-volume
   Adapted Tango (15 lessons, 1.5 hour each over 3 weeks). Twenty
   participants were assessed with clinical balance and gait measures
   before and after the intervention. Nine participants were also assessed
   with support-surface translation perturbations.
   Results: Overall adherence to the intervention was 77\%. At posttest,
   peak forward CoM displacement was reduced (4.0 +/- 0.9 cm, pretest, vs
   3.7 +/- 1.1 cm, posttest; P = 0.03; Cohen's d = 0.30) and correlated to
   improvements on Berg Balance Scale (rho= -0.68; P = 0.04) and Dynamic
   Gait Index (rho = -0.75; P = 0.03). Overall antagonist onset time was
   delayed (27 ms; P = 0.02; d = 0.90) and duration was reduced (56 ms,
   approximate to 39\%, P = 0.02; d = 0.45). Reductions in EMG magnitude
   were also observed (P < 0.05).
   Discussion and Conclusions: Following participation in Adapted Tango,
   changes in kinematic and some EMG measures of perturbation responses
   were observed in addition to improvements in clinical measures. We
   conclude that 3-week, high-volume Adapted Tango is feasible and
   represents a viable alternative to longer duration adapted dance
   programs.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Demand projections for civil aviation have forecast increases in
   operations in future decades. Increases in demand are beneficial to the
   growth and advancement of the aviation industry, but also come with the
   threat of significant increase in environmental impacts. In response,
   the industry is focusing on programs to develop technologies for
   reductions in fuel burn, NOx emissions, and noise. While aircraft-level
   impacts are an obvious metric of success, it is difficult to make
   informed robust technology investment decisions with respect to noise
   without understanding the fleet-level impacts. Fleet-level predictions
   of noise for technology explorations are especially complicated because
   it is computationally expensive, highly combinatorial, and
   airport-specific. Recently, rapid automated airport noise models have
   been developed, which can be simulated using Design of Experiments
   (DOE). The results of these simulations are used to generate surrogate
   models for airport noise contour area, which can be summed to yield a
   fleet-level impact. These models make use of simplifying assumptions to
   provide estimates of airport level noise that are substantially cheaper
   to compute. They can be used to perform parametric trade-off analyses in
   conjunction with the equivalency assumption. Equivalency asserts that
   environmental impacts of a technology infused aircraft can be
   represented by scaled operations of the baseline aircraft in the same
   class. This simple assumption allows for the modeling of technology and
   market penetration factors under the same units: operations. This
   research uses surrogate models in conjunction with the equivalency
   assumption to examine two potential technology scenarios in a target
   forecast year, simulating technology and market performance factors to
   identify vehicle classes that could have the greatest impact in reducing
   contour area. Results show that technology and market performance of
   future notional Small Single Aisle and Large Single Aisle vehicle
   aircraft have the highest positive correlations with potential
   reductions in contour area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable electronics fabricated on lightweight and flexible substrate
   are believed to have great potential for portable devices, but their
   applications are limited by the life span of their batteries. We propose
   a hybridized self-charging power textile system with the aim of
   simultaneously collecting outdoor sunshine and random body motion
   energies and then storing them in an energy storage unit. Both of the
   harvested energies can be easily converted into electricity by using
   fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells (for solar energy) and
   fiber-shaped triboelectric nanogenerators (for random body motion
   energy) and then further stored as chemical energy in fiber-shaped
   supercapacitors. Because of the all-fiber-shaped structure of the entire
   system, our proposed hybridized self-charging textile system can be
   easily woven into electronic textiles to fabricate smart clothes to
   sustainably operate mobile or wearable electronics.}},

Title = {{Direct Air Capture of CO2 Using Amine Functionalized MIL-101(Cr)}},

Abstract = {{Direct adsorption of CO2 from ambient air, also known as direct air
   capture (DAC), is gaining attention as a complementary approach to
   processes that capture CO2 from more concentrated sources such as flue
   gas. Oxide-supported amine materials are effective materials for CO2
   capture from dilute gases, but less work has been done on metal organic
   framework (MOF) supported amine materials. Use of MOFs as supports for
   amines could be a versatile approach to the creation of effective amine
   adsorbents because of the tunability of MOF structures. In the present
   work, MIL-101(Cr) materials functionalized with amine species are
   evaluated for CO2 capture from simulated air. Two amines are loaded into
   the MOF pores, tris (2-amino ethyl) (TREN) and low molecular weight,
   branched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI 800), at different amine loadings.
   The MIL-101(Cr)-TREN composites showed high CO2 capacities for high
   loadings of TREN, but a significant loss of amines is observed over
   multicycle temperature swing adsorption experiments. In contrast,
   MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 shows better cyclic stability. The amine efficiency
   (mol CO2/mol amine) as a function of amine loading is used as a metric
   to characterize the adsorbents. The amine efficiency in
   MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 showed a strong dependence on the amine loading,
   with a step change to high amine efficiencies occurring at similar to
   0.8 mmol PEI/g MOF. The kinetics of CO2 capture, which have important
   implications for the working capacity of the adsorbent, are also
   examined, demonstrating that a MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 sample with a 1-1.1
   mmol PEI/g MOF loading has an excellent balance of CO2 capacity and CO2
   adsorption kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a new polarisation smoothing algorithm with
   multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) electromagnetic vector sensor
   array to address the problem of coherent source angle estimation in MIMO
   radar. This algorithm can be summarised as follows: (i) matched
   filtering for echoes is performed to get virtual MIMO array; (ii) the
   virtual array is divided into six spatially identical subarrays
   according to polarisation information offered by electromagnetic vector
   sensor; and (iii) the six subarrays covariance matrices are processed
   with weighted smoothing to obtain polarisation smoothing covariance
   matrix, which can restore the rank loss of the covariance matrix of
   coherent sources. When compared with spatial smoothing, the proposed
   algorithm is suitable for spatially arbitrary array configuration,
   without the price of reducing effective array aperture. Simulation
   results show that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the
   spatial smoothing algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Literature data for vehicle life cycle water consumption are limited and
   contradictory; there are no published estimates of vehicle life cycle
   water withdrawal. To place future discussions of sustainable mobility on
   a firmer technical basis, we report the results of a cradle-to-grave
   assessment of water withdrawal and water consumption for the gasoline
   internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and battery electric vehicle
   (BEV) variants of the 2012 Ford Focus. U.S. average life cycle water
   withdrawal and consumption of 531 and 131 cubic meters (m(3)),
   respectively, for a lifetime driving distance of 160,000 miles are
   estimated for the Focus ICEV using E10 gasoline. Employing our upper
   bound of water use in oil refinery operations and corn and ethanol
   production increases the life cycle withdrawal and consumption to 1,570
   and 761 m(3), respectively. The U.S. average life cycle water withdrawal
   for the Focus BEV is 3,770 m(3) (7 times that for the ICEV, reflecting
   the large volume of cooling water required during electricity
   generation), whereas the water consumption is 170 m(3) (comparable to
   that for the ICEV). Vehicle use is the most significant phase of the
   life cycle with fuel production, accounting for 49\% of water withdrawal
   and 82\% of water consumption for the ICEV. For the BEV, fuel
   (electricity) production accounts for 92\% of life cycle water
   withdrawal and 85\% of consumption. The results highlight the importance
   of renewable and sustainable fuels and increased vehicle energy
   efficiency in providing sustainable mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Patch clamp is the main technique for measuring electrical properties of
   individual cells. Since its discovery in 1976 by Neher and Sakmann,
   patch clamp has been instrumental in broadening our understanding of the
   fundamental properties of ion channels and synapses in neurons. The
   conventional patch-clamp method requires manual, precise positioning of
   a glass micropipette against the cell membrane of a visually identified
   target neuron. Subsequently, a tight ``gigaseal{''} connection between
   the pipette and the cell membrane is established, and suction is applied
   to establish the whole cell patch configuration to perform
   electrophysiological recordings. This procedure is repeated manually for
   each individual cell, making it labor intensive and time consuming. In
   this article we describe the development of a new automatic patch-clamp
   system for brain slices, which integrates all steps of the patch-clamp
   process: image acquisition through a microscope, computer vision-based
   identification of a patch pipette and fluorescently labeled neurons,
   micromanipulator control, and automated patching. We validated our
   system in brain slices from wild-type and transgenic mice expressing
   channelrhodopsin 2 under the Thy1 promoter (line 18) or injected with a
   herpes simplex virus-expressing archaerhodopsin, ArchT. Our computer
   vision-based algorithm makes the fluorescent cell detection and
   targeting user independent. Compared with manual patching, our system is
   superior in both success rate and average trial duration. It provides
   more reliable trial-to-trial control of the patching process and
   improves reproducibility of experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The middle ear efficiently transmits sound from the ear canal into the
   inner ear through a broad range of frequencies. Thus, understanding
   middle-ear transmission characteristics is essential in the study of
   hearing mechanics. Two models of the chinchilla middle ear are
   presented. In the first model, the middle ear is modeled as a lumped
   parameter system with elements that represent the ossicular chain and
   the middle-ear cavity. Parameters of this model are fit using available
   experimental data of two-port transmission matrix parameters. In an
   effort to improve agreement between model simulations and the phase of
   published experimental measurements for the forward pressure transfer
   function at high frequencies, a second model in which a lossless
   transmission line model of the tympanic membrane is appended to the
   original model is proposed. Two-port transmission matrix parameter
   results from this second model were compared with results from
   previously developed models of the guinea pig, cat, and human middle
   ears. Model results and published experimental data for the two-port
   transmission matrix parameters are found to be qualitatively similar
   between species. Quantitative differences in the two-port transmission
   matrix parameters suggest that the ossicular chains of chinchillas,
   cats, and guinea pigs are less flexible than in humans. (C) 2016

   multi-junctioned sample (PCM). Uncrosslinked PS-PI block copolymer (UBC)
   was also studied as a comparison. Crosslinking density was calculated by
   measuring the change in intensity of the double bond peaks using FTIR
   spectroscopy. Thermo-mechanical properties and morphology of the blends
   were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and scanning
   electron microscope (SEM). DMA results show that modulus increases with
   increasing filler loading in the terminal region for both PS/FCM and
   PS/FCF systems and the increasing rate is related to crosslinking
   density.}},

Abstract = {{We study the dynamic server allocation problem for tandem queueing
   systems with an equal number of stations and servers. The servers are
   flexible, yet non-collaborative, so that at most one server can work at
   a station at any time. The objective is to maximize the long-run average
   throughput. We show that if each server is the fastest at one station,
   then a dedicated server assignment policy is optimal for systems of
   arbitrary size and with general service requirement distributions.
   Otherwise, the optimal policy is more complex as servers must divide
   their time between stations. For Markovian systems with two stations and
   two servers, we characterize the optimal policy completely. For larger
   Markovian systems, we use our results for two-station systems to propose
   four heuristic server assignment policies and provide computational
   results that show that our heuristics are near-optimal. We also compare
   collaborative and non-collaborative settings to evaluate the benefits of
   dynamic server allocation, as opposed to collaboration, in systems with
   flexible servers. We conclude that the loss in the long-run average
   throughput due to lack of collaboration is mitigated by the similarity
   of the tasks in the system, and cross-training can still be beneficial
   in non-collaborative systems.}},

Abstract = {{The organic charge-transfer complex
   dibenzotetrathiafulvalene-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane is found to
   crystallize in two polymorphs when grown by physical vapor transport:
   the known -polymorph and a new structure, the -polymorph. Structural and
   elemental analysis via selected area electron diffraction, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, and polarized IR spectroscopy reveal that
   the complexes have the same stoichiometry with a 1:1 donor: acceptor
   ratio, but exhibit unique unit cells. The structural variations result
   in significant differences in the optoelectronic properties of the
   crystals, as observed in the experiments and electronic-structure
   calculations. Raman spectroscopy shows that the -polymorph has a degree
   of charge transfer of about 0.5e, while the -polymorph is nearly
   neutral. Organic field-effect transistors fabricated on these crystals
   reveal that in the same device structure both polymorphs show ambipolar
   charge transport, but the -polymorph exhibits electron-dominant
   transport while the -polymorph is hole-dominant. Together, these
   measurements imply that the transport features result from differing
   donor-acceptor overlap and consequential varying in frontier molecular
   orbital mixing, as suggested theoretically for charge-transfer
   complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks is a
   promising technology for improving network resource utilization, and
   cooperative communication technology is usually used to mitigate the
   interference caused by D2D communication. Due to the additional signal
   processing cost introduced by cooperative communication, the cellular
   links who have the exclusive usage right of the network spectrum can
   charge the D2D links a fee for spectrum usage to enhance their profit.
   In this paper, we propose a contract-based cooperative spectrum sharing
   mechanism to exploit transmission opportunities for the D2D links and
   meanwhile achieve the maximum profit of the cellular links. We first
   design a cooperative relaying scheme that employs superposition coding
   at both the cellular transmitters and D2D transmitters. The cooperative
   relaying scheme can maximize the data rate of the D2D links without
   deteriorating the performance of the cellular links. Then, we employ a
   contract-theoretic framework to model the spectrum trading process based
   on the cooperative relaying scheme, and derive the optimal power-payment
   contracts for the cellular links under both the cases that the private
   information (i.e., channel quality) of the D2D links is continuous and
   discrete using tools from continuous- and discrete-time optimal control
   theories, respectively. Analytic and numerical results confirm the
   efficiency of the proposed spectrum sharing mechanism.}},
