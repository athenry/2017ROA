Abstract = {{Hard-to-cut materials such as stainless steels and nickel-based super
   alloys are widely applied in different critical areas, e.g., aerospace
   and automotive components and chemical plants. Complex parts used in
   these areas are machined by indexable copy face mills with round
   inserts. This work aims to apply such inserts for studying machinability
   and process cost optimization during face milling of several hard alloys
   including stainless steel SS 403cb+, Inconel 718, and Inconel 625 with
   indexable copy face mills. Machining experiments on these alloys are
   performed at different cutting speed and feed rate combinations, and
   machinability is studied in terms of tool life and wear, material
   removal rate, cutting forces, and force coefficients. The extended
   Taylor's tool life model that includes both the cutting speed and feed
   rate are used to determine the model coefficients. Using standard cost
   optimization model, process parameters are optimized considering the
   trade-off between material removal rate and tool life. The coefficients
   estimated for the extended Taylor's tool life model are also validated.
   Findings reveal that machinability of Inconel 625 is poorest among the
   three alloy materials considered. Also, machining cost is found to be
   about 5 and 6 folds for Inconel 718 and Inconel 625, respectively, as
   compared to that for SS403cb+ when considering a fixed volume to be
   removed at the optimized speed and feed combinations of each material.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a study of a viscoelastic polymer stamp-based mechanical
   exfoliation technique capable of yielding large area (similar to square
   centimeters or larger) graphene layers from a highly ordered pyrolytic
   graphite (HOPG) substrate by manipulating the adhesion properties of a
   Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp and other key process parameters. In
   particular, the effects of stamp adhesion, normal contact force, and
   dwell time on the exfoliation force, layer thickness, and graphene
   surface morphology are studied. Experiments show that the process is
   capable of exfoliating relatively large (up to 12x 12 mm(2)) graphene
   layers under certain conditions. The exfoliated layers, albeit of
   varying thickness, have regions that are tens of nanometer thick and
   contain various topographical features such as bubbles, wrinkles, and
   compressed regions. This work serves as the first step toward developing
   a scalable production method for large area graphene and other layered

Abstract = {{Ambient wet-bulb temperature measurement is critical in the water-cooled
   chiller plant system to enhance the holistic energy efficiency through
   advanced control strategies, such as the cooling tower temperature
   relief, condenser water supply temperature reset, and so on. The outside
   air (OA) wet-bulb temperature is usually measured either by a
   psychrometer or a combination of an OA relative humidity sensor and an
   OA dry-bulb sensor. However, these conventional measuring devices are
   notoriously costly and frequently problematic in consideration of the
   accuracy and reliability. This paper proposes a black-box-based virtual
   ambient wet-bulb sensor through adopting a low-cost but relatively
   accurate dry-bulb temperature sensor and the local weather data, either
   the typical meteorological year (TMY) weather data or the real-time
   weather data available online. Further, a dynamic real-time calibration
   algorithm was simultaneously developed to minimize the measurement
   error. A case study in a ten-story office building in Austin, Texas was
   implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy. It reveals
   that the virtual sensor combined with the uniquely developed control
   algorithm could greatly improve the readings of the ambient wet-bulb
   temperature, thus guarantee the in-field chiller plant performance
   optimization as expected by the proposed control strategies. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{For most light commercial buildings and residential houses, the thermal
   energy system is usually a unitary air system and only rated as
   standard-satisfied during the initial installation and commission phase,
   regardless of the performance during the whole life cycle. Further, the
   thermal energy system is normally equipped with low initial cost and
   simple controller, usually one thermostat, which results in the poor
   maintenance since no specific diagnostic sensors were installed. The
   maintenance is required only when the system capacity is degraded and no
   longer satisfied, which already results in large amount of energy
   wasting.
   Existing evaluation methods for building thermal energy system have two
   major limitations. Firstly, they mainly work for those with advanced
   building automation system (BAS) control, which is extremely costly and
   usually adopted for large commercial building. Secondly, advanced
   specific knowledge is required, which is relatively complicated for
   average residents.
   This study developed a convenient method for the thermal performance
   evaluation of these DX or Unitary AC units: provide one simple and
   convenient method to quantify the thermal performance and continuously
   monitor thermal performance during the whole life-cycle period; present
   a building thermal performance rating procedure; implement the proposed
   method through either field data or standard compliant as-built
   simulation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{According to the U.S. Green Building Council, buildings consumed 36\% of
   total energy consumption in United States. With the concept of
   sustainability continues to grow in importance, more researches have
   been focused on improving energy efficiency during a building's
   operation phase. Academic settings, such as university facilities, pose
   a unique set of challenges to facility managers and administrators in
   achieving energy efficiency. Unlike commercial, residential or
   industrial buildings, campus facilities are composed of different
   building types with different requirements for indoor air quality,
   humidity, temperature and ventilation from continuously changing
   occupants. The current practice with campus facility management requires
   facility managers to manually schedule tasks, often based on the order
   of incoming requests without considering their impact on building energy
   consumption. This paper aims to develop an energy-aware intelligent
   facility management system for campus facilities. It first builds a
   knowledge database which includes two main parts: basic information on
   common daily work request and work instructions; and also the impact on
   building energy performance. An artificial intelligent model is then
   proposed to automatically analyze and prioritize future work requests
   based on factors such as safety, energy consumption impact, occupant
   satisfaction, etc. A case study is conducted on campus to validate the
   system with focus on HVAC tasks. The goal is to help facility managers
   improve building energy efficiency while meeting other restraints. (C)

Abstract = {{With the growing needs of improving building sustainability, an
   increasing number of existing buildings need renovation to meet the
   expectation of the stakeholders. In the pre-design phase, it is very
   critical to have the best decision made to satisfy both the project
   budget and the performance standard. For a new buildings, a whole
   building energy simulation analysis is very helpful for this decision
   making process because it can provide the stakeholders the evaluation
   results of all alternative solutions. However, for existing buildings,
   the as-built data required for the building energy modeling process is
   not always available, and its manual collection process is
   time-consuming and error prone. This paper first reviews the
   state-of-the-art methods of automated data collection, and then
   introduces the automatic as-built BIM model creation process through a
   case study. This study also successfully demonstrated the
   interoperability between the created as-built model and a typical energy

Abstract = {{Existing buildings now represent the greatest opportunity to improve
   building energy efficiency. Building performance analysis is becoming
   increasingly important because decision makers can have a better
   visualization of their building's performance and quickly make the
   solution for improving building energy efficiency and reducing
   environmental impacts. Nowadays, building information models (BIMs) have
   been widely created during the design phase of new buildings, and it can
   be easily imported to third party software to conduct various analyses.
   However, a BIM is not always available for all existing buildings. Even
   if a BIM is available during the design and construction phases, it is
   very challenging to keep updating it while a building is aged. A manual
   process to create or update a BIM is very time consuming and labor
   intensive. A laser scanning technology has been a popular tool to create
   as-is BIM. However it still needs labor-intensive manual processes to
   create a BIM out of point clouds. This paper introduces automatic as-is
   simplified BIM creation from point clouds for energy simulations. A
   framework of decision support system that can assist decision makers on
   retrofits for existing buildings is introduced as well. A case study on
   a residential house was tested in this study to validate the proposed
   framework, and the technical feasibility of the developed system was
   positively demonstrated. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes the iterative nonlinear least square approximation
   (INLSA) algorithm for designing measurement-based wideband shallow
   underwater acoustic (UWA) channel simulators. Measurement-based channel
   simulators are essential for the test, optimization, and performance
   analysis of UWA communication systems. The aim is to fit the
   time-variant channel impulse response (TVCIR) of the simulation model to
   that of the measured UWA channel. The performance of the designed UWA
   channel simulator is assessed by comparing the time-frequency
   correlation function (TFCF), the power delay profile (PDP), and the
   probability density function (PDF) of the channel envelope with the
   corresponding quantities of the measured channel. The results of the
   assessment show an excellent match between the statistical properties of
   the UWA channel simulator, designed by the INLSA method, and those of
   the real-world UWA channel. It is also shown that the distribution of
   the channel envelope of our measurement data, which is collected from a
   shallow-water environment, follows closely the Rayleigh distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, atomic interaction is
   characterized by the interatomic potential energy as the input of
   simulation models. The interatomic potentials are derived experimentally
   or from first-principles calculations. Therefore they are inherently
   imprecise because of the measurement or model-form errors. In this work,
   a reliable molecular dynamics (R-MD) mechanism is developed to extend
   the predictive capability of MD given the input uncertainty. In R-MD,
   the locations and velocities of particles are not assumed to be
   precisely known as in traditional MD. Instead, they are represented as
   intervals in order to capture the input uncertainty associated with the
   atomistic model. The advantage of the new mechanism is the significant
   reduction of computational cost from traditional sensitivity analysis
   when assessing the effects of input uncertainty. A formalism of
   generalized interval is incorporated in R-MD, as an intrusive
   uncertainty quantification method, to model the propagation of
   uncertainty during the simulation. Error generating functions associated
   interatomic potentials are developed to capture the bounds of input
   variations.}},

Abstract = {{Atomistic scale simulation can predict state transition processes such
   as adsorption, diffusion, and reaction. The challenge of the accurate
   prediction is to obtain a global view of many local minima and saddle
   points on the potential energy surface (PES) of a material system. The
   transition conditions are determined by the saddle points on the PES
   with the minimum energy barrier between local minima. In this paper, a
   new algorithm is developed to exhaustively search local minima and
   saddle points within a region of PES in order to provide a global view
   of the energy landscape. Unlike the existing saddle point search
   methods, the algorithm represents a transition path by a parametric
   Bezier curve with control points. It uses multiple groups of such
   curves, each of which represents a multistage transition path. During
   the searching process, each group of curves communicates with others to
   maintain cohesion and avoid collision based on a collective potential
   model. The algorithm is integrated with density functional theory
   calculation and demonstrated by diffusion of hydrogen atoms in the FeTiH
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale modeling of material systems demands novel solution
   strategies to simulating physical phenomena that occur in a hierarchy of
   length scales. Majority of the current approaches involve one way
   coupling such that the information is transferred from a lower length
   scale to a higher length scale. To enable bi-directional scale-bridging,
   a new data-driven framework called Materials Knowledge System (MKS) has
   been developed recently. The remarkable advantages of MKS in
   establishing computationally efficient localization linkages (e.g.,
   spatial distribution of a field in lower length scale for an imposed
   loading condition in higher length scale) have been demonstrated in
   prior work. In these prior MKS studies, the effort was focused on
   composite materials that had a finite number of discrete local states.
   As a major extension, in this work, the MKS framework has been extended
   for polycrystalline aggregates which need to incorporate crystal lattice
   orientation as a continuous local state. This extension of the MKS
   framework for elastic deformation of polycrystals is achieved by
   employing compact Fourier representations of functions defined in the
   crystal orientation space. The viability of this new formulation will be
   presented for case studies involving single and multi-phase
   polycrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Computational models of the mitral valve (MV) exhibit significant
   potential for patient-specific surgical planning. Recently, these models
   have been advanced by incorporating MV tissue structure, non-linear
   material properties, and more realistic chordae tendineae architecture.
   Despite advances, only limited ground-truth data exists to validate
   their ability to accurately simulate MV closure and function. The
   validation of the underlying models will enhance modeling accuracy and
   confidence in the simulated results. A necessity towards this aim is to
   develop an integrated pipeline based on a comprehensive in-vitro flow
   loop setup including echocardiography techniques (Echo) and
   micro-computed tomography. Building on {[}1] we improved the acquisition
   protocol of the proposed experimental setup for in-vitro Echo imaging,
   which enables the extraction of more reproducible and accurate
   geometrical models, using state-of-the art image processing and
   geometric modeling techniques. Based on the geometrical parameters from
   the Echo MV models captured during diastole, a bio-mechanical model is
   derived to estimate MV closure geometry. We illustrate the framework on
   two data sets and show the improvements obtained from the novel Echo
   acquisition protocol and improved bio-mechanical model.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional Brillouin based carrier generator may produce optical
   wavelengths at the spacing of 10 GHz (odd) or 20 GHz (even), which in
   turn will be heterodyned for microwave/millimeter wave (mm-wave)
   generation. Therefore, in the scenario where both odd and even order
   carriers are required, two laser units have to be utilized. In this
   paper, a new type of Brillouin fiber laser is proposed with
   bidirectional pumping by using two seed lasers. This technique enables
   single laser unit to generate both odd and even order wavelengths that
   results in the possibility of varying the resolution of the laser. The
   laser resolution can be changed by switching the seed laser 2 OFF for
   even order carrier generation, while the odd order carrier generation
   can be performed by operating the seed laser 2 at the same wavelength as
   seed laser 1. A similar to 30 GHz carrier generation was performed in
   the proposed laser unit by switching to odd order generation. Meanwhile,
   a 40 GHz carrier was generated by both odd and even order options of the
   laser, where the odd order exhibits a power level of -7 dBm with many
   residual components, while the even order generated high purity carrier
   with a power level of 8 dBm, resulting in an improvement 15 dB.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate objective of this research is to quantify changes in joint
   sounds during recovery from musculoskeletal injury, and to then use the
   characteristics of such sounds as a biomarker for quantifying joint
   rehabilitation progress. This paper focuses on the robust measurement of
   joint acoustic emissions using miniature microphones placed on the knee
   and interfaced to custom hardware. Two types of microphones were
   investigated: (1) miniature microphones with a sound port for detecting
   airborne sounds; and (2) piezoelectric film based contact microphones
   for detecting skin vibrations associated with internal sounds.
   Additionally, inertial measurements were taken simultaneously with joint
   sounds to observe the consistency in the acoustic emissions in the
   context of particular activities: knee flexion/extension (without load)
   and multi-joint weighted movement involving knee and hip
   flexion/extension (i.e. sit-to-stand). The preliminary data demonstrated
   that high quality joint sound measurements can be obtained with unique
   and repeatable acoustic signatures in healthy and injured joints.
   Additionally, the results suggest that combining piezoelectric contact
   microphones (which detect high quality acoustic emission signals
   directly from the skin vibrations but can be compromised with loss of
   skin contact) and electret microphones (which measure lower
   signal-to-noise ratio airborne sounds from the joint but can even
   measure such sounds at 5 cm distance from the skin) can provide robust
   measurements for a future wearable system to assess joint health in
   patients during rehabilitation at home.}},

   structure, then we can use straightforward two-stage algorithm that
   exploits this structure. We show that the estimate is accurate when the
   number of sketches is proportional to the maximum of the rank times the
   number of significant rows/columns of Sigma. Moreover, our algorithm
   takes direct advantage of the low-rank structure of Sigma by only
   manipulating matrices that are far smaller than the original covariance
   matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Mass spectrometry is one of the primary methods for chemical analysis
   and serves as a fundamental tool in numerous scientific disciplines. In
   this paper we consider the design of time-of-flight mass spectrometers,
   which produce a stream of measurements which can be modeled by a
   convolution between the mass spectrum of interest and a specified
   pulsing pattern. Our goal is to reduce the total time necessary to
   analyze a sample to a given precision (or equivalently, given a fixed
   amount of time, to obtain a more precise estimate of the sample). We can
   do this by leveraging the structure that exists in typical mass spectra.
   In particular, since any given substance is usually composed of a
   relatively small number of distinct molecules, mass spectra tend to be
   relatively sparse. In this paper we perform an analysis of an idealized
   model of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer which uses a randomized
   pulsing pattern. Such an architecture has the potential to enable a new
   tradeoff between acquisition time and precision/dynamic range. We show
   that under certain natural conditions on the randomized scheme - namely,
   that the system does not pulse too often - this construction will lead
   to a system which satisfies certain desirable properties that are
   sufficient to ensure that sparse recovery is possible. In particular, we
   show that with high probability, the system will satisfy the conditions
   of a bipartite expander graph provided the pulsing rate is not too
   large. We then conclude with a range of simulations that support our
   theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical viability of this
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of completing a matrix with categorical-valued
   entries from partial observations. This is achieved by extending the
   formulation and theory of one-bit matrix completion {[}1]. We recover a
   low-rank matrix M by maximizing the likelihood ratio with a constraint
   on the nuclear norm of M, and the observations are mapped from entries
   of M through multiple link functions. We establish theoretical upper and
   lower bounds on the recovery error, which meet up to a constant factor
   O(K-3/2) where K is the fixed number of categories. The upper bound in
   our case depends on the number of categories implicitly through a
   maximization of terms that involve the smoothness of the link functions.
   In contrast to one-bit matrix completion, our bounds for categorical
   matrix completion are optimal up to a factor on the order of the square
   root of the number of categories, which is consistent with an intuition
   that the problem becomes harder when the number of categories increases.
   By comparing the performance of our method with the conventional matrix
   completion method on the MovieLens dataset, we demonstrate the advantage
   of our method.}},

   capacity of the receiver is characterized as a lower bound for the
   general capacity. It is also proved that a finite support probability

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fabrication technique to develop highly laminated
   structures comprising stacked thin films, in which the structures are
   based on surface tension-driven assembly at the liquid-air interface.
   When multiple metallic films are removed from a liquid solution, there
   is a surface tension-driven coalescence and self-alignment of the wetted
   films, resulting in thick metallic microstuctures comprised of many
   layers of metallic nanosheets after evaporation of the liquid. If the
   liquid contains a dissolved material, each sheet can further be coated
   with the material prior to assembly. Based on this technique, we
   developed laminated structures comprising hundreds of nanoscale layers
   of alternating metallic film and non-conducting polymer. Electroplated
   Co44Ni37Fe19 (Cobalt-Nickel-Iron alloy) and a commercial Novec 1700
   solution (3M, Minnesota) were utilized for the metallic film and the
   liquid solution, respectively. However, the assembly process inherently
   allows a variety of materials to be exploited. Theoretical analysis and
   experimental results were compared, demonstrating a critical gap between
   the metallic films, below which capillary force is sufficient for
   driving self-assembly of the films. As an exemplary application of this
   technique, highly laminated magnetic cores comprising 600 layers of 500
   nm thick CoNiFe that are insulated by 100 nm thick polymer were
   prepared. A 15-turn toroidal inductor with the fabricated magnetic core
   exhibited a constant inductance of 2.5 mu H up to 30 MHz with a quality
   factor over 70 at 1 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology to estimate the lifetime due to gate oxide breakdown
   (GOBD) is presented. The results of this analysis show that devices in
   analog circuits experience unequal stress acceleration and this impacts
   lifetime estimates at use conditions and can cause some devices to fail
   relatively more frequently under accelerated conditions in comparison
   with use conditions. We calculate the impact of voltage and temperature
   acceleration on circuits by combining the impact of voltage and
   temperature acceleration on each device to find the circuit-level
   acceleration factors. Because the acceleration factors are not constant
   for analog circuits, we propose to use reliability simulation to
   properly estimate acceleration factors under the uneven stress
   conditions experienced by mixed-signal circuits. The acceleration
   factors can then be used to estimate circuit lifetime at use conditions,
   given empirical data on failure rates of chips at high temperature and
   voltage stress conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal performance of air cooled heat sinks is significantly
   enhanced by deliberate formation of unsteady small-scale vortical
   motions within the fin channels that result in significant increases in
   the local heat transfer coefficient at the fins' surfaces, and in the
   mixing between the thermal boundary layers and the cooler core flows.
   These small-scale motions are induced by autonomous aeroelastic
   fluttering of a cantilevered planar thin-film reed that is placed in the
   center plane of each fin channel. The thermal performance enhancement in
   the absence and presence of reed actuation is characterized in a
   mm-scale model of the rectangular air-cooled heated fin channels. Of
   particular interest are the increases in power dissipation and the
   associated fluid power over a range of flow rates. It is shown that the
   cooling flow rate that is needed to sustain a given heat flux at a fixed
   wall temperature is nearly two times lower in the presence of reed
   actuation. Therefore, the reeds can lead to a four-fold increase in
   thermal performance as measured by the ratio of power dissipated to
   fluid power. The thermal effectiveness of the reeds is tested in a
   multi-channel heat sink, and it is shown that the improvement in heat
   transfer relative to the base flow is similar to that of the model
   channel.}},

   diagnosis and therapy. Likewise, molecular dynamics (MD) has become a
   novel major technique that developed to design pioneering nano-biosensor
   as well as nanocarriers in this regard. Furthermore, cancer diagnosis
   using nano-biosensors such as glioblastoma cancer in early stage is
   imperative to enhance the efficacy of treatment. Tumor cell-derived
   exosomes or tumor antigens are nanovesicles responsible for
   tumorigenesis and transferring information between cells which delivery
   oncogenes and onco-microRNAs. They are also present in blood and other

   early detection of several cancer types. In this work, we report on the
   use of classical MD simulations to study the binding mechanism of
   functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with Tim-4 to the
   tumor-derived exosomes phosphatidylserine (Ptd-L-Ser) receptor. All-atom
   MD simulations of Tim-4-SWCNT and Tim-4-Ptd-L-Ser allowed us to observe

Abstract = {{Energy consumption is a primary consideration that determines the
   usability of emerging mobile computing devices such as smartphones.
   Refresh operations for main memory account for a significant fraction of
   the overall energy consumption, especially during idle periods, when
   processor can be switched off quickly; however, memory contents continue
   to get refreshed to avoid data loss. Given that mobile devices are idle
   most of the times, reducing refresh power in idle mode is critical to
   maximize the duration for which the device remains usable. The frequency
   of refresh operations in memory can be reduced significantly by using
   strong multi-bit error correction codes (ECC). Unfortunately, strong ECC
   codes incur high latency, which causes significant performance
   degradation (as high as 21\%, and on average 10\%).
   To obtain both low refresh power in idle periods and high performance in
   active periods, this paper proposes Morphable ECC (MECC). During idle
   periods, MECC keeps the memory protected with 6-bit ECC (ECC-6) and
   employs a refresh period of 1 second, instead of the typical refresh
   period of 64ms. During active operation, MECC reduces the refresh
   interval to 64ms, and converts memory from ECC-6 to weaker ECC
   (single-bit error correction) on a demand-basis, thus avoiding the high
   latency of ECC-6, except for the first access during the active mode.
   Our proposal reduces refresh operations during idle mode by 16x, memory
   power in idle mode by 2X, while retaining performance within 2\% of a
   system that does not use any ECC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a Distributed Energy Resources Services Platform as
   an electric grid Business Model Innovation Framework (BMIF) for
   coordination of distributed energy resources and renewable energy
   integration. The platform is based on a decentralized and layered
   architecture and is centered on the concept of electricity prosumers
   -economically motivated agents (residential, commercial, industrial) -
   that can produce, store or consume energy. The platform consists of six
   layers, including: the physical layer, local control layer, cyber layer,
   system control layer (economic dispatch and real-time control), market
   transactive layer and business layer. The main objective of the platform
   is to provide a framework for the coordination of several spatially
   distributed and heterogeneous subsystems containing energy resources at
   different time scales and horizons in order to conduct economic
   emissions dispatch and reserve scheduling to integrate higher amounts of
   renewable energy, while dynamically maintaining and adapting to user
   level of service requirements and system level constraints. Using the
   structure provided by the platform, the benefits of flexible distributed
   energy resources for different scenarios of renewable energy integration
   are quantified. The results show that using the platform for
   coordination of flexible energy, offers the opportunity to integrate
   higher amounts of renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions and
   operational costs.}},

Abstract = {{High false alarm rates in the ICU decrease quality of care by slowing
   staff response times while increasing patient delirium through noise
   pollution. The 2015 Physio-Net/Computing in Cardiology Challenge
   provides a set of 1,250 multi-parameter ICU data segments associated
   with critical arrhythmia alarms, and challenges the general research
   community to address the issue of false alarm suppression using all
   available signals. Each data segment was 5 minutes long (for real time
   analysis), ending at the time of the alarm. For retrospective analysis,
   we provided a further 30 seconds of data after the alarm was triggered.
   A collection of 750 data segments was made available for training and a
   set of 500 was held back for testing. Each alarm was reviewed by expert
   annotators, at least two of whom agreed that the alarm was either true
   or false. Challenge participants were invited to submit a complete,
   working algorithm to distinguish true from false alarms, and received a
   score based on their program's performance on the hidden test set. This
   score was based on the percentage of alarms correct, but with a penalty
   that weights the suppression of true alarms five times more heavily than
   acceptance of false alarms.
   We provided three example entries based on well-known, open source
   signal processing algorithms, to serve as a basis for comparison and as
   a starting point for participants to develop their own code. A total of
   38 teams submitted a total of 215 entries in this year's Challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: An ECG signal has important information that can help for
   reflecting cardiac activity of a patient and medical diagnosis.
   Consistent or periodical heart rhythm disorders can result cardiac
   arrhythmias so classification algorithm for recognizing arrhythmias with
   satisfactory accuracy is necessary.
   Aims: In this study, a robust wavelet based algorithm for detection and
   delineation of events in ECG signal is applied and then a new synthesis
   of MLP-BP and PNN neural networks for heart arrhythmia classification
   was described.
   Methods: As a matter of fact any changes in the morphology of an ECG due
   to the arrhythmia are observed in time and frequency analysis so multi
   resolution analysis is applied for feature detection. First, noise and
   artifact is rejected by a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and multi
   lead ECG is obtained. Then QRS complexes of signal is extracted and the
   signal is decomposed so corresponding DWT scales are segmented Next
   curve length and high order moment order based feature extraction are
   calculated for each excerpted segment and elements of feature vector for
   regulating the parameters of classifiers are obtained After generation
   of feature source and segmentation, Multi-Layer Perceptron-Back
   Propagation (MLP-BP) neural networks, Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)
   and support vector machine (SVM) were designed and tuned and their
   results were compared.
   Results: The proposed algorithm was tested to all 48 record of the
   MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and also the proposed topology of
   classifiers and its related parameters is optimized by searching of best
   value of parameters. The average value of accuracy of each classifier
   over all records of MIT-BIH for arrhythmias recognition is Acc = 97.42,
   Acc = 98.24 and Acc = 97.42 for SVM, MLP and PNN classifiers
   respectively and also obtained results were compared with similar
   peer-reviewed studies in this subject.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new method for detection of arterial blood pressure
   pulses (ABP) is presented The algorithm employs discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT) decomposition to extract ABP waveform features. In the
   proposed method, two strategies are used In the first strategy, the
   algorithm uses only the DWT coefficients of ABP. The second strategy
   which is introduced for the first time in this paper, the coupled DWT
   coefficients of ABP and electrocardiogram (ECG) are used. When DWT
   coefficients of ECG and ABP are coupled the detection of ABP pulses is
   easier and more accurate in noisy parts of the signals. Furthermore,
   this coupling strategy is useful for the detection of ECG R-peaks since
   the ABP pulses make the ECG R-peaks detectable when ECG is noisy. To
   meet this end, adaptive thresholding and different DWT functions were
   employed and fitted because of different morphologies of ABP and ECG
   signals. The ABP-ECG delay time is measured in different recordings and
   set for 254 milliseconds. For evaluation, 170 recordings of the
   multimodal training set of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge
   2014 which contained both ECG and ABP waveforms were used The first and
   second strategy obtained average accuracy of 87.56\% and 88.53\%,

Abstract = {{Introduction: Coronary artery congestion is a heart disease which causes
   a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the heart, and is felt as chest pain
   (ischemia disease). Prolonged ischemia can continue until the cells
   start to dye, which is called myocardial infraction.
   Aims: We aim to determine the amount of cardiac tissue damage by multi
   resolution analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) and atrial blood pressure
   (ABP) signals.
   Methods: In this study 39 Wistar rats were used, and ECG and ABP signals
   were recorded to estimate the extent of tissue damage. The signals were
   recorded for 30 minutes during normal heart function and for 30 minutes
   during ischemia and myocardial infraction (MI) which was induced by
   artificial complete blockage of the left anterior descending coronary
   artery (LAD). Additionally the vasopressin (AVP) in various doses was
   injected to 39 rats. Afterwards, the wavelet packet transform (WPT) wad
   applied to the recorded ECG and ABP signals for decomposition into
   dyadic scales. 50 dyadic scales which were more informative for
   discrimination of different ischemic phases among each other and from
   the healthy phase were chosen, and a feature vector as the entropy of
   corresponding wavelet coefficients was selected. As a reference
   measurement of the extent of damage tissue, images of the heart sections
   were additionally extracted, and the extent of damage tissue was
   assessed by image processing technique. Finally, the amount of damage
   tissue was classified with artificial neural networks (ANN) based
   techniques.
   Results: The extent of tissue damage was estimated based on the ANN and
   multi-resolution analysis of the synchronic electromechanical signals
   with the average error of the 2.17\% for the normal and ischemic tissue
   in all the AVP doses.}},

Abstract = {{On a given vector X = < x(1), x(2),..., x(n)> of integers, the range
   selection (i, j, k) query is finding the k-th smallest integer in <
   x(i), x(i+1),..., x(j)> for any (i, j, k) such that 1 <= i <= j <= n,
   and 1 <= k <= j - i + 1. Previous studies on the problem kept X intact
   and proposed data structures that occupied additional O(n center dot log
   n) bits of space over the X itself that answer the queries in
   logarithmic time. In this study, we replace X and encode all integers in
   it via a single wavelet tree by using S = n center dot log u + Sigma(for
   all i) log x(i) + o(n center dot log u + Sigma(for all i) log x(i))
   bits, where u is the number of distinct left perpendicularlog x(i)right
   perpendicular values observed in X. Notice that u is at most 32 (64) for
   32-bit (64-bit) integers and when x(i) > u, the space used for x(i) in
   the proposed data structure is less then the Elias-delta coding of x(i).
   Besides data-aware coding of X, the range selection is performed in
   O(log u + logx') time where x' is the k-th smallest integer in the
   queried range. This somewhat adaptive result interestingly achieves the
   range selection regardless of the size of X, and totally depends on the
   actual answer of the query. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, we
   present the first algorithm using data-aware space and time for the
   general range selection problem.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of a communication link is commonly indicated by signal to
   noise/interference ratio and affected by noise and interference
   variance. To ensure a power efficient adaptive OFDM system's
   performance, the system needs to be tested against various channel
   conditions. Conventional algorithms and experiments assume that the
   noise and interference density stays constant over the OFDM frequency
   band but in reality the communication link often populated with both
   white noise and interference that results an uneven impact on OFDM
   spectrum. To create such channel condition, an up-conversion is commonly
   used. However, due to the non-linearity of the mixer, the up-converted
   interference is always distorted. The proposed method uses a modified
   higher-than-Nyquist-rate RF signal generation algorithm to minimize the
   distortion of generated interference within a pre-defined output
   bandwidth. Both concept validation and experimental measurement have
   been conducted to prove the effect of proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{One of the few convergent themes during the first two United Nations
   Meeting of Experts on autonomous weapons systems (AWS) was the
   requirement that there be meaningful human control (MHC) of AWS. What
   exactly constitutes MHC, however, is still ill-defined. While multiple
   sets of definitions and analyses have been published and discussed, this
   work seeks to address two key issues with the current definitions: (1)
   they are inconsistent in what authorities and responsibilities of human
   and automated agents need to be regulated, and (2) they lack the
   specificity that would be required for designers to systemically
   integrate these restrictions into AWS designs. Given that MHC centers on
   the interaction of human and autonomous agents, we leverage the models
   and metrics of function allocation - the allocation of work between
   human and autonomous agents - to analyze and compare definitions of MHC
   and the definitions of AWS proposed by the U.S. Department of Defense.
   Specifically, we transform the definitions into function allocation form
   to model and compare the definitions, and then show how a mismatch
   between authority and responsibility in an exemplar military scenario
   can still plague the human-AWS interactions. In summary, this paper
   provides a starting point for future research to investigate the
   application of function allocation to the questions of MHC and more
   generally, the development of rules and standards for incorporating AWS
   into the law of armed conflict.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines an adaptive extension of likelihood codebook
   reordering (LCR) vector quantization. By providing a method for allowing
   the vector quantization to adapt in a predetermined way, the codebook
   may be adaptively reordered to allow more efficient encoding by giving
   preference to encountered vectors in the dictionary. In particular,
   adaptation allows the trained dictionaries to be more efficient in
   representing specific data. The difference in the training and testing
   sets produces different transition matrices which are used to encode
   testing vectors. The adaptive likelihood codebook reordering vector
   quantization adapts the a priori transition matrix obtained from
   training data set to the testing data set on an online instantaneous
   basis. This method yields improvements in coding rate when entropy
   coding is applied to the reordered indices obtained from the adaptive
   version of the LCR algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal is to find anomalous features in a dataset using the sparse
   coding concept of dictionary learning. Rather than using the averaged
   column l(2)-norm for the dictionary update as is typically done in
   sparse coding, we explore using three matrix norms: vertical bar
   vertical bar.vertical bar vertical bar(1), vertical bar vertical
   bar.vertical bar vertical bar(2), and vertical bar vertical bar.vertical
   bar vertical bar(infinity). Minimizing the matrix norms represents
   minimizing a maximum deviation in the reconstruction error rather than
   an average deviation, hopefully allowing us to find features that
   contribute significantly but infrequently to sample training points. We
   find that while solving for the dictionaries using matrix norm
   minimization takes longer to compute, all three methods are able to
   recover a known basis from a simple set of training data. In addition,
   the vertical bar vertical bar(1) matrix norm is able to recover a known
   anomalous feature in the training data that the other norms ( including
   the standard averaged l(2)-norm) are unable to find.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in illumination negatively impacts the performance of most
   face recognition systems. This is substantially exacerbated when the
   illumination on a face exhibits strong shadows or other anomalies. This
   paper describes a system of practical technologies to implement an
   illumination robust, consumer grade biometric system based on face
   recognition to be used in the automotive market. It addresses the
   challenging outdoor environments in which driver identification is
   expected to operate. The point of this research is to investigate
   practical face recognition used for identity management in order to
   minimize algorithmic complexity while making the system robust to
   ambient illumination changes. First, we present a frame differencing
   method with an active near-infrared illumination control that produces
   images independent of the ambient illumination. Second, end-to-end face
   recognition system is presented including motion detection, face
   detection and face recognition modules. And it is shown that the frame
   differencing method makes the modules more robust to the ambient
   illumination variation. Vehicular application videos were taken in
   extremely challenging outdoor illumination and shadowing conditions and
   used to test each module. Finally, extensive test results of vehicular
   scenario are provided to evaluate the end-to-end systems.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a distributed composite hypothesis testing problem in which
   sensor nodes share a collision channel to send their decisions and the
   fusion center (FC) has a limited time to collect these decisions. When
   the FC does not have enough time to collect all local decisions
   successfully, we propose a transmission protocol called sensor censoring
   random access as the multiple access scheme used by sensor nodes to send
   their decisions to the FC. By using this protocol, the collection time
   is divided into frames, where each frame consists of a number of time
   slots. The sensor nodes whose observations are within a specific range
   will send their decisions in a specific frame by using slotted ALOHA.
   Thereafter, we derive a Rao test used by the FC to decide whether the
   event is happening. Since this Rao test is aware of packet collisions
   and exploits them to make a global decision, we call it a
   collision-aware Rao test (CA-Rao test). Its asymptotic performance (the
   probabilities of detection and false alarm) is determined. The receiver
   operating characteristics of the CA-Rao test are evaluated and compared
   to those of a Rao test of distributed detection using parallel access
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{Designing and developing complex mechatronic systems requires the
   consolidation of models from a variety of domains. These models are
   created by different stakeholders using a variety of formalisms for the
   purpose of addressing specific concerns, and are used for representing
   different views on the same system. While it is considered good practice
   to separate concerns as much as possible, a complete separation is
   impossible. The resulting model overlap opens the possibility of
   inconsistencies being introduced - that is, disagreements between views.
   Numerous approaches to identify and resolve such inconsistencies have
   been introduced in the software and systems engineering literature.
   However, in mechatronic design practice, these have gained little
   acceptance. The goal of this paper is two-fold: to investigate why their
   wide spread use is not common, and to assess which of the approaches is
   the most promising for multi-disciplinary systems design. To aid in the
   investigation, a change scenario is analyzed using the models of a
   mechatronic manufacturing system as a case study.}},

Abstract = {{In some recent work, we proposed a binary decision diagram (BDD-) based
   approach for the development of the maximally permissive deadlock
   avoidance policy (DAP) for complex resource allocation systems (RAS),
   that is based on the identification and the explicit storage of a set of
   critical states in the underlying RAS state-space. The work presented in
   this paper seeks to extend the applicability of the aforementioned
   results by coupling them with a partitioning technique for the more
   efficient storage and processing of the BDD that encodes the underlying
   state space. The reported numerical experimentation demonstrates the
   increased efficiency of the new algorithm w.r.t. its space and time
   complexity, compared to the previous method that uses a more monolithic
   representation of the RAS state-space. The last part of the paper also
   discusses some further potential advantages of the presented method,
   including its amenability to a parallelized implementation and its
   ability to cope effectively and efficiently with uncontrollable
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In complex systems, like the modern air traffic system, human operator
   taskload can have a profound influence on how well the system performs.
   Because of the system's complexity, however, it can be difficult to
   determine all of the situations where taskload issues can arise.
   Simulation and formal verification have been used separately to explore
   human taskload in complex systems. However, both have problems that
   limit their usefulness. In this paper, we describe a formal modeling
   architecture designed to enable the discovery of interesting human
   operator taskload conditions though the synergistic use of formal
   verification and simulation. This architecture formally represents
   original simulation constructs using computationally efficient
   abstractions that ensure that temporal and ordinal relationships between
   simulation events (actions) are represented realistically. Taskload for
   each agent is represented based on a priority queue model where only a
   limited number of actions can be performed or remembered by a human at
   any given time. We provide an overview of this architecture, discuss its
   essential features, and describe the mathematical foundations needed for
   its instantiation. We present insights into its capabilities for finding
   interesting taskload conditions by formulating several checkable
   specification properties. The implications of this architecture are
   discussed in terms of its broader supported analysis method and
   directions for future work are explored.}},

   probabilistic methods. By exploiting a symmetry property of the
   stochastic MFD, whereby it exhibits identical probability distributions

   mainly on two dimensionless parameters: the mean block length to green
   ratio and the mean red to green ratio. The theory is validated with an
   exact traffic simulation and with the empirical data from the city of
   Yokohama. It is also shown that the effect of buses can be approximated

Abstract = {{In this study, key components of combined cycles designed for waste
   energy recovery from automobile engines have been virtually designed for
   being light weight, small sized without compromising strengths, and
   based on integration with the existing components of an automobile.
   Originally a simulation was performed to examine the amount of waste
   energy that could be recovered and the consequential increase in the
   overall thermal efficiency through the use of Kalina, ethanol and steam
   cycles using Engineering Equation Solver software under typical engine
   operating conditions. It was found that steam cycle was better for
   recovering energy from the exhaust gas at the higher temperature range
   (689 C to 160 C) and Kalina cycle was better for recovering energy from
   the exhaust gas and the cooling water at the lower temperature range
   (122 C to 80 C) among the three cycles. It was found that using this
   combination of cycles about 5 kW of power could be extracted from the
   wasted energy. The next thing was to determine the amount of space,
   weight and design to incorporate a system of cycles like this with an
   automobile. The combined cycle generation, a process widely used in
   existing power plants, has become a viable option for automotive
   applications due to advances in materials science, nanotechnology, and
   MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems) devices. Critical components of
   the best performing cycles have been designed using computer aided
   engineering for the minimization of weight and space, and integration
   with the typical components of an automobile.}},

Abstract = {{Residential rooftops offer attractive options for solar arrays since it
   makes productive use of otherwise unused space and are co-located with
   residential demand. However, the current installation practice in the
   solar panel industry is based on code (ASCE-7) that is intended to
   estimate the design wind loads on buildings and roofs and is not
   intended to apply to roof mounted solar arrays. Conservative mounting
   approaches are likely to result in over designed and expensive mounting
   systems, while less conservative methods may jeopardize the integrity of
   the whole system and safety of the surrounding structure. One of the
   major challenges of producing affordable. energy form solar photovoltaic
   arrays is the cost of the installation. Thus, understanding wind-induced
   aerodynamic loads in arrays of solar panels is an important part of
   designing appropriate mounting systems. This study addresses the wind
   load on a 1:12 scale model of a moderate (83.6 m(2)) residential
   structure with a roof pitch of 26.5 degrees with two arrays of solar
   panels on one side. The wind angle is varied from 0 to 360 degrees to
   address front and back roof-mounted arrays. The flow is simulated using
   the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and k - epsilon turbulent
   model. The wind load is estimated from numerically obtained wind-induced
   pressure coefficients. The model result is also compared to a roof with
   no panels. Depending on the air flow direction, complex maximum and
   minimum pressure locations are identified where the panels are exposed
   to extreme conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Slow crack growth (SCG) is a common failure mode in underground
   polyethylene (PE) piping which was designed for 50-year services. It had
   been revealed by experiments that the SCG process is caused by
   continuous propagation of the craze zone at the crack tip through the
   bulk material. However, the mechanism of SCG failure has not been
   understood clearly. The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is found
   to be an effective tool for locally non-smooth features (voids, cracks,
   etc.) in solid or fluid mechanics solutions. In this paper the time
   dependent property of PE was considered, a viscoelastic constitutive
   model was used for the bulk material. To represent the material
   deterioration during SCG, a damage model was developed for the craze
   zone. Combined with the XFEM, the process of the Pennsylvania Notched
   Test (PENT), which had been widely applied for characterizing resistance
   of SCG for PE pipes or resins, was analyzed based on the proposed finite
   element (FE) model containing the two constitutive models. The numerical
   results were then compared with the experimental data in literatures. It
   showed that the failure time and final notch angle were in agreement
   with the experimental observations. Based on the verified FE model,
   strain distributions along the boundary of the crack were studied and
   the shortcomings of this model were discussed.}},

   SP for 10 \% and 30 \% MK substitutions were determined based on mini

   the effects of SPs on setting time, hydration kinetics, and strength
   development were measured. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out
   on different cement compositions used in this study to evaluate the
   greenhouse gas emissions and embodied energy of limestone-metakaolin
   blended cement with SP addition. While MK substitution decreases the
   workability of samples and shortens the setting time, this study shows
   that adequate dosages of a compatible type of SP can be used to
   compensate for these effects. Of the SPs examined, PCE and PMS are found

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using 3D printing
   technique to create functional graded shape memory polymers (SMPs) with
   both spontaneous and sequential shape recovery abilities. The created
   SMP components, with properly assigned spatial variation of the
   thermodynamical property distribution, react rapidly to a thermal
   stimulus, and return to a specified configuration in a precisely
   controlled shape changing sequence. The use of the 3D printing technique
   enables a manufacturing routine with merits of easy implementation,
   large design freedom, and high printing resolution, which promises to
   advance immediate engineering applications for low-cost, rapid, and mass
   production. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in microscopy imaging and genomics have created an
   explosion of patient data in the pathology domain. Whole-slide images
   (WSIs) of tissues can now capture disease processes as they unfold in
   high resolution, recording the visual cues that have been the basis of
   pathologic diagnosis for over a century. Each WSI contains billions of
   pixels and up to a million or more microanatomic objects whose
   appearances hold important prognostic information. Computational image
   analysis enables the mining of massive WSI datasets to extract
   quantitative morphologic features describing the visual qualities of
   patient tissues. When combined with genomic and clinical variables, this
   quantitative information provides scientists and clinicians with
   insights into disease biology and patient outcomes. To facilitate
   interaction with this rich resource, we have developed a web-based
   machine-learning framework that enables users to rapidly build
   classifiers using an intuitive active learning process that minimizes
   data labeling effort. In this paper we describe the architecture and
   design of this system, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
   quantification of glioma brain tumors.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the use of electronic healthcare reimbursement claims (EHRC)

   Further, by analyzing over 1 billion EHRCs, we track patterns of
   clinical procedures administered to patients with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD), heart disease (HD) and breast cancer (BC) using
   sequential pattern mining algorithms. Our analyses reveal that in
   contrast to treating HD and BC, clinical procedures for ASD diagnoses
   are highly varied leading up to and after the ASD diagnoses. The
   discovered clinical procedure sequences also reveal significant
   differences in the overall costs incurred across different parts of the
   US, indicating a lack of consensus amongst practitioners in treating ASD
   patients. We show that a data-driven approach to understand clinical
   trajectories using EHRC can provide quantitative insights into how to

Abstract = {{Compressed sparse row (CSR) is a frequently used format for sparse
   matrix storage. However, the state-of-the-art CSR-based sparse
   matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) implementations on CUDA-enabled GPUs
   do not exhibit very high efficiency. This has motivated the development
   of some alternative storage formats for GPU computing. Unfortunately,
   these alternatives are incompatible with most CPU-centric programs and
   require dynamic conversion from CSR at runtime, thus incurring
   significant computational and storage overheads. We present LightSpMV, a
   novel CUDA-compatible SpMV algorithm using the standard CSR format,
   which achieves high speed by benefiting from the fine-grained dynamic
   distribution of matrix rows over warps/vectors. In LightSpMV, two
   dynamic row distribution approaches have been investigated at the vector
   and warp levels with atomic operations and warp shuffle functions as the
   fundamental building blocks. We have evaluated LightSpMV using various
   sparse matrices and further compared it to the CSR-based SpMV
   subprograms in the state-of-the-art CUSP and cuSPARSE libraries.
   Performance evaluation reveals that on the same Tesla K40c GPU,
   LightSpMV is superior to both CUSP and cuSPARSE, with a speedup of up to
   2.60 and 2.63 over CUSP, and up to 1.93 and 1.79 over cuSPARSE for
   single and double precision, respectively. LightSpMV is available at
   http://lightspmv.sourceforge.net.}},

Abstract = {{Swirling flows exhibit a variety of unsteady fluid mechanic features,
   including large scale vortical structures and precessing recirculation
   zones. This paper considers the specific influence of precession on the
   relationship between time-averaged and instantaneous flow and flame
   features. The objective of this study is to aid in developing insight
   into high fidelity computations or experimental results. In particular,
   we describe how certain topological features in the time-averaged flow,
   such as centerline axial jets, centerline stagnation points, and
   symmetry of the flow about the centerline are influenced by precession.
   Insight is built by presenting results from a simplified model of a
   two-zone flow, consisting of a precessing reverse flow region embedded
   in a positive axial flow. A particularly significant result of this work
   is in regards to aerodynamically stabilized flames, which rely on the
   low velocity interior stagnation points in the vortex breakdown region
   for flame stabilization. We show how precession causes systematic
   differences between the location of the stagnation point of the
   time-averaged velocity and the time-averaged position of the
   instantaneous stagnation point. Indeed, an important implication of this
   point is that a perfect prediction of the time-averaged flow field could
   still lead to a completely erroneous time-averaged flame position
   prediction. Finally, we discuss the influence of precession and coherent
   motion on convergence of estimated averaged quantities.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the autoignition of a Jet-A fuel spray in a
   preheated air flow in a 75 mm inner diameter quartz tube at atmospheric
   pressure. Fuel was injected via a pressure-swirl atomizing injector
   enclosed in an aerodynamically-shaped outer body (7 mm diameter) that is
   installed coaxially with the flow using 3 water-cooled pylons. The air
   temperature and oxygen content were in the range of 1000 - 1400 K and
   9-12\%, respectively by controlling the equivalence ratio in the primary
   zone of the pre-burner/vitiator and by adding dilution air downstream.
   The co-flow air velocity ranged from 25 - 30 m/s for this study (Re =
   10,000 - 12,000), with a trapezoidal profile. Fuel spray was
   characterized using PDPA. Shape of the spray was transitional between
   hollow and solid cone with the corner angle of 350 to the axis near
   injector which reduced to 22 downstream. Spray density varied
   significantly over cross-section of the tube with the minimum on the
   axes. Droplets produced have average diameters (D-10) of 15 - 70 mu m on
   the axes and periphery, respectively, at 6 cm downstream from the
   injector Character of the droplet size distribution was polydisperse.
   Auto-ignition time delays were captured using a time-averaged camera
   with CH{*} (432 nm) filter The measured values agree with delay times
   previously reported in literature. Two synchronized high-speed cameras
   with 432 nm and 307 nm filters were used to investigate dynamics of
   auto-ignition kernel initiation and convection by capturing of CH{*} and
   OH{*} chemiluminescence at 5000 fps. This methodology allowed
   qualitative characterization of the equivalence ratio of kernels in
   process of their convection and growth. It was shown that kernels are
   always initiated on the axes of the spray where the average droplet size
   is minimum. Kernels were formed leaner and become richer as they grow
   down-stream as indicated by the increase of CH{*}/OH{*}intensity ratio.
   Additionally, kernel behavior depends greatly on air temperature with
   kernels transitioning from randomly appearing (i.e. single kernel), to
   periodic, to a constantly auto-igniting flame with the spatial scatter
   of ignition kernels decreasing with temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The reduction of particulate matter emissions is becoming a requirement
   for aircraft turbine engine combustor design. This requirement leads to
   the need to estimate particulate emissions during the conceptual design
   phase. Current prediction methods are based on detailed numerical
   simulation techniques such as CFD, which are unsuitable for conceptual
   design due to high computational cost.
   This paper introduces a new approach employing a semi empirical model
   for prediction of the soot emission indices of RQL combustors. The
   proposed approach dramatically improves computational efficiency by
   avoiding complex numerical calculations.
   The model is based on the response surface developed from experimental
   data for turbulent non-premixed flames. The data has been extracted from
   the literature, employing statistical methods such as machine learning
   techniques and polynomial regressions to apply the turbulent flame data
   to the actual operating conditions in the primary zone of aircraft
   engine combustors.
   The model is developed by first representing the combustor primary zone
   by chemical reactor networks constructed in CHEMKIN based on a
   statistical PDF approach to simulate the non -uniform distribution of
   time -evolving local mixture fraction with a beta distribution. The
   reactor networks are used to estimate the concentrations of soot
   precursor species in the rich zone. The empirical equations are then
   used with the predicted concentrations to predict the soot foimation
   rate. Finally, these results are used along with the turbulent non
   premixed flame data to develop the final model through a model
   calibration process.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms and physics of flame stabilization and
   blowoff of premixed flames is critical towards the design of high
   velocity combustion devices. In the high bulk flow velocity situation
   typical of practical combustors, the flame anchors in shear layers where
   the local flow velocities are much lower. Within the shear layer, fluid
   strain deformation rates are very high and the flame can be subjected to
   significant stretch levels. The main goal of this work was to
   characterize the flow and stretch conditions that a premixed flame
   experiences in a practical combustor geometry and to compare these
   values to calculated extinction values. High resolution, simultaneous
   PIV and CH-PLIF measurements are used to capture the flame edge and
   near-field stabilization region. When approaching lean limit extinction
   conditions, we note characteristic changes in the stretch and flow
   conditions experienced by the flame. Most notably, the flame becomes
   less critically stretched when fuel/air ratio is decreased. However, at
   these lean conditions, the flame is subject to higher mean flow
   velocities at the edge, suggesting less favorable flow conditions are
   present at the attachment point of the flame as blowoff is approached.
   These measurements suggest that blowoff of the flame from the shear
   layer is not directly stretch extinction induced, but rather the result
   of an imbalance between the speed of the flame edge and local tangential
   flow velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse engineering whole-genome networks from large-scale gene
   expression measurements and analyzing them to extract biologically valid
   hypotheses are important challenges in systems biology. While simpler
   models easily scale to large number of genes and gene expression

   scale of applicability. In this talk, I will present our research on the
   development of parallel mutual information and Bayesian network based
   structure learning methods to eliminate such bottlenecks and facilitate
   genome-scale network inference. As a demonstration, we reconstructed
   genome-scale networks of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana from
   11,700 microarray experiments using 1.57 million cores of the Tianhe-2
   Supercomputer. Such networks can be used as a guide to predicting gene

Abstract = {{The discovery of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from next-generation
   sequencing (NGS) data typically works by aligning reads to a given
   genome and then creating an alignment map to interpret the presence of
   SNVs. Various approaches have been developed to call whether germline
   SNVs (or SNPs) in normal cells or somatic SNVs in cancer/tumor cells.
   Nonetheless, efficient callers for both germline and somatic SNVs have
   not yet been extensively investigated. In this paper, we present
   SNVSnifTer, an integrated caller for germline and somatic SNVs from NGS
   data based on Bayesian probabilistic models. In SNVSnifTer, our germline
   SNV calling models allele counts per site as a multinomial conditional
   distribution. Meanwhile, our somatic SNV calling relies on NGS
   tumor-normal sample pairs, and introduces a hybrid approach combining a
   subtraction approach with a joint sample analysis which models
   tumor-normal allele counts per site as a joint multinomial conditional
   distribution. Moreover, we investigate a lightweight tumor purity
   estimation approach, which demonstrates high accuracy on synthetic
   tumors. Compared to some leading SNP callers (SAMtools, GATK and FaSD)
   and somatic SNV callers (VarScan2, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2, MuTect),
   SNVSnifTer demonstrates comparable or even better accuracy at faster
   speed. SVNSniffer, the synthetic tumor-normal data and the supplementary
   information are available at http://snvsniffer.sourceforge.net.}},

Abstract = {{Sliding window correlation (SWC) is one of the most popular methods to
   study the dynamics of functional connectivity from resting-state
   functional MRI scans. These scanned signals are often non-stationary and
   normally bandpass filtered before the SWC analysis, so there are more
   than one frequency component present in the correlating signals. In this
   paper we study the effects of two frequencies in such signals by
   extending the findings of an earlier study that considered only a single
   frequency. Although the fluctuations in the SWC are reduced when the
   length of the window approaches the minimum window length, as reported
   in the earlier study, but the ability of the SWC to give the stationary
   correlation value dependents on the ratio of the two frequencies rather
   than the minimum frequency only. Furthermore, some undesirable
   components other than the modulating frequency would be extracted from
   non-stationary analysis under certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{With faster switching speed and much lower conduction and switching
   losses, Silicon-Carbide (SiC) semiconductor devices are nowadays gaining
   more favor in power converters applications. 1200 V and 1700 V SiC
   MOSFETs are commercially available, which enables more efficient and
   compact design of high power rated converters. However, the high di/dt
   and dv/dt associated with fast switching as well as the circuit
   parasitic elements raise various issues. In this paper, a double-pulse
   characterization fixture is built to test a 1200 V/100 A SiC device,
   from which the high speed switching issues, including device current and
   voltage resonances and spikes, gate terminal resonance, cross-talk, gate
   driver noise, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), are presented. All
   the switching waveform resonances and their associated parasitic
   elements are exploited and explained. Results show that due to these
   issues, the devices are prevented from full utilization of either the
   safe operation area (SOA) or the maximum switching speed. Finally, the
   device model considering all the parasitic elements is tested with a
   soft-switching circuit-resonant DC link converter, showing that the
   above stated issues are significantly mitigated.}},

Abstract = {{The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most
   promising converter topologies for medium/high-power applications. As
   the MMC is structured based upon stacking up of a number of
   series-connected identical SubModules (SMs), to improve its fault
   tolerance and reliability, SM failure detection and location is of
   significant importance. In this paper, two SM-failure detection and
   location methods are proposed, i.e., a clustering algorithm (CA)-based
   method and a calculated capacitance (CC)-based method. In the proposed
   CA-based method, a pattern recognition-based fault diagnosis approach is
   developed, which employs the clustering algorithm to detect and locate
   the faulty SMs with open-switch failures through identifying the pattern
   of two-dimensional trajectories of the SM characteristic variables. The
   proposed CC-based method is based on calculation and comparison of a
   physical component parameter, i.e., the nominal SM capacitance, and is
   capable of failure detection, location, and classification within one
   stage. Performance of the proposed failure detection methods for an MMC
   system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the
   PSCAD/ENITDC software environment. The reported study results
   demonstrate the capabilities of the two proposed methods in detecting
   and locating any SM failure under various conditions accurately and
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an improved signal-injection-based stator-winding
   thermal-monitoring method for field-oriented-controlled (FOC) induction
   motors. In this method, stator-winding DC resistance is normally used as
   a direct indicator of winding temperature, and is obtained from injected
   DC currents and voltages in the motor winding. Conventionally, however,
   implementation of this DC-injection method causes low-frequency torque
   ripple, which is undesired especially for high-performance motor
   applications and becomes a major disadvantage of this type of
   thermal-monitoring scheme. This paper takes advantage of the flexibility
   of the FOC scheme and proposes an improved method with a form of
   injection that compensates the torque ripple by adding second harmonic
   currents. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the
   low-frequency torque ripple is successfully mitigated, and accurate
   temperature estimate is guaranteed under various motor operating

Abstract = {{Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) technology is a potential solution in
   battery charging of electrical vehicles (EV). However, problems of
   varied magnetic coupling caused by coil misalignment still limit its
   practical applications. Besides improvements of inductive chargers, the
   EV manufacturers need a standard on the power-receiving part for
   adaptive charging in various conditions. Accordingly, this paper
   proposes design of an on-board charger, which cooperates with the
   previously proposed universal inductive charger (UIC), for more
   universal, efficient and safe EV charging in various coupling and load
   conditions. The optimal design of the secondary LC circuit and the
   receiving pad is provided. A simple and low-cost control method based on
   the dual-mode operation of the DC-DC converter is applied, to coordinate
   with the UIC for more accurate control on the frequency and voltage.
   Simulation results and a prototype validate the proposed on-board
   charger is robust and applicable, and performs better for universal

Abstract = {{Load balancing of tasks across processing nodes is critical for
   achieving speed up on large scale clusters. Load balancing schemes
   typically detect the imbalance and then migrate the load from an
   overloaded processing node to an idle or lightly loaded processing node
   and thus, estimation of load critically affects the performance of load
   balancing schemes. On large scale clusters, the latency of load
   migration between processing nodes (and the energy) is also a
   significant overhead and any missteps in load estimation can cause
   significant migrations and performance losses. Currently, the load
   estimation is done either by profile or feedback driven approaches in
   sophisticated systems such as Charm++, but such approaches must be
   re-thought in light of some workloads such as Adaptive Mesh Refinement
   (AMR) and multiscale physics where the load variations could be quite
   dynamic and rapid. In this work we propose a compiler based framework
   which performs precise prediction of the forthcoming workload. The
   compiler driven load prediction technique performs static analysis of a
   task and derives an expression to predict load of a task and hoists it
   as early as possible in the control flow of execution. The compiler also
   inserts corrector expressions at strategic program points which refine
   the reachability probability of the load as well as its estimation. The
   predictor and the corrector expressions are evaluated at runtime and the
   predicted load information is refined as the execution proceeds and is
   eventually used by load balancer to take efficient migration decisions.
   We present an implementation of the above in the Rose compiler and the
   Charm++ parallel programming framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the framework on some key benchmarks that exhibit dynamic variations
   and show how the compiler framework assists load balancing schemes in
   Charm++ to provide significant gains.}},

Abstract = {{The speed at which a slung load can be carried under an aircraft is
   often limited by the onset of divergent oscillations. Simulations using
   highly-resolved airloads maps are described, in an effort to determine
   divergence speed. Airloads are obtained using the Continuous Rotation
   technique, which converts the discrete attitude static airload
   measurements problem to a periodic problem amenable to closed-form
   analytical description. Free-swing tests of scaled models are performed
   in a wind tunnel with and without initial perturbations, to capture
   quantitative and qualitative records from encoders and from video, also
   capturing the likely modes that amplify. Results are presented for a
   cuboid and a porous box, the latter with and without one side closed.
   The roll divergence mechanism, the coupling of roll and yaw frequency,
   seen in swing tests is clearly observed in simulations run on the
   cuboid, both when yaw is forced and when the model is free.}},

   keyword-aware grammar for LVCSR-based keyword search using weight

   n-gram WFSA. Tested on the evalpart1 data of the IARPA Babel OpenKWS13
   Vietnamese and OpenKWS14 Tamil limited-language pack tasks, the
   experimental results indicate the proposed keyword-aware framework
   achieves significant improvement, with about 50\% relative actual term
   weighted value (ATWV) enhancement for both languages. Comparisons
   between the keyword-aware grammar and our previously proposed n-gram LM
   based approximation approach for the grammar also show that the KWS
   performances of these two realizations are complementary.}},

   relies solely on visual cues on the spectrogram, without the need for
   language-specific training data. The results are evaluated on the TIMIT
   corpus, and compared to other unsupervised speech segmentation
   techniques, with comparable results obtained. We also fuse the results
   with those obtained by hidden Markov models (HMM) and HMM-based forced
   alignment to investigate if image features can provide an additional
   feature representation for speech processing tasks. With the fusion, up
   to 10\% absolute improvement in segmentation accuracy over the HMM
   baselines can be obtained. Results are promising and suggests a strong
   potential for image-based features applying to speech processing.}},

Abstract = {{The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP) is a typical
   non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem, which has wide
   engineering applications, and performs an important function in
   manufacturing fields. In this paper, an improved shuffled complex
   evolution algorithm with opposition-based learning (SCE-OBL) was
   proposed to obtain the optimal makespan for permutation flow shop
   scheduling. The OBL strategy was used to improve the population quality
   and accelerate the convergence speed. The theoretical analysis
   demonstrated that the improved algorithm converged to optimum with a
   probability of 1. Moreover, the largest-order-value mechanism was used
   in the combinational optimisation problem to change the variables in the
   continuous domain to discrete variables, and job-based representation
   was adopted for encoding the solution of the PFSP. Twenty-nine typical
   instances were then used to test the performance of the SCE-OBL, and the
   computational results showed that the SCE-OBL algorithm could obtain
   better solutions for the PFSP than other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel approach to directly integrate equivalent
   circuit models of vias in a 2D finite-differences frequency-domain

   serves two main purposes. First, it improves the accuracy of simulation
   results by modeling the modification of the local electric field in the
   vicinity of the via barrel. Second, it provides the coupling between
   different cavities, thus allowing to represent and solve a multilayer
   structure in a single 2D-FDFD system. In comparison to a related
   approach recently suggested in the literature, the procedure in this
   paper has two main advantages: First, it allows taking into account via
   barrel-to-plane capacitances at the proper positions in the equivalent
   circuit model, thus providing modeling accuracy. Second, its application
   to arbitrary numbers of cavities is straightforward. Both points are
   demonstrated with examples, showing good agreement to full-wave results

Abstract = {{Licensed-assisted access (LAA) has been developed to improve LTE system
   capacity by using unlicensed bands. However, the energy efficiency (EE)
   of the LTE system may be degraded by LAA since unlicensed bands are
   generally less energy-efficient than licensed hands. In this paper, we
   investigate the EE optimization of LAA systems. We first develop a
   criterion to determine whether unlicensed bands can be leveraged to
   improve the EE of LAA systems. We prove that unlicensed bands can be
   used to improve the EE only when the allocated licensed resource blocks
   (RBs) are not enough. We then investigate how to jointly allocate
   licensed and unlicensed RBs to achieve EE fairness among small cell base
   stations (SBSs), based on the Nash bargaining solution. Numerical
   results are presented to confirm our analysis and to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate mode selection for coordinated multi-point
   (CoMP) transmission in downlink LTE-A networks, where inter-cluster
   interference exists. The proposed scheme selects the single-cell (SC) or
   coordinated beainforming (CB) transmission mode according to
   interference level to maximize the weighted sum rate with fairness
   consideration. To formulate the optimization problem, an approximated
   closed-form expression for the achievable rate is derived by modeling
   the probability distributions of signal and interference powers as Gamma
   distributions. Since the original optimization problem is a
   combinatorial and non-convex one with high complexity, a low-complexity
   and sub-optimal algorithm is proposed, which first performs coordinated
   cell selection and then transmission mode selection. Simulation results
   show that the closed-form approximation of the achievable rate is very
   tight and the proposed mode selection scheme can improve the average
   system throughput by 13\% and the 10th percentile user throughput by
   10\% compared with the existing scheme.}},

Abstract = {{LTE/LTE-A networks have been successfully providing advanced broadband
   services to millions of users worldwide. Lately, it has been suggested
   to use LTE networks for mission-critical applications like public
   safety, smart grid and military communications. We have previously shown
   that LTE networks are vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DOS) and loss of
   service attacks from smart jammers. In this paper, we extend our
   previous work on resilience of LTE networks to wideband multipath fading
   channel, SINR estimation in frequency domain and computation of
   utilities based on observable parameters under the framework of
   single-shot and repeated games with asymmetric information. In a
   single-shot game formulation, network utility is severely compromised at
   its solutions, i.e. at the Nash Equilibria (NE). We propose evolved
   repeated-game strategy algorithms to combat smart jamming attacks that
   can be implemented in existing deployments using current technology.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C is a major public health problem in the United States and
   worldwide. Outbreaks of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections associated
   with unsafe injection practices, drug diversion, and other exposures to
   blood are difficult to detect and investigate. Molecular analysis has
   been frequently used in the study of HCV outbreaks and transmission
   chains; helping identify a cluster of sequences as linked by
   transmission if their genetic distances are below a previously defined
   threshold.
   However, HCV exists as a population of numerous variants in each
   infected individual and it has been observed that minority variants in
   the source are often the ones responsible for transmission, a situation
   that precludes the use of a single sequence per individual because many
   such transmissions would be missed.
   The use of Next- Generation Sequencing immensely increases the
   sensitivity of transmission detection but brings a considerable
   computational challenge because all sequences need to be compared among
   all pairs of samples. For instance, our relatively small dataset of 401
   samples, a total of 80200 pairwise sample comparisons must be performed,
   which account for 4.56 x 1010 pairwise sequence comparisons. We present
   a fast and efficient three- step filtering strategy that removes 85.1\%
   of all the pairwise sample comparisons and 91.0\% of all pairwise
   sequence comparisons, accurately establishing which pairs of HCV samples
   are below the relatedness threshold This electronic document is a ``
   live{''} template and already defines the components of your paper

Abstract = {{This paper exploits the possibility of the 3D printing for microwave
   sensor purposes. Because of the complex shapes allowed by this emerging
   technology, a fully-custom microfluidic sensor can be embedded directly

   sensor design can be achieved together with a reduction of the
   manufacturing time, costs and overall complexity of the sensor. 3D
   printed microwave devices are very attractive for the future generation
   of Wireless Sensor Networks and of the Internet of Things. The proposed
   microfluidic sensor exploits the substrate integrated waveguide
   technology to keep high the quality factor and to merge the requirements
   of planar integration of further blocks. The aim of this sensor is a
   real time characterization of fluids across the lower UWB frequency
   band. The design, a first prototype and measurements are shown to
   exhibit the potentiality of this technique.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates, for the first time, implementation of a V-band
   end-fire Yagi-Uda antenna on an ultra-thin (100um) glass substrate
   (epsilon(r) = 5.3). The quasi Yagi-Uda antenna is chosen because of its
   small form factor (lambda(0)/2 x lambda(0)/2). The center frequency of
   the antenna is 53 GHz. The fabricated antenna-on-glass shows good
   performance with 3.1 dBi of measured gain and 3 GHz of 10-dB impedance
   bandwidth. H-plane Co-pol and Cross-pol radiation patterns were measured
   at 53 GHz. All measurements are in close agreement with simulated
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium nitride (GaN) amplifiers are inherently well suited for high
   power applications, but their increased power densities call for high
   thermal conductivity (k) substrates, such as copper (Cu) or aluminum
   nitride (AlN), to provide adequate thermal management. Thus,
   low-cost/low-k substrates, such as organics, have been traditionally
   overlooked for GaN-based amplifiers. In this paper, an encapsulated
   package is investigated to circumvent the thermal limitations of liquid
   crystal polymer (LCP), one such organic, while leveraging its multilayer
   and microwave advantages. An X-band GaN PA in such a package has been
   designed and fabricated, showing a PAE of 38\% and PSAT of 5.4W under CW
   operation, or 49\% PAE and 7W PSAT at 50\% duty cycle.}},

   separation methods to isolate the vocal component from the background
   accompaniment for a song mix. This paper discusses the methods of

   MUSHRA test is used to get the human perceptual ratings for the outputs
   of various SVS algorithms, which are correlated with widely used

Abstract = {{Power system operational and economic challenges are raised from
   increasing penetration of variable energy sources. Reliable operation of
   transmission and distribution systems with high penetration of renewable
   resources can be achieved using storage. In this paper, a flexible
   AC-OPF dispatch algorithm (F-OPF) is presented and two different types
   of storage devices are considered to address the problem: battery
   storage and pumped hydro storage. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
   are located in the transmission level and Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV)
   batteries in the distribution level. Different percentage scenarios of
   storage devices and renewable sources are tested on the IEEE 24 bus
   system. Wind and solar sources and storage devices are considered in
   specific buses in the standard 24 bus system. The impact of different
   penetration levels of renewables and storage is examined and the total
   operational cost of the system is calculated by the F-OPF. A
   predetermined day-ahead schedule is used for all generation units and
   storage devices and kept constant for all different scenarios of
   penetration for comparison purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Phase inductance is a key parameter in switched reluctance motor (SRM)
   design because torque and the dynamics of phase voltages and currents
   are directly related to inductance. Therefore, accurate calculation of
   the inductance at arbitrary rotor positions is important in determining
   the SRM behavior. Contrary to the popular but time-consuming approach to
   determine the flux linkage and inductance of a SRM with finite element
   analysis (FEA), this paper proposes a novel analytical solution based on
   the partial differential equations of magnetic potentials to calculate
   the inductance profile of a 4/2 SRM with respect to rotor position,
   which makes the inductance prediction more time-efficient. The accuracy
   of this method is validated by comparing its estimated inductance
   profile to the inductance obtained by FEA.}},

Abstract = {{The control process of many inverter-based systems requires having d-
   and q-axis currents which have been calculated through a
   microprocessor-based system. This paper presents a new technique able to
   direct measure those currents through a non-magnetic current sensor
   called a Rogowski coil. The basic idea behind this technique is to
   design a suitable integrator circuit for the coil to convert the actual
   current passing through it into a proper voltage that indicates the
   values of its d-and q-axis components. The proposed configuration of the
   coil and its associated integrator circuit is analyzed and discussed in
   detail in this paper. A simulation study proves how the proposed method
   could provide real-time measurement capability.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conditioning is a key component in the lifespan and efficiency
   of an induction machine, and appropriate thermal monitoring methods
   could help lengthen the lifetime of induction machines. The installation
   and purchase of potentially expensive and perishable temperature sensors
   are not the best option for manufacturers and businesses in today's
   competitive market. This paper thus proposes a non-intrusive method for
   thermal estimation of induction motors operating under open-loop
   controlled systems widely used in industry. By superimposing dc values
   onto the three-phase voltage commands, the dc signal is injected into
   the stator windings of the induction machine. The stator winding
   temperature could thus be estimated upon the extraction of a dc
   resistance. This method is efficient and non-intrusive because it does
   not disturb the normal operations of the induction motor, nor does it
   involve any hardware changes. Also, this method is time efficient
   because the resistance and temperature estimations can be calculated
   within seconds after the injection has been made. The effectiveness of
   the proposed method is illustrated by simulations conducted under
   various motor conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of the parameters for a photovoltaic (PV) module is an
   important part in the PV module modeling process. The PV module
   parameters include the series and shunt resistances, the leakage
   currents, the ideality constants, and the PV module solar dependent
   current. The significance of the PV module parameters is underscored
   when the high fidelity replication of the behavior of a given PV module
   is desired. Most PV modules come with a datasheet, which contains key
   information about the PV module. Some of the data on the PV module
   datasheet include the maximum power point voltage and current of the PV
   module, the short circuit current, and the open circuit voltage. Also
   found on the datasheet are the current and voltage temperature
   coefficients. However, without accurate knowledge of the PV parameters,
   obtaining the operating points provided on the PV module datasheet, such
   as open circuit voltage and maximum power point voltage and current is
   difficult. The number of parameters to be determined for the PV module
   is dependent on the model of PV module that is used. The simplest model
   of the PV module is the one-diode model, followed by the two-diode
   model, and then the three-diode model. The two-diode PV array model is
   widely used in the PV array model development, and this two-diode model
   is the focus of this paper. Current publications that propose methods of
   extracting the PV module parameters make several simplifications. The
   goal of these simplifications is to make the two-diode PV model
   observable. The proposed PV module parameter extraction method in this
   paper is the method of an optimized Fibonacci search, and the Steepest
   Descent method. Using these methods, no simplifications are made, and
   accurate results as compared with data measurements from an actual PV
   module, are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous-rotation testing technique is applied to capture the
   variation of aerodynamic loads with attitude on objects of arbitrary
   shape. The technique converts the problem of measuring static air loads
   at various attitudes into a periodic problem. Phase-resolved
   ensemble-averaging is used to capture load variations with arbitrarily
   fine azimuthal resolution. The airload variations are obtained in closed
   form as discrete Fourier series. Experiments on a `cylinder model of
   equal length and diameter were used to study the ability to capture
   asymmetries, and resolve support interference issues. A closed cuboid is
   used to correlate with prior work. A flat plate with a central
   cylindrical load, and a porous box are also studied. Free-swing tests
   using rigid tethers fixed to a pitch-yaw-roll gimbal mount are used to
   derive dynamic behavior in a free stream. The cylinder results showed
   the ability to resolve the effect of minor geometric asymmetries on
   airloads. The flat plate at 10 degrees pitch shows strong differences in
   dynamics between cases with a rounded versus squared off edge facing the
   freestream. The porous box shows the differences between cases with and
   without one side blocked.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulating suspended neutrally buoyant colloidal particles of radii a
   = O(0.1 mu m-1 mu m) near solid surfaces, or walls, is a key technology
   in various microfluidics devices. These particles, suspended in an
   aqueous solution at rest near a solid surface, or wall, are subject to
   wall-normal ``lift{''} forces described by the DLVO theory of colloid
   science. The particles experience additional lift forces, however, when
   suspended in a flowing solution. A fundamental understanding of such
   lift forces could therefore lead to new methods for the transport and
   self-assembly of particles near and on solid surfaces.
   Various studies have reported repulsive electroviscous and hydrodynamic
   lift forces on colloidal particles in Poiseuille flow (with a constant
   shear (gamma) over dot rate near the wall) driven by a pressure
   gradient. A few studies have also observed repulsive
   dielectrophoretic-like lift forces in electroosmotic (EO) flows driven
   by electric fields.
   Recently, evanescent-wave particle tracking has been used to quantify
   near-wall lift forces on a = 125 nm-245 nm polystyrene (PS) particles
   suspended in a monovalent electrolyte solution in EO flow, Poiseuille
   flow, and combined Poiseuille and EO flow through similar to 30 mu m
   deep fused-silica channels. In Poiseuille flow, the repulsive lift force
   appears to be proportional to (gamma) over dot, a scaling consistent
   with hydrodynamic, vs. electroviscous, lift.
   In combined Poiseuille and EO flow, the lift forces can be repulsive or
   attractive, depending upon whether the EO flow is in the same or
   opposite direction as the Poiseuille flow, respectively. The magnitude
   of the force appears to be proportional to the electric field magnitude.
   Moreover, the force in combined flow exceeds the sum of the forces
   observed in EO flow for the same electric field or in Poiseuille flow
   for the same (gamma) over dot. Initial results also imply that this
   force, when repulsive, scales as (gamma) over dot(1/2) These results
   suggest that the lift force in combined flow is fundamentally different
   from electroviscous, hydrodynamic, or dielectrophoretic-like lift.
   Moreover, for the case when the EO flow opposes the Poiseuille flow, the
   particles self-assemble into dense stable periodic streamwise bands with
   an average width of similar to 6 mu m and a spacing of 2-4 times the
   band width when the electric field magnitude exceeds a threshold value.
   These results are described and reviewed here.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) is to
   improve the Air Traffic Management (ATM) and by considering National
   Airspace System (NAS). The business goals of the NAS' users flight and
   airspace restrictions, thereby operations more flexible and financially
   stable for those involved. During a CTOP, airlines can share their route
   preferences with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), combining delay
   and reroute. Considering that trajectory preferences will impact in the
   final sort to be assigned, how an airline could reduce its global delay
   achieving a better position to be assigned. Current solutions for this
   problem are based on Greedy methods. However, when a CTOP demand is
   initiated each airline might decide its TOS strategy without knowledge
   about other airline's flights. A Game Theory approach for single games
   (SG-CTOP) was proposed to improve the decision-making process. It was
   developed as an intelligence solution regarding the TOS strategy under
   involved uncertainty about airline competitors. A case study was
   conducted using real data from two airlines and 100 different CTOP
   demands called as SG-CTOP cycle. It was performed 100 SG-CTOP cycles to
   verify the SG-CTOP behavior by the time. The result analysis identified
   that when it was used the same strategy for every flight, after 100
   SG-CTOP cycles the best strategy was to send two trajectories option for
   each FCA plus a NOSLOT option to fly around, regarding a maximum
   assigned delay to fly through the FCA. This strategy achieved a global
   delay of 53\% less than NOSLOT strategy for every flight. When this
   strategy was compared with the proposed SG-CTOP model, Airline A would
   achieve a global delay less than, or equal, in 97\% of CTOP negotiations
   representing a delay reduction of 537 hours for the airline.}},

   Mentor GraphicsTM Calibres provides surface heat maps based on IC
   layout, material property, and geometric configuration files. Chiplets
   are connected by heterogeneous interconnect (HIC). Differences in
   thermal performance of GaN and InP chiplets are explored by varying the
   number of HICs. Two methods for building up the model of a test chip are
   compared. One method uses custom scripts to place discrete blocks in the
   model to represent HICs, while the other uses thermal material
   properties extracted from the layout. Measurements presented confirm
   simulated results.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for engineering/tailoring properties, specifically
   electrical properties, of polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposite films is
   examined by comprehensively studying process-structure-property
   relationships. This work focuses on investigating the effect of
   composite processing methods and conditions on the electrical response
   of exfoliated graphite nanoplatelet (GNP) / PLA films. GNP are
   incorporated into the PLA matrix either via polymer dissolution /
   solution casting or via melt compounding and fiber melt spinning /
   compression molding to produce films of similar to 160 mu m thickness.
   In order to investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the
   electrical response of the films, the melt compounded / compression
   molded films are either cooled rapidly (similar to 16 degrees C/min and
   denoted fast cooled or FC) or cooled slowly (similar to 0.4 degrees
   C/min and denoted slow cooled or SC) to alter the matrix crystallinity.
   Crystallinity and crystal structure of the composite films are
   investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). Mechanical properties are examined in tensile mode
   using a standard tension setup. Electrical properties of the films are
   examined using impedance spectroscopy (IS). The SC films percolated
   between 1 and 5wt\% of GNP, followed by the solution cast films which
   percolated between 5 and 8wt\% of GNP, and finally the FC films had the
   highest percolation between 12 and 15wt\% of GNP. Furthermore, the
   percolation of the solution cast films can be lowered to below 5wt\% of
   GNP by minimizing voids present in the films which can be done via
   compression. The differences in percolation can be attributed to
   differences in compounding technique and the polymer matrix
   crystallinity.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant off-chip interconnects can accommodate the differential
   displacement between dissimilar materials such as a silicon substrate
   and an organic board, and can decrease stresses in a microelectronic
   system. In this paper, we present the fabrication of an area-array of
   TriDelta compliant interconnects on a 6-inch silicon wafer using
   sequential processes. The design consists of about 2000 compliant
   interconnects at a 400-mu m pitch on each 18mmx18mm silicon substrate,
   and there are 32 substrates on a 6-inch wafer. The three arcuate beams
   of the compliant interconnects are the main parts that provide both the
   in-plane and out-of-plane compliance, and thus the arcuate beam width
   and thickness are the most important factor to be considered. DupontTM
   Riston (R) FX920 (thickness = 20 mu m) negative dry film photoresist is
   used in our study and the arcuate beam thickness is uniform throughout
   the pattern. However, by designing the arcuate beam width to be 10 mu m,
   15 mu m and 20 mu m, different compliance values can be achieved in the
   same or different substrates. The use of the dry film photoresist makes
   the fabrication process cost effective compared to the use of liquid
   film photoresist. The mechanical compliance of such fabricated compliant
   interconnects, intended as second-level interconnects, is presented in
   this work.}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature-glide (i.e., large difference in dew and bubble point
   temperature) zeotropic mixtures such as ammonia/water have the potential
   to improve efficiency as new working fluids in advanced energy cycles
   for heating, cooling and power. Furthermore, the high heat capacity of
   ammonia/water mixtures makes them particularly attractive for use in
   compact mini-and microchannel devices. The non isothermal condensation
   process of zeotropic mixtures leads to coupled heat and mass transfer
   resistances in each phase, which are not accounted for by
   single-component in-tube condensation modeling and correlation
   techniques. Previous attempts to design zeotropic condensers have relied
   on use of non equilibrium film theory or mixture resistance correction
   factors. The film theory models have been developed with many
   simplifying assumptions including annular flow, negligible condensate
   and vapor sensible heat loads, and/or laminar condensate film, while the
   correction factor approaches do not directly consider mass transfer
   resistances. In the present study of high-temperature-glide mixtures in
   small channels, these assumptions are relaxed, and a new design method
   for mini-and microchannel zeotropic condensers is introduced. The
   approach is validated with experiments conducted for a range of tube
   diameters (0.98 < D < 2.16 mm), mass fluxes (50 < G < 200 kg m(-2)
   s(-1)) and mass fractions of ammonia (0.80 < chi(bulk) < 0.96). The
   results can be used in the development of compact, highly efficient heat
   and mass transfer devices.}},

Abstract = {{Marangoni convection in a liquid layer subject to a horizontal
   temperature gradient due to variations in the surface tension at the
   liquid-vapor interface and confined in a rectangular enclosure is a
   basic problem of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, with applications in
   evaporative cooling. In general, surface tension increases as
   temperature decreases, giving rise to thermocapillary stresses that
   drive liquid coolant away from hot regions. In a volatile binary-fluid
   mixture, however, the two components can be chosen so that the surface
   tension of the mixture increases as temperature increases due to
   differential evaporation, giving rise to solutocapillary stresses that
   can drive liquid instead towards hot regions, and hence oppose the
   thermocapillary stresses.
   It is of course well-known that noncondensables suppress phase change.
   Yet there have been few, if any studies of how noncondensables affect
   the Marangoni convection of volatile binary fluids in a confined
   geometry, where evaporation and condensation must balance. An
   experimental study was therefore performed of Marangoni convection in a
   layer of methanol-water (MeOH-H2O) mixture confined in a sealed
   rectangular cuvette. The cuvette was symmetrically heated on one end and
   cooled on the other end using Peltier devices, giving temperature
   differences of similar to 6 degrees C over a horizontal distance of 4.9
   cm, and two-dimensional, two-component particle-image velocimetry (2D-2C
   PIV) was used to measure the velocity fields in this steady flow. The
   study focuses on convection in liquid layers with a depth of similar to
   0.3 cm (vs. a test cell height of 1 cm), and how this flow is affected
   by changes in the relative concentration of noncondensables (i.e., air)
   in the gas space above the liquid. The results suggest that changing the
   concentration of noncondensables, which also has a marked effect on the
   pressure, in the gas space, can be used to ``adjust{''} the relative
   importance of solutocapillary and thermocapillary stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Convection in confined layers of volatile liquids has been studied

   {[}1] have shown that removing most of the air from a sealed cavity
   significantly alters the flow structure and, in particular, suppresses
   transitions between the different convection patterns found at
   atmospheric conditions. Yet, at the same time, this has almost no effect
   on the flow speeds in the liquid layer. To understand these results, we
   have formulated and numerically implemented a detailed transport model
   that accounts for mass and heat transport in both phases as well as the
   phase change at the interface. Surprisingly, the numerical simulations
   show that noncondensables have a large effect on
   buoyancy-thermocapillary flow at concentrations even as low as 1\%,
   i.e., much lower than those achieved in experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The best possible program for geotechnical soils exploration involves a
   blend of rotary drilling, undisturbed sampling, laboratory testing,
   in-situ field tests, and geophysics, all taken within the context of
   engineering geology. Yet, this is only viable when sufficient
   allocations of time and funds are available, namely large or critical
   projects. Therefore, for routine site investigations, the use of hybrid
   geotechnical-geophysical methods should be adopted, including the
   seismic piezocone test(SCPTu) and seismic dilatometer (SDMTa), since
   they collect as many as five independent readings with depth, thereby
   optimizing the information gathered in an efficient, expeditious, and
   economical manner..}},

Abstract = {{Multiphase flow phenomena in single micro- and mini-channels have been
   widely studied. Characteristics of two-phase flow through a large array
   of microchannels are investigated here. An air-water mixture is used to
   represent the two phases flowing through a microchannel array
   representative of those employed in practical applications. Flow
   distribution of the air and water flow across 52 parallel microchannels
   of 0.3 mm hydraulic diameter is visually investigated using high speed
   photography. Two microchannel configurations are studied and compared,
   with mixing features incorporated into the second configuration. Slug
   and annular flow regimes are observed in the channels. Void fractions
   and interfacial areas are calculated for each channel from these
   observations. The flow distribution is tracked at various lengths along
   the microchannel array sheets. Statistical distributions of void
   fraction and interfacial area along the microchannel array are measured.
   The design with mixing features yields improved flow distribution. Void
   fraction and interfacial area change along the length of the second
   configuration, indicating a change in fluid distribution among the
   channels. The void fraction and interfacial area results are used to
   predict the performance of different microchannel array configurations
   for heat and mass transfer applications. Results from this study can
   help inform the design of compact thermal-fluid energy systems.}},

Abstract = {{Boiling systems are capable of dissipating high heat fluxes, and as such
   have potential applications in thermal management of high power
   microelectronics. Although there are a number of experimental
   investigations of flow boiling in small flow passages and several
   empirical correlations have been proposed, the computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) modeling of such systems is much less explored. In the
   present investigation, a phase-change model representing the heat and
   mass transfer is coupled with the volume of fluid (VOF) model for the
   transient analysis of flow boiling. The analyzed domain consists of a
   silicon microchannel with a finite substrate thickness, subjected to
   non-uniform heat fluxes at localized regions, providing with a more
   realistic scenario for the case of microelectronics power maps. The
   results show the strong effect on the two-phase flow characteristics for
   these configurations and visualization of the induced flow regimes is
   presented. Furthermore, discussion about the heat transfer mechanisms,
   challenges and possible solutions are given in order to provide
   guidelines for effective cooling of these devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides unambiguous velocity field proof that a strong edge
   vortex occurs on a rotating blade in reverse flow. The rotor blades of a
   helicopter encounter reverse flow during flight at high advance ratio.
   Reverse flow is a limiter in rotorcraft design with excursions in pitch
   link loads and bending moments. Stereo particle-image velocimetry is
   used on the flow under the retreating blade of a two-bladed teetering
   rotor system in a low speed wind tunnel. The results are correlated with
   earlier aerodynamic loads and flow visualization data using the same
   rotor blade planform placed in a yawed, fixed-wing position. Results
   obtained with the blade held fixed at several rotor azimuths and angles
   of attack are used to ascertain the rotation effects on the flowfield by
   comparison with rotating blade results. Initial results suggest that
   radial velocity due to rotation hinders separation and delays the
   formation of an attached vortex, compared to the static case. The
   circulation of the reverse flow attached vortex is of the same order of
   magnitude as the bound circulation of the airfoil section, proving that
   the vortex contributes significantly to the lift force in addition to
   the pitching moment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic methodology for achieving stable
   locomotion behaviors on transfemoral prostheses, together with a
   framework for transitioning between these behaviors-both of which are
   realized experimentally on the self-contained custom-built prosthesis
   AMPRO. Extending previous results for translating robotic walking to
   prosthesis, the first main contribution of this paper is the gait
   generation and control development for realizing dynamic stair climbing.
   This framework leads to the second main contribution of the paper: a
   methodology for motion intent recognition, allowing for natural and
   smooth transitions between different motion primitives, e.g., standing,
   level walking, and stair climbing. The contributions presented in this
   paper, including stair ascent and transitioning between motion
   primitives, are verified in simulation and realized experimentally on
   AMPRO. Improved tracking and energy efficiency is seen when the online
   optimization based controller is utilized for stair climbing and the
   motion intent recognition algorithm successfully transitions between
   motion primitives with a success rate of over 98\%.}},

Abstract = {{A new processing route for making thermosetting materials and products
   containing high loading solid fillers including waste solid scraps and
   natural mineral fillers was investigated. Traditionally, solid fillers
   are incorporated into thermosetting polymers by liquid-state mixing.
   However, due to the high viscosity in mixing, high loading above 50\% by
   weight is difficult to achieve. The new process overcomes this hurdle by
   a two-step processing strategy. First, solid fillers are placed in the
   mold and compacted to conform to the mold shape. Next, with the mold
   closed, a thermosetting resin is infused by vacuum into the particulate
   preform and after curing to form the desired product. In the exploratory
   study, epoxy and mineral particles including sand were chosen as
   material systems for feasibility demonstration. Thermal analysis and
   rheology were performed to assist in understanding of the fluid flow in
   heated porous media to achieve an optimized process window for rapid
   infusion. The results indicated that epoxy matrix composites with
   extremely high solid filler loading exceeding 70\% by weight, as well as
   with complex external geometry, can be successfully produced. The
   resulting material is structurally uniform and its mechanical properties
   can be adjusted by changing the composition and makeup of the filler
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a low-complexity loop filter for video coding.
   We begin by presenting a set of non-Wiener based loop filters that can
   complement the Wiener-based adaptive loop filter which was considered as
   a tool for possible adoption in the HEVC standard. We devise filters
   which can be adaptively operated on different regions in an image. We
   devise a quad-tree based signaling for the filters, and present various
   loop filters: such as bilateral and Gaussian, as well as a separable
   3-tap filter which can be implemented by just shifts and adds. The
   proposed 3-tap filter is thus hardware friendly with minimal complexity.
   In terms of compression performance, the proposed 3-tap filter can
   approach other sophisticated filters, albeit at a substantially reduced
   complexity; and can provide compression gains of 2.3\% on average; and
   upto 7.0\% for Low-Delay-P configuration over a data-set of 19 diverse
   HD, and UHD sequences of upto 8K resolution when implemented on top of
   the HM14.0 software for HEVC. Finally, we also present results for
   combining our proposed filters with the Wiener-based adaptive loop
   filter considered in HEVC, and illustrate that there is a significant
   amount of compression gain that can be achieved by loop filters for the
   next generation of video coding standard beyond HEVC.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new curvelet-based distance measure for post-migration
   seismic data. The measure exploits the highly directional content of
   seismic images. It calculates the sum of the squared chord distances

   all orientations and scales. In a retrieval task consisting of 918
   retrieval instances, the proposed method successfully retrieves all
   images. This wasn't achieved by other methods in the literature.
   Furthermore, in comparison to the state-of-the-art, the proposed measure
   required 86\% less computation time.}},

Abstract = {{Many Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) use replicated
   simulations to project possible future system states. In many cases
   there are substantial similarities among these different replications.
   In other cases output statistics are independent of certain simulation
   computations. This paper explores computational methods to exploit these
   properties to speed up the simulation execution time. We discuss a new
   algorithm to speed up the execution of replicated vehicle traffic
   simulations, where the output statistics of interest focus on one or
   more attributes such as the trajectory of a certain ``target{''}
   vehicle. By focusing on correctly reproducing the behavior of the target
   vehicle and its interaction with other modeled entities across the
   different replications and modifying the event handling mechanism the
   execution time can be reduced. A speculative execution method using a
   tagging mechanism allows this speedup to occur without loss of accuracy
   in the output statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer in a high aspect ratio, rectangular mm-scale channel that
   models a segment of a high-performance, air-cooled heat-sink is enhanced
   by deliberate formation of unsteady small-scale vortical motions. These
   small-scale motions are induced by self-fluttering, cantilevered planar
   thin-film reeds that are placed along the channel's centerline. Heat
   transfer is enhanced by significant increases in both the local heat
   transfer coefficient at the fins surfaces, and in the mixing between the
   thermal boundary layers and the cooler core flow. The present
   investigation characterizes the thermal performance enhancement by reed
   actuation compared to the base flow (in the absence of the reeds) in
   terms of increased power dissipation over a range of flow rates, along
   with the associated fluid power. It is shown that because the cooling
   flow rate that is needed to sustain a given heat flux at a given surface
   temperature is almost two times higher than in the presence of the
   reeds, the reeds lead to a four-fold increase in thermal performance (as
   measured by the ratio of power dissipated to fluid power). The thermal
   effectiveness of the reeds is tested in a multi-channel heat sink, and
   it is shown that the improvement in heat transfer coefficient of the
   base flow is similar to that of the single channel.}},

Abstract = {{The high heat flux and strong thermal coupling in the 3D ICs has limited
   the performance gains that would otherwise be feasible in 3D structures.
   The common practice of adopting worst-case design margins is in part
   responsible for this limitation since average-case performance would be
   limited by worst case thermal design margins. The coupling between
   temperature and leakage power exacerbates this effect. However,
   worst-case thermal conditions are not the common state across the
   package at runtime. We argue for the co-design of the package,
   architecture, and power management based on the multi-physics
   interactions between temperature, power consumption and system
   performance. This approach suggests an adaptive architecture that
   accommodates the thermal coupling between layers and leads to increased
   energy efficiency over a wider operating voltage range and therefore
   higher performance.
   In this paper, we target at a 3D multicore architecture where the cores
   reside on one die and the last level cache (LLC) resides on the other.
   The DRAM stack may be stacked on top of the package (e.g., 3D) or in the
   same package (e.g., 2.5D). We propose a novel adaptive cache structure-
   the constant performance model (CPM) cache - based on voltage
   adaptations to temperature variations. We construct a HSPICE model for
   the SRAM to explore the relationship between temperature, supply
   voltage, and the circuit delay in the context of the LLC. This model is
   used to investigate, characterize, and analyze the effect of the
   temperature-delay dependence of the SRAM LLC configuration on the
   system-level performance and energy efficiency. This analysis gives rise
   to an intelligent scheme for dynamic voltage regulation in the LLC cache
   that is sensitive to the temperature of the individual cache banks. Each
   cache bank is thermally coupled to the associated cores and thus is
   sensitive to the local core-level power management. We show that this
   local adaptation to the temperature-delay dependence leads to a
   significant power reduction in the LLC cache, and improvement of system
   energy efficiency computed as energy per instruction (EPI). We evaluate
   our approach using a cycle-level, full system simulation model of a
   16-core x86 homogenous microarchitecture in 16nm technology that boots a
   full Linux operating system and executes application binaries. The
   advantages of the proposed adaptive LLC structure illustrate the
   potential of the co-design of the package, architecture, and power
   management in future 3D multicore architectures.}},

Abstract = {{As the microelectronics industry continues to advance the boundaries of
   size and performance, focus on the impact of systems packaging has risen
   to the forefront of design and material considerations. As interfaces
   are often constructed of multiple heterogeneous layers, interfacial
   delamination is an important failure mechanism to consider in
   microelectronic packaging. This failure is due to, among other factors,
   the stresses arising from high mismatches in coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE). Most work to date has focused on interfacial crack
   propagation under monotonic loading that is incurred during fabrication
   steps such as deposition or curing which occur at elevated temperatures
   and subsequent cooling to room temperature. This is an important design
   consideration but it is not sufficient as the operational life of these
   devices involve high numbers of heating and cooling cycles which result
   in crack propagation under fatigue loading. As such the study of fatigue
   effects on these interfaces is paramount to improving the lifetime of
   microelectronic devices as the field pushes towards both thinner and
   wider packages. One such exploration, which is the subject of this work,
   is to determine the interface incremental crack growth rate as it
   relates to cyclic loading. In this work, double cantilever beam (DCB)
   tests are performed at various stress ratios on samples with epoxy mold
   compound (EMC) atop a copper leadframe. For these tests, force versus
   displacement curves will be obtained. Given the small dimensions of the
   interfaces in question, it is desirable to develop a test methodology,
   that does not require in-situ measurement of crack length. Thus, in
   these tests the compliance of the samples is determined from the force
   versus displacement curves and used to infer the progress of the crack
   through an indirect approach. The advantage of this method is that it
   does not require the observational measurement of the crack length
   potentially allowing crack monitoring absent any optical or imaging
   methods. Using the determined crack propagation rate with fatigue cycle
   under various loading conditions, a generalized fatigue crack
   propagation model will be developed for mold compound and copper
   interface, and such a model can be employed to assess packaging
   reliability in operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Forests comprised of nominally vertically aligned carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) are excellent candidates for thermal interface materials (TIMs)
   due to their theoretically predicted outstanding thermal and mechanical
   properties. Unfortunately, due to challenges in the synthesis and
   characterization of these materials reports of the thermal conductivity
   and thermal contact resistance of CNT forests have varied widely and
   typically fallen far short of theoretical predictions. In particular,
   the micro- and nano-length scales characteristic of the heat transfer in
   CNT forests pose significant challenges and may lead to misreported
   results. Here we examine the ability of a popular and well-established
   thermal metrology technique, time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), to
   resolve the properties of CNT forest TIMs. The characteristic heating
   frequencies of TDTR (1-10 MHz) are used to probe heat transfer at length
   scales spanning similar to 0.1-1 mu m, applicable for measuring the
   contact resistance between the CNT forest free tips and an opposing
   substrate. We identify the range of CNT forest-opposing substrate
   interface resistances that can be resolved with TDTR, and simultaneously
   demonstrate the effectiveness of several processes developed to reduce
   the resistance of these interfaces. The limitations of characterizing
   CNT forests with TDTR are discussed in terms of uncertainty and
   sensitivity to parameters of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at Ti-graphene-Ti and Au-graphene-Au
   interfaces was measured using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR).
   Graphene grown on Cu foil by chemical vapor deposition was transferred
   to metallized Si substrates and TDTR was performed following the
   deposition of a top metal contact to form the metal-graphene-metal
   sandwiched structure. The results show that TBC was reduced at
   Au-graphene-Au interface in comparison to Au-Au interface and the value
   was similar to TBC measured at Au-HOPG interface. TBC at Ti-graphene-Ti
   interface was measured to be in the same range as Ti-Ti interface. This
   result is believed to be due to formation of oxide on surface of Ti, but
   further investigation is required. To the best of our knowledge, this is

Abstract = {{The development of gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon (Si) substrates is a
   critical technology for potential low cost power electronics. These
   devices can accommodate faster switching speeds, hotter temperatures,
   and high voltages needed for power electronics applications. However,
   the lattice mismatch and difference in crystal structure between 111 Si
   and c-axis hexagonal GaN requires the use of buffer layers in order to
   grow device quality epitaxial layers. For lateral high electron mobility
   transistors, these interfacial layers act as a potential source of
   increased thermal boundary resistance (TBR) which impedes heat flow out
   of the GaN on Si devices. In addition, these interfacial layers impact
   the growth and residual stress in the GaN epitaxial layer which can play
   a role in device reliability. In this work we use optical methods to
   experimentally measure a relatively low TBR for GaN on Si with an
   intermediate buffer layer to be 3.8 +/- 0.4 m(2)K/GW. The effective TBR
   of a material stack that encompasses GaN on Si with a superlattice (SL)
   buffer is also measured, and is found to be 107 +/- 1 m(2)K/GW. In
   addition the residual state of strain in the GaN layer is measured for
   both samples, and is found to vary significantly between them. Thermal
   conductivity of a 0.8um GaN layer on AlN buffer is determined to be 126
   +/- 25 W/m-K, while a 0.84 mu m GaN layer with C-doping on a SL
   structure is determined to be 112 +/- 29 W/m-K.}},

Abstract = {{The seismocardiogram (SCG) is a measure of chest wall acceleration due
   to cardiac motion that could potentially supplement the
   electrocardiogram (ECG) to more reliably predict cardiac quiescence.
   Accurate prediction is critical for modalities requiring minimal motion
   during imaging data acquisition, such as cardiac computed tomography
   (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For seven healthy subjects,
   SCG and B-mode echocardiography were used to identify quiescent periods
   on a beat-by-beat basis. Quiescent periods were detected as time
   intervals when the magnitude of the velocity signals calculated from SCG
   and echocardiography were less than a specified threshold. The quiescent
   periods detected from SCG were compared to those detected from B-mode
   echocardiography. The quiescent periods of the SCG were found to occur
   before those detected by echocardiography. A linear relationship between
   the delay from SCG- to echocardiography-detected phases with respect to
   heart rate was found. This delay could potentially be used to predict
   cardiac quiescence from SCG-observed quiescence for use with cardiac
   imaging modalities such as CT and MRI.}},

Abstract = {{Systolic time intervals (STI) are non-invasive measures of cardiac
   function. Due to the fact that STI can be measured noninvasively outside
   the clinic, STI are a promising method for long-term monitoring of
   patients with cardiovascular disease. In particular, the pre-ejection
   period (PEP) has been measured successfully from body vibrations of the
   beating heart, a technique called ballistocardiography (BCG), using a
   weighing scale. Similar measurements can be made with on-body
   accelerometers, however these wearable BCG signals are typically more
   challenging to interpret than whole-body BCG. In this paper, we
   conducted a small pilot study with four subjects to investigate whether
   a body sensor network of four accelerometers positioned on the wrist,
   arm, sternum, and head could improve beat-by-beat PEP prediction beyond
   that of each sensor alone. Linear models were fitted from the R-J and
   R-I intervals of the four BCG signals to PEP measured with impedance
   cardiography from 5-minute recordings after isometric lower-body
   exercise. Specifically, we found that (i) the RMS error of PEP
   estimation from the wearable BCG sensors can be reduced by using double
   integration, (ii) the standard deviation of PEP estimates from R-I
   intervals was smaller than from R-J intervals, and (iii) linear models
   combining both R-J and R-I measurements from all sensors resulted in the
   best average correlation (r(2) = 0.96 +/- 0.01) and lowest average root
   mean square error (2.5 +/- 0.8 ms) from 5x2-fold cross validation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a non-invasive and active sensing scheme that is
   ultimately aimed to be integrated in a wearable system for
   neuro-vascular health assessment is presented with preliminary results.
   With this system, vascular tone is modulated by local heating and
   cooling of the palm, and the resulting changes in local hemodynamics are
   monitored via impedance plethysmography (IPG) and photoplethysmography
   (PPG) sensors interfaced with custom analog electronics.
   Proof-of-concept measurements were conducted on three subjects using hot
   packs / ice bags to modulate the palmar skin temperature. From ensemble
   averaged and smoothed versions of pulsatile IPG and PPG signals, the
   effects of local changes in skin temperature on a series of parameters
   associated with neuro-vascular mechanisms (heart rate, blood volume,
   blood flow rate, blood volume pulse inflection point area ratio, and
   local pulse transit time) have been observed. The promising experimental
   results suggest that, with different active temperature modulation
   schemes (consisting of heating / cooling cycles covering different
   temperature ranges at different rates), it would be possible to enhance
   the depth and specificity of the information associated with
   neuro-vascular health by using biosensors that can fit inside a wearable
   device (such as a sleeve). This study sets the foundation for future
   studies on designing and testing such a wearable neurovascular health
   assessment system employing active sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Intra-body communication networks are designed to interconnect nano-or
   micro-sized sensors located inside the body for health monitoring and
   drug delivery. The most promising solutions are made of implanted
   nanosensors to timely monitor the body for the presence of specific
   diseases and pronounce a diagnosis without the intervention of a
   physician. In this manner, several deadly health conditions such as
   heart attacks are avoided through the early in vivo detection of their
   biomarkers. In reality, nanosensors are challenged by the individual
   specificities, molecular noise, limited durability, and low energy
   resources. In this paper, a framework is proposed for estimating and
   detecting diseases and localizing the nanosensors. This framework is
   based on molecular communication, a novel communication paradigm where
   information is conveyed through molecules. Through the case study of the
   shedding of endothelial cells as an early biomarker for heart attack,
   the intra-body molecular communication networks framework is shown to
   resolve major issues with in vivo nanosensors and lay the foundations of
   low-complexity biomedical signal processing algorithms for continuous
   disease monitoring and diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory rate (RR) is a key vital sign that is monitored to assess
   the health of patients. With the increase of the availability of
   wearable devices, it is important that RR is extracted in a robust and
   noninvasive manner from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) acquired from pulse
   oximeters and similar devices. However, existing methods of noninvasive
   RR estimation suffer from a lack of robustness, resulting in the fact
   that they are not used in clinical practice.
   We propose a Bayesian approach to fusing the outputs of many RR
   estimation algorithms to improve the overall robustness of the resulting
   estimates. Our method estimates the accuracy of each algorithm and
   jointly infers the fused RR estimate in an unsupervised manner, with aim
   of producing a fused estimate that is more accurate than any of the
   algorithms taken individually. This approach is novel in the literature,
   where the latter has so far concentrated on attempting to produce single
   algorithms for RR estimation, without resulting in systems that have
   penetrated into clinical practice. A publicly-available dataset,
   Capnobase, was used to validate the performance of our proposed model.
   Our proposed methodology was compared to the best-performing individual
   algorithm from the literature, as well as to the results of using common
   fusing methodologies such as averaging, median, and maximum likelihood
   (ML). Our proposed methodology resulted in a mean-absolute-error (MAE)
   of 1.98 breaths per minute (bpm), outperformed other fusing strategies
   (mean fusion: 2.95 bpm; median fusion: 2.33 bpm; ML: 2.30 bpm). It also
   outperformed the best single algorithm (2.39 bpm) and the benchmark
   algorithm proposed for use with Capnobase (2.22 bpm).
   We conclude that the proposed fusion methodology can be used to combine
   RR estimates from multiple sources derived from the PPG, to infer a
   reliable and robust estimation of the respiratory rate in an
   unsupervised manner.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a noninvasive hemodynamic monitor to estimate arterial
   stiffness, by measurement of pulse transit time (PTT), was demonstrated
   in microgravity. The monitor's utility for space applications was shown
   by establishing the correlation between ground-based and
   microgravity-based measurements. The system consists of a scale-based
   ballistocardiogram (BCG) and a toe-mounted photoplethysmogram (PPG). PTT
   was measured from the BCG I-wave to the intersecting tangents of the
   first trough and maximum first derivative of the PPG waveforms of each
   subject. The system was tested on a recent series of parabolic flights
   in which the PTT of nine subjects was measured on the ground and in
   microgravity. An average of 60.2 ms PTT increase from ground to
   microgravity environments was shown, and was consistent across all test
   subjects (standard deviation = 32.9 ms). This increase in PTT could be
   explained by a number of factors associated with microgravity and
   reported in previous research, including elimination of hydrostatic
   pressure, reduction of intrathoracic pressure, and reduction of mean
   arterial pressure induced by vasodilation.}},

Abstract = {{We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq low-expression genes and
   investigate the effect of filtering on detection of differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs). Although RNA-seq technology has improved the
   dynamic range of gene expression quantification, low-expression genes
   may be indistinguishable from sampling noise. The presence of noisy,
   low-expression genes can decrease the sensitivity of detecting DEGs.
   Thus, identification and filtering of these low-expression genes may
   improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC benchmark dataset, we
   investigate the effect of different filtering methods on DEG detection
   sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of RNA-seq pipelines on
   optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the filtering
   threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely corresponds to
   the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity. Transcriptome
   reference annotation, expression quantification method, and DEG
   detection method are statistically significant RNA-seq pipeline factors
   that affect the optimal filtering threshold.}},

   between early and advanced cases of multiple cancer types through the

Abstract = {{Despite the recent research activities in molecular communication among
   bio agents, the design of reliable schemes remains an open problem. One
   of the challenges is to develop suitable coding schemes which meet the
   molecular communication specific constraints in terms of reliability and
   complexity. In this paper, we consider diffusion-based molecular
   communication in which the information is encoded into the concentration
   (e.g., on/off keying). Such a communication system operates over a
   completely asymmetric channel where one of the bits can be transmitted
   without any error while the other can undergo a random error by the
   channel. Because of the limitations of bio agents, we focus on
   error-detecting schemes which require far less complexity at the
   receiver relative to error-correction codes. We model the detection
   process at the receiver via an erasure channel and propose an algorithm
   that obtains the optimal codewords efficiently. Then, we consider an
   error-free sub-family of such codes, namely constant weight codes, and
   propose an implementation specific to the molecular communication. We
   analyze the rate of the constant-weight coding scheme and specify the
   optimal weights and lengths of such codes. We also show that this coding
   scheme, by design, would enable the nodes to synchronize their
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-hop or cascaded distributed multi-input and multi-output (DMIMO)
   occurs in a series of clusters of single-antenna radios, when the
   clusters relay to each other, using concurrent transmission one cluster
   to the next, within a cooperative route. We address the case of no
   external synchronization, where one cluster derives its transmit
   synchronization from a packet received from the previous cluster. For
   DMIMO system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   transmission, frequency offsets between cooperating transmitters or
   cluster members induce inter-carrier-interference (ICI) in the receivers
   of the next cluster. Also, the timing offsets between transmitters
   create additional delay spread potentially necessitating a longer guard
   interval. Rather than estimating each of the multiple offsets, each
   receiver estimates just one offset, which implicitly is a channel
   gain-weighted average, known from our previous work to yield
   statistically stable synchronization from hop to hop. To effectively
   suppress the timing and frequency offsets between distributed
   transmitters, we designed a novel preamble which facilitates this
   one-step estimation without explicit knowledge of channel gains. The
   performance improvement of the estimation algorithm is evaluated through
   simulation as well as experiment on GNU Radio and USRPs.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-stream aggregation (MSA) allows users to receive data from
   multiple base stations simultaneously to increase their data rates. In
   this paper, we propose a joint user association and resource allocation
   algorithm for MSA systems to achieve energy efficiency (EE) balance
   among different base stations. The problem is formulated as a non-convex
   combinatorial sum-of-ratios optimization problem, which is very hard to
   solve directly. We first relax the combinatorial variables and then
   transform the problem into a convex optimization problem by the
   sum-of-ratios algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA)
   method. Based on this, a near-optimal algorithm is developed. Simulation
   results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good performance
   with a fast convergence speed.}},

   types of interference: inter-layer interference from D2D pairs to CUs
   and intra-layer interference among D2D pairs. The former is mitigated by
   the base station through setting a price on the channel being reused by
   D2D pairs while the latter is solved by a game-theoretic approach, in
   which the D2D pairs compete for the spectrum until a Nash Equilibrium
   (NE) is achieved. Finally, numerical results verify that the proposed
   distributed scheme is effective for the interference coordination and
   its performance is close to the centralized scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been recognized as the
   next-generation networking paradigm. It is a fast-evolving technology
   that decouples the network control plane from the data forwarding plane.
   A logically centralized controller is responsible for all the control
   decisions and communication among the forwarding elements. However,
   current traffic engineering techniques and state-of-the-art routing
   algorithms do not effectively use the merits of SDNs, such as global
   centralized visibility, control and data plane decoupling, network
   management simplification and portability. In this paper, a
   multi-tenancy management framework is proposed to fulfill the
   quality-of-services (QoSs) requirements through tenant isolation,
   prioritization and flow allocation. First, a network virtualization
   algorithm is provided to isolate and prioritize tenants from different
   clients. Second, a novel routing scheme, called QoS-aware
   Virtualization-enabled Routing (QVR), is presented. It combines the
   proposed virtualization technique and a QoS-aware framework to enable
   flow allocation with respect to different tenant applications.
   Simulation results confirm that the proposed QVR algorithm surpasses the
   conventional algorithms with less traffic congestion and packet delay.
   This facilitates reliable and efficient data transportation in
   generalized SDNs. Therefore, it yields to service performance
   improvement for numerous applications and enhancement of client
   isolation.}},

   fundamentally guided the research questions and approach. We examine the
   different roles researchers play-researcher, confidant, advocate,
   interloper, invader, and collaborator-and how those roles create
   particular relations in the field. The contribution of this work is the
   development of a reflective account of the research in order to evaluate

   and mobile computing in support of digital democracy. These experiments
   will have potentially long lasting consequences on how the public is

   decisions for new cycling infrastructure and to provide an alternate
   means for participating in the planning process. Through our analysis,
   we point to three distinct roles the data played at the event-as

Abstract = {{A variety of massive datasets, such as social networks and biological
   data, are represented as graphs that reveal underlying connections,
   trends, and anomalies. Community detection is the task of discovering
   dense groups of vertices in a graph. Its one specific form is seed set
   expansion, which finds the best local community for a given set of seed
   vertices. Greedy, agglomerative algorithms, which are commonly used in
   seed set expansion, have been previously designed only for a static,
   unchanging graph. However, in many applications, new data is constantly
   produced, and vertices and edges are inserted and removed from a graph.
   We present an algorithm for dynamic seed set expansion, which
   incrementally updates the community as the underlying graph changes. We
   show that our dynamic algorithm outputs high quality communities that
   are similar to those found when using a standard static algorithm. The
   dynamic approach also improves performance compared to recomputation,
   achieving speedups of up to 600x.}},

Abstract = {{The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a vessel tracking protocol
   used by the vast majority of the global maritime community. While AIS is
   a fantastic tool for preventing vessel collisions, it unfortunately has
   no built-in security. This project first provides a security
   vulnerability analysis of the current AIS system. We then propose the
   outline for a new protocol that addresses these vulnerabilities. This
   protocol maintains the anti-collision capabilities that AIS was designed
   to provide, but uses secured communications similar to those proposed in
   IEEE 1609 combined with a multi-tiered user-level approach to provide
   greater security. Finally, our proposed protocol is simulated from two
   perspectives: that of an average user as well as from a network level.
   In aggregate, the results from these simulations suggest that our
   protocol keeps the existing usability of AIS while dramatically reducing
   potential security concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency, broadband electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors have
   been shown to be highly effective at detecting and classifying buried
   conducting targets. Even the simplest inductive sensors are capable of
   easily detecting the presence of buried metal. It is difficult, however,
   for most inductive sensors to discriminate between targets of interest,
   and the ubiquitous metallic clutter that might be buried alongside it.
   One attractive solution to this discrimination problem is to invert the
   broadband frequency data collected by the EMI sensor, finding a
   pole-expansion representation of the scattering transfer function known
   as its discrete spectrum of relaxation frequencies (DSRF). A target's
   low-frequency scattering behavior can then be compactly described by a
   set of relaxation frequencies that are the poles of the transfer
   function and their coefficients that are the corresponding amplitudes.
   Discrimination can be achieved by comparing the inverted data to a
   dictionary that contains the theoretical DSRFs of targets of interest.
   In this paper, a computational method will be presented for modeling the
   DSRF of arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional conducting targets.}},

Abstract = {{There is a fundamental tradeoff between processor performance and
   lifetime reliability. High throughput operations increase power and heat
   dissipations that have adverse impacts on lifetime reliability. On the
   contrary, lifetime reliability favors low utilization to reduce stresses
   and avoid failures. A key challenge of understanding this tradeoff is in
   connecting application characteristics to device-level degradation
   behaviors. Using a full-system microarchitecture and physics simulation,
   the performance-reliability tradeoff in a multicore processor is
   analyzed by introducing a metric, throughput-lifetime product (TLP). A
   finding reveals that reducing the variance of degradation distribution
   on the multicore die leads to effectively enhancing processor lifetime
   with minimal impact on performance. This concept is referred to as
   dynamic reliability variance management (DRVM). We discuss three
   possible microarchitectural techniques that perform DRVM and improve the
   TLP; i) phase-aware thread migration, ii) dynamic voltage scaling, and
   iii) turbo-mode execution combined with DRVM. The simulation results
   with selected PARSEC and SPLASH-2 benchmarks show that DRVM techniques
   improve processor lifetime up to 15\% or enhance the throughput-lifetime
   tradeoff by 12\% without adding extra design margins or spare components
   on the multicore die.}},

   relevant region of a motion planning problem during the exploration
   phase of sampling-based path-planners. The algorithm guides the
   exploration so that it draws more samples from the relevant region as
   the number of iterations increases. The approach works in two steps:
   first, it predicts if a given sample is collision-free (classification
   phase) without calling the collision-checker, and it then estimates if
   it is a promising sample, i.e., if it has the potential to improve the
   current best solution (regression phase), without solving the local
   steering problem. The proposed exploration strategy is integrated to the
   RRT\# algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an adaptive critic design(A CD) based control method
   of a generator in a single machine infinite bus (SMm) power system, by
   using a biologically-inspired artificial neural network (BIANN). A
   heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) based optimal controller applying
   three BIANNs is designed for the control of the turbo generator in the
   SMm system. By developing a numerical derivative calculation algorithm,
   the difficulties in back-propagating errors through a BIANN are
   overcome. The HDP-BIANN controller for the turbo generator in the SMm
   system is trained and run online for different operating conditions. The
   results show that the HDP-BIANN controller improves the system damping
   as well as dynamic transient stability more effectively than the
   conventional controllers (CONVC) for not only small step changes, but
   also large disturbances such as a three phase short circuit. This is the
   first time that a BIANN is used for closed-loop optimal control of a
   power system.}},

Abstract = {{Student designers and professionals alike have difficulty accessing
   appropriate analogies for design problems. Recognizing the advantages of
   Design-by-Analogy (DbA), the Design-Analogy Performance Parameter System
   (D-APPS) tool was developed to include a library of analogy entries and
   a matching algorithm. These components are combined into the Design
   Repository \& Analogy Computation via Unit-Language Analysis (DRACULA)
   software package that maps functions across domains in order to present
   analogies to designers as initiated through engineering performance
   metrics and critical functions. Most tools developed for DbA emphasize
   the searching by function feature. Since analogies are based on more
   than function, DRACULA incorporates both performance and function for
   the user to identify relevant analogous solutions. Prior to exposing
   engineering students to this tool, we investigated their ability to use
   analogies when crossing domains. During this process, we identified
   three function concepts to be vital for students to effectively use
   analogies across domains: reoccurring functions, critical functions, and
   mapping functions. The results establish a better understanding of the
   information that students utilize in order to formulate appropriate and
   creative analogous design solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a physiologically-based time-domain model of
   the mammalian ear that couples a nonlinear model of the cochlea with a
   lumped parameter model of the middle ear. The cochlear model is an
   extension of a previous nonlinear frequency-domain model {[}9]. This
   model is based on the finite element method and includes mechanical
   degrees of freedom for the organ of Corti micromechanics, acoustical
   degrees of freedom for the intracochlear fluid mechanics and electrical
   degrees of freedom that represent the intracellular outer hair cell
   (OHC) potential and the electrical potentials in the cochlear ducts.
   Nonlinear OHC hair bundle mechanoelectrical transduction and linear
   somatic electromotility couple the mechanical and electrical domains of
   the cochlea. A two-dimensional representation of the fluid domain is
   used. The governing equations are formulated using a state-space
   approach that is used to determine the linear stability and the
   time-domain response of the model. Electrical longitudinal cables were
   previously included in the frequency-domain model in order to represent
   the propagation of current in the cochlear ducts. The effect of these
   cables on the state-space formulation is discussed. Numerical results
   for the transient and steady-state response to a pure tone are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric flexible nanocomposites featuring ferroelectric barium
   titanate nanoparticles embedded in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)
   matrix were fabricated by a miscible-immiscible coagulation method
   followed by hot pressing. The SEM images showed good distribution of
   nanoparticles with very little particle agglomeration. This
   microstructure was achievable with or without surface functionalization
   of the nanoparticles and resulted in high dielectric permittivity and
   low dielectric loss over a wide range of frequency (10 Hz to 1 MHz).
   Dielectric permittivity of the composite increased as the filler content
   increased from 0 to 47 vol \% with only a small increase in dielectric
   loss. At a filler content of 47 vol \%, the dielectric permittivity can
   reach 76 at 1 kHz which is more than 10 times higher than the PVDF
   matrix while the dielectric loss can remain at < 0.1 at 1 kHz. Due to
   the simplicity of the processing method, reliable dielectric properties
   and flexibility, this composite may be useful in many electronic
   applications such as capacitors and flexible high-k dielectrics

   matches well in the frequency range of 1.7-2.7 GHz and the return loss

   cross-polarization, high front-back ratio (>2SdB) and stable half-power

Abstract = {{In three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) systems that use
   through-silicon via (TSV) technology, a significant design consideration
   is the coupling noise to/from TSVs. In Analog/Mixed signal ICs, the TSV
   coupling effect can cause coupling noise disturbance and degrades the
   performance of sensitive analog devices. In this paper, two different
   stacking integrations for the sensor array and the 3D IC, are considered
   and compared. In the face-up stacking integration, the transducers' flip
   chip bonded pads are directly bonded to the integrated circuit. In
   face-down integration type, however, the connections from the sensor
   output signal to the front end electronics is done via the TSVs. The TSV
   coupling noise is compared for the two schemes using the existing TSV
   coupling noise model. To validate the impact of stacking integration on
   the coupling noise, an ADC case study was designed and implemented using
   130nm device technology and Tezzaron TSV technology. The simulations
   results show that the face-up integration could suppress the coupling
   noise by 1 0 d b. Moreover, a 2 3 \% reduction in footprint is achieved
   in this stacking integration.}},

Abstract = {{A platform has been presented for wireless powering of receivers that
   are arbitrarily distributed over a large area. A potential application
   could be powering of small implants distributed over large areas of the
   brain. The transmitter (Tx) consists of three overlapping layers of
   hexagonal planar spiral coils (hex-PSC) that are horizontally shifted to
   provide the best electromagnetic flux coverage. The three-layer hex-PSC
   array is driven by a three-phase time-division multiplexed (TDM) power
   transmitter that takes advantage of the carrier phase shift, coil
   geometries, and Rx time constant to homogeneously power the arbitrarily
   distributed receivers regardless of their misalignments. The
   functionality of the proposed three-phase power transmission concept has
   been verified in a scaled up HFSS/ADS simulation and compared to a
   conventional transmitter. The new transmitter achieves, on average,
   5.8\% power transfer efficiency (PTE) to the Rx at 90 degrees angular
   misalignment compared to 1.4\% by the conventional method.(1)}},

Abstract = {{Ultra wideband (UWB) impulse radio technology has been widely researched
   for sensor applications and communication systems. In the radar system,
   detection performance is determined by a threshold. However, setting a
   proper threshold for maximizing detection performance is challenging
   without knowledge of exact noise power. In this paper, we propose novel
   algorithms that estimate noise power by adopting a divide-and-conquer
   algorithm to set a threshold for maximizing detection performance under
   the Neyman-Pearson criterion for UWB radar signals. The proposed
   algorithm can be easily applied to existing detectors. Simulation
   results show that the performance of detection with our proposed
   algorithm is closely matches to statistical model bounds, and required
   signal-to-noise ratio for perfect detection is less than constant false
   alarm rate detectors.}},

Abstract = {{As the RF spectrum becomes increasingly congested, localization
   algorithms which are tolerant of high levels of interference become
   necessary. A unique opportunity exists to study these issues during any
   event in a large venue, such as a football game in a large stadium. We
   report on the development of a RF sensor localization field deployment,
   LOC-EED, in the football stadium at Georgia Tech as well as a simplified
   laboratory testbed for controlled experimentation. During football
   games, cellphones, stadium personnel radios, media organization radios
   and wireless controlled devices, game official wireless headsets, etc.
   create an Extreme Emitter Density (EED) background that is a challenge
   to any algorithm attempting to identify and localize a single emitter.
   The laboratory testbed and field deployment to study this problem
   consists of RF sensor nodes (RFSN) using wideband RF digitizers and
   general purpose processors to sense the RF environment. We are using
   software radios as an enabling technology for the development of unique
   cross-layer localization techniques which are typically not realizable
   on specialized hardware, such as WiFi APs. This paper reports the
   details of LOC-EED and offers a preliminary analysis of spectrum
   captures in the 2.4 GHz band during a live football game. The analysis
   and a simulation of a simple cross-layer localization technique confirm
   both the need for, and ability to exploit, cross-layer information for
   localization.}},

   minimize the mean-square error of the channel estimate, which is tied to
   a lower bound on ergodic channel capacity. We perform a hypothesis test

Abstract = {{An energy efficient synchronization method is presented for an
   OFDM-based Time Division Cooperative Transmission (TDCT) system for the

   preamble consisting of two OFDM symbols. In TDCT, copies of the packet
   are transmitted through different time slots. Exploiting dependence
   between the synchronization parameters of the different TDCT copies, the
   approach achieves diversity gain in all estimated synchronization
   parameters. Since the design and algorithm pertain only to the preamble,
   the method can be applied to decode-and-forward as well as
   amplify-and-forward TDCT schemes. This algorithm also offers a
   significant performance improvement to the single-input-and-single-out
   (SISO) communication system. Through computer simulation, we show that
   our novel TDCT approach achieves synchronization in the context of range
   extension, avoiding the need for more preamble energy.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice reduction (LR)-aided equalizers have been well studied for
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems due to their great
   bit-error-rate (BER) improvement over linear equalizers (LEs) and
   relatively low complexity. In this paper, we present results on the
   maximum information rate (denoted as ``capacity{''} hereafter) of MIMO
   transmission with LR-aided equalizers employed at the receiver. First,
   we derive the main steps for calculating the capacity with different
   equalizers. Then, we illustrate the capacity when LR-aided equalizers
   are adopted. We show that the capacity gap between maximum likelihood
   equalizer (MLE) and LR-aided LEs is linked to the orthogonality
   deficiency (od) of the dual of the lattice-reduced channel matrix.
   Although LR-aided LEs do not guarantee to improve capacity every channel
   realization, we give the conditions when the ergodic capacity of
   LR-aided LEs is greater than that of LEs, as well as when their outage
   diversity is the same as that of MLE. Lastly, we show numerical examples
   with several state-of-the-art LR algorithms to corroborate the
   theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a single-hop, wireless sensor network (WSN) performing
   distributed estimation where the fusion center (FC) will collect local
   binary estimates within a limited collection time over a single
   transmission channel. We propose a transmission protocol called
   sensor-censoring random access (SCRA), in which the collection time is
   divided into frames and only local binary estimates of the observations
   in a specific range will be sent in a specific frame by using slotted
   ALOHA. Since we study a WSN with a single transmission channel, during
   the collection time, the FC will observe idle time slots, successful
   time slots, and collision time slots. As a result, we derive a
   collision-aware maximum likelihood estimator and collision-aware
   type-based estimators at the FC such that the global estimate is
   computed from not only the successfully received estimates but also idle
   time slots and collision time slots. The Cramer-Rao lower bound and mean
   square error of these estimators are evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Power transformers are expensive and critical power system components.
   Reliable and secure protection schemes for transformers are extremely
   important. While transformer protection has evolved to a high degree of
   sophistication they cannot ensure 100\% reliable and secure protection.
   A new transformer protection scheme based on dynamic state estimation is
   proposed. The dynamic transformer state is continuously estimated from
   measurements and the protective decision is based on the transformer
   state only (operating condition or health status). This scheme requires
   very few and simple settings, such as maximum permissible hot spot
   temperature. The protection algorithm is object-oriented. Specifically,
   the transformer model is expressed in a standard format, named the
   algebraic quadratic companion form (AQCF) and the dynamic state
   estimation operates directly on this object model. The method has been
   demonstrated in the laboratory. The paper describes the laboratory
   hardware. An example transformer protection is presented for a 115/25 kV
   three-phase transformer. Results verify the advantages of this scheme
   over traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{The HVDC-AC transmission system is becoming more and more popular for
   its numerous benefits, such as low cost, low losses for long distance
   transmission, etc. However, the power oscillation of this hybrid system
   has become a major obstacle for its further application. Tons of methods
   have been tried to damp the power oscillation and static series
   synchronous compensator (SSSC) is proved to be one of the most effective
   way for its excellent inherent characteristics. The SSSC offers many
   advantages as a FACTS device, but it is challenging to design a perfect
   controller for its application in a nonlinear system. In this paper, a
   linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) for SSSC is designed to increase power
   oscillations damping (POD) of an HVDC-AC power system. The LQR optimizes
   the system input (injected voltage of SSSC) to the reference value with
   full state feedback so that no vague controller parameter (such as PI
   controller parameters) is needed. The Algebraic Riccati Equation is
   introduced as well to provide the solutions for the controller
   parameters. Simulation results validate the feasibility of proposed
   modeling and control approach.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrid protection presents challenges because of the presence of
   inverter interfaced resources which results in insufficient separation
   between fault and load currents. This paper uses the Dynamic State
   Estimation (DSE) based protection (EBP) method for the protection of
   microgrid components. The paper demonstrates that this method provides a
   reliable protection system as opposed to traditional methods.
   Specifically, we verify that traditional protection functions such as
   overcurrent, distance etc. fail to provide selectivity in protection of
   microgrids. The EBP method can be viewed as an evolution of current
   differential protection and requires GPS synchronization if measurements
   come from different metering devices. The method mainly determines
   whether the measurements are consistent with the model of the protection
   zone by use of the chi-square test. Numerical simulations prove that the
   method can correctly respond to different fault types and locations. The
   method works equally well for three-phase balanced or unbalanced
   systems, two-phase or single-phase systems, and radial or networked
   microGrids.}},

   to enable accurate load forecasting, demand respond, system planning,

   queuing model for residential EV charging demand by performing big data
   analytics on smart meter measurements. The data driven model captures
   the non-homogeneity and periodicity of the residential EV charging
   behavior through a self-service queue with a periodic and
   non-homogeneous Poisson arrival rate, an empirical distribution for
   charging duration and a finite calling population. Upon parameter
   estimation, we further validate the model by comparing the simulated
   data series with real measurements. The hypothesis test shows the
   proposed model accurately captures the charging behavior. We further
   acquire the long-run average steady state probabilities and simultaneous
   rate of the EV charging demand through simulation output analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the optimal commutation of two types of
   linear variable reluctance motors (one with coupled and one with
   uncoupled phases) under constraints on force ripple size ranging from
   zero ripple to unconstrained ripple. Constrained optimization methods
   are used in order to (1) generate force-speed characteristics
   parametrized by forceripple size (2) produce current waveforms that
   minimize average power dissipation while producing a desired average
   force within specified force-ripple limits. Force ripple size is
   measured by the 1-norm of the force ripple waveform. The force models
   used are idealized analytical models derived from magnetic circuit
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, robot exploration problem assumes a static environment.
   Casting the exploration problem with the presence of humans brings new
   possibilities for interactive exploration tasks including robot rescue,
   etc. In this paper, we present a mobile robot system designed to explore
   an unknown environment with humans. The system is able to perform the
   robot localization and mapping, and produce the positions of humans in
   the environment at the same time. The system combines techniques of
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), motion planning, and human
   recognition. Our approach maximizes the exploration efficiency by
   designing optimal exploration paths. Moreover, the robot is able to
   perform human-aware behavior during the exploration, which complies with
   human safety, preferences and actions. Both simulation and field
   experimental results in real world settings are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for real-time deblurring of images captured
   by a robotic system. De-blurring is achieved by combining a
   dynamics-based approach and parallel computing. Existing methods have
   successfully restored a blurry image but were not suitable for real-time
   applications. The dynamics-based method with parallel programming in the
   FPGA is used to estimate the PSF during the camera exposure window. The
   deconvolution process, which involves iterative matrix calculations with
   millions of pixels, is then performed on the GPU to achieve real-time
   performance. The proposed method has been evaluated by using a robotic
   system which has a total of 32 piezoelectric actuators and one vision
   sensor. The frame rate of image de-blurring ranges from 20.32 to 40.68
   fps and thus real-time performance is achieved. In comparison to
   existing methods, the proposed method produces the best image quality.
   The dynamics-based approach is extended to real-time image stitching
   which is computationally cheap and robust to motion blur. It is
   demonstrated from image stitching that real-time de-blurring is
   beneficial for image processing.}},

Abstract = {{The scales on the skin of a snake are an integral part of the snake's
   locomotive capabilities. It stands to reason that the integration of
   scales into the design of robotic snakes would open new properties to
   exploit. In this work, we present a robotic snake design that
   incorporates rigid scales in the casing of each module. To validate the
   impact of the scales, locomotion is tested under three conditions: with
   scales, covered in cloth with scales, and covered in cloth without
   scales. The performance of the snake robot, in each of the
   aforementioned scenarios, is evaluated based on its forward displacement
   while executing each of two pre-programmed gaits: inchworm and lateral
   undulation. The lateral undulation gait is tested under two additional
   conditions: pitched and un-pitched. Tracks of the experimental runs are
   presented followed by a statistical analysis demonstrating an increase
   in locomotive performance when incorporating scales in the chassis
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Current multi-agent robotic testbeds are prohibitively expensive or
   highly specialized and as such their use is limited to a small number of
   research laboratories. Given the high price tag, what is needed to scale
   multi-agent testbeds down both in price and size to make them accessible
   to a larger community? One answer is the GRITSBot, an inexpensive
   differential drive microrobot designed specifically to lower the
   entrance barrier to multi-agent robotics. The robot allows for a
   straightforward transition from current ground-based systems to the
   GRITSBot testbed because it closely resembles expensive platforms in
   capabilities and architecture. Additionally, the GRITSBot's support
   system allows a single user to easily operate and maintain a large
   collective of robots. These features include automatic sensor
   calibration, autonomous recharging, wireless reprogramming of the robot,
   as well as collective control.}},

   We demonstrate a reduction of 40-50\% in the number of landmarks and

Abstract = {{Several sampling-based algorithms have been recently proposed that
   ensure asymptotic optimality. The convergence of these algorithms can be
   improved if sampling is guided toward the most promising region of the
   search space where the solution is more likely to be found. In this
   paper we propose three sample rejection methods that leverage the
   classification of the samples according to their potential of being part
   of the optimal solution to guide the exploration of the motion planner
   to promising regions of the search space. These sampling strategies are
   a direct by-product of the exploitation phase of the algorithm, which
   uses a dynamic programming (DP) step while planning on random graphs as,
   for example, is done in the RRT\# algorithm. It is shown that the
   proposed sampling strategies are able to compute high-quality solutions,
   much faster than existing algorithms. We provide numerical results and
   compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the original
   RRT\# and the RRT{*} algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes system observability to guide monocular SLAM.
   Instead of providing all measured features then performing data-driven
   outlier rejection (such as with RANSAC), we propose to identify only the
   minimal subset of features which form an optimally observable SLAM
   subsystem for localization. Modeling the SLAM system as a discrete time
   system with piece-wise linear SE < 3 > motion, complete observability
   conditions are derived and a means to test the observability
   conditioning of candidate feature point groupings is proposed. Based on
   the conditioning, an efficient algorithm for picking the optimally
   observable feature subset is derived by incorporating the image
   geometric measures. The proposed monocular SLAM algorithm, called
   Optimally Observable and Minimal Cardinality (OOMC) SLAM is formulated
   as an EKF process. OOMC SLAM is first validated using a 6-DOF
   localization experiment; the results demonstrate accuracy comparable to
   the state-of-art SLAM algorithm with significantly improved
   computational efficiency. A longer sequence on a 620-meter trajectory is
   also tested. The algorithm achieves 0.9178\% relative error against the
   GPS ground truth.}},

Abstract = {{A robot companion should adapt to its user's needs by learning to

   We aim to solve the task learning problem using an experience-based
   learning framework that stores human demonstrations as task instances.
   These instances are retrieved when confronted with a similar task in
   which the system generates predictions of task behaviors based on prior
   actions. In order to automate the processes of instance encoding,
   acquisition, and retrieval, we have developed a framework that gathers
   task knowledge through interaction with human teachers. This approach,
   further referred to as interactive instance-based learning (IIBL),
   utilizes limited information available to the robot to generate
   similarity metrics for retrieving instances. In this paper, we focus on
   introducing and evaluating a new hybrid IIBL framework using sensitivity
   analysis with artificial neural networks and discuss its advantage over
   methods using k-NNs and linear regression in retrieving instances.}},

   transients and the need for finegrained spatio-temporal power management

   Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). This demands modularity in design as well as
   process and voltage scalability of such linear regulators. Digital
   linear regulators have emerged as an attractive counterpart to the

   The proposed strategy ensures that optimal performance of the MC is

   converter operates with an output voltage greater than maximum
   attainable balanced output voltage under unbalance input voltage
   conditions. The implementation of the modulation strategy involves
   selection of the most appropriate switching states and calculation of
   the corresponding duty cycles to ensure that error in the output voltage
   and the input current is minimized. Performance of the proposed strategy
   is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the

   A general approach to determine the optimal common-mode voltage is
   introduced in detail in this paper. In the proposed method, the level
   number of the output phase voltage of the MMC reaches the maximum (i.e.,
   2n+1, where n is the number of submodules in the upper or lower arm of
   each phase), which leads to reduced harmonics. Both of these advantages

Title = {{Estimation of Annual Mileage Budgets for a Multiple Discrete-Continuous
   Choice Model of Household Vehicle Ownership and Utilization}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2493}},
Pages = {{126-135}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an empirical comparison of the following approaches
   to estimate annual mileage budgets for multiple discrete-continuous
   extreme value (MDCEV) models of household vehicle ownership and
   utilization: (a) a log-linear regression approach to model observed
   total annual household vehicle miles traveled (AH-VMT), (b) a stochastic
   frontier regression approach to model latent annual vehicle mileage
   frontier, and (c) other approaches used in the literature to assume
   annual household vehicle mileage budgets. For the stochastic regression
   approach, MDCEV and multiple discrete-continuous heteroscedastic extreme
   value (MDCHEV) models were estimated and examined. When model
   predictions were compared with observed distributions of vehicle
   ownership and utilization in a validation data sample, the log-linear
   regression approach performed better than other approaches. However,
   policy simulations demonstrate that the log-linear regression approach
   does not allow for AH-VMT to increase or decrease as a result of changes
   in vehicle-specific attributes, such as changes in fuel economy. The
   stochastic frontier approach overcomes that limitation. Policy
   simulation results with the stochastic frontier approach suggest that
   increasing the fuel economy of a category of vehicles increases the
   ownership and use of those vehicles. But this does not necessarily
   translate into an equal decrease in the use of other household vehicles,
   confirming previous findings in the literature that improvements in fuel
   economy tend to induce additional travel. In view of policy
   responsiveness and prediction accuracy, using the stochastic frontier
   regression (for estimating mileage budgets) in conjunction with the
   MDCHEV model for discrete-continuous choice analysis of household
   vehicle ownership and utilization is recommended.}},

Title = {{Latent-Segmentation-Based Approach to Investigating Spatial
   Transferability of Activity-Travel Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2493}},
Pages = {{136-144}},
Abstract = {{Spatial transferability of travel demand models has been an issue of
   considerable interest, particularly for small- and medium-sized planning
   areas that often do not have the resources and staff time to collect
   large-scale travel survey data and estimate model components native to
   the region. Traditional approaches to identifying geographic contexts
   that may borrow and transfer models between one another involve the
   exogenous a priori identification of a set of variables used to
   characterize the similarity between geographic regions. However, this ad
   hoc procedure presents considerable challenges because it is difficult
   to identify the most appropriate criteria a priori. To address that
   issue, this paper proposes a latent segmentation approach: the most
   appropriate criteria for identifying areas with similar profiles are
   determined endogenously in the model estimation phase. The end products
   are a set of optimal criteria for clustering regions as well as a fully
   transferred model, segmented to account for heterogeneity in the
   population. The method is demonstrated, and its efficacy established
   through a case study in this paper that uses the National Household
   Travel Survey data set for information on weekday activities of
   nonworkers in nine regions in the states of California and Florida. The
   estimated model is then applied to a context withheld from the original
   estimation to assess its performance. The method is found to offer a
   robust mechanism for identifying latent segments and establishing
   criteria for transferring models between areas.}},

Abstract = {{By the year 2020 it is expected that corresponding to every human being
   there would be seven connected devices. These connected devices will
   usher in the Internet of Things (IoTs) and would percolate every aspect
   of human life, changing the human experience at a fundamental level. In
   order to power these devices novel strategies would have to be developed
   as these devices will not only have a dynamic load, due to multiple
   features, but also dynamic sources if opportunistic energy harvesting is
   used to supplement the rechargeable battery. For the power delivery
   network, figures of merit would be to comprehend both the ability to
   supply the worst case design as well as to maintain high efficiency
   across a wide dynamic range. To maintain high efficiency for a large
   range we will need adaptive components on the load side as well as at
   the energy source. In this work we will discuss the general IoT power
   delivery network (PDN), current research and the state of the art PDN
   components, novel designs and control for interface circuits and energy
   harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{As the idea of ``all-electric{''} has been proposed and gradually
   realized in recent years, the power consumption of the system increases
   substantially, this demands the power supply with better properties and
   higher reliability. Currently, the prognostics and health management
   research of the power electronic system, including switch mode power
   supply (SMPS), are based primarily on field data with specified usage
   stress. The usage stress (including input voltage, temperature, load,
   etc.) is specific, therefore, it is difficult to adapt to the
   measurement in other stress conditions. The tolerance of the system is
   rarely considered. In addition, the basis of the health- assessment is
   the database containing degradation features of multi-component
   degradation. However, the degradation degree of components can rarely be
   controlled by experiment. By injecting degradation parameters of
   components into the high fidelity SMPS model, a health-assessment
   methodology for SMPS based on simulation is proposed. Firstly, SMPS with
   multi-component degradation in various tolerance and stress conditions
   is simulated by using the design of experiment (DOE) method; Secondly,
   the testable signals in the system such as output signals and
   gate-source voltage of MOSFET are pre-treated to reduce dimensionality
   and to eliminate redundant information, and the database containing
   degradation characteristics is created. Then, based on the database, the
   degradation status of SMPS is identified by Mahalanobis Distance (MD)
   calculation. The methodology proposed in this paper provides a general
   platform for prognostics and health- management research of SMPS. A
   flyback SMPS is studied to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of
   proposed methodology.}},

   functions represent rough references for where the robots should be

   the number of robots and focus on the general behavior of the team of

   whereby the robots only need to access information from adjacent robots
   allows these algorithms to scale well with the number of robots.

Abstract = {{This paper explores how haptic interfaces should be designed to enable
   effective human-swarm interactions. When a single operator is
   interacting with a team of mobile robots, there are certain properties
   of the team that may help the operator complete the task at hand if
   these properties were fed back via haptics. However, not all team-level
   properties may be particularly well-suited for haptic feedback. In this
   paper, characteristics that make a property of a multi-agent system
   appropriate for haptic feedback are defined. The focus here is on
   leader-follower networks, in which one robot, the so-called leader, is
   controlled via an operator with a haptic device, whereas the remaining
   robots, the so-called followers, are tasked with maintaining distances
   between one another. Multi-agent manipulability, a property which
   describes how effective the leader is at controlling the movement of the
   followers, is proposed as one such appropriate property for haptic
   feedback in a human-swarm interaction scenario. Manipulability feedback
   is implemented using a PHANTOM Omni haptic joystick and experiments in
   which a team of mobile robots is controlled via a human operator with
   access to this feedback show that this is viable in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Mutual trust is a key factor in human-human collaboration. Inspired by
   this social interaction, we propose to analyze human-agent mutual trust
   in the collaboration of human and (semi) autonomous multi-agent systems.
   Human-agent mutual trust should be bidirectional and determines the
   human's acceptance and use of autonomous agents as well as agents'
   willingness to take human's command. It is especially important when a
   human collaborates with multiple agents concurrently. In this paper, we
   propose time-series humanagent mutual trust models based on well known
   results from human factors engineering. To avoid both ``over-trust{''}
   and ``under-trust{''}, we set up dynamic timing models for the
   multi-agent scheduling problem and develop necessary and sufficient
   conditions to test the schedulability of the human multi-agent
   collaborative task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   scheduling algorithm using Matlab simulations. It shows that the
   proposed algorithm guarantees the effective real-time scheduling of the
   human multi-agent collaboration system while ensuring a proper level of
   mutual trust.}},

   natural frequencies of the cranes are calculated and utilized to design
   a three-mode zero-vibration input shaper. A Lyapunov control law using
   only the states associated with the first mode is derived. The
   robustness of the proposed controller in state tracking and oscillation

Abstract = {{This paper presents an evolutionary optimization approach to the control
   of antagonistic shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator arrays. The actuator
   and control architectures are inspired by the neuromuscular system,
   which achieves smooth and accurate movements despite nonlinearities and
   uncertainties in control and estimation. SMA actuators produce
   contractile forces and have a high power-density, but exhibit
   nonlinearity and significant hysteresis in their thermo-mechanical
   behavior. A floating-point quantization (FPQ) schema is used to
   determine a non-uniform array distribution, resulting in motor
   variability similar to that observed in humans. Actuator arrays are used
   in an antagonistic configuration for joint control of a planar link. An
   evolutionary optimization approach is used to determine the optimal
   control inputs for point-to-point trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an energy co-optimization problem of minimizing the total
   communication and motion energy of a robot tasked with transmitting a
   given number of information bits while moving along a fixed path. The
   data is transmitted to a remote station over a fading channel, which
   changes along the trajectory of the robot. While a previous approach to
   the problem used a speed-based motion-energy model, this paper uses
   acceleration both as an input to the system and as a basis for the
   motion energy which is more realistic. Furthermore, while previous
   approaches posed the problem in discrete time, we formulate it in
   continuous time. This enables us to pose the problem in an optimal
   control framework amenable to the use of maximum principle. We then
   compute the optimal control input via an effective algorithm recently
   developed by us that converges very fast. We use practical models for
   channel fading and energy consumption: the channel quality is predicted
   based on actual measurements, and the energy models are based on
   physical principles. Simulation is used to solve a specific problem and
   demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the highly successful Quaternion Multiplicative Extended Kalman
   Filter (Q-MEKF) for spacecraft attitude estimation using unit
   quaternions, this paper proposes a Dual Quaternion Multiplicative
   Extended Kalman Filter (DQ-MEKF) for spacecraft pose (i. e., attitude
   and position) and linear and angular velocity estimation using unit dual
   quaternions. By using the concept of error unit dual quaternion, defined
   analogously to the concept of error unit quaternion in the Q-MEKF, this
   paper proposes, as far as the authors know, the first multiplicative EKF
   for pose estimation. Compared to existing literature, the state of the
   DQ-MEKF only includes six elements of a unit dual quaternion, instead of
   eight, resulting in obvious computational savings. A version of the
   DQ-MEKF is presented that takes only discrete-time pose measurements
   with noise and, hence, is suitable for uncooperative satellite proximity
   operation scenarios where the chaser satellite has only access to
   measurements of the relative pose, but requires the relative velocities
   for control. Finally, the DQ-MEKF is experimentally validated and
   compared with two alternative EKF formulations on a 5-DOF air-bearing
   platform.}},

   manipulate the communication topology of a given networked multiagent
   system - without adding physical edges to the graph. The proposed
   protocol achieves this objective by utilizing not only neighboring
   agents' relative position information but also their possibly delayed
   velocity information. It is shown that the stability of the proposed
   framework is not dependent on the possible time delay present in the
   neighboring velocity information. In addition, it is formally proven
   that utilization of the proposed consensus protocol is equivalent to the
   addition of virtual communication links in a standard consensus
   protocol. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a tool to increase
   the performance of a multiagent system without resorting to adding

Abstract = {{The Exposure Controlled Projection Lithography (ECPL) is a
   photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing process, which cures a
   3D part by projecting patterned UV light from beneath a stationary and
   transparent resin chamber. Its application in microfabrication is
   limited by the current open-loop process control method. The overall
   research goal is to develop some closed-loop control system for the
   black / grey box ECPL process. In this paper, we presented two process
   modeling and control systems for ECPL - a lumped parameters model with
   an Kalman filter equipped Evolutionary Cycle to Cycle (EC2C) control
   scheme, and a novel backstepping dynamics model with Adaptive Neural
   Network Backstepping (ANNB) control method. EC2C and ANNB methods adopt
   different process models, control approaches and algorithms, and can be
   applied under different development stages and application scenarios of
   the ECPL process. Preliminary study concluded that the EC2C and ANNB
   control methods are capable of tracking the process dynamics, thus are
   promising to be able to improve the ECPL process precision and
   robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Although reference systems with linear dynamics are common in the
   adaptive control literature, they can lead to limitations on the
   achievable closed-loop dynamical system performance. This is due to the
   fact that linear reference systems can only approximate the desired
   closed-loop behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems in narrow regions of
   the state-space. In this paper, we study a new adaptive control
   architecture for uncertain dynamical systems based on a nonlinear
   reference system. It is shown that the system error between the
   uncertain dynamical system and the nonlinear reference system
   asymptotically vanishes in steady-state, and its performance is
   guaranteed during the transient-time. Two illustrative numerical
   examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallization operations are frequently used in a number of
   industries, in particular in the production of fine chemicals. However,
   stochastic and nonlinear crystallization kinetics often makes it
   difficult to determine appropriate operating procedures for producing
   the desired products. This has motivated the development of online
   measurement tools and the pursuit of feedback control strategies that
   can adapt to the observed kinetics and produce consistent products. One
   important crystal property that often must be controlled is the crystal
   size distribution. Although a number of feedback control schemes have
   been proposed to indirectly control the size of crystals, these
   strategies suffer from the lack of direct feedback on the crystal size
   during operations. Here we propose the simultaneous use of focused-beam
   reflectance measurements (FBRM) and attenuated total-reflectance
   Fourier-transform infrared absorbance (ATR-FTIR) measurements to obtain
   an online measure of average crystal size: the mass-per count. In this
   paper, we give experimental results that indicate a strong correlation
   between the proposed mass per-count measure and the average crystal
   size. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this online measure for
   determining the effects of certain operations on the evolution of
   average crystal size. Finally, we use this measure to understand the
   effects of prevailing feedback strategies known as supersaturation
   control and direct nucleation control and, in doing so, elucidate a
   feedback control strategy that combines these techniques to produce
   large crystals more efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{In many practical applications, stability with respect to part of the
   system's states is often necessary with finite-time convergence to the
   equilibrium state of interest. Finite-time partial stability involves
   dynamical systems whose part of the trajectory converges to an
   equilibrium state in finite time. Since finite-time convergence implies
   non-uniqueness of system solutions in backward time, such systems
   possess non-Lipschitzian dynamics. In this paper, we address finite-time
   partial stability and uniform finite-time partial stability for
   nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we provide Lyapunov
   conditions involving a Lyapunov function that is positive definite and
   decrescent with respect to part of the system state, and satisfies a
   differential inequality involving fractional powers for guaranteeing
   finite-time partial stability. In addition, we show that finite-time
   partial stability leads to uniqueness of solutions in forward time and
   we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for continuity of the
   settling-time function of the nonlinear dynamical system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the differential game of pursuit and evasion
   between two players in the presence of an external flow field. It is
   assumed that the two players move on the plane at fixed but different
   speeds, and they are both agile. That is, they steer by choosing at each
   instant their direction of travel and abrupt heading changes are
   allowed. The external flow field is approximated by a time-invariant
   affine function. By utilizing standard techniques from differential game
   theory, we characterize the regions of initial conditions that lead to
   capture, as well as the regions that result in evasion when the two
   players act optimally. We derive the optimal strategies of the pursuer
   and the evader within the capture regions. Finally, we present numerical
   simulations of the resulting pursuer and evader trajectories for several
   values of the parameters of the external flow field.}},

Abstract = {{The singular optimal control problem for asymptotic stabilization has
   been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, the optimal
   singular control problem is extended to address a weaker version of
   closed-loop stability, namely, semistability, which is of paramount
   importance for consensus control of network dynamical systems. Two
   approaches are presented to address the nonlinear semistable singular
   control problem. Namely, we solve the nonlinear semistable singular
   control problem by using the cost-to-go function to cancel the
   singularities in the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. For
   this case, we show that the minimum value of the singular performance
   measure is zero. In the second approach, we provide a framework based on
   the concepts of state-feedback linearization and feedback equivalence to
   solve the singular control problem for semistabilization of nonlinear
   dynamical systems. For this approach, we also show that the minimum
   value of the singular performance measure is zero. A numerical example
   is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed singular
   semistabilization frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Face-to-face (F2F) is a bonding style in three-dimensional integrated
   circuits (3D ICs) that bonds ICs by using the top-metal (face) as the
   bonding side when stacking two ICs. As technology scales in F2F bonding,
   the distance between the ICs becomes as small as few microns. Due to
   this shorter distance, significant coupling occurs between these ICs. In
   this paper, we investigate the impact of coupling capacitance when ICs
   are bonded in a F2F manner. Using a field-solver-based modeling
   methodology, we examine three critical areas related to F2F parasitics:
   (1) physical and process factors that impact F2F coupling capacitance,
   (2) capacitance error when inter-die interactions are not considered,
   and (3) the impact of micro-bumps on F2F capacitance. The results
   indicate that F2F separation distances smaller than 10 microns will lead
   to significant inter-die capacitive interactions that must be considered
   when extracting F2F bonded 3D ICs.}},

   the promising solutions to enable systems with higher electrical
   performance and at the same time reducing size of the whole systems. To
   maximize benefits of the interposer, power distribution network ( PDN)
   and channels should be well-designed. PDN and channel properties are
   heavily affected by the material properties of the interposer substrate.
   Depending on the substrate material, anti-resonance frequency of PDN can
   coincide with ICs' switching frequencies. Therefore analysis and
   comparison of hierarchical PDN are important. Also channels can be
   affected by the PDN design, especially channels escaping/entering
   interposers are affected by the properties of the interposer PDN.
   Therefore, when designing interposers, co-design and co-analysis of PDNs
   and channels are required.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesive materials are the key component in the whole temporary
   bonding/debonding process for thin wafer handling. In this study, a
   reversible thermoset was synthesized by polycondensation between methyl
   diamine and aldehydes and was used as the basic resin for temporary
   adhesive. The use of thermoset endows the adhesive with excellent
   thermal and chemical stabilities. Moreover, the thermoset can be
   depolymerized to recover the monomers at a low pH and thus the adhesion
   was switched off by soaking in strong acids. A perforated glass wafer
   was bonded with a silicon wafer using the thermoset-based adhesive. It
   was shown the bonded pair can be separated after soaking in acids. It
   was further demonstrated that the debonding efficiency can be increased
   by optimizing the distribution and diameter of the holes in the carrier.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) interposers have received an increasing amount of attention
   in microelectronic packaging industry due to its potential application
   in the emerging 2.5D system integration. One of the key steps in the
   fabrication flow of Si interposer is the formation of through silicon
   vias (TSVs), which enable the vertical communication of chips attached
   on either side of the interposer. Current method for TSVs formation
   suffers from high cost and low throughput. In this paper, we report
   successful TSVs formation by a novel wet chemical method, which is named
   as metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE). In a typical experiment, fast
   etching of TSVs with 30 mu m in diameter, 80 mu m in pitch size, less
   than 50 nm in sidewall roughness and maximum depth of 330 mu m on
   standard Si substrates is demonstrated. Effect of etching time,
   temperature of the etchant and application of external electric bias are
   discussed by comparative study. Uniformity of the TSVs array by MaCE is
   investigated. The results clearly demonstrate that MaCE is a promising
   method for TSVs formation on Si interposers with cost-efficiency and
   high throughput in large-scale manufacturing.}},

   its stringent material requirements are unlikely to be met by
   traditional underfills. Moreover, filler trapping is becoming an

   have previously reported an underfilling technology to reduce filler
   trapping using no-flow underfills and surface modified Cu bond pads
   {[}1]. In such process, underfilling and interconnect bonding are
   carried out simultaneously, which calls for new underfill materials that
   would meet process requirements while leaving minimal residue filler on
   the bonding pads. Here we report a development epoxy composite material
   that is compatible with the bonding profile for eutectic SnAg solder.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible and stretchable electronics have aroused tremendous attentions

   hybrid conductive architecture where elastomeric components can be
   integrated. In this research, we report on a facile synthesis of
   graphene aerogel via spontaneous reduction. The porous structure of the
   aerogel greatly facilitates the incorporation of poly(dimethylsiloxane)
   (PDMS) elastomer into the graphene framework. The graphene/PDMS
   composite has demonstrated a high conductivity of 95 S/m and less than
   20\% resistance variation under different bending conditions. With
   unique electrical feature and robust mechanical strength, the
   as-fabricated graphene/PDMS composite poses the great potential as

Abstract = {{Glass interposers have gained increased attention and interest in
   microelectronics industry since 2010. This is because glass has a
   tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high mechanical
   rigidity, availability in large and thin panel form, low processing
   cost, smooth surface for fine line and space fabrication, and superior
   electrical properties. While thin glass panels offer such a plethora of
   benefits, there are several processing and reliability challenges that
   glass imposes. As a brittle material, glass has low fracture toughness
   and is prone to cracking.
   In a typical large-area glass panel processing, layers of dielectric
   polymers and conducting copper are sequentially deposited and patterned.
   Due to these temperature histories and difference in the CTE among
   different materials, the panel is subjected to process-induced residual
   stresses. When the panel is subsequently diced into smaller substrates,
   the glass could crack. This cracking is due to high residual stresses as
   well as dicing defects and possible delamination at the polymer-glass
   interface.
   This experimental and theoretical work aims to investigate thin glass
   cracking and understand the mechanics of such cracks, focusing on the
   stresses induced by build-up layers. As part of this work, glass panels
   of 150 x 150 mm size and 100 mu m thickness were laminated on both sides
   with ZS-100 polymer of 10 - 22.5 mu m thickness and cured. After the
   lamination process, 5 - 10 mu m thickness of copper is then deposited
   through a semi-additive electroless and electrolytic plating processes.
   This process of polymer and copper are repeated to create a total of two
   metal layers on each side of the panel. The panel is then diced into
   18.4 x 18.4 mm substrate coupons. Dicing defects are characterized using
   optical inspection. Cracking failures are documented. The unbroken
   substrates are thermal cycled between -40 and 125 degrees C.
   In parallel to the experimental investigation, numerical models are
   created based on the sequential fabrication process. Copper material
   properties are obtained from literature as well as from in-house
   nanoindentation tests. Polymer properties are obtained from vendor data,
   and the stress-free temperature is obtained through experiments. Dicing
   process is simulated by inserting a vertical crack through the panel,
   and various dicing defects are introduced in the singulated substrate.
   Energy available for crack propagation of such defects is determined
   through fracture mechanics approach, and design guidelines to mitigate
   glass fracture during dicing and reliability testing are explored.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a fabrication process for the deposition of a polymer
   insulation layer on the sidewall of through silicon vias in wafer level

   the insulation layer. The glue is a Newtonian fluid and has low
   viscosity (24 mPa{*}s @ 100 l/s) as well as low contact angle (25.9
   degrees) to silicon. The resultant polymer insulation layer has a
   shearing strength as high as 25.8 Kg/mm(2). Furthermore, the polymer
   insulation layer exhibits good uniformity in thickness and roughness
   over the whole 8 `' wafer. On the conformal coating of the polymer
   insulation layer, the Ti/Cu seed layer and Cu conductive layer were
   fabricated by PVD and electroplating. Therefore, all the results show

Abstract = {{This paper presents, for the first time, the characterization of
   electrical properties of Glass/ZIF stack-up and transmission lines on
   glass/ZIF up to 50 GHz. Ring resonators, co-planar wave guide (CPW),
   CPWs with Thru-Package-Vias (TPVs) and microstrip to CPW transitions are
   designed, fabricated and measured on a 300/33 mu m glass/ZIF substrate.
   The Short-Open-Load-Through (SOLT) calibration technique was used to
   measure the fabricated structures. Measurements show promising RF
   performance of glass and T. L on glass up to 50 GHz. An insertion loss
   of 0.05 dB/mm at 20 GHz and 0.12 dB/mm at 50 GHz for a CPW line has been
   measured. The microstrip to CPW transition exhibited 0.24 dB/mm of loss
   and a thru-package-via exhibited a loss of 0.34 dB at 50 GHz. A
   dielectric constant of 4.95 and loss tangent of 0.012 at 50 GHz is also
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Microchannels and microgratings on silicon (Si) are key components for
   microfluidic device, microelectromechanical system, Si photonics,
   micro-chemical reactor, microbiomedical devices and other applications.
   In the fabrication flow of these microstructures, photolithography and
   dry etching are the two major steps. However, both of them incur high
   fabrication cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for
   fabrication of Si microstructures. The approach uses flow-enabled
   polymer self-assembly (FESA) as a facile pattern formation method on Si
   surface; a novel wet etching method, named metal-assisted chemical
   etching, is employed for Si etching. These two consecutive steps show
   good compatibility with each other and capability of uniform
   microstructures fabrication on Si. The proposed approach, with
   combination of two low-cost yet high-performance novel technology, will
   serve as a promising route for microchannels and microgratings
   fabrication for various Si-related devices in high-volume production.}},

Abstract = {{Magneto-dielectric materials have been spotlighted as a new opportunity
   for effective antenna size reduction in many recent studies. In this
   paper, we start from first principles to describe the methodology used
   to synthesize the magneto-dielectric material. A combination of
   Bruggeman's effective medium model and Sihvola and Lindell model are
   used to find the right mixture of cobalt particles and fluoropolymer
   material for the effective antenna miniaturization. A three pole
   Lorentzian dispersion model is derived for fitting extracted material
   properties of magneto-dielectric composite material. The material
   properties are extracted using a cavity perturbation technique with
   substrate integrated waveguide cavity resonator. The Kramers-Kronig
   relations are used to demonstrate that the extracted material properties
   from the method are causal in this paper. A 900MHz PIFA on
   magneto-dielectric material substrate is designed, fabricated and
   measured. A 7.4\% bandwidth and 61.7\% radiation efficiency for the
   antenna were obtained. Human body effect to antenna was studied and
   Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) was calculated. The simulation results
   show that magneto-dielectric material can reduce the effect of human
   body on antenna performance and the magnetic loss enables a decrease in
   the SAR of the antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal weights used in element-space pre-Doppler STAP ideally maximize
   the magnitude and frequency coverage of the pre-Doppler temporal output
   signal. Maximizing the magnitude of the temporal output signal is
   critical for detection of weak targets, while broad frequency coverage
   is essential for detection of low radial velocity targets. Traditional
   pre-Doppler STAP uses binomial filter coefficients, which act as a
   high-pass filter, for the temporal weights. A comparison of the
   traditional weighting method and an alternative method, which uses
   linear prediction to determine the temporal weights, shows that weights
   determined with linear prediction often contribute to a higher output
   SINR than do binomial temporal weights. In addition, linear prediction
   based temporal weights are determined adaptively from the data which
   offers a significant advantage in flexibility over the traditional
   method whose weights are based on a specific collection geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) can be increased
   by extending the dwell time or coherent processing interval (CPI) over
   which target signal energy is integrated. However, over a long dwell
   time, nonlinear phase components in the slow-time signal limit the
   effectiveness of traditional Fourier-based processing methods to
   coherently integrate signal energy; thus, signal energy is often
   coherently integrated on a sub-CPI basis. This paper investigates a new
   extended dwell temporal signal processing algorithm that utilizes the
   signal energy in adjacent sub-CPIs in a unique way to improve the
   detection of weak, slow-moving targets. In many cases, the extended
   dwell algorithm more than doubles the probability of detection of low
   radial velocity targets over conventional noncoherent integration.}},

Abstract = {{A system design is presented for radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting
   on wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes, where all electronics reside

   Additive manufacturing techniques are used for the packaging and antenna
   fabrication: A 3D-printed cross-shaped structure is built that folds to
   a cuboid in an ``origami{''} fashion and retains its shape at room
   temperature. Inkjet printing is used to directly fabricate antennas on
   the surfaces of the 3D-printed plastic, enabling a fully additive
   manufacturing of the structure. Multiple antennas on the cube's surfaces
   can be used for RF energy harvesting of signals arriving from totally
   orthogonal directions, with the use of an appropriate harvester. The
   system modules (cube, antenna, harvester) are described and
   characterized, offering a proof-of-concept for the combination of
   fabrication techniques to build systems for demanding RF applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the feasibility to manufacture high performance
   radio-frequency passive components on cellulose substrates by exploiting
   two novel technologies: the vertically integrated inkjet printing and
   the copper laminate method. Both processes are substrate independent and
   thus suitable for fabricating circuits on paper as well; moreover, in a
   future perspective, they can be easily combined together in order to
   exploit their complementarity. Passive components such as capacitors and
   inductors, with Qs up to 22, never registered before on cellulose
   substrates, and Self-Resonant-Frequency (SRF) up to 4 GHz are described.
   The obtained values of the capacitance and inductance per unit area are
   0.8 pF/mm(2) and 43 nH/mm(2), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel transformer-based poly-phase passive network
   for generating high-quality fully differential quadrature signals with
   low-loss, ultra-broad bandwidth, and high compactness. A differential
   folded transformer quadrature coupler serves as the building block in
   the proposed poly-phase network. The poly-phase network can be readily
   extended to high-order configurations for broadband operation. Unlike
   the RC-CR poly-phase network, the transformer-based design offers
   inherently low loss and compatibility with output loading. As a
   proof-of-concept design, a 3-stage transformer poly-phase network is
   implemented in a standard 65 nm bulk CMOS process and achieves
   high-quality differential quadrature generation over a decade bandwidth.
   Measurements demonstrate the maximum differential quadrature outputs
   phase error within +/- 2 degrees from 2 GHz to 20 GHz, maximum magnitude
   mismatch within +/- 1 dB from 2.6 GHz to 25 GHz, and a worst-case image
   rejection ratio of 25 dB. The measured passive loss is 3.5 dB at 6.4

   The design leverages a folded-transformer based passive network to

   four-phase signals drive the 1st-stage frequency doublers to yield fully

   another push-push frequency doubler and generate the desired 4th
   harmonic output at 140GHz. The push-push doublers are designed based on
   2nd harmonic load-pull with Class-C operation for optimized output power
   and efficiency. The quadrupler is implemented in a 32nm CMOS SOI process
   occupying only 530 mu m-by-550 mu m. It achieves the state-of-the-art
   output power of +2.3dBm, a peak DC-to-RF efficiency of 5.3\%, and the

Abstract = {{The I-85 express lanes were the first value pricing facility in the
   Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan region. This study investigated the
   behavior and decision making of users and nonusers of those
   high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes. The study used a unique combination of
   express lane data and household demographic data, obtained from a
   private marketing firm, to examine decision making at the trip level for
   users from different income segments and demographic clusters. Trip
   characteristics (e.g., toll amount and trip length, operating conditions
   on HOT and general purpose lanes) and socioeconomic characteristics
   (e.g., household income and size) were incorporated into the choice
   models. This study also provided a summary of express lane use
   characteristics by income segments and investigated trip speeds by lane
   types and income categories. Lane choice decisions were modeled with
   binary logit methods to examine potential determinants of HOT lane use.
   Households were segmented into lower-, medium-, and higher-income groups
   to illustrate the differences in responses across these categories. In
   addition, households were clustered by their demographic characteristics
   to compare lane choice determinants across similar households.
   Elasticities for the various factors were calculated. The results showed
   slightly higher rates of HOT use among the higher-income segment,
   inelastic demand sensitivities for most factors, and few differences
   between lane choice determinants across income groups. With
   goodness-of-fit values that ranged from .18 to .21, these disaggregate
   models left most lane choice variation unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{Perforated floor tiles are used to supply cooling air from a subfloor
   pressurized plenum to server racks in raised floor data centers.
   Consideration of momentum rise due to acceleration of air through pores
   is critical for correctly predicting the flow field downstream of a
   perforated tile. The momentum rise could be captured by either directly
   resolving the tile pore structure (geometrical resolution model, GR) or
   simulated by artificially specifying a momentum source above the tile
   surface (modified body force model, MBF). Artificial specification of
   the momentum source obviates the need of resolving the tile pore
   geometry and hence requires considerably lower computational effort. In
   our previous investigation, we showed close agreement between the MBF
   and the GR model for different pore sizes, porosities and edge
   blockages. In this paper we further evaluate the MBF model for different
   pore patterns, air flow rates, tile thickness, small pore sizes,
   anterior blockage and presence of an adjacent server rack. From the GR
   model, it was observed that the flow field was very similar for
   staggered and aligned pores and for the range of air flow rates
   investigated. Thicker tiles resulted in lower pressure loss and lower
   air entrainment in the downstream. Small tile pores resulted in minimal
   excess downstream momentum and hence very low air entrainment. Anterior
   dampers increased the tile pressure loss but had negligible effect on
   air entrainment. MBF model was able to capture the trends predicted by
   the GR model and a close agreement between the two models was obtained.
   MBF model showed promise for modeling complex tile geometries with
   significantly lower computational effect.}},

   plenum reaches the data center room space through perforated floor
   tiles. Presently, commercially available tool ``Flow Hood{''} (also

   the tiles. In the present paper, we will discuss the operating principle
   and the shortcomings of the commercial tool and will investigate a
   simple tile air flow rate measurement tool having an array of thermal
   anemometers (here termed as ``Anemometric Tool{''}). The performance of
   both the tools is compared for different types of tiles (passive and
   active) for a wide range of tile air flow rates. It is found that the
   Anemometric Tool results in lower flow rate measurement uncertainty and
   works more effectively for high porosity tiles, as compared to the
   commercial tool Flow Hood.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate a transparent conducting oxide (TCO)-based,
   passivated contact for the potential use as a passivated tunnel contact
   to p-type Si. As a surface passivation layer, the Al2O3 films with
   varying the thickness are deposited using plasma-enhanced atomic layer
   deposition (PEALD) at 200 degrees C, followed by post-deposition
   annealing. For a similar to 15 nm thick Al2O3 layer, a high level of
   surface passivation is achieved, characterized by the effective surface
   recombination velocity (S-eff,S-max) of <30 cm/s. The samples with
   ultrathin Al2O3 layer <3 nm, however, shows degradation in passivation
   quality, reaching the S-eff,S-max<500 cm/s. When Al-doped zinc oxide
   (ZnO:Al) as TCO contact is directly deposited onto a similar to 10.6 nm
   thick Al2O3 coated p-Si via RF magnetron sputtering, the final
   passivation quality (p-Si/Al2O3/ZnO:Al) is characterized by the
   saturation current density at contact (J(0,contact)) of 92.1 fA/cm(2)
   with the implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) of 653 mV, showing the
   passivation quality is not severely degraded after sputtering without
   thermal treatment. Further process optimization of PEALD is in progress
   to produce an improved quality of surface passivation with the
   S-eff,S-max<10 cm/s for ultrathin passivation layers less than 2 nm,
   enabling a passivated tunneling contact.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel architecture for human-machine interface
   focusing primarily on the human aspects as applied to aircraft and
   unmanned systems. There is a need to explore new human-machine interface
   strategies stemming from the proliferation over the past years of
   accidents due to system complexity, failure modes and human errors.
   Concepts of autonomy establish the foundational elements of the work. We
   pursue a rigorous systems engineering process to analyze and design the
   tools and techniques for automated vehicle health monitoring,
   human-automation interface and conflict resolution enabled by innovative
   methods from game theory and reasoning algorithms. The general structure
   is illustrated in the paper. This paper addresses the general interface
   framework while emphasizing the human's (pilots) intended actions
   following an adverse event on-board the vehicle, i.e. critical component
   fault/failure modes. When combined with automated health state
   assessment means on-board the aircraft, the proposed strategy assists to
   improve the reliability of estimated actions the pilot must execute to
   mitigate possible catastrophic consequences. A ``smart{''} knowledge
   base is exploited as the reasoning paradigm where cases are stored and
   new ones are compared with similar ones available in the case library.
   Learning and adaptation tools are used to improve the decision making
   process. The emphasis of this contribution is on methods and tools for
   conflict resolution when the automated system's advisories are
   coincident with the human's intended actions. Appropriate similarity
   metrics are defined and used for this purpose. The efficacy of the
   approach is demonstrated via an interface built in MATLAB highlighting
   the performance of the algorithmic modules for assessment and conflict
   resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Localization and tracking (L\&T) are some of the most important
   applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. One
   method of achieving this is by approximating the position of an object
   from the measured backscattered signal parameters and backscattered
   data. A comprehensive analysis of the backscattered signal parameters,
   such as received signal amplitude and phase, is necessary to establish
   their effect on the accuracy of L\&T. In this context, this paper
   investigates the probability density functions (PDFs) of the received
   signal amplitude and phase for RFID systems. It was observed that both
   PDFs converge to Gaussian distributions in high signal-to-noise ratio
   scenarios. Moreover, the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), which serves as
   an established reference for unbiased estimation, is also derived for
   the estimated received signal amplitude and phase difference. It was
   noticed that the CRLBs are inversely proportional to the number of
   observations taken for the parameter estimation. Finally, it is
   pertinent to mention that if multiple types of sensed information are
   fused to perform L\&T, it results in millimeter-level accuracy. For
   RFID, one such technique which employs multiple sensed parameters for
   L\&T is Hybrid Inertial Microwave Reflectometry (HIMR). This paper also
   presents a simulation and experimental analysis of HIMR. HIMR-based RFID
   tracking scheme results in tracking accuracy in the range of 1-10 mm.}},

Abstract = {{RFID applications have power constraints that limit RF tags to short
   range communications. This article presents the design procedures,
   validated by experimental results, to make a low-powered reflection
   amplifier that exploits the quantum mechanical tunneling effect to
   dramatically enhance the range of passive or semi-passive tags. A return
   gain of 34.4 dB with bias power of 45 mu W at 5.45 GHz and a return gain
   of 22.1 dB with a bias power of 47 mu W at 5.55 GHz have been observed
   for impinging RF power levels as low as -70 dBm. These results allow,
   for certain devices, a factor of 7 range improvement to the RFID link
   while keeping the bias power 10 times lower than any other available
   reflection amplifier. This prototype could play a key role in enhancing
   RFID communication ranges without significantly affecting the low power
   budget typical for RFID technology; the design can be implemented in
   currently available semi-passive tags and opens the door for a new
   generation of long-range, passive/semi-passive transponders.}},

Abstract = {{In three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs), many clock-TSVs are
   deployed to deliver clock signals to different tiers with minimum skews.
   However, these clock-TSVs are prone to aging effects, such as
   thermal-mechanical stress and electromigration, rendering
   hard-to-predict clock skews at runtime. These skews have a wide range of
   influence on the flip-flops, and may violate the safety margins of
   critical paths in the circuit. Besides the circuit aging effect, the
   clock-TSV induced skews pose another threat to the circuit lifetime
   reliability. To tackle this problem, we propose to put tunable buffer
   for each clock-TSV in the clock network, and introduce an efficient
   algorithm to place aging sensors in the circuit at design stage. Then,
   at runtime, we conduct online diagnosis and apply effective clock tuning
   algorithms based on the triggered alarms in the aging sensors.
   Experimental results on a post-layout 3D circuit show that the proposed
   solution is able to significantly improve the lifetime reliability of 3D
   ICs.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity detectors work based on electro-thermal interaction
   between rate of heat loss to the surrounding gas from a hot element and
   resistance change due to temperature variation of the heater. Our
   developed ultra-low power polysilicon microbridge TCD provides
   ultra-fast response time and high sensitivity along with lower power
   consumption that makes it suitable for portable GC in environmental and
   bioengineering applications. In this work we modeled and tested the
   microTCD operation as a detector in a GC system. MicroTCD was packaged
   and connected to a 3 m long separation column in GC and was tested with
   injections of hexane and mixture of six standard compounds in helium
   carrier. Modeling and experimental results show that the effect of
   carrier gas flow speed on power consumption and heat loss from the
   microbridge is small and therefore the microTCD is insensitive to
   various typical flow rates. A new method of excitation and measurement
   of the detector was utilized to avoid base temperature drifting and
   achieve superior resolution in extended range of operations while
   consuming only 0.4 mW power. The microTCD response for different
   compound was obtained and compared with standard Flame Ionization

Abstract = {{Short-range wireless power and data transmission offers a viable mean to

   paper reviews various mechanisms for WPT with focus on link structures
   and circuit techniques for wirelessly-powered IMDs. Moreover, advanced
   IMDs require wireless data telemetry (WDT) for wideband bidirectional

Abstract = {{This paper presents a millimeter-wave fully differential compact
   transformer-based passive reflective-type phase shifter (RTPS). The
   proposed RTPS design employs two transformer-based 90 degrees couplers
   and two transformer-based multi-resonance reflective loads, offering
   low-loss and an ultra-compact chip size. A proof-of-concept design at
   62GHz is implemented in a standard 130nm BiCMOS process with a core area
   of 480 mu m-by-340 mu m. It achieves a wide phase shifting range (up to
   367 degrees) and a low insertion loss (IL) (3.7dB<vertical bar IL
   vertical bar<10.2dB) at 62GHz. It also performs phase shifting with a
   constant insertion loss at a loss variation of less than 0.7dB.
   Full-span 360 degrees phase interpolation is achieved from 58GHz to

Abstract = {{This paper presents a differential vector modulator phase rotator
   performing 360 degrees full span phase interpolation over a first-ever
   decade-wide instantaneous bandwidth (2GHz-24GRz). A wideband poly-phase
   network based on folded transformer 90 degrees couplers generates
   accurate differential quadrature signals with low passive loss (2dB)
   over a decade bandwidth. Two 5-bit linear digital variable gain
   amplifiers (VGAs) scale the quadrature signals, which are then combined
   for the target phase interpolations. Our phase rotator occupies a very
   compact chip size (1.2mm-by-1.8mm) in a standard 65nm CMOS process.
   Moreover, our design does not require any tuning element, band selection
   switch, or frequency-dependent code compensation/look-up table, ensuring
   that each phase interpolation code can be used for all the in-band
   operation frequencies. Additionally, the maximum RATS quantization phase
   error is only 1.22 degrees within 1.5dB output magnitude variation for
   full 360 degrees interpolation from 2GHz to 24GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Temporally and spatially dense data-rich environments provide
   unprecedented opportunities and challenges for effective process
   control. In this article, we propose a systematic and scalable adaptive
   sampling strategy for online high-dimensional process monitoring in the
   context of limited resources with only partial information available at
   each acquisition time. The proposed adaptive sampling strategy includes
   a broad range of applications: (1) when only a limited number of sensors
   is available; (2) when only a limited number of sensors can be in
   ``ON{''} state in a fully deployed sensor network; and (3) when only
   partial data streams can be analyzed at the fusion center due to limited
   transmission and processing capabilities even though the full data
   streams have been acquired remotely. A monitoring scheme of using the
   sum of top-r local CUSUM statistics is developed and named as ``TRAS{''}
   (top-r based adaptive sampling), which is scalable and robust in
   detecting a wide range of possible mean shifts in all directions, when
   each data stream follows a univariate normal distribution. Two
   properties of this proposed method are also investigated. Case studies
   are performed on a hot-forming process and a real solar flare process to
   illustrate and evaluate the performance of the proposed method.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{415-428}},
Abstract = {{One obvious minimum requirement for any temperature-pressure-viscosity
   correlation is that the pressure-viscosity relation be capable of
   describing all possible trends in the pressure dependence of viscosity.
   Empirical models are employed because theoretical models do not provide
   experimental accuracy. If an empirical model is selected to determine
   outliers from any data set, failure to accommodate any aspect of the
   pressure response may lead to incorporating flawed data and to the
   exclusion of accurate data in the regression of correlation parameters.
   Two simple models have been thoroughly investigated, one for faster-than
   exponential pressure response and another for slower-than exponential
   pressure response. A test for the applicability of the McEwen model has
   been derived, analogous to the derivative Stickel analysis. A new model,
   a hybrid of the McEwen model and the Paluch (Johari and Whalley) model,
   has been derived and tested on two liquids. The purpose of this article
   is not to construct a reference correlation, but rather, to show the
   pit-falls of assuming a pressure-viscosity relation of limited
   applicability.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we highlight the use of molecular simulation to study the
   behaviour of water inside isostructural Zn-DMOF structures. Among the
   Zn-DMOF structures, the parent DMOF, and the DMOF-DM and DMOF-TF
   variants are known to be less stable than the DMOF-A and DMOF-TM
   structures in the presence of water. We apply tools such as radial
   distribution functions, rotational auto-correlation functions and the
   visualisation of adsorbate density distributions to investigate the
   differences in water behaviour within these structures. We also study
   properties that are inherent to the frameworks themselves such as
   thermal expansion and ligand flexibility. Our results indicate that
   water is only able to get 0.5 angstrom closer to the metal hydrolysis
   site in the water unstable structures than in the more water stable
   structures. The results can be somewhat sensitive to the details of the
   modelling of the electrostatic potential energy surface and, for
   dynamical properties, modelling of framework flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of extracting static pressure fields on and away from flow
   boundaries in complex flows, is considered. Given the correct velocity
   field in steady incompressible flow, an assumption of constant or known
   stagnation pressure allows finding the static pressure. This gives an
   upper bound on static pressure, and is in fact close to the real answer.
   The technique developed here is to start with the measured, ensemble
   averaged 3-component velocity field in a periodic flow. The static
   pressure field computed from this velocity field in incompressible flow
   can be used along with the velocity field as the starting guess of a
   solution in a Navier-Stokes solver. The method is applied to the bottom
   surface near the sharp edge of a rotating rotor blade in the reverse
   flow domain encountered at high advance ratio in a wind tunnel. The drop
   in stagnation pressure along given streamlines even through the
   sharp-edge vortex, is shown to be very. small, so that the effect on the
   static pressure estimate is minor. The pressure field successfully
   explains some features that could not otherwise be explained.}},

   unsteadiness are shown to be negligible using a cylinder of aspect ratio
   1. The genesis of the side force on the yawed cylinder, and the
   differences between rough and smooth cylinders, are derived from
   comparisons between experiments and diagnostic computations with an
   unsteady Navier-Stokes solver. Interpolating Fourier coefficients of the
   azimuthal load variation appears to be viable to generalize loads on
   cylinders of varying aspect ratio. A large variation is seen for aspect
   ratio 0.5 to 1, with a more gradual transition to `high aspect ratio'

Abstract = {{At high edgewise flow speeds, reversed flow causes excursions in
   pitching moment and blade torsion on the rotor blades of helicopters and
   wind turbines. Our prior work has shown that a yawed fixed wing at angle
   of attack in reversed flow generates a sharp-edge vortex. The sharp-edge
   vortex is a primary feature of the flow under the rotor blade. During
   operation as a rotor blade at high advance ratio in a wind tunnel,
   stereo PIV results show that the well-formed sharp-edge vortex at 240
   degrees azimuth resembles that on a forward-swept wing. This vortex
   stops growing before 270 degrees and convects with the blade by 300
   degrees. Static pressure computed from interpolated velocity data show
   the effects of vortex-induced radial pressure gradient. This explains
   the finding of inboard-directed radial flow at 300 degrees azimuth,
   overcoming centrifugal effects. Viscous stress is shown to have only a
   minor effect on the static pressure field computation.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic counts are one of the fundamental data sources for a variety of
   transportation applications ranging from assessment of current
   transportation system conditions to future transportation planning and
   forecasting. A variety of traffic data collection methods have been used
   to provide continuous traffic count coverage at selected locations to
   estimate annual average daily traffic. This paper evaluates the
   performance of a Video Detection System. A video detection system was
   investigated under various conditions, including mounting style, height,
   and roadway off sets. This paper conducts a lane-by-lane analysis and
   the results indicate that video detection system data presents
   reasonably accurate data, although these data exhibit more variability
   compared to Automatic Traffic Recorder data. The paper provides an
   analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the video detection system
   technology based data compared to the Automatic Traffic Recorder data
   and helps in the decision process of whether to use the data for
   specific transportation planning and strategic decision applications.

Abstract = {{Source/drain stressors in FinFET-based circuits lose their effectiveness
   at smaller contacted gate pitches. To improve circuit performance, a
   dual gate pitch technique is proposed in this work, where standard cells
   with double the gate pitch are selectively used on the gates of the
   circuit critical paths, at minimal area and power costs. A stress-aware
   library characterization is performed for FinFET-based standard cells by
   obtaining stress distributions using finite element simulations on a
   subset of structures. The stresses are then employed to create look-up
   tables for mobility multipliers and threshold voltage shifts, for
   subsequent performance characterization of FinFET-based standard cells.
   Finally, a circuit delay optimizer is applied using the dual gate pitch
   approach and is compared with an alternative gate sizing approach. Using
   a combination of gate sizing and the dual gate pitch approach, it is
   shown that the average power delay product improves by 12.9\% and 15.9\%
   in 14nm and 10nm technologies, respectively.}},

Title = {{Image-domain shading correction for cone-beam CT without prior patient
   information}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{65-75}},
Abstract = {{In the era of high-precision radiotherapy, cone-beam CT (CBCT) is
   frequently utilized for on-board treatment guidance. However, CBCT
   images usually contain severe shading artifacts due to strong photon
   scatter from illumination of a large volume and non-optimized
   patient-specific data measurements, limiting the full clinical
   applications of CBCT. Many algorithms have been proposed to alleviate
   this problem by data correction on projections. Sophisticated methods
   have also been designed when prior patient information is available.
   Nevertheless, a standard, efficient, and effective approach with large
   applicability remains elusive for current clinical practice. In this
   work, we develop a novel algorithm for shading correction directly on
   CBCT images. Distinct from other image-domain correction methods, our
   approach does not rely on prior patient information or prior assumption
   of patient data. In CBCT, projection errors (mostly from scatter and
   non-ideal usage of bowtie filter) result in dominant low-frequency
   shading artifacts in image domain. In circular scan geometry, these
   artifacts often show global or local radial patterns. Hence, the raw
   CBCT images are first preprocessed into the polar coordinate system.
   Median filtering and polynomial fitting are applied on the transformed
   image to estimate the low-frequency shading artifacts (referred to as
   the bias field) angle-by-angle and slice-by-slice. The low-pass
   filtering process is done firstly along the angular direction and then
   the radial direction to preserve image contrast. The estimated bias
   field is then converted back to the Cartesian coordinate system,
   followed by 3D low-pass filtering to eliminate possible high-frequency
   components. The shading-corrected image is finally obtained as the
   uncorrected volume divided by the bias field. The proposed algorithm was
   evaluated on CBCT images of a pelvis patient and a head patient. Mean CT
   number values and spatial non-uniformity on the reconstructed images
   were used as image quality metrics. Within selected regions of interest,
   the average CT number error was reduced from around 300 HU to 42 and 38
   HU, and the spatial nonuniformity error was reduced from above 17.5\% to
   2.1\% and 1.7\% for the pelvis and the head patients, respectively. As
   our method suppresses only low-frequency shading artifacts, patient
   anatomy and contrast were retained in the corrected images for both
   cases. Our shading correction algorithm on CBCT images offers several
   advantages. It has a high efficiency, since it is deterministic and
   directly operates on the reconstructed images. It requires no prior
   information or assumptions, which not only achieves the merits of
   CBCT-based treatment monitoring by retaining the patient anatomy, but
   also facilitates its clinical use as an efficient image-correction
   solution.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{45-75}},
Abstract = {{Many organizations struggle to develop plans to achieve levels of
   scaling for agricultural technologies that demonstrate population-level
   impacts in developing countries. Scaling is a complex process, involving
   many disparate actors. There is no consensus model to follow; different
   models are needed at different stages. Practice for sound development
   activity planning generally involves analysis of feasibility in key
   areas, such as economic, financial, environmental, social,
   institutional, and technical. Attention to these should guarantee
   suitable, scalable, and sustainable technologies. This paper provides an
   introduction to the topics of the adoption, diffusion and scaling, with
   examples from agriculture.
   Relevant methods from the literature are reviewed to provide the reader
   with a general understanding of scaling and their application. Roger's
   model of the adoption and diffusion of technologies is presented and
   explained in context of agriculture in the developing world. Diffusion
   is a social process, and five qualities are necessary for an innovation
   to spread. The way to engage the five groups of adopters - innovators,
   early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards - in the
   adoption process are discussed. Peer to peer communication is critical
   in the spread of an innovation. A model of scaling up and a set of key
   questions to frame an organization's scaling activities are critical to
   successful diffusion. Public-private partnerships are required for a
   technology or intervention to cross the ``valley of death{''} between
   public funding of the research phase and private support of the market
   phase so it will be sustainable. The spread of orange flesh sweet
   potato, tractors and cows for power, and axial flow pumps for irrigation
   demonstrate how the diffusion model applies to actual products.
   Organizations must be open to innovation and change for scaling to
   succeed. As a result, they must involve different types of partners with
   knowledge of the social contexts and the types of adopters of the stages
   of scaling. The Asian Green Revolution is an example of the complexity
   of the process of the diffusion of multiple technologies required for
   success of this world-changing event. Government funding was critical in
   supporting the research that developed the agricultural technologies. An
   enabling economic environment consisting of incentives, policies, and
   subsidies, as well as land tenure reform, was necessary so that farmers
   and the private sector would participate in and drive the spread of the
   technologies and make the revolution succeed. This investment and
   support must be sustained in the long term, as the spread of
   technologies can take a decade or more, as did the Asian Green
   Revolution, which one can argue is still occurring. Agriculture
   revolutions must be pro-poor and environmentally sustainable or else
   they will fail in the long term.}},

   efficiently coupled into the high-k guided modes in the HMM slab and be
   absorbed by the graphene layers, which can be applied to create

Title = {{Tour Characterization Framework Incorporating Activity Stop-Sequencing
   Model System}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2494}},
Pages = {{77-86}},
Abstract = {{Activity-based models (ABMs) adopt the notion of tours to model activity
   travel patterns, because the concept of a tour closely mimics how
   individuals chain their activities in the real world. Each tour may be
   defined by a primary destination that corresponds to a primary purpose
   and may include a multitude of secondary stops on the way to the primary
   destination (the outbound half-tour) or on the way back (the inbound
   half-tour). This paper presents a tour characterization framework
   capable of simulating all secondary stops on a tour, the time allocated
   to each activity, and the sequence of stops on a tour. The first
   component simulates the mix of activities and their corresponding
   durations and was presented in an earlier paper. The current paper
   presents the stop-sequencing component, which is capable of determining
   the order in which activities will be pursued on outbound and inbound
   half-tours. Model estimation results and comparisons between observed
   and predicted stop-sequencing patterns are presented. The models were
   found to perform quite well in replicating the observed stop-making
   patterns. The overall tour characterization framework was designed to
   accommodate the continuous treatment of time in ABMs in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Imbalanced supercapacitor was constructed by using various ratio of

   potential distribution, and life cycle. The imbalanced supercapacitor
   with an AC weight ratio of 80 : 120 of positive to negative electrode
   has an average potential distribution in each electrode, and it revealed
   the best electrochemical performance: specific capacitor was 39.6

Abstract = {{Star polyelectrolytes with responsive properties to external stimuli,
   such as pH, temperature and ionic condition, were utilized to fabricate
   layer-by-layer (LbL) microcapsules. The microstructure of star
   polyelectrolytes was first studied in semi-dilute solution by in situ
   small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). These measurements show that with
   the addition of salts, arms of strong cationic star polyelectrolytes
   will contract and the spatial ordering of the stars would be
   interrupted. SANS measurements were also performed on the microcapsules
   in order to study their internal structure and responsive properties in
   solution. The results show that with the increase of shell thickness,
   microcapsules undergo a change of fractal dimension. Microcapsules with
   thinner shell have a surface fractal structure with rough interface,
   while those with thicker shell generally have a mass fractal structure
   of 3D random network. With the change of surrounding environment (pH,
   temperature, or ionic condition), the morphology and permeability of
   microcapsules are changed concurrently, for example, with the addition
   of multivalent salt, there is a surface- to mass-fractal transition,
   with the correlation length decreasing by around 50 \%. This study
   provides insight into the mechanism of the responsiveness of novel star
   polyelectrolytes and their assembled multilayer structures.}},

Abstract = {{Strategies to enhance, suppress, or qualitatively shape the immune
   response are of importance for diverse biomedical applications, such as
   the development of new vaccines, treatments for autoimmune diseases and
   allergies, strategies for regenerative medicine, and immunotherapies for
   cancer. However, the intricate cellular and molecular signals regulating
   the immune system are major hurdles to predictably manipulating the
   immune response and developing safe and effective therapies. To meet
   this challenge, biomaterials are being developed that control how,
   where, and when immune cells are stimulated in vivo, and that can finely
   control their differentiation in vitro. We review recent advances in the
   field of biomaterials for immunomodulation, focusing particularly on
   designing biomaterials to provide controlled immunostimulation,
   targeting drugs and vaccines to lymphoid organs, and serving as
   scaffolds to organize immune cells and emulate lymphoid tissues. These
   ongoing efforts highlight the many ways in which biomaterials can be
   brought to bear to engineer the immune system.}},

Abstract = {{Propulsion effort of manual wheelchairs, a major determinant of user
   mobility, is a function of human biomechanics and mechanical design.
   Human studies that investigate both variables simultaneously have
   resulted in largely inconsistent outcomes, motivating the implementation
   of a robotic propulsion system that characterizes the inherent
   mechanical performance of wheelchairs. This study investigates the
   impacts of mass and mass distribution on manual wheelchair propulsion by
   configuring an ultra-lightweight chair to two weights (12-kg and
   17.6-kg) and two load distributions (70\% and 55\% on drive wheels). The
   propulsion torques of these four configurations were measured for a
   straight maneuver and a fixed-wheel turn, on both tile and carpet.
   Results indicated that increasing mass to 17.6-kg had the largest effect
   on straight acceleration, requiring 7.4\% and 5.8\% more torque on tile
   and carpet, respectively. Reducing the drive wheel load to 55\% had the
   largest effect on steady-state straight motion and on both turning
   acceleration and steady-state turning; for tile and carpet, propulsion
   torque increased by 13.5\% and 11.8\%, 16.5\% and 4.1\%, 73\% and 5.1\%,
   respectively. These results demonstrate the robot's high sensitivity,
   and support the clinical importance of evaluating effects of wheelchair
   mass and axle position on propulsion effort across maneuvers and
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Analogical reasoning is not the only approach for achieving innovation,
   but it is a highly effective and noted method. To avoid relying on
   chance identification of analogies through unique individual knowledge
   and experience, this research considers the potential impact of a system
   where an engineer could begin with their existing design, specify to a
   computer a set of critical functions and desired design performance
   improvements, and be returned with design analogies intended to inspire
   avenues for design improvements. This system, called Design Analogy
   Performance Parameter System (D-APPS), implements performance metric
   matching to retrieve examples and stimulate analogical mapping, enabling
   innovative design advances.
   The D-APPS software, Design Repository \& Analogy Computation via
   Unit-Language Analysis (DRACULA), produces matches using topological

Abstract = {{The paper highlights the opportunities for Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   based product family design to operate in a much broader design space
   that is free from constraints which arise in traditional product family
   designs from finding a compromise between commonality and performance.
   The proposed method starts by establishing design requirements and
   defining the customization space. Subsequently a utility- based
   objective function is employed to optimize individual products for
   multiple objectives. The final step identifies potential commonalities
   that can be exploited in order to reduce the manufacturing cost. We
   incorporate an AM cost model into the product family design process and
   to explore the effects of eliminating the commonality requirement. To
   show the feasibility of the method, a family of finger pumps is
   investigated. The results show a significant performance improvement
   when compared to conventional product family design methods. The results
   also show that, with the advantages of AM, the customization cost is
   consistently low. These results provide confidence that the proposed
   method yields affordable customization without compromising individual
   product performances.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation and creativity research assists and enables designers to
   break the mold of everyday, expected designs and discover the
   delightful, but unexpected, meaning-rich, and radical through novel
   approaches to engineering problems and opportunities. Sustainability is
   one ``wicked problem{''} that requires innovative design thinking to
   change the interface between nature, society, economy and artifact. We
   surveyed perspectives on the innovation process from 59 design experts
   internationally through two separate workshops. In the first workshop,
   38 experts in innovation provided perspectives on the cognitive
   underpinnings and design processes relevant to innovation. In the
   second, 21 experts provided their perspectives on the same topics in
   light of sustainable design objectives. These findings show the two
   areas of research to be linked alternatives, and that future research
   into analogies, creativity, open-mindedness and the application of
   constraints can help bridge the gap between techniques in engineering
   design innovation and the applications of sustainable engineering
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial reverse electrodialysis cells (MRECs) combine power generation
   from salinity gradient energy using reverse electrodialysis (RED), with
   power generation from organic matter using a microbial fuel cell. Waste
   heat can be used to distill ammonium bicarbonate into high (HC) and low
   salt concentration (LC) solutions for use in the RED stack, but nitrogen
   crossover into the anode chamber must be minimized to avoid ammonia
   loses, and foster a healthy microbial community. To reduce nitrogen
   crossover, an additional low concentration (LC) chamber was inserted
   before the anode using an additional anion exchange membrane (AEM) next
   to another AEM, and filled with different amounts of anion or cation ion
   exchange resins. Addition of the extra AEM increased the ohmic
   resistance of the test RED stack from 103 Omega cm(2) (1 AEM) to 295
   Omega cm(2) (2 AEMs). However, the use of the anion exchange resin
   decreased the solution resistance of the LC chamber by 74\% (637 Omega
   cm(2), no resin; 166 Omega cm(2) with resin). Nitrogen crossover into
   the anode chamber was reduced by up to 97\% using 50\% of the chamber
   filled with an anion exchange resin compared to the control (no
   additional chamber). The added resistance contributed by the use of the
   additional LC chamber could be compensated for by using additional LC
   and HC membrane pairs in the RED stack.}},

Abstract = {{Energy demand is increasing dramatically due to the fast industrial
   development, rising population, expanding urbanization, and economic
   growth in the world and large amount of fossil fuels are widely used.
   The depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the environmental pollution
   caused by burning of fossil fuels stimulate development of alternative
   fuels. Biodiesel today is the most popular and promising biofuel and
   vegetable oils are one of the potential feedstocks for biodiesel
   production. In order to explore the wild oil plant sources in China, the
   fruit oil of Swida wilsoniana, a wild woody oil plant widely distributed
   in the mountainous regions of calcareous sandstone, was used to produce
   the biodiesel by transesterification method. The reaction parameters
   were optimized by an orthogonal experimental design. The results showed
   that Swida wilsoniana fruit oil (SWO) could be conversed to biodiesel at
   a wide range of reaction conditions. The optimum conditions for the
   reaction process were determined as: methanol/oil mole ratio 5:1,
   catalyst dosage 1.1\%, reaction temperature 60 degrees C, and reaction
   time 120 min. The characteristics of Swida wilsoniana biodiesel (SDBD)
   were analyzed, which was similar to that of 0\# diesel. Moreover, SDBD
   has the advantages of higher flash point (>105) and lower ash content
   (<0.003). Therefore, SDBD is a safe and clean biodiesel and a promising
   alternative biofuel.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{2203-2238}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the blind deconvolution of an image and an
   unknown blur in a coded imaging system. The measurements consist of
   subsampled convolution of an unknown blurring kernel with multiple
   random binary modulations (coded masks) of the image. To perform the
   deconvolution, we consider a standard lifting of the image and the
   blurring kernel that transforms the measurements into a set of linear
   equations of the matrix formed by their outer product. Any rank-one
   solution to this system of equations provides a valid pair of an image
   and a blur. We first express the necessary and sufficient conditions for
   the uniqueness of a rank-one solution under some additional assumptions
   (uniform subsampling and no limit on the number of coded masks). These
   conditions are a special case of a previously established result
   regarding identifiability in the matrix completion problem. We also
   characterize a low-dimensional subspace model for the blur kernel that
   is sufficient to guarantee identifiability, including the interesting
   instance of ``bandpass{''} blur kernels. Next, assuming the bandpass
   model for the blur kernel, we show that the image and the blur kernel
   can be found using nuclear norm minimization. Our main results show that
   recovery is achieved (with high probability) when the number of masks is
   on the order of mu log(2) L log Le/mu log log(N + 1), where mu is the
   coherence of the blur, L is the dimension of the image, and N is the
   number of measured samples per mask.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid proximal extragradient (HPE)
   self-concordant primal barrier method for solving a monotone variational
   inequality over a closed convex set endowed with a self-concordant
   barrier and with an underlying map that has Lipschitz continuous
   derivative. In contrast to the iteration of a previous method developed
   by the first and third authors that has to compute an approximate
   solution of a linearized variational inequality, the one of the present
   method solves a simpler Newton system of linear equations. The method
   performs two types of iterations, namely, those that follow ever
   changing interior paths and those that correspond to large-step HPE
   iterations. Due to its first-order nature, the present method is shown
   to have a better iteration-complexity than its zeroth order counterparts
   such as Korpelevich's algorithm and Tseng's modified forward-backward
   splitting method, although its work per iteration is larger than the one
   for the latter methods.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers the (two-player) composite Nash equilibrium (CNE)
   problem with a separable nonsmooth part, which is known to include the
   composite saddle-point (CSP) problem as a special case. Due to its
   two-block structure, this problem can be solved by any algorithm
   belonging to the block-decomposition hybrid proximal-extragradient
   (BD-HPE) framework proposed in {[}R. D. C. Monteiro and B. F. Svaiter,
   SIAM J. Optim., 23 (2013), pp. 475-507]. The framework consists of a
   family of inexact proximal point methods for solving a more general
   two-block structured monotone inclusion problem which, at every
   iteration, solves two prox subinclusions according to a certain relative
   error criterion. By exploiting the fact that the two prox subinclusions
   in the context of the CNE problem are equivalent to two composite convex
   programs, this article proposes a new instance of the BD-HPE framework
   that approximately solves them using an accelerated gradient method. It
   is shown that the new instance is able to take significantly larger prox
   stepsizes than other instances from this framework that perform single
   composite gradient steps for solving the subinclusions. As a result, it
   is shown that the first instance has better iteration-complexity than
   the latter ones. Finally, it is also shown that the new accelerated
   BD-HPE instance computationally outperforms several state-of-the-art
   algorithms on many relevant classes of CSP and CNE instances.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution imaging in ultraviolet (UV) bands has many applications
   in defense and commercial systems. The shortest wavelength is desired
   for increased spatial resolution, which allows for small pixels and
   large formats. The next frontier is to develop UV avalanche photodiode
   (UV-APD) arrays with high gain to demonstrate high-resolution imaging.
   We compare performance characteristics of front-illuminated
   Al0.05Ga0.95N UV-APDs grown on a free-standing (FS) GaN substrate and a
   GaN/sapphire template. UV-APDs grown on a FS-GaN substrate show lower
   dark current densities for all fabricated mesa sizes than similar
   UV-APDs grown on a GaN/sapphire template. In addition, stable avalanche
   gain higher than 5x10(5) and a significant increase in the responsivity
   of UV-APDs grown on a FS-GaN substrate are observed as a result of
   avalanche multiplication at high reverse bias. We believe that the high
   crystalline quality of Al0.05Ga0.95N UVAPDs grown on a FS-GaN substrate
   with low dislocation density is responsible for the observed improvement
   of low leakage currents, high performance photodetector characteristics,
   and reliability of the devices.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Machine failure modes are presenting a major burden to the operator, the
   plant, and the enterprise causing significant downtime, labor cost, and
   reduced revenue. New technologies are emerging over the past years to
   monitor the machine's performance, detect and isolate incipient failures
   or faults, and take appropriate actions to mitigate such detrimental
   events. This paper addresses the development and application of novel
   Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technologies to a prototype
   machining process (a screw-tightening machine). The enabling
   technologies are built upon a series of tasks starting with failure
   analysis, testing, and data processing aimed to extract useful features
   or condition indicators from raw data, a symbolic regression modeling
   framework, and a Bayesian estimation method called particle filtering to
   predict the feature state estimate accurately. The detection scheme
   declares the fault of a machine critical component with user specified
   accuracy or confidence and given false alarm rate while the prediction
   algorithm estimates accurately the remaining useful life of the failing
   component. Simulation results support the efficacy of the approach and
   match well the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The ionosphere is the ionized uppermost layer of our atmosphere (from 70
   - 500 km altitude) where free electron densities yield peak critical
   frequencies in the HF (3 - 30 MHz) range. The ionosphere thus provides a
   quiescent plasma target, stable on timescales of minutes, for a whole
   host of active plasma experiments. High power RF experiments on
   ionospheric plasma conducted in the U.S. have been reported since 1970.
   The largest HF transmitter built to date is the HAARP phased-array HF
   transmitter near Gakona, Alaska which can deliver up to 3.6 Gigawatts
   (ERP) of CW RF power in the range of 2.8 - 10 MHz to the ionosphere with
   microsecond pointing, power modulation, and frequency agility. With an
   ionospheric background thermal energy in the range of only 0.1 eV, this
   amount of power gives access to the highest regimes of the nonlinearity
   (RF intensity to thermal pressure) ratio. HAARP's unique features have
   enabled the conduct of a number of unique nonlinear plasma experiments
   in the interaction region of overdense ionospheric plasma including
   generation of artificial aurorae, artificial ionization layers, VLF
   wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere, parametric
   instabilities, stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE), strong
   Langmuir turbulence (SLT) and suprathermal electron acceleration.
   Diagnostics include the Modular UHF Ionospheric Radar (MUIR) sited at
   HAARP, the SuperDARN-Kodiak HF radar, spacecraft radio beacons, HF
   receivers to record stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) and
   telescopes and cameras for optical emissions. We report on short
   timescale ponderomotive overshoot effects, artificial field-aligned
   irregularities (AFAI), the aspect angle dependence of the intensity of
   the HF-enhanced plasma line, and production of suprathermal electrons.
   One of the primary missions of HAARP, has been the generation of ELF
   (300 - 3000 Hz) and VLF (3 - 30 kHz) radio waves which are guided to
   global distances in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. We review recent
   efforts to improve the efficiency of the generation ELF/VLF and develop
   alternative mechanisms that do not require a natural ionospheric
   current. Applications include the controlled study of ionospheric
   irregularities affecting spacecraft communication and navigation
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Forward looking (FL) imaging catheters would be an important tool for
   several intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and intracardiac
   echocardiography (ICE) applications. Single chip capacitive
   micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays fabricated on
   front-end CMOS electronics with simplified electrical interconnect have
   been previously developed for highly flexible and compact catheters. In
   this study, we present a custom built real time imaging system utilizing
   catheters with single chip CMUT-on-CMOS arrays and show initial imaging
   results. The fabricated array has a dual-ring structure with 64 transmit
   (Tx) and 56 receive (Rx) elements. The CMUT arrays fit on a 2.1 mm
   diameter circular region with all the required front-end electronics.
   The device operates at 12 MHz center frequency and has around 20 V
   collapse voltage. The single-chip system requires 13 external
   connections including 4 Rx channels and power lines. The electrical
   connections to micro cables in the catheter are made from the top side
   of the chip using polyimide flex tapes. The device is placed on a 6-Fr
   catheter shaft and secured with a medical grade silicon rubber. For real
   time data acquisition, we developed a custom design FPGA based imaging
   platform to generate digital control sequences for the chip and collect
   RF data from Rx outputs. We performed imaging experiments using wire
   phantoms immersed in water to test the real time imaging system. The
   system has the potential to generate images at 32 fps rate with the
   particular catheter. The overall system is fully functional and shows
   promising image performance.}},

Abstract = {{An interdisciplinary design approach is essential to solve critical
   engineering challenges, yet few eng. curricula cultivate
   interdisciplinary design thinking, particularly early on. Most
   fundamentals courses are taught independently, often viewed as isolated
   subjects. We consider a framework for core eng. subjects, Structures \&
   Materials and Circuits \& Electronics, to gauge if proposed design
   activities can 1) reinforce concepts taught in each course, 2) enable
   students to see coexistence of both subjects in applications, 3) advance
   innovation/design skillsets/mindset and 4) increase confidence in
   solving interdisciplinary problems. To achieve concrete experience and
   reflective observation of Kolb's model, three design problems are posed
   to target challenges in energy, aerospace and healthcare. The activities
   foster deductive learning based on earlier concepts and require their
   interdisciplinary application. Participants report more confidence with
   interdisciplinary design projects and better grasp of interdisciplinary
   requirements in solving technical challenges (p<0.05). Positive feedback
   from instructors/students indicates attainment of additional desired

Abstract = {{Aims: Here we report a one-step approach for reproducible synthesis of
   finely tuned targeting multifunctional hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs).
   Materials \& methods: A microfluidic-assisted method was employed for
   controlled nanoprecipitation of bisphosphonate-conjugated
   poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) chains, while coencapsulating
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and the anticancer drug
   Paclitaxel. Results: Smaller and more compact HNPs with narrower size
   distribution and higher drug loading were obtained at microfluidic rapid
   mixing regimen compared with the conventional bulk method. The HNPs were
   shown to have a strong affinity for hydroxyapatite, as demonstrated in
   vitro bone-binding assay, which was further supported by molecular
   dynamics simulation results. In vivo proof of concept study verified the
   prolonged circulation of targeted microfluidic HNPs. Biodistribution as
   well as noninvasive bioimaging experiments showed high tumor
   localization and suppression of targeted HNPs to the bone metastatic
   tumor. Conclusion: The hybrid bone-targeting nanoparticles with
   adjustable characteristics can be considered as promising nanoplatforms
   for various theragnostic applications.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally
   suppress gene expression through sequence-specific interaction with the
   30 untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs. By modulating gene
   networks, miRNAs have been shown to regulate many aspects of cellular
   homeostasis and physiology, including differentiation, growth,
   proliferation, and apoptosis. The discovery of extracellular miRNA in
   blood and other body fluids has prompted investigation into their
   ability to serve as biomarkers for human disease. Further, many miRNAs
   have been implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of human disease,
   and there is substantial opportunity to develop novel molecular
   therapeutics through manipulation of these miRNAs. Here, we review the
   evidence for the use of miRNAs as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in
   human disease. We also describe the advantages and limitations for
   current miRNA profiling strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Grain size is important to the effect of material performance,
   particularly when reduced to nanoscale size. Generally, ionic
   conductivity in solid electrolytes can be remarkably enhanced by the
   nanostructure ceramics. In this study, a shrouded plasma torch was used

   shielding was used to realize the controlling of grain size during the
   deposition process. The deposition behavior of YSZ was studied. The
   surface and cross-sectional morphology of the coating layer were also
   investigated. An island structure consisting of nano particle was seen
   on the coating layer surface, and the particle size becomes smaller with
   increased shielding stage. The cross section morphology of fracture
   coatings showed columnar structure. In this work, the grain size of the
   YSZ coating layer can be successfully controlled minimum to 25 nm by
   PS-PVD process. The effect of YSZ grain size on the coating properties
   is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This research studies multi-physics simulation of a frequency doubling
   antenna sensor for wireless strain measurement. The frequency doubling
   technology allows easy distinguishing of backscattered passive sensor
   signal (at the doubled frequency 2f) from environmental reflection (at
   original reader interrogation frequency f). Upon bonding to a base
   structure, because strain/deformation causes resonance frequency change
   of the antenna sensor, the passive wireless antenna sensor can be used
   to measure strain in the underlying base structure. To accurately model
   the mechanical and electromagnetic behaviors of the frequency doubling
   antenna sensor, a multi-physics coupled simulation approach is proposed.
   For simulating both the matching network performance and the antenna
   behavior under strain/deformation, two commercial software packages,
   COMSOL and ADS, are combined to leverage the strength of each package.}},

Abstract = {{The ground penetrating radar (GPR) nondestructive evaluation (NDE)
   method often uses the attenuation map to evaluate the health condition
   of the reinforced concrete bridge decks. The attenuation map is commonly
   generated by using traditional migration techniques, which require
   Nyquist-rate time samples of the received data and fine spatial
   sampling. Recent progress in the compressive sensing (CS) theory and its
   development in the application of GPR provide an alternative migration
   method for high-resolution and less cluttered images with a small amount
   of CS measurements for sparse point-like targets, which can be satisfied
   in GPR probing of reinforced concrete bridge decks in the two
   dimensional sense. However, the previous imaging method for GPR landmine
   detection using the CS-based migration mainly focuses on the target
   detection and localization, but fails to correctly preserve the relative
   reflection amplitudes. As the attenuation mapping is the major
   network-level evaluation tool for bridge deck evaluation using GPR, the
   relative intensities of the rebar reflections are of vital importance
   for this application. A modified CS-based imaging method with
   segmentation is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. The
   proposed approach can not only preserve the comparative amplitudes, but
   can also highly decrease the processing speed and the requirement of the
   computer memory. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
   demonstrated using GPR numerical simulation data in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Wavefields obtained from the measurement of Lamb waves propagating
   through a solid media by a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) are very rich

   the number of point measurements necessary to the application of SHM
   techniques. The process extrapolates the information con-tained in M
   measurements to reconstruct a wavefield on a grid of P pixels with the
   condition M < P, using a basis of functions created from the dispersion
   relations of the media and the propagation laws of lamb waves.
   Reconstructions of experimental and analytical uni-dimensional
   wavefields are detailed to validate the concept. The development of this
   process is a first step towards fast large scale defect detection
   techniques by LDV in SHM.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{23360-23367}},
Abstract = {{Upconversion/semiconductor submicron hollow spheres composed of inner
   NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er shell and outer TiO2 shell (denoted
   NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2) were, for the first time, crafted by exploiting
   colloidal carbon spheres as the scaffold. The hollow spheres were then
   incorporated into the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode to yield
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with improved performance. The
   implementation of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres in DSSCs imparted
   the light trapping due to the light scattering from submicron hollow
   spheres, and the harvesting of near infrared solar photons by the
   upconversion material (i.e., dual functionalities), thereby resulting in
   an increased short-circuit current density J(sc), and thus an improved
   power conversion efficiency PCE. The electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy measurements were performed to scrutinize the interfacial
   charge transfer characteristics of DSSCs. The measurements revealed that
   when NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er hollow spheres without the deposition of TiO2 shell
   were integrated in the photoanode, a high charge transfer resistance was
   found. In stark contrast, the judicious decoration of NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er
   hollow spheres with a thin layer of TiO2 shell markedly improved the
   contact between the resulting NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 shell/shell hollow
   spheres and the TiO2 nanoparticle film photoanode, leading to a much
   decreased charge transfer resistance. Taken together, compared to the
   PCE of 6.81\% for the pristine device, the DSSC assembled with the
   introduction of 8 wt\% NaxGdFyOz:Yb/Er@TiO2 hollow spheres in the
   photoanode exhibited an optimal PCE of 7.58\% and a maximum
   short-circuit current density J(sc) of 18.72 mA cm(-2) under AM 1.5G one
   sun illumination, corresponding to 11.31\% performance enhancement. As
   such, the implementation of upconversion submicron hollow materials in
   photoanode may stand out as an intriguing strategy to improve the device
   performance of DSSCs.}},

Abstract = {{Density Functional Theory (DFT) based force fields (FFs) for Ar and Xe
   adsorption in six metalorganic frameworks were developed using three DFT
   functionals (PBE-D2, vdW-DF, vdW-DF2) in periodic systems. These force
   fields include van der Waals (vdW) and polarization terms, and the
   effect of the latter was shown to be small. Using our DFT-derived and
   standard (UFF) FFs in grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations,
   adsorption isotherms and heats of adsorption were calculated and
   compared with experiment. In most of the cases, it was possible to
   accurately predict adsorption isotherms using one of the DFT-derived
   FFs. Still, among the DFT functionals investigated, no single DFT
   functional could accurately describe all of the adsorbate-framework
   interactions. On average, performance of UFF and PBE-D2 based FFs to
   predict experimental isotherms were at a similar quality, still, UFF was
   slightly superior. Although vdW-DF2 based FFs predicted experimental
   isotherms almost perfectly for ZIF-8 and HKUST-1 up to 20 bar, their
   average performance was less than that of PBE-D2 based FFs.
   Nevertheless, the overall performance of UFF, PBE-D2 and vDW-DF2 FFs was
   similar. Lastly, vdW-DF based FFs always over-predicted experiments.}},

Title = {{Out-of-Plane Elastic Waves in 2D Models of Solids: A Case Study for a
   Nonlocal Discretization Scheme with Reduced Numerical Dispersion}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The paper addresses the problem of numerical dispersion in simulations
   of wave propagation in solids. This characteristic of numerical models
   results from both spatial discretization and temporal discretization
   applied to carry out transient analyses. A denser mesh of degrees of
   freedom could be a straightforward solution to mitigate numerical
   dispersion, since it provides more advantageous relation between the
   model length scale and considered wavelengths. However, this approach
   also leads to higher computational effort. An alternative approach is
   the application of nonlocal discretization schemes, which employ a
   relatively sparse spatial distribution of nodes. Numerical analysis
   carried out to study the propagation of elastic waves in isotropic solid
   materials is demonstrated. Fourier-based nonlocal discretization for
   continuum mechanics is introduced for a two-dimensional model undergoing
   out-of-plane wave propagation. The results show gradual increase of the
   effectiveness of this approach while expanding the region of nonlocal
   interactions in the numerical model. A challenging case of high ratio
   between the model length scale and wavelength is investigated to present
   capability of the proposed approach. The elaborated discretization
   method also provides the perspective of accurate representation of any
   arbitrarily shaped dispersion relation based on physical properties of
   modelled materials.}},

Abstract = {{Laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM)
   process that enables fabrication of functional metal parts with
   near-net-shape geometries. The drawback to L-PBF is its lack of
   precision as well as the formation of defects due to process randomness
   and irregularities associated with laser powder fusion. Over the past
   two decades much research has been conducted to control laser powder
   fusion in order to provide parts of higher quality.
   This paper addresses online quality monitoring in AM by in-situ
   automated visual inspection of each layer which is aimed to geometric
   objects and defects from high-resolution visual images. A scheme for
   online defect detection system is presented that consists of three
   levels of processing: low-level, intermediate-level, and high-level
   processing. Each level is described and appropriately divided to several
   stages, when insightful. Techniques that are feasible in each level for
   successful defect detection and classification are identified and
   described. Requirements and specifications of the measurement data to
   achieve desired performance of the online defect detection system are
   stated.
   Image processing algorithms are developed for first level of processing
   and implemented for segmentation of geometric objects. Due to the large
   variation of intensities within the powder region and fused regions, and
   also the non-multi-modal nature of the image, the basic segmentation
   algorithms such as thresholding do not produce appropriate results. In
   this work, morphological operations are effectively designed and
   implemented following thresholding to achieve the desired object
   segmentation. Examples of implementations are given. The paper provides
   the results of object segmentation which is the initial stage of
   development of an in-situ automated visual inspection for L-PBF process.}},

Abstract = {{In the years since the Cold War; the aerospace industry has seen a shift
   towards affordability-based design from the primarily petformance-based
   designs of the past era. While many techniques, such as IPPD and PLM,
   have been implemented in support of this shift recent developments in
   the industry have led to major cost overruns and production delays. The
   increased prevalence of demand variability in the aerospace industry and
   the difficulty to rapidly adapt production plans are a primary cause of
   these issues. Furthermore, traditional aircraft designers perform
   detailed manufacturing cost analysis late in the design process when the
   majority of the pro gram costs are already committed. With the recent
   shift to more composite aerostructures, historical regressions and cost
   estimating relationships used to predict cost and manufacturability are
   no longer accurate, so postponing more detailed cost analyses to later
   design phases can lead to high costs due to sub-optimal early design
   decisions. The methodology presented in this paper addresses these
   problems by providing the ability to conduct multi-disciplinary trades
   in the early stages of design, when a large amount of design freedom and
   cost savings opportunities exist.
   To enable these multi-disciplinary trades, this paper describes how
   aircraft performance considerations are integrated with production rate,
   manufacturing cost, and financial planning metrics into a parametric,
   visual trade-off environment. The environment, combined with a
   multi-objective optimization routine, facilitate effective
   affordability-based trades during the early stages of design. An F-86
   Sabre redesigned wingbox using 3 separate manufacturing concepts is used
   as a proof-of-concept for this research.}},

Abstract = {{During physical therapy intervention protocols, it's important to
   consider the individual's intrinsic motivation to perform in-home
   recommended exercises. Physical therapy exercises can become tedious
   thus limiting the individual's progress. Not only have researchers
   developed serious gaming systems to increase user motivation, but they
   have also worked on the design aesthetics since results have shown
   positive effects on the users' performance for attractive models. As
   such, we improved the aesthetics of a previously developed serious game
   called Super Pop VR (TM). Namely, we improved the game graphics, added
   new game features, and allowed for more game options to provide users
   the opportunity to tailor their own experience. The conducted user
   studies show that participants rank the version of the game with the
   improved aesthetics higher in terms of the amount of interest/enjoyment
   it generates, thus allowing for an increase in intrinsic motivation when

Abstract = {{Cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC) measurements performed at 14
   locations around the world within the European Integrated project on
   Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality interactions (EUCAARI) framework
   have been analysed and discussed with respect to the cloud condensation
   nuclei (CCN) activation and hygroscopic properties of the atmospheric
   aerosol. The annual mean ratio of activated cloud condensation nuclei
   (N-CCN) to the total number concentration of particles (N-CN), known as
   the activated fraction A, shows a similar functional dependence on
   supersaturation S at many locations - exceptions to this being certain
   marine locations, a free troposphere site and background sites in
   south-west Germany and northern Finland. The use of total number
   concentration of particles above 50 and 100 nm diameter when calculating
   the activated fractions (A(50) and A(100), respectively) renders a much
   more stable dependence of A on S; A(50) and A(100) also reveal the
   effect of the size distribution on CCN activation. With respect to
   chemical composition, it was found that the hygroscopicity of aerosol
   particles as a function of size differs among locations. The
   hygroscopicity parameter kappa decreased with an increasing size at a
   continental site in south-west Germany and fluctuated without any
   particular size dependence across the observed size range in the remote
   tropical North Atlantic and rural central Hungary. At all other
   locations kappa increased with size. In fact, in Hyytiala, Vavihill,
   Jungfraujoch and Pallas the difference in hygroscopicity between Aitken
   and accumulation mode aerosol was statistically significant at the 5\%
   significance level. In a boreal environment the assumption of a
   size-independent kappa can lead to a potentially substantial
   overestimation of N-CCN at S levels above 0.6 \%. The same is true for
   other locations where kappa was found to increase with size. While
   detailed information about aerosol hygroscopicity can significantly
   improve the prediction of N-CCN, total aerosol number concentration and
   aerosol size distribution remain more important parameters. The seasonal
   and diurnal patterns of CCN activation and hygroscopic properties vary
   among three long-term locations, highlighting the spatial and temporal
   variability of potential aerosol-cloud interactions in various
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Irregular applications are challenging to scale on supercomputers due to
   the difficulty of balancing load across large numbers of nodes. This
   challenge is exacerbated by the increasing heterogeneity of modern
   supercomputers in which nodes often contain multiple processors and
   coprocessors operating at different speeds, and with differing core and
   thread counts. We present Dtree, a dynamic task scheduler designed to
   address this challenge. Dtree shows close to optimal results for a class
   of HPC applications, improving time-to-solution by achieving
   near-perfect load balance while consuming negligible resources. We
   demonstrate Dtree's effectiveness on up to 77,824 heterogeneous cores of
   the TACC Stampede supercomputer with two different petascale HPC
   applications: ParaBLe, which performs large-scale Bayesian network
   structure learning, and GTFock, which implements Fock matrix
   construction, an essential and expensive step in quantum chemistry
   codes. For ParaBLe, we show improved performance while eliminating the
   complexity of managing heterogeneity. For GTFock, we match the most
   recently published performance without using any application-specific
   optimizations for data access patterns (such as the task distribution
   design for communication reduction) that enabled that performance. We
   also show that Dtree can distribute from tens of thousands to hundreds
   of millions of irregular tasks across up to 1024 nodes with minimal
   overhead, while balancing load to within 2\% of optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous transition metal oxides,
   particularly those involving different metal ions of mixed valence
   states and constructed from interconnected nano-building blocks directly
   grown on conductive current collectors, are promising electrode
   candidates for energy storage devices such as Li-ion batteries (LIBs)
   and supercapacitors (SCs). This study reports a facile and scalable
   chemical bath deposition process combined with simple calcination for
   fabricating 3D hierarchically porous Zn-Ni-Co oxide (ZNCO) nanosheet
   arrays directly grown on Ni foam with robust adhesion. The resulting
   nanostructures are then evaluated as a binder-free electrode for LIBs
   and SCs. Given its unique architecture and compositional advantages, the
   electrode exhibits a reversible capacity of 1131 mA h g(-1) after 50
   cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1), an excellent long-term
   cycling stability at a high current density of 1 A g(-1) for 1000
   cycles, and a desirable rate capability when tested as an anode for
   LIBs. When used for SCs, the electrode demonstrates a high specific
   capacitance (1728 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), an outstanding rate capability
   (72\% capacitance retention from 1 A g(-1) to 50 A g(-1)), and an
   excellent cycling stability (capacitance of 1655 F g(-1) after 5000
   cycles at a current density of 20 A g(-1) with 108.6\% retention).
   Overall, the unique 3D hierarchically porous ZNCO nanosheets hold a
   great promise for constructing high-performance energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{A series of polystyrene-based light harvesting polymers featuring
   pendant polypyridyl ruthenium complexes has been synthesized. The
   polymer backbones were prepared by nitroxide-mediated radical
   polymerization with a variable average molecular weight (M-n) ranging
   from similar to 5500 to similar to 24 000 g mol(-1). Pendant Ru(II)
   polypyridyl complexes were grafted to the polymer backbone by
   azide-alkyne click chemistry to afford chromophore loaded polymers. The
   resulting polystyrene-based polychromophores with pendant Ru(II)
   polypyridyl complexes (PS-Ru) were characterized by nuclear magnetic
   resonance and infrared spectroscopy, confirming the high efficiency of
   the click grafting. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of
   the series of PS-Ru polymers were characterized in solution and
   investigated as a function of polymer chain length and solvent. The
   electrochemical properties of PS-Ru maintained the characteristics of
   the individual Ru(II) polypyridyl units. Emission quantum yield and
   lifetime studies reveal that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)
   excited states are quenched to a variable extent depending on the
   molecular weight of the polymers, consistent with intramolecular energy
   transfer and self-quenching in polymers with longer chain lengths. To
   support the synthetic effort, molecular dynamics simulations of the
   polypyridyl ruthenium derivatized polystyrenes in different solvents
   were conducted.}},

   motor (PMSM) are generated by the distortion of air-gap magnetic field
   and the nonlinear characteristics of inverter, resulting in the ripple
   of electromagnetic torque. In this paper, a novel harmonic compensation
   algorithm was proposed to solve this problem. Based on the harmonic
   model of the PMSM, harmonic voltage is injected to reduce harmonic
   components of the motor flux and current. By extraction of harmonic
   flux/current and injection of harmonic voltage in real-time, high-order
   harmonics of flux generated by the distortion of air-gap magnetic field
   and the nonlinear characteristics of inverter is counteracted. Thereby,
   distortion of motor current is reduced. The effectiveness of the
   algorithm is validated by simulation and experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of residual stresses on the fatigue behavior as well as the
   dimensional stability of high precision part is very important.
   Machining operation consists generally multi-step operations from
   roughing to finishing. It is therefore critical to predict residual
   stresses under such configuration. In this paper, an analytical
   algorithm is proposed to predict the final residual stresses induced by
   a multi-step machining operation capturing the change of stress state of
   the workpiece as well as material hardening behavior during the
   multi-step orthogonal cutting. The model predictions were compared to
   other work's finite element method (FEM) predictions.}},

Title = {{A high-performance hydroxyl-functionalized polymer of intrinsic
   microporosity for an environmentally attractive membrane-based approach
   to decontamination of sour natural gas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Abstract = {{Acid gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are important
   and highly undesirable contaminants in natural gas, and membrane-based
   removal of these contaminants is environmentally attractive. Although
   removal of CO2 from natural gas using membranes is well established in
   industry, there is limited research on H2S removal, mainly due to its
   toxic nature. In actual field operations, wellhead pressures can exceed
   50 bar with H2S concentrations up to 20\%. Membrane plasticization and
   competitive mixed-gas sorption, which can both lead to a loss of
   separation efficiency, are likely to occur under these aggressive feed
   conditions, and this is almost always accompanied by a significant
   decrease in membrane selectivity. In this paper, permeation and
   separation properties of a hydroxyl-functionalized polymer with
   intrinsic microporosity (PIM-6FDA-OH) are reported for mixed-gas feeds
   containing CO2, H2S or the combined pair with CH4. The pure-gas
   permeation results show no H2S-induced plasticization of the PIM-6FDA-OH
   film in a pure H2S feed at 35 degrees C up to 4.5 bar, and revealed only
   a slight plasticization up to 8 bar of pure H2S. The
   hydroxyl-functionalized PIM membrane exhibited a significant pure-gas
   CO2 plasticization resistance up to 28 bar feed pressure. Mixed-gas
   (15\% H2S/15\% CO2/70\% CH4) permeation results showed that the
   hydroxyl-functionalized PIM membrane maintained excellent separation
   performance even under exceedingly challenging feed conditions. The CO2
   and H2S permeability isotherms indicated minimal CO2-induced
   plasticization; however, H2S-induced plasticization effects were evident
   at the highest mixed gas feed pressure of 48 bar. Under this extremely
   aggressive mixed gas feed, the binary CO2/CH4 and H2S/CH4
   permselectivities, and the combined CO2 and H2S acid gas selectivity
   were 25, 30 and 55, respectively. Our results indicate that
   OH-functionalized PIM materials are very promising candidate membrane
   materials for simultaneous removal of CO2 and H2S from aggressive
   natural gas feeds, which makes membrane-based gas separation technology
   an attractive option for clean energy production and reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions.}},

Abstract = {{We present a highly flexible dye-sensitized solar cell composed of TiO2
   nanotube arrays (TNARs) as the photoanode and a transparent Pt network
   electrode as the counter electrode (CE). The network-structured Pt
   electrodes can be transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates at room
   temperature and exhibit remarkable mechanical flexibility in bending and
   twisting tests. Up to 94\% transmittance for Pt network electrodes can
   be obtained when the sheet resistances are over 170 Omega sq(-1). The CV
   and EIS analyses of the Pt networks reveal a comparable electrocatalytic
   behavior with the thermally deposited Pt particles on FTO glass. A
   photoelectric-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.82\% was obtained by
   utilizing Pt networks as CEs in TNAR based DSSCs and maintained >90\%
   PCE after 200 bending cycles. Such metal network based electrodes would
   be widely used not only in flexible solar cells but also in other
   wearable, lightweight electronic devices.}},

   Ag@Ag-Au core-frame nanocubes with enhanced plasmonic and catalytic
   properties}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Abstract = {{We report a new strategy for the synthesis of Ag@Ag-Au core-frame
   nanocubes by co-titrating AgNO3 and HAuCl4 concomitantly into an aqueous
   suspension of Ag nanocubes in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and
   poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) at room temperature. When the molar ratio of
   AgNO3 to HAuCl4 was larger than three, we discovered that the added Ag+
   ions could effectively push the galvanic replacement reaction between Ag
   nanocubes and HAuCl4 backward and thus inhibit it, making it possible to
   achieve the co-reduction of the two precursors by AA without involving
   any galvanic replacement. By increasing the volumes of the two
   co-titrated precursors, we validated that the added AgNO3 and HAuCl4
   were completely reduced to Ag and Au atoms, respectively, followed by
   their co-deposition onto the edges, corners, and then side faces of the
   Ag nanocubes in a fashion similar to seeded growth. As a result, the
   co-titration process offers an exquisite control over the relative
   amounts of Ag and Au atoms being deposited by simply varying the feeding
   ratio between the two precursors. We also demonstrated that the Ag@Ag-Au
   core-frame nanocubes exhibited unique plasmonic properties. Upon etching
   of the Ag templates from the core-frame nanocubes by an oxidant, we
   obtained Ag-Au nanoframes that could serve as an active catalyst for the
   reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH4.}},

Title = {{Interrelationship Between Airport Enplanements and Accessibility Case of
   Three Airports in Metropolitan Washington, DC, Region}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2501}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly, because urbanized areas have access to multiple airports,
   airlines must compete for passengers. One such location is the
   Washington, D.C., metropolitan area with three international airports
   within a 30-mi radius, each governed by a different planning authority.
   A traveler's choice to fly from a particular airport depends on a number
   of factors, chiefly convenient accessibility to the airport.
   Transportation planning agencies in the area often plan for network
   improvements to provide the best accessibility to a single major
   airport, although such improvements may also provide accessibility
   benefits to airports outside their jurisdiction. This paper presents an
   approach to estimate airport accessibility by highway and transit for
   both peak and off-peak hours. Furthermore, accessibility to these
   airports for a base year and a 20-year planning horizon are measured.
   The accessibility measure presented in the paper incorporates congestion
   travel times as obtained from a travel demand model. The results show
   that accessibility varies greatly for competing airports and, with that
   variation, there appears to be a correlation with total airport
   enplanements. The analysis also reveals the importance of taking a
   multimodal and multiple time-of-day approach to accessibility analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a graphene-based nanocomposite was prepared for use as a
   high-capacity supercapacitor electrode using triethanolamine (TEA) as an
   inter-layer spacer Via a controlled hydrothermal process. The chemical
   functionalization of the molecular spacer onto the reduced graphene
   oxide (rGO) surface considerably increased the specific surface area and
   generated a 3D porous graphene network for efficient ionic diffusion and
   transport. In addition, the formation of oxygen-containing groups in the
   composite could effectively tune the surface chemistry, making the
   electrolyte ions more accessible to the electrode nanostructure. The
   unique compositional and structural features of the TEA/rGO were
   confirmed by several techniques, including TGA, FTIR, XPS, XRD and BET
   measurement. The as-fabricated electrode exhibited a superior
   capacitance of 211 F g(-1) in a two-electrode configuration with
   excellent rate performance, low charge transfer resistance and
   outstanding cycling stability (91.7\% of initial capacitance retained
   after 10 000 cycles). Furthermore, a maximum energy density of 25.7 W h
   kg(-1) was achieved in organic electrolytes at a potential of 2.5 V.
   These impressive electrochemical characteristics of the TEA/rGO
   composite make it highly promising for high performance energy storage
   applications.}},

   devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{21856-21863}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a highly soluble PCBM-based thermo-cross-linkable
   fullerene precursor has been synthesized for use in bulk heterojunction
   based organic solar cells. The cross-linking was achieved using a
   thermally activated benzocyclobutene (BCB) molecule. The
   thermo-crosslinking reaction is initiated at temperatures as low as 150
   degrees C. Compared to PCBM, the cross-linked fullerene is highly
   insoluble and has a diffusional mobility in poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) that is an order of magnitude slower than PCBM. Its electron
   mobility is comparable to that of PCBM and organic photovoltaic (OPV)
   devices consisting of bulk heterojunction active layers with P3HT or
   PTB7 and this fullerene show very similar efficiencies. Devices prepared
   either with pure cross-linked fullerene or its mixture with PCBM as
   acceptors in OPVs have been shown to be highly stable to accelerated
   aging with little loss in device efficiency up to 48 hours of aging at
   150 degrees C. This compares to a loss of 60\% of initial efficiency in
   identically prepared devices when using PCBM as the acceptor. Optical
   microscopy and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)
   shows that a probable cause for this excellent stability in the
   cross-linked fullerene containing BHJs is associated with a significant
   inhibition of formation of crystals of fullerene.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{44}},
Pages = {{22432-22440}},
Abstract = {{A test set of chemically and topologically diverse Metal-Organic
   Frameworks (MOFs) with high accuracy experimentally derived
   crystallographic structure data was compiled. The test set was used to
   benchmark the performance of Density Functional Theory (DFT) functionals
   (M06L, PBE, PW91, PBE-D2, PBE-D3, and vdW-DF2) for predicting lattice
   parameters, unit cell volume, bonded parameters and pore descriptors. On
   average PBE-D2, PBE-D3, and vdW-DF2 predict more accurate structures,
   but all functionals predicted pore diameters within 0.5 angstrom of the
   experimental diameter for every MOF in the test set. The test set was
   also used to assess the variance in performance of DFT functionals for
   elastic properties and atomic partial charges. The DFT predicted elastic
   properties such as minimum shear modulus and Young's modulus can differ
   by an average of 3 and 9 GPa for rigid MOFs such as those in the test
   set. The partial charges calculated by vdW-DF2 deviate the most from
   other functionals while there is no significant difference between the
   partial charges calculated by M06L, PBE, PW91, PBE-D2 and PBE-D3 for the
   MOFs in the test set. We find that while there are differences in the
   magnitude of the properties predicted by the various functionals, these
   discrepancies are small compared to the accuracy necessary for most
   practical applications.}},

Title = {{A controlled, before-and-after trial of an urban sanitation intervention
   to reduce enteric infections in children: research protocol for the
   Maputo Sanitation (MapSan) study, Mozambique}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Access to safe sanitation in low-income, informal
   settlements of Sub-Saharan Africa has not significantly improved since
   1990. The combination of a high faecal-related disease burden and
   inadequate infrastructure suggests that investment in expanding
   sanitation access in densely populated urban slums can yield important
   public health gains. No rigorous, controlled intervention studies have
   evaluated the health effects of decentralised (non-sewerage) sanitation
   in an informal urban setting, despite the role that such technologies
   will likely play in scaling up access.
   Methods and analysis: We have designed a controlled, before-and-after
   (CBA) trial to estimate the health impacts of an urban sanitation
   intervention in informal neighbourhoods of Maputo, Mozambique, including
   an assessment of whether exposures and health outcomes vary by localised
   population density. The intervention consists of private pour-flush
   latrines (to septic tank) shared by multiple households in compounds or
   household clusters. We will measure objective health outcomes in
   approximately 760 children (380 children with household access to
   interventions, 380 matched controls using existing shared private
   latrines in poor sanitary conditions), at 2 time points: immediately
   before the intervention and at follow-up after 12 months. The primary
   outcome is combined prevalence of selected enteric infections among
   children under 5 years of age. Secondary outcome measures include
   soil-transmitted helminth (STH) reinfection in children following
   baseline deworming and prevalence of reported diarrhoeal disease. We
   will use exposure assessment, faecal source tracking, and microbial
   transmission modelling to examine whether and how routes of exposure for
   diarrhoeagenic pathogens and STHs change following introduction of
   effective sanitation.
   Ethics: Study protocols have been reviewed and approved by human
   subjects review boards at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
   Medicine, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of North
   Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Ministry of Health, Republic of
   Mozambique.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of epoxides has been performed
   in a shell-crosslinked micellar (SCM) nanoreactor consisting of
   amphiphilic triblock copolymers based on poly(2-oxazline) s polymer
   derivatives with attached Co(III)-salens to the micelle core. To
   investigate the effect of the molecular interaction of reactant/product
   molecules with the SCM nanoreactor on the rate of HKR, we calculated the
   Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (w) using the molecular dynamics
   simulation method. For this, the blend systems were constructed with
   various compositions such as 15, 45, and 70 wt\% of the reactant/product
   molecules with respect to the polymers such as
   poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMOX), poly(2-(3-butinyl)-2- oxazoline)
   (PBOX), and poly(methyl-3-oxazol-2-yl) pentanoate with Co(III)-salen
   (PSCoX). From the chi parameters, we demonstrate that the miscibility of
   reactants/products with polymers has a strong correlation with the
   experimental reaction rate of the HKR: phenyl glycidyl ether (Reac-OPh)
   > epoxyhexane (Reac-C4) > styrene oxide (Reac-Ph) 4 epichlorohydrin
   (Reac-Cl). To validate this finding, we also conducted the potential of
   mean force analysis using steered molecular dynamics simulation for the
   molecular displacement of Reac-Cl and Reac-OPh through PMOX and PSCoX,
   revealing that the free energy reduction was greater when Reac-OPh
   molecule enters the polymer phase compared to Reac-Cl, which agrees with
   the findings from the chi parameters calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We review the recent progress of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire sensors with
   ohmic-contacted and Schottky-contacted configurations and the
   enhancement of the performances of Schottky-contacted ZnO NW sensors
   (SCZNSs) by the piezotronic effect. Comparing with the traditional
   ohmic-contacted ZnO NW sensors (OCZNSs), the SCZNSs have higher
   sensitivities and faster responses controlled by the barrier height at
   themetal-semiconductor (M-S) interface. The piezotronic effect was
   applied to tune the Schottky barrier height (SBH) with the
   strain-induced piezoelectric polarization charges at the interface of
   the M-S contact. The piezotronic effect can thus improve the detection
   limitation, sensitivity, and response time of the SCZNSs in different
   applications, such as UV detection, gas and bio/ chemical sensing. These
   piezotronic-enhanced SCZNSs may find potential applications in
   human-machine interfacing and flexible electronics skin technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of 3-D viscoelastic flow is of a particular interest in polymer
   processing. Classical approaches rely on the use of the Finger tensor
   and its inverse for strain evaluation. In this paper, we present a
   general formulation for Maxwell models with relaxation expressed in
   terms of a logarithmic strain tensor. Since the logarithmic strain
   provides a better representation of the state of straining of the
   material, the resulting constitutive model is expected to have a number
   of advantages including more uniform straining in different directions
   and extended linear behavior towards moderate deformations. Under this
   framework, a linear logarithmic relaxation process that is continuity
   compatible and uniformity compatible was proposed. Model testing with
   only two material constants demonstrated simultaneous prediction of
   shear thinning, first and second normal stress differences in shear, and
   elongational thickening in different modes of extension. By further
   including finite stretch in the relaxation process and the stress law,
   improved constitutive models with controllable elongational thickening
   and shear thinning were established.}},

Abstract = {{An Eulerian particle model is coupled with a Navier-Stokes computational
   fluid dynamics code to data-parallel line relaxation (DPLR) simulate
   flows with spallation products from thermal protection systems (TPS).
   Loose-coupling between the two codes is achieved via momentum and energy
   source terms that arise as the result of drag and heat transfer.
   Additionally, an approximate model for the scattering and emission of
   radiation by the particles is developed. The methodology is applied to a
   simulation of an experiment the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF)
   arc-jet at NASA Ames Research Center. Initial results from the
   simulations show promising qualitative similarity to the fluid mechanics
   and spectral results. The capability developed is essential for
   subsequent prediction of particle ejection rates and densities to
   reproduce attenuation of spectroscopic data observed in the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce operating costs and membrane fouling of conventional membrane
   bioreactors (cMBR), a novel MBR using a non-woven fabric membrane (nMBR)
   was constructed and the performance of the two MBRs was compared for
   anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) cultivation. The results showed
   that the start-up period for the nMBR (44 days) was notably shorter than
   that for the cMBR (56 days), meanwhile the nMBR achieved a 2-times
   higher nitrogen removal rate (231.5 mg N per L per d) compared to the
   cMBR (112.3 mg N per L per d). Illumina MiSeq sequencing showed that
   Candidatus Kuenenia and Candidatus Jettenia were the main distinguished
   anammox bacteria. FISH analysis revealed that anammox bacteria
   predominated in both reactors, especially in the nMBR (58\%)
   corresponding to a qPCR analysis of 1.07 x 10(9) copies per mL (day
   120). N2O emission analysis confirmed the advantage of the nMBR in N2O
   reduction to reduce the influence of greenhouse gas emission while
   treating identical nitrogen. These results clearly demonstrated that
   nMBRs could be a prospective choice for anammox start-up and performance
   enhancement.}},

Title = {{Advanced source apportionment of size-resolved trace elements at
   multiple sites in London during winter}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{11291-11309}},
Abstract = {{Trace element measurements in PM10-2.5, PM2.5-1.0 and PM1.0-0.3 aerosol
   were performed with 2 h time resolution at kerbside, urban background
   and rural sites during the ClearfLo winter 2012 campaign in London. The
   environment-dependent variability of emissions was characterized using
   the Multilinear Engine implementation of the positive matrix
   factorization model, conducted on data sets comprising all three sites
   but segregated by size. Combining the sites enabled separation of
   sources with high temporal covariance but significant spatial
   variability. Separation of sizes improved source resolution by
   preventing sources occurring in only a single size fraction from having
   too small a contribution for the model to resolve. Anchor profiles were
   retrieved internally by analysing data subsets, and these profiles were
   used in the analyses of the complete data sets of all sites for enhanced
   source apportionment.
   A total of nine different factors were resolved (notable elements in
   brackets): in PM10-2.5, brake wear (Cu, Zr, Sb, Ba), other
   traffic-related (Fe), resuspended dust (Si, Ca), sea/road salt (Cl),
   aged sea salt (Na, Mg) and industrial (Cr, Ni); in PM2.5-1.0, brake
   wear, other traffic-related, resuspended dust, sea/road salt, aged sea
   salt and S-rich (S); and in PM1.0-0.3, traffic-related (Fe, Cu, Zr, Sb,
   Ba), resuspended dust, sea/road salt, aged sea salt, reacted Cl (Cl),
   S-rich and solid fuel (K, Pb). Human activities enhance the
   kerb-to-rural concentration gradients of coarse aged sea salt, typically
   considered to have a natural source, by 1.7-2.2. These site-dependent
   concentration differences reflect the effect of local resuspension
   processes in London. The anthropogenically influenced factors traffic
   (brake wear and other traffic-related processes), dust and sea/road salt
   provide further kerb-to-rural concentration enhancements by direct
   source emissions by a factor of 3.5-12.7. The traffic and dust factors
   are mainly emitted in PM10-2.5 and show strong diurnal variations with
   concentrations up to 4 times higher during rush hour than during
   night-time. Regionally influenced S-rich and solid fuel factors,
   occurring primarily in PM1.0-0.3, have negligible resuspension
   influences, and concentrations are similar throughout the day and across
   the regions.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin Au nanowires have garnered increasing attention in recent
   years because of their potential use in a range of applications due to
   their unique optical properties, conductivity, chemical activity, and
   discrete plasticity. Herein, we report an unconventional seed-mediated
   growth of ultrathin Au nanowires induced by hydrophobic molecules. Quite
   intriguingly, by adding a trace amount of hydrophobic molecules (i.e.,
   toluene or chloroform) to the Au growth solution conventionally used for
   the growth of Au nanorods with cylindrical CTAB micelles as templates,
   CTAB-capped ultrathin Au nanowires (i.e., water-soluble ultrathin Au
   nanowires) were crafted. Similarly to the growth of Au nanorods, silver
   ions and Au seeds were crucially required to yield the water-soluble
   ultrathin Au nanowires. The growth mechanism of these ultrathin
   nanowires was also explored.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Prior studies have assessed the impacts of real-time information (RTI)
   provided to bus and heavy rail riders but not commuter rail passengers.
   The objective of this research is to investigate the benefits of
   providing commuter rail RTI. The method is a three-part statistical
   analysis using data from an on-board survey on two commuter rail lines
   in the Boston region. The first analysis assesses overarching adoption,
   and the results show that one-third of commuter rail riders use RTI. The
   second part conducts difference of means tests and regression analysis
   on passenger wait times, which reveals that riders' use of RTI is
   correlated with a decrease in self-reported ``usual{''} wait times. The
   third part analyzes 12 quality-of-service indicators, which have a
   limited relationship with RTI utilization. The results suggest that the
   benefits of commuter rail RTI are modest. Despite this, many commuter
   rail riders choose to use this new information source, which has
   important implications for transit managers considering deploying RTI
   systems.}},

   for graphene-based supercapacitors}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{84113-84118}},
Abstract = {{Various aromatic molecules have been reported to improve the performance
   of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based supercapacitors. However, the
   mechanism for this improvement remains unclear. Here we design a facile
   approach that clearly identifies the main reason for the enhancement.
   Benzene derivatives, namely p-phenylenediamine (PPD), m-phenylenediamine
   (MPD), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), hydroquinone (HQ), phenol, aniline and
   p-aminophenol (PAP) are incorporated into graphene oxide (GO) layers
   during their reduction and assembly at room temperature. We find that
   the capacitance increase mainly arises from the pseudocapacitance of
   specific benzene derivative molecules rather than their spacing effect.
   Moreover, the para and ortho substituted benzene derivatives contribute
   much more than the meta substituted ones do. With a small amount of PPD
   (similar to 11 wt\%), the specific capacitance reaches 273 F g(-1), much
   higher than that of pure rGO electrodes (113 F g(-1)). The hybrid
   electrode also shows great stability with a capacitance retention of up
   to 86\% after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles.}},

Title = {{Developing Vehicle Classification Inputs for Project-Level MOVES
   Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2503}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Abstract = {{The motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES) model is the primary
   regulatory model for estimating automobile emissions in the United
   States. The model requires refined input data; otherwise, internal model
   assumptions that are not necessarily representative of the project being
   modeled can dominate the outputs. For example, project-level on-road
   fleet composition is highly dependent on local vehicle use; hence, MOVES
   default inputs and regional distributions are not likely to apply (and
   MOVES estimates for project-level analyses are especially sensitive to
   vehicle source type distribution). Unfortunately, developing
   project-level source type distributions can be challenging for model
   users. This research proposes a procedure for developing MOVES vehicle
   source type distribution inputs that uses the FHWA vehicle
   classification scheme, Environmental Protection Agency certification
   data, state registration data, along with on-road license plate and
   video data. A case study of I-85 near Atlanta, Georgia, is presented to
   illustrate the importance of distinguishing within light-duty vehicle
   classes for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide estimations, and between the
   single-unit heavy-duty truck (HDT) and combination HDT classes for
   nitrogen oxide and particulate matter estimation. The analysis suggests
   that the most important work is to generate on-road distributions of
   HDTs with respect to single-unit and combination trucks rather than to
   use regional defaults. The case study results show the need for locally
   derived vehicle class inputs for MOVES for project-level analysis and
   calls for an alternative MOVES vehicle class input option that uses
   regulatory class distributions because the default vehicle class
   distribution embedded in MOVES may sometimes be unrealistic.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{A facile and scalable synthesis of mesoporous films impregnated with Au
   nanoparticles (NPs) as effective dielectrics is demonstrated for
   enhancing the nanogenerator performance based on vertical
   contact-separation mode. This technique is so simple and scalable,
   providing a promising solution for developing large-scale and practical
   self-powered devices. The spatial distribution of Au NPs made it
   possible to fabricate an Au NP-embedded mesoporous triboelectric
   nanogenerator (AMTENG) with a high output power of 13 mW under cycled
   compressive force, giving over 5-fold power enhancement, compared with a
   flat film-based TENG under the same mechanical force. It is proposed
   that the presence of aligned dipoles produced due to the charges created
   by the contact between Au NPs and PDMS inside the pores can influence
   the surface potential energy of mesoporous films. With such an enhanced
   power output and unique device design, we demonstrate various
   applications such as self-powered shape mapping sensors, foot-step
   driven large-scale AMTENGs, and integrated circuits with capacitors for
   powering commercial cell phones for realizing self-powered systems from
   footsteps, wind power, and ocean waves.}},

Abstract = {{A novel and systematic approach for dynamic modeling and approximate
   constraint-following servo control of constrained mechanical systems
   under uncertainty is proposed. Fundamental equation of constrained
   mechanical systems is first obtained based on Udwadia-Kalaba approach
   which is applicable to holonomic and nonholonomic constrained systems no
   matter whether they satisfy the D'Alember's principle. The uncertainty
   (possibly fast time-varying) in mechanical systems is bounded and the
   bound is unknown. Fuzzy set theory is used to describe the unknown
   bound. The performance requirement is modeled as servo constraints in
   second-order form. A model-based robust control is presented to
   approximately follow the servo constraints. The proposed control is
   deterministic and is not IF-THEN rules-based. The uniform boundedness
   and uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error are guaranteed,
   regardless of the uncertainty. A performance index (the combined cost,
   which includes average fuzzy system performance and control effort) is
   proposed based on the fuzzy information. The optimal design problem
   associated with the control can then be solved (explicitely or

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin are promising materials for
   growth factor delivery due to their ability to efficiently bind
   positively charged growth factors including bone morphogenetic protein-2
   (BMP-2) through their negatively charged sulfate groups. Therefore, the
   goal of this study was to examine BMP-2 release from heparin-based
   microparticles (MPs) after first, incorporating a hydrolytically
   degradable crosslinker and varying heparin content within MPs to alter
   MP degradation and second, altering the sulfation pattern of heparin
   within MPs to vary BMP-2 binding and release. Using varied MP
   formulations, it was found that the time course of MP degradation for 1
   wt\% heparin MPs was similar to 4 days slower than 10 wt\% heparin MPs,
   indicating that MP degradation was dependent on heparin content. After
   incubating 100 ng BMP-2 with 0.1 mg MPs, most MP formulations loaded
   BMP-2 with similar to 50\% efficiency and significantly more BMP-2
   release (60\% of loaded BMP-2) was observed from more sulfated heparin
   MPs (MPs with similar to 100\% and 80\% of native sulfation). Similarly,
   BMP-2 bioactivity in more sulfated heparin MP groups was at least
   four-fold higher than soluble BMP-2 and less sulfated heparin MP groups,
   as determined by an established C2C12 cell alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
   assay. Ultimately, the two most sulfated 10 wt\% heparin MP formulations
   were able to efficiently load and release BMP-2 while enhancing BMP-2
   bioactivity, making them promising candidates for future growth factor
   delivery applications.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{43-52}},
Abstract = {{Life-cycle performance, safety, reliability and risk are emergent issues
   for civil infrastructure systems exposed to recurring natural and
   man-made disasters. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness
   of the importance of socio-economic sustainability in research and
   practice in the field of civil infrastructure. Sustainable engineering
   solutions strive to achieve responsible stewardship of available
   resources and to avoid transferring the burden of costly maintenance or
   repair of civil infrastructure to future generations. The use of
   customary risk-informed decision frameworks, however, raises ethical
   issues in terms of project risk shared between current and future
   generations, especially when project expectations require it to function
   over extended periods of time that may be a century or more. In this
   paper, the relation between intergenerational equity in decision support
   frameworks for civil infrastructure is explored. We propose an
   intergenerational discounting method for civil infrastructure to achieve
   equitable risk sharing between current and future generations, and
   investigate the impact of discounting in life-cycle engineering on
   future generations and on sustainable decision-making. The effect of the
   proposed discounting method on decision consequences is highlighted
   through two examples; seismic retrofit of a dam and seismic design of a
   steel frame building. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alignment free sequence comparison methods are attracting persistent
   interest, driven by data-intensive applications in genome-wide molecular
   taxonomy and phylogentic reconstruction. Among the methods based on
   substring composition, the Average Common Substring (ACS) measure
   proposed by Burstein et al. (RECOMB 2005) admits a straightforward
   linear time sequence comparison algorithm, while yielding impressive
   results in multiple applications. An important direction of research is
   to extend the approach to permit a bounded edit/hamming distance between
   substrings, so as to reflect more accurately the evolutionary process.
   To date, however, algorithms designed to incorporate k >= 1 mismatches
   have O(kn(2)) worst-case complexity, worse than the O(n(2)) alignment
   algorithms they are meant to replace. On the other hand, accounting for
   mismatches does show to lead to much improved classification, while
   heuristics can improve practical performance. In this paper, we close
   the gap by presenting the first provably efficient algorithm for the
   k-mismatch average common string (ACS(k)) problem that takes O(n) space
   and O(n log(k+1) n) time in the worst case for any constant k. Our
   method extends the generalized suffix tree model to incorporate a
   carefully selected bounded set of perturbed suffixes, and can be
   applicable to other complex approximate sequence matching problems.}},

Abstract = {{Single-pressure absorption heat pumps operate using solely thermal input
   and are ideal candidates for distributed cooling applications. Liquid
   circulation in such systems has conventionally been achieved with
   spot-heated bubble-pump generators, vertical tubes in which intense
   localized heat desorbs refrigerant. Rising refrigerant bubbles lift
   solutions to an upper reservoir, which feeds other system components.
   While this method of refrigerant separation and fluid circulation is
   simple, it necessitates a source of high-grade energy and thus cannot be
   employed in many settings. In this investigation, a full-length
   coupling-fluid heated bubble-pump generator is investigated. In this
   implementation, heating fluid is circulated through an annular jacket
   around the bubble-pump tube. Because the heat transfer area is much
   larger than in conventional spot-heated bubble-pump generators,
   relatively low-temperature thermal sources can be employed. Results are
   presented from an experimental study of a 7.8-mm-internal-diameter
   bubble-pump generator with water-steam working fluid over a range of
   operating conditions. This bubble-pump generator can operate with
   thermal input as low as 11 K above the fluid saturation temperature. A
   mechanistic fluid flow and heat transfer model is developed and
   validated. This investigation demonstrates that coupling-fluid heated
   bubble-pump generators are a promising alternative to conventional
   spot-heated implementations and can enable refrigeration using low-grade
   thermal energy.}},

   ammonia-water absorption chiller are developed and investigated
   numerically using a dynamic simulation model. The dynamic model is
   employed to study the response of the system under varying ambient

   for feedback control of the system. The first control loop maintains the
   evaporator temperature glide set-point (T-evap,T-out - T-evap,T-in),
   while the second control loop regulates desorption temperature to
   provide the desired cooling duty and maintain the delivered coolant
   temperature at a set-point. At design operating conditions, the proposed
   control for evaporator temperature glide requires similar to 250 s to
   reach the set-point of 3 degrees C, starting from ambient conditions.
   With the proposed implementation of desorption temperature control, the
   system can respond to changes in ambient temperature and cooling load
   demand, and maintain the delivered coolant temperature within +/- 0.75
   degrees C of the set-point. At part-load operation, the proposed

Abstract = {{This article presents the development of two novel compact heat and mass
   exchange concepts for use as the desorber in small-capacity
   ammonia-water absorption systems. Both concepts feature a counterflow

   vapor rises through small channels within the component, flowing past
   the heated ammonia-water solution. Heat input is supplied by a hot
   coupling fluid flowing through a microchannel array adjacent to the
   vapor/solution channels in a counterflow orientation with the solution
   stream. This geometry provides high heat transfer coefficients, enabling
   a significant reduction in component size. This arrangement is also
   found to produce high-purity ammonia vapor, which leads to reduced
   rectification loads and a higher coefficient of performance of the
   system compared to more conventional designs. Additionally, both designs
   can be configured to include an analyzer and rectification section,
   leading to more compact integrated system packages and a reduction of
   external fluid connections and cost. A model of the coupled heat and
   mass exchange process associated with ammonia-water desorption in these
   concepts is developed. The proposed design is compact, scalable,
   versatile, and easily mass-produced. This concept can also be extended
   for use in other multi-component heat and mass transfer applications.}},

Abstract = {{Current standard of care therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
   (DLBCL) cures a majority of patients with additional benefit in salvage
   therapy and autologous stem cell transplant for patients who relapse.
   The next generation of prognostic models for DLBCL aims to more
   accurately stratify patients for novel therapies and risk-adapted
   treatment strategies. This review discusses the significance of host
   genetic and tumor genomic alterations seen in DLBCL, clinical and
   epidemiologic factors, and how each can be integrated into risk
   stratification algorithms. In the future, treatment prediction and
   prognostic model development and subsequent validation will require data
   from a large number of DLBCL patients to establish sufficient
   statistical power to correctly predict outcome. Novel modeling
   approaches can augment these efforts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-wrapped octahedral Cu2O composites (GCCs)
   were successfully produced by an ultrasonication-assisted reduction of
   graphene oxide (GO) in the Cu2O precursor solution. During the
   ultrasound reaction, the reduction of GO and the growth of octahedral
   Cu2O crystals occurred simultaneously in conjunction with the deposition
   of Cu2O crystals on graphene. As a result of the introduction of rGO,
   the light absorption of octahedral Cu2O was markedly improved, the size
   of Cu2O crystals was decreased, and the self-aggregation of Cu2O
   crystals was effectively prevented. More importantly, the charge
   separation and transfer were effectively enhanced. Compared to the pure
   octahedral Cu2O crystals and commercial TiO2 (P25), the GCCs exhibited
   an increased degradation rate of methyl orange (MO) by 4.5 and 20.2
   times, respectively. Meanwhile, upon the graphene loading, the
   photoelectric conversion efficiency of GCC electrodes was largely
   improved resulting in an efficiency of 0.151\%, representing an 8 fold
   higher efficiency than that of pure Cu2O crystals.}},

Title = {{Synergetic enhancement of organic solar cell thermal stability by wire
   bar coating and light processing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{9551-9558}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that organic solar cells can exhibit different
   morphological and performance stability under thermal stress depending
   upon the processing technique employed, without compromising initial
   device efficiency. In particular, we investigate benchmark PCDTBT:
   PC60BM solar cells fabricated by wire bar coating (a technique
   attractive for commercial manufacture) and the more widely employed, lab
   scale, technique of spin coating. For this system, wire bar deposition
   results in superior device stability, with lifetime improvements in
   excess of 20-fold compared to spun cast devices. Neutron reflectivity
   reveals that the enhanced PC60BM segregation to the top interface in the
   slower, wire bar, casting process is likely responsible for the hindered
   PC60BM nucleation at tens of nm length scale, characterized by atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), and thus enhanced morphological stability.
   Modest light exposure of the active layer (at approximately 10 mW
   cm(-2)), known to reversibly photo-oligomerize fullerenes and thus
   impart morphological stability, is found to further improve device
   stability by a factor of 10. The combined effects of wire bar coating
   and light processing are highly synergetic, resulting in solar cells
   which are overall 200 times more stable than devices prepared by spin
   casting without light processing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{9715-9725}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the literature, a variety of counter electrode materials have
   been used in conjugated polymer-based electrochromic devices (ECDs)
   without a comparative understanding of their effects on the
   electrochromic properties of the device. In this study, we show that
   poor ECD performance, often attributed to electrochromic polymer (ECP)
   stability, is in fact largely due to an inappropriate choice of counter
   electrode. We have compared a set of counter electrode materials used in
   the ECD literature in magenta-to-clear and black-to-clear devices and
   evaluated how they affect the device parameters including contrast,
   switching time, stability, and voltage requirements. We demonstrate that
   through the appropriate choice of counter electrode material (i) the
   operating voltage can be lowered, (ii) no additional
   equilibration/break-in time is required, and (iii) the contrast and
   switching times of the ECP is maintained when incorporated into a
   device. Furthermore, we show that even unencapsulated ECDs with
   ECP-Magenta as the vibrantly colored material assembled and operated
   under ambient conditions can withstand over 10 000 switches without
   compromising contrast or switching time.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor targeting agents including antibodies, peptides, and small

   targeting agents to increase the accumulation of nanosized therapeutics
   within diseased tissues, little attention has been focused on how these
   ligands can affect the self-assembly of the nanoparticle's modified
   polymer constituents upon chemical conjugation. Here we present an
   actively tumor targeted nanoparticle constructed via the self-assembly
   of a folate modified heparin. Folate conjugation unexpectedly allowed
   the self-assembly of heparin, where a majority of the folate molecules
   (>80\%) resided inside the core of the nanoparticle. The folate-heparin
   nanoparticles could also physically encapsulate lipophilic fluorescent
   dyes, enabling the use of the constructs as activatable fluorescent
   probes for targeted in vivo tumor imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesives from disintegrated mailing labels and other sources can cause
   operational problems in paper recycling mills. Soy protein reduces the
   tack of both microstickies and of adhesive films. For the latter, tack
   reduction is accompanied by a corresponding decrease of the contact
   angle of water on the adhesive surface. The contact angle of
   polyacrylates is reduced much more than that of hot melts. Because the
   polar component of the surface energy is higher for polyacrylates, soy
   protein is particularly effective for pressure sensitive adhesives based
   on these polymers. The soy protein can be mostly extracted from soy
   flour under typical repulping conditions, which opens the possibility of
   extracting the soy protein from soy flour in the repulper. The economics
   of using soy flour for stickies control are attractive because of the
   low cost of the flour and its stability during storage and handling. The
   green value of soy is an added bonus.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a novel, flexible inkjet-printed metamaterial absorber
   is proposed. The unit cell consists of a miniaturized Jerusalem-cross
   resonator and a completely conductive bottom. Because the conductive
   patterns are inkjet-printed using silver nanoparticle inks on paper, the
   proposed metamaterial absorber is flexible. It is also eco-friendly
   because it does not produce any chemical waste. In this letter, the
   working principle of the proposed miniaturized unit cell is explained,
   and parametric simulations are described. The inkjet-printing process is
   delineated, and the silver nanoparticle inks and paper used are
   characterized. The performance of the proposed absorber is demonstrated
   with a full-wave simulation and measurements at the X-band. The
   experimental results show that the absorption rate at 9.09 GHz is
   greater than 99\% at the normal incidence. Angular and polarization
   insensitivity are also experimentally demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Impact of Including Exiting Vehicles in Single-Lane Roundabout Capacity
   Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2517}},
Pages = {{87-95}},
Abstract = {{Roundabouts are classified as alternative intersection forms because
   they provide operational conditions not found at conventional
   intersections (e.g., a low-speed environment and fewer possible vehicle
   conflicts). Such conditions provide a combination of safety and
   operational benefit that normally is not achievable at a conventional
   intersection. The ability to predict capacity accurately is important
   when alternative intersection designs are examined. Highway Capacity
   Manual 2010 provides a current method for determining the capacity of a
   roundabout approach in which vehicles that exit on the same approach are
   considered not to influence capacity. However, the inclusion of exiting
   vehicles in the model creates a different circulating vehicle gap
   distribution (dividing larger gaps into smaller gaps) that reduces the
   number of opportunities to measure follow-up headway. Also, most
   critical headway values for the analysis are smaller than the critical
   headway values found when exiting vehicles are excluded. Capacity
   equations were developed from video imagery recorded for 28 approaches
   at 13 roundabouts, and the impact of including exiting vehicles in the
   analysis of single-lane roundabout capacity was evaluated. Vehicles
   exiting the roundabout were found to have a measurable impact on the
   estimated capacity of the roundabout approach. Both follow-up and
   critical headway values decreased when exiting vehicles were included.
   Also, the estimated capacity including exiting vehicles was found to
   increase or decrease (relative to capacity estimates that excluded
   exiting vehicles) depending on the percentage of conflicting vehicles
   that were exiting vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{The functional design of discrete event logistics systems (DELS)
   specifies the systems' transformative functions independently from the
   technology required to implement those functions. Creating a functional
   architecture for a new system is as much an art form as a science and
   often relies on the tacit knowledge of the systems architect. In this
   paper, we present a method to integrate analyses to support the
   refinement of the functional architecture. This method relies on
   integrating the description of the functional architecture with a formal
   network description and using that formal network description to provide
   access to analysis generation technologies. The result is automated
   access to analysis tools, such as discrete event simulations, which
   provide critical feedback on the performance of a particular design
   early in the design process. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{9203-9215}},
Abstract = {{While cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) production associated with
   atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is thought to be frequent
   throughout the continental boundary layers, few studies on this
   phenomenon in marine air exist. Here, based on simultaneous measurement
   of particle number size distributions, CCN properties and aerosol
   chemical composition, we present the first direct evidence on CCN
   production resulting from NPF in the eastern Mediterranean atmosphere.
   We show that condensation of both gaseous sulfuric acid and organic
   compounds from multiple sources leads to the rapid growth of nucleated
   particles to CCN sizes in this environment during the summertime.
   Sub-100 nm particles were found to be substantially less hygroscopic
   than larger particles during the period with active NPF and growth (the
   value of kappa was lower by 0.2-0.4 for 60 nm particles compared with
   120 nm particles), probably due to enrichment of organic material in the
   sub-100 nm size range. The aerosol hygroscopicity tended to be at
   minimum just before the noon and at maximum in the afternoon, which was
   very likely due to the higher sulfate-to-organic ratios and higher
   degree of oxidation of the organic material during the afternoon.
   Simultaneous with the formation of new particles during daytime,
   particles formed during the previous day or even earlier were growing
   into the size range relevant to cloud droplet activation, and the
   particles formed in the atmosphere were possibly mixed with
   long-range-transported particles.}},

Abstract = {{The pyrolysis of whole biomass-pine wood and bark-with mordenite (M),
   beta (beta) and Y zeolites has been examined at 600 degrees C. The GPC
   results indicated that the pyrolysis oils upgraded by Y and beta
   zeolites have a very low average molecular weight range (70-170 g
   mol(-1)). Several NMR methods have been employed to characterize the
   whole portion of pyrolysis products. After the use of these two zeolites
   (Y and beta), the two main products from the pyrolysis of
   cellulose-levoglucosan and HMF-were eliminated; this indicates a
   significant deoxygenation process. When a mixture of zeolites (Y and M)
   was used, the upgraded pyrolysis oil exhibited advantages provided by
   both zeolites; this pyrolysis oil represents a biofuel precursor that
   has a very low average molecular weight and a relatively low acidity.
   This study opens up a new way to upgrade pyrolysis oils by employing
   mixtures of different functional zeolites to produce biofuel/biochemical
   precursors from whole biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Information technology (IT) systems are already ubiquitous,
   and their future growth is expected to drive the global economy for the
   next several decades. However, energy consumption by these systems is
   growing rapidly, and their sustained growth requires curbing the energy
   consumption, and the associated heat removal requirements. Currently,
   20-50 percent of the incoming electrical power is used to meet the
   cooling demands of IT facilities. Careful co-optimization of electrical
   power and thermal management is essential for reducing energy
   consumption requirements of IT equipment. Such modeling based
   co-optimization is complicated by the presence of several decades of
   spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this paper is to review
   recent approaches for handling these challenges.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors illustrate the
   challenges and possible modeling approaches by considering three
   examples. The multi-scale modeling of chip level transient heating using
   a combination of Progressive Zoom-in, and proper orthogonal
   decomposition (POD) is an effective approach for chip level
   electrical/thermal co-design for mitigation of reliability concerns,
   such as Joule heating driven electromigration. In the second example,
   the authors will illustrate the optimal microfluidic thermal management
   of hot spots, and large background heat fluxes associated with future
   high-performance microprocessors. In the third example, data center
   facility level energy usage reduction through a transient measurements
   based POD modeling framework will be illustrated.
   Findings - Through modeling based electrical/thermal co-design, dramatic
   savings in energy usage for cooling are possible.
   Originality/value - The multi-scale nature of the thermal modeling of IT
   systems is an important challenge. This paper reviews some of the
   approaches employed to meet this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the first demonstration of controllable carbon doping of
   graphene to engineer local electronic properties of a graphene
   conduction channel using focused electron beam induced deposition
   (FEBID). Electrical measurements indicate that an ``n-p-n{''} junction
   on graphene conduction channel is formed by partial carbon deposition
   near the source and drain metal contacts by low energy (<50 eV)
   secondary electrons due to inelastic collisions of long range
   backscattered primary electrons generated from a low dose of high energy
   (25 keV) electron beam (1 x 10(18) e(-) per cm(2)). Detailed AFM imaging
   provides direct evidence of the new mechanism responsible for dynamic
   evolution of the locally varying graphene doping. The FEBID carbon
   atoms, which are physisorbed and weakly bound to graphene, diffuse
   towards the middle of graphene conduction channel due to their surface
   chemical potential gradient, resulting in negative shift of Dirac
   voltage. Increasing a primary electron dose to 1 x 10(19) e(-) per cm(2)
   results in a significant increase of carbon deposition, such that it
   covers the entire graphene conduction channel at high surface density,
   leading to n-doping of graphene channel. Collectively, these findings
   establish a unique capability of FEBID technique to dynamically modulate
   the doping state of graphene, thus enabling a new route to resist-free,
   ``direct-write{''} functional patterning of graphene-based electronic
   devices with potential for on-demand re-configurability.}},

Title = {{The size effect on intermetallic microstructure evolution of critical
   solder joints for flip chip assemblies}},
Journal = {{SOLDERING \& SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{178-184}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the intermetallic
   compound (IMC) thickness, composition and morphology in 100-mu m pitch
   and 200-mu m pitch Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC305) flip-chip assemblies after bump
   reflow and assembly reflow. In particular, emphasis is placed on the
   effect of solder joint size on the interfacial IMCs between metal pads
   and solder matrix.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work uses 100-mu m pitch and 200-mu m
   pitch silicon flip chips with nickel (Ni) pads and stand-off height of
   approximately 45 and 90 mu m, respectively, assembled on substrates with
   copper (Cu) pads. The IMCs evolution in solder joints was investigated
   during reflow by using 100- and 200-mu m pitch flip-chip assemblies.
   Findings - After bump reflow, the joints size controls the IMC
   composition and dominant IMC type as well as IMC thickness and also
   influences the dominant IMC morphology. After assembly reflow, the
   cross-reaction of the pad metallurgies promotes the dominant IMC
   transformation and shape coarsened on the Ni pad interface for smaller
   joints and promotes a great number of new dominate IMC growth on the Ni
   pad interface in larger joints. On the Cu pad interface, many small
   voids formed in the IMC in larger joints, but were not observed in
   smaller joints, combined with the drawing of the IMC growth process.
   Originality/value - With continued advances in microelectronics, it is
   anticipated that next-generation microelectronic assemblies will require
   a reduction of the flip-chip solder bump pitch to 100 mu m or less from
   the current industrial practice of 130 to150 mu m. This work shows that
   as the packaging size reduced with the solder joint interconnection, the
   solder size becomes an important factor in the intermetallic composition
   as well as morphology and thickness after reflow.}},

Title = {{Advanced Treatment of Pesticide-Containing Wastewater Using Fenton
   Reagent Enhanced by Microwave Electrodeless Ultraviolet}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The photo-Fenton reaction is a promising method to treat organic
   contaminants in water. In this paper, a Fenton reagent enhanced by
   microwave electrodeless ultraviolet (MWEUV/Fenton) method was proposed
   for advanced treatment of nonbiodegradable organic substance in
   pesticide-containing biotreated wastewater. MWEUV lamp was found to be
   more effective for chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal than commercial
   mercury lamps in the Fenton process. The pseudo-first order kinetic
   model can well describe COD removal from pesticide-containing wastewater
   by MWEUV/Fenton, and the apparent rate constant (k) was 0.0125 min(-1).
   The optimal conditions for MWEUV/Fenton process were determined as
   initial pH of 5, Fe2+ dosage of 0.8 mmol/L, and H2O2 dosage of 100
   mmol/L. Under the optimal conditions, the reaction exhibited high
   mineralization degrees of organics, where COD and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentration decreased from 183.2 mg/L to 36.9 mg/L and
   43.5 mg/L to 27.8 mg/L, respectively. Three main pesticides in the
   wastewater, as Dimethoate, Triazophos, and Malathion, were completely
   removed by the MWEUV/Fenton process within 120 min. The high degree of
   pesticides decomposition and mineralization was proved by the detected
   inorganic anions.}},

Abstract = {{Current applications of carbon-based supercapacitors are limited by
   their low energy density. One promising strategy to enhance the energy
   density is to couple metal oxides with carbon materials. In this study,
   a porous MnCo2O4.5 nanoneedle/carbon aerogel hybrid nanostructure was
   synthesized by assembling MnCo2O4.5 nanoneedle arrays on the surface of
   channel walls of hierarchical porous carbon aerogels derived from
   chitosan for the supercapacitor application. The synthetic process of
   the hybrid nanostructure involves two steps, i.e. the growth of Mn-Co
   precursors on carbon aerogel by a hydrothermal process and the
   conversion of the precursor into MnCo2O4.5 nanoneedles by calcination.
   The carbon aerogel exhibits a high electrical conductivity, high
   specific surface area and porous structure, ensuring high
   electrochemical performance of the hybrid nanostructure when coupled
   with the porous MnCo2O4.5 nanoneedles. The symmetric supercapacitor
   using the MnCo2O4.5 nanoneedle/carbon aerogel hybrid nanostructure as
   the active electrode material exhibits a high energy density of about
   84.3 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 600 W kg(-1). The voltage window is
   as high as 1.5 V in neutral aqueous electrolytes. Due to the unique
   nanostructure of the electrodes, the capacitance retention reaches 86\%
   over 5000 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies have suggested overlapping pathological
   features among motor neuron, cognitive and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Aims/Methods: Secondary analysis of 46 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   (ALS) patient autopsies was performed to independently assess
   pathological feature prevalence (e.g. percent of patients with any
   positive finding), degree of severity (e.g. mild, moderate, severe), and
   2,200+ potential clinical/neuropathological correlations. The possible
   impact of gender, onset age, onset type (limb vs. bulbar), riluzole
   treatment, and severe TDP-43 pathology was assessed within patient
   subgroups. Results: Assessed features (prevalence, severity) include:
   lateral corticospinal tract degeneration (89\%, moderate); Purkinje cell
   loss (85\%, mild); localized neuronal loss (83\%, mild to moderate);
   TDP-43 inclusions (80\%, moderate); Betz cell loss (76\%, mild);
   neurofibrillary tangles (78\%, severe); anterior corticospinal tract
   degeneration (72\%, moderate); spinal ventral root atrophy (65\%,
   moderate); atherosclerosis (35\%, mild); beta-amyloid (35\%, mild);
   tauopathy/tau inclusions (17\%, mild); ventricular dilation (13\%,
   mild); Lewy body formation (11\%, mild); microinfarcts (7\%, mild); and
   alpha-synuclein (4\%, mild). Twenty-two percent of patients met criteria
   for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 26\% for frontotemporal lobar
   degeneration. Substantial differences were identified in the AD group
   and in the different onset age groups. Conclusion: Our findings support
   the hypothesis that ALS and its variants could comprise a larger
   neuropathological continuum. (C) 2015 The Author(s) Published by S.

Abstract = {{This review describes the status of the fields of biocatalysts and
   enzymes, as well as existing drawbacks, and recent advances in the areas
   deemed to represent drawbacks. Although biocatalysts are often highly
   active and extremely selective, there are still drawbacks associated
   with biocatalysis as a generally applicable technique: the lack of
   designability of biocatalysts; their limits of stability; and the
   insufficient number of well-characterized, ready-to-use biocatalysts.
   There has been significant progress on the following fronts: (a) novel
   protein engineering tools, both experimental and computational, have
   significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development. (b) The
   deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses can be described
   quantitatively via rational models. There are several cases of
   spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing
   mutations found in earlier rounds. The concept that stabilization
   against one type of stress commonly also stabilizes against other types
   of stress is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few
   years ago. (c) A host of developments of novel biocatalysts in the past
   few years, in part fueled by improved designability and improved methods
   of stabilization, has considerably broadened the toolbox for synthetic
   chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) combined with the
   partitioning of semivolatile organic components can impact numerous
   aerosol properties including cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity,
   hygroscopicity, and volatility. During the summer 2013 Southern Oxidant
   and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign in a rural site in the
   southeastern United States, a suite of instruments including a CCN
   counter, a thermodenuder (TD), and a high-resolution time-of-flight
   aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were used to measure CCN activity,
   aerosol volatility, composition, and oxidation state. Particles were
   either sampled directly from ambient or through a particle-into-liquid
   sampler (PILS), allowing the investigation of the water-soluble aerosol
   component. Ambient aerosols exhibited size-dependent composition with
   larger particles being more hygroscopic. The hygroscopicity of thermally
   denuded aerosols was similar between ambient and PILS-generated aerosols
   and showed limited dependence on volatilization. Results of AMS
   three-factor positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis for the
   PILS-generated aerosols showed that the most hygroscopic components are
   most likely the most and the least volatile features of the aerosols. No
   clear relationship was found between organic hygroscopicity and the
   oxygen-to-carbon ratio; in fact, isoprene-derived organic aerosols
   (isoprene-OAs) were found to be the most hygroscopic factor, while at
   the same time being the least oxidized and likely most volatile of all
   PMF factors. Considering the diurnal variation of each PMF factor and
   its associated hygroscopicity, isoprene-OA and more-oxidized oxygenated
   organic aerosols are the prime contributors to hygroscopicity and
   co-vary with less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosols in a way that
   induces the observed diurnal invariance in total organic hygroscopicity.
   Biomass burning organic aerosols contributed little to aerosol
   hygroscopicity, which is expected since there was little biomass burning
   activity during the sampling period examined.}},

Title = {{Examining the effects of anthropogenic emissions on isoprene-derived
   secondary organic aerosol formation during the 2013 Southern Oxidant and
   Aerosol Study (SOAS) at the Look Rock, Tennessee ground site}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{A suite of offline and real-time gas-and particlephase measurements was
   deployed at Look Rock, Tennessee (TN), during the 2013 Southern Oxidant
   and Aerosol Study (SOAS) to examine the effects of anthropogenic
   emissions on isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation.
   High-and low-time-resolution PM2.5 samples were collected for analysis
   of known tracer compounds in isoprene-derived SOA by gas
   chromatography/electron ionizationmass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) and ultra
   performance liquid chromatography/diode array detection-electrospray
   ionization-high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (UPLC/DAD-ESI-HR-QTOFMS). Source apportionment of the organic aerosol
   (OA) was determined by positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of
   mass spectro-metric data acquired on an Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical
   Speciation Monitor (ACSM). Campaign average mass concentrations of the
   sum of quantified isoprene-derived SOA tracers contributed to similar to
   9\% (up to 28 \%) of the total OA mass, with isoprene-epoxydiol (IEPOX)
   chemistry accounting for similar to 97\% of the quantified tracers. PMF
   analysis resolved a factor with a profile similar to the IEPOX-OA factor
   resolved in an Atlanta study and was therefore designated IEPOX-OA. This
   factor was strongly correlated (r(2) > 0.7) with 2-methyltetrols,
   C5-alkene triols, IEPOX-derived organosulfates, and dimers of
   organosulfates, confirming the role of IEPOX chemistry as the source. On
   average, IEPOX-derived SOA tracer mass was similar to 26\% (up to 49 \%)
   of the IEPOX-OA factor mass, which accounted for 32\% of the total OA. A
   low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA) and an oxidized
   factor with a profile similar to 91Fac observed in areas where emissions
   are biogenic-dominated were also resolved by PMF analysis, whereas no
   primary organic aerosol (POA) sources could be resolved. These findings
   were consistent with low levels of primary pollutants, such as nitric
   oxide (NO similar to 0.03 ppb), carbon monoxide (CO similar to 116 ppb),
   and black carbon (BC similar to 0.2 mu g m(-3)). Particle-phase sulfate
   is fairly correlated (r(2) similar to 0.3) with both methacrylic acid
   epoxide (MAE)/hydroxymethyl-methyl-ff lactone (HMML)-(henceforth called
   methacrolein (MACR)derived SOA tracers) and IEPOX-derived SOA tracers,
   and more strongly correlated (r(2) similar to 0.6) with the IEPOX-OA
   factor, in sum suggesting an important role of sulfate in isoprene SOA
   formation. Moderate correlation between the MACR-derived SOA tracer
   2-methylglyceric acid with sum of reactive and reservoir nitrogen oxides
   (NOy; r(2) = 0.38) and nitrate (r(2) = 0.45) indicates the potential
   influence of anthropogenic emissions through long-range transport.
   Despite the lack of a clear association of IEPOX-OA with locally
   estimated aerosol acidity and liquid water content (LWC), box model
   calculations of IEPOX uptake using the simpleGAMMA model, accounting for
   the role of acidity and aerosol water, predicted the abundance of the
   IEPOX-derived SOA tracers 2-methyltetrols and the corresponding sulfates
   with good accuracy (r(2) similar to 0.5 and similar to 0.7,
   respectively). The modeling and data combined suggest an anthropogenic
   influence on isoprene-derived SOA formation through acid-catalyzed
   heterogeneous chemistry of IEPOX in the southeastern US. However, it
   appears that this process was not limited by aerosol acidity or LWC at
   Look Rock during SOAS.
   Future studies should further explore the extent to which acidity and
   LWC as well as aerosol viscosity and morphology becomes a limiting
   factor of IEPOX-derived SOA, and their modulation by anthropogenic
   emissions.}},

Title = {{A Service-Oriented, Cyber-Physical Reference Model for Smart Grid}},
Booktitle = {{CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS APPROACH TO SMART ELECTRIC POWER GRID}},
Series = {{Power Systems}},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {{25-42}},
Abstract = {{This chapter presents a cyber-physical reference model for smart grid.
   Most of the early smart grid applications have been developed in an
   ad-hoc manner, without any underlying framework. The proposed reference
   model addresses this issue and enables the design of smart grid as a
   robust system that is extensible to the future. The proposed reference
   model is based on service-oriented computing paradigm and is compatible
   with the existing service-oriented technologies, used in enterprise
   computing, such as Web Services. However, it also extends these
   technologies for handling the hard real-time aspects of smart grid by
   introducing resource-aware service deployment and quality-of-service
   (QoS)-aware service monitoring phases. According to the proposed
   reference model, each smart grid scenario is characterized by three
   elements: (1) an application model that describes the smart grid
   applications to be supported by the system as a set of resource-and
   QoS-aware service descriptions, (2) a platform model that describes the
   smart grid platform as a set of computing nodes, communication links,
   sensors, actuators, and power system entities, and (3) a set of
   algorithms that enable resource-aware service deployment, QoS-aware
   service discovery, and QoS-aware service monitoring. This chapter also
   presents typical development steps of a smart grid application according
   to the proposed reference model. Moreover, this chapter identifies a
   number of technological requirements that can enable the development of
   smart grid applications according to the proposed reference model.
   Although the development of these required technologies is a topic of
   ongoing research, this chapter identifies some potential solution
   approaches, based on state-of-the-art techniques from real-time systems
   literature. The case study of a demand response application has been
   employed to explain the various aspects of the proposed smart grid
   reference model.}},

Title = {{Treatment of Antibiotic Pharmaceutical Wastewater Using a Rotating
   Biological Contactor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Rotating biological contactors (RBC) are effective for treating
   wastewater, while they are rarely reported to be used for treating
   antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater (APW). The current study
   investigates treatment of APW using an RBC. The effects of influent
   concentration, number of stages, and temperature on the remediation of
   APW were studied. The results indicated, even at low ambient
   temperature, 45\% COD and 40\% NH4+-N removal efficiencies. Moreover,
   the BOD5 removal efficiency was 85\%. Microscopic observations
   illustrated that there were various active microorganisms displayed in
   the biofilms and their distribution changed from stage to stage.
   Compared with activated sludge, the biofilms in this study have higher
   content of dry matter and are easier to dehydrate and settle. Compared
   with current commercial incineration processes or advanced oxidation
   processes, RBC can greatly reduce the treatment cost. This research
   shows RBC is effective for such an inherently biorecalcitrant wastewater
   even at low ambient temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic titanium dioxide based nanocomposites have been gaining
   increasingly high attention in sustainable environmental protection
   fields; these materials can integrate the advantages of magnetic
   recovery and the superior photocatalysis performance of titanium
   dioxide. However, direct contact between crystalline photoactive
   titanium dioxide and magnetic iron oxide gives rise to lower
   photoreactivity than pure titanium dioxide for the pollutant
   degradation. To overcome the challenge, a number of researches have been
   done and significant process has been made in this area in recent years.
   This review primarily focuses on the properties of magnetic particles,
   structural models, preparation methods and techniques to improve
   photocatalytic performance of magnetic titanium dioxide based
   photocatalysts, and aims to provide a systematic overview of the current
   knowledge of these subjects. Notably, the recently discovered technique
   coupling graphene into magnetic iron oxide-titanium dioxide system is
   discussed, which opens a promising future for preparation of magnetic
   semiconductors with excellent properties. Current challenges and
   prospects are also proposed at the end of this article. In particular,
   the examination of corresponding deactivation or regeneration mechanisms
   should be investigated further, from the point of view of practical
   applications.}},

Title = {{Selective and irreversible adsorption of mercury(II) from aqueous
   solution by a flower-like titanate nanomaterial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{17676-17684}},
Abstract = {{A novel flower-like titanate nanomaterial (titanate nanoflowers, TNFs)
   was synthesized through a hydrothermal method using nano-anatase and
   sodium hydroxide, and used for mercury(II) removal from aqueous
   solution. The large surface area (187.32 m(2) g(-1)) and low point of
   zero charge (3.04) of TNFs facilitated the adsorption of cations.
   Adsorption experiments indicated that TNFs could quickly capture 98.2\%
   of Hg(II) from solution within 60 min at pH 5. The maximum adsorption
   capacity of Hg(II) was as large as 454.55 mg g(-1) calculated by the
   Langmuir isotherm model. Moreover, selective adsorption of Hg(II) by
   TNFs was observed with the coexistence of other conventional cations
   (i.e., Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) even at 10 times concentration of Hg(II).
   XRD analysis indicated that the prepared TNFs were a kind of
   tri-titanate composed of an edge-sharing triple {[}TiO6] octahedron and
   interlayered Na+/H+, and ion-exchange between Hg2+ and Na+ was the
   primary adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, it was interesting that the
   basic crystal structure of TNFs, tri-titanate (Ti3O72-), transformed
   into hexa-titanate (Ti6O132-) after adsorption, resulting in the
   trapping of Hg(II) into the lattice tunnel of this hexa-titanate.
   Desorption experiments also confirmed the irreversible adsorption due to
   Hg(II) trapped in TNFs, which achieved safe disposal of this highly
   toxic metal in practical application.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical axis turbines have many attractive features and are well suited
   for extraction of wind and hydrokinetic energy. At low angular
   velocities, the rotor blades momentarily experience high angles of
   attack and move in and out of stall. This gives rise to unsteady
   aerodynamic loads that may cause vibration and structural fatigue. The
   high pressure drag and loss of lift during dynamic stall also leads to a
   lower efficiency compared to horizontal axis systems. In this work, a
   three-pronged approach with increasing complexity is used to understand
   and model this complex phenomenon, for a representative system.
   Empirical curve fits are first used to map the efficiency of the turbine
   as a function of tip speed ratio. An existing double multiple streamtube
   methodology (DMST) is next used, with a variety of empirical methods for
   modeling dynamic stall. Finally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   results are presented and compared with test data and the DMST approach.
   It is concluded that DMST approaches are well suited for screening and
   designing vertical axis wind turbine configurations, followed by
   detailed modeling of the physical phenomena using well validated CFD
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of elastic wave propagation in nonlinear media has gained
   recent research attention due to the recognition of their
   amplitude-dependent behavior. This creates opportunities for increased
   accuracy of damage detection and localization, development of new
   structural monitoring strategies, and design of new structures with
   desirable acoustic behavior (e.g., amplitude-dependent frequency
   bandgaps, wave beaming, and filtering). This differs from more
   traditional nonlinear analysis approaches which target the prediction of
   higher harmonic growth. Of particular interest in this work is the
   analysis of amplitude-dependent shifts in Lamb wave dispersion curves.
   Typically, dispersion curves are calculated for nominally linear
   material parameters and geometrical features of a waveguide, even when
   the constitutive law is nonlinear. Instead, this work employs a
   Lindstedt -Poincare perturbation approach to calculate
   amplitude-dependent dispersion curves, and shifts thereof, for
   nonlinearly-elastic plates. As a result, a set of first order
   corrections to frequency (or equivalently wavenumber) are calculated.
   These corrections yield significant amplitude dependence in the spectral
   characteristics of the calculated waves, especially for high frequency
   waves, which differs fundamentally from linear analyses. Numerical
   simulations confirm the analytical shifts predicted. Recognition of this
   amplitude-dependence in Lamb wave dispersion may suggest, among other
   things, that the analysis of guided wave propagation phenomena within a
   fully nonlinear framework needs to revisit mode-mode energy flux and
   higher harmonics generation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel electronic stability control (ESC) strategy
   that is capable of adapting to changing vehicle mass, tyre cornering
   stiffnesses and road surface conditions. First a nonlinear reduced-order
   observer is used to estimate vehicle sideslip and axle slip angles. In
   addition, lateral forces are estimated providing a real-time
   characterisation of lateral force capability of the axles with respect
   to slip angle. A recursive least squares estimation algorithm is used to
   estimate cornering stiffness, which in turn provides a real-time
   indication of axle lateral force saturation. An algorithm calculates the
   reduction in yaw moment owing to axle lateral force saturation and
   determines an equivalent moment to be generated by differential braking
   on the opposite axle. Simulations demonstrate that the ESC strategy
   provides improved vehicle performance with regard to handling stability
   and is capable of adapting to changes in vehicle parameters.}},

Title = {{Investigation of ultra-thin titania films as hole-blocking contacts for
   organic photovoltaics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Pages = {{17332-17343}},
Abstract = {{Ultra-thin (0.5-10 nm) plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited (PE-ALD)
   titanium oxide (TiOx) films, deposited on indium-tin-oxide (ITO)
   contacts, are investigated as hole-blocking interlayers using
   conventional electrochemistry of select probe molecules, in blended
   heterojunction (P3HT: PCBM) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and in
   conventional Al/TiOx/p-Si diode platforms. Even films as thin as 0.5 nm,
   which represent as few as 10 ALD cycles, begin to show hole blocking in
   the electrochemical experiments, and optimized rectification and power
   conversion efficiencies are seen for the diode and OPV platforms
   respectively at a thickness of ca. 3 nm. These results suggest a
   significant reactivity of the ALD precursors with the ITO substrate to
   form conformal films with properties which can normally only be achieved
   with much thicker TiO2 films created from chemical vapor deposition or
   sol-gel solution processing. The performance of these PE-ALD TiOx layers
   is highly dependent on thickness. Up to ca. 3 nm these PE-ALD films
   remain amorphous, whereas for thicker layers (10 nm) grazing incidence
   X-ray diffraction shows a transition to the anatase structure, with an
   increase in both leakage current and reduction in shunt resistance in PV
   platforms. TiO2 films can be quite attractive electron-selective,
   hole-blocking interlayers in both PV and photoelectrochemical energy
   conversion platforms, but need to be thin, owing to their lower
   intrinsic conductivities. PE-ALD TiO2 films appear to provide these
   capabilities, with strikingly optimized performance at very low
   thickness.}},

Abstract = {{A facile and scalable one-step anodization method has been developed to
   fabricate three-dimensional (3-D) Cu(OH)(2) nanoporous nanorods on a
   copper foil substrate, a product that can be used directly as a
   binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. The unique morphology of the
   nanorods provides a large amount of active sites for redox reactions,
   which can be easily accessed by electrolyte ions. Benefiting from that,
   a high capacitance of 213 mF cm(-2) is obtained, and superior rate
   capability (62.3\% capacitance retention when the scan rate is increased
   to 10 times) and excellent cyclability (92.0\% capacitance retention
   after 5000 cycles) are achieved. In addition, a flexible and foldable
   solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled using the Cu(OH)(2)
   and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes,
   respectively. The devices deliver a high energy density of 3.68 mW h
   cm(-3) and a high power density of 5314 mW cm(-3), demonstrating great

Title = {{Improved metabolite profile smoothing for flux estimation}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2394-2405}},
Abstract = {{As genome-scale metabolic models become more sophisticated and dynamic,
   one significant challenge in using these models is to effectively
   integrate increasingly prevalent systems-scale metabolite profiling data
   into them. One common data processing step when integrating metabolite
   data is to smooth experimental time course measurements: the smoothed
   profiles can be used to estimate metabolite accumulation (derivatives),
   and thus the flux distribution of the metabolic model. However, this
   smoothing step is susceptible to the (often significant) noise in
   experimental measurements, limiting the accuracy of downstream model
   predictions. Here, we present several improvements to current approaches
   for smoothing metabolite time course data using defined functions.
   First, we use a biologically-inspired mathematical model function taken
   from transcriptional profiling and clustering literature that captures
   the dynamics of many biologically relevant transient processes. We
   demonstrate that it is competitive with, and often superior to,
   previously described fitting schemas, and may serve as an effective
   single option for data smoothing in metabolic flux applications. We also
   implement a resampling-based approach to buffer out sensitivity to
   specific data sets and allow for more accurate fitting of noisy data. We
   found that this method, as well as the addition of parameter space
   constraints, yielded improved estimates of concentrations and
   derivatives (fluxes) in previously described fitting functions. These
   methods have the potential to improve the accuracy of existing and
   future dynamic metabolic models by allowing for the more effective
   integration of metabolite profiling data.}},

Abstract = {{Altered metabolism is increasingly acknowledged as an important aspect
   of cancer, and thus serves as a potentially fertile area for the
   identification of therapeutic targets or leads. Our recent work using
   transcriptional data to predict metabolite levels in cancer cells led to
   preliminary evidence of the antiproliferative role of menaquinone
   (vitamin K2) in the Jurkat cell line model of acute lymphoblastic
   leukemia. However, nothing is known about the direct metabolic impacts
   of menaquinone in cancer, which could provide insights into its
   mechanism of action. Here, we used metabolomics to investigate the
   process by which menaquinone exerts antiproliferative activity on Jurkat
   cells. We first validated the dose-dependent, semi-selective,
   pro-apoptotic activity of menaquinone treatment on Jurkat cells relative
   to non-cancerous lymphoblasts. We then used mass spectrometry-based
   metabolomics to identify systems-scale changes in metabolic dynamics
   that are distinct from changes induced in non-cancerous cells or by
   other chemotherapeutics. One of the most significantly affected
   metabolites was phosphoethanolamine, which exhibited a two-fold increase
   in menaquinone-treated Jurkat cells compared to vehicle-treated cells at
   24 h, growing to a five-fold increase at 72 h. Phosphoethanolamine
   elevation was observed prior to the induction of apoptosis, and was not
   observed in menaquinone-treated lymphoblasts or chemotherapeutic-treated
   Jurkat cells. We also validated the link between menaquinone and
   phosphoethanolamine in an ovarian cancer cell line, suggesting
   potentially broad applicability of their relationship. This
   metabolomics-based work is the first detailed characterization of the
   metabolic impacts of menaquinone treatment and the first identified link
   between phosphoethanolamine and menaquinone-induced apoptosis.}},

Title = {{Highly stable and re-dispersible nano Cu hydrosols with sensitively

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{13775-13783}},
Abstract = {{Highly stable monodispersed nano Cu hydrosols were facilely prepared by
   an aqueous chemical reduction method through selecting copper hydroxide
   (Cu(OH)(2)) as the copper precursor, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and
   ethanol amine (EA) as the complexing agents, and hydrazine hydrate as
   the reducing agent. The size of the obtained Cu colloidal nanoparticles
   was controlled from 0.96 to 26.26 nm by adjusting the dosage of the
   copper precursor. Moreover, the highly stable nano Cu hydrosols could be
   easily concentrated and re-dispersed in water meanwhile maintaining good
   dispersibility. A model catalytic reaction of reducing p-nitrophenol
   with NaBH4 in the presence of nano Cu hydrosols with different sizes was
   performed to set up the relationship between the apparent kinetic rate
   constant (k(app)) and the particle size of Cu catalysts. The
   experimental results indicate that the corresponding k(app) showed an
   obvious size-dependency. Calculations revealed that k(app) was directly
   proportional to the surface area of Cu catalyst nanoparticles, and also
   proportional to the reciprocal of the particle size based on the same
   mass of Cu catalysts. This relationship might be a universal principle
   for predicting and assessing the catalytic efficiency of Cu
   nanoparticles. The activation energy (E-a) of this catalytic reaction
   when using 0.96 nm Cu hydrosol as a catalyst was calculated to be 9.37
   kJ mol(-1), which is considered an extremely low potential barrier. In
   addition, the synthesized nano Cu hydrosols showed size-dependent
   antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)
   and the minimal inhibitory concentration of the optimal sample was lower
   than 5.82 mu g L-1.}},

   storage, and biomedicine. Despite the large number of successful
   demonstrations, there still exists a significant gap between academic
   studies and industrial applications owing to the lack of an ability to
   produce colloidal nanocrystals in large quantities without losing
   control over their properties. Droplet reactors have shown great
   potential for the continuous and scalable production of colloidal
   nanocrystals with uniform and well-controlled sizes, shapes, structures,
   and compositions. In this tutorial review, we begin with rationales for
   the use of droplet reactors as a new platform to scale up the production
   of colloidal nanocrystals, followed by discussions of the general
   concepts and technical challenges in applying droplet reactors to the
   synthesis of nanocrystals, including droplet formation, introduction and
   mixing of reagents, management of gaseous species, and interfacial
   adsorption. At the end, we use a set of examples to highlight the unique
   capabilities of droplet reactors for the high-volume production of
   colloidal nanocrystals in the setting of both homogeneous nucleation and
   seed-mediated growth.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has been proposed as a
   promising method for micro- and nanostructures fabrication on silicon
   (Si) with high aspect ratio, high geometric uniformity and low cost. In
   MaCE, electron holes (h(broken vertical bar)) are injected into Si
   through catalytic reduction of H2O2 on metal catalyst thin film
   patterns. Si beneath the metal is etched through a redox reaction where
   h(+) are involved. This work investigated a fundamental electrochemical
   process during MaCE: the transport of h+, and revealed its unique
   correlation with the 3D profile of the etching results. It is discovered
   that under the uniform etching condition, etching occurs both in the Si
   beneath the catalysts as well as on the sidewall of the etched space. On
   N-type Si, the sidewall etching is intrinsically depressed, and highly
   vertical HAR structures are formed; on P-type Si and undoped Si, the
   sidewall tapering becomes significant as the pattern number and density
   increase. The variation of the 3D profile can be explained by the CT
   during etching using a Schottky junction model, which show dependence on
   the intrinsic properties of the Si. CT involved in the two etching
   process can further be correlated by diffusion or drift of h+, which
   explains the influence of catalysts geometry. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{This work highlights a new bonding technique for micro-fabrication of an
   all silicon 3 meter gas chromatography column that could withstand the
   temperature cycling required for axial temperature programming. Proper
   separation of a complex gas mixture using a miniaturized GC column is
   critical in improving the overall performance of a lab on a chip system
   for environmental monitoring, medical diagnoses, and gas impurity
   measurement. To improve upon current methodology the column was first
   fabricated using micro-fabrication processes; experimentally validated
   using a high performance 3 meter GC column coated with OV-1 stationary
   phase. This process demonstrates that the bonding quality of the GC
   column to a 200 mu m thick silicon lid was improved when using a new
   gold eutectic bonding technique. Furthermore, a new quality control
   technique was developed in order to test the overall bonding quality of
   the bonded pieces by fixing the bottom column and applying a mechanical
   shear force to the top lid. This method could ultimately be used for
   quality control of each individual bonded columns. The gold bonded
   interface of the gold diffusion bonded area is further characterized
   using surface analysis. In the end, the utility of the column was
   demonstrated by separating 21 retention index and molecular weights in
   less than five minutes. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All

Title = {{Insights into the effect of dilute acid, hot water or alkaline
   pretreatment on the cellulose accessible surface area and the overall
   porosity of Populus}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4239-4246}},
Abstract = {{Pretreatment is known to make biomass more reactive to cellulase by
   altering the chemical compositions as well as physical structures of
   biomass. Simons' staining technique along with mercury porosimetry was
   applied on the acid, neutral, and alkaline pretreated materials to
   measure the accessible surface area of cellulose and pore size
   distribution of Populus. The results indicated that acid pretreatment is
   much more effective than water and alkaline pretreatment in terms of
   cellulose accessibility increase. Further investigation suggests that
   lignin does not dictate cellulose accessibility to the extent that
   hemicellulose does, but it does restrict xylan accessibility which in
   turn controls the access of cellulase to cellulose. The most interesting
   finding is that severe acid pretreatment significantly decreases the
   average pore size, i.e. 90\% average size decrease could be observed
   after 60 min dilute acid pretreatment at 160 degrees C; however, the
   nano-pore space formed between the coated microfibrils increased after
   pretreatment, especially with the acid pretreatment, suggesting that
   this particular type of biomass porosity is probably the most
   fundamental barrier to effective enzymatic hydrolysis.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Conventional electronic circuit wiring methods involve subtractive
   processes such as etching the copper foils, and thus are inefficient and
   cause serious environmental problems. Printed electronics technology is
   expected to be more environmentally benign and have lower cost, due to
   its additive characteristics. In this paper, we present a simple and
   efficient strategy to fabricate high performance copper metal fine
   circuits by a galvanic replacement deposition method. Zinc nanoparticles
   filled epoxy resin paste is printed onto the substrate film as the seed
   layer; with a subsequent simple galvanic replacement reaction between Zn
   and Cu2+, we can obtain a conductive Cu layer that can be further
   thickened by electroplating. The as-prepared circuits show bulk Cu
   conductivity, excellent flexibility, adhesion strength and pattern
   resolution. By adjusting the processing parameters, this technology is
   suitable for various practical applications, such as flexible circuit
   boards, RFID tags, touch panels, membrane switches, and photovoltaics,
   making it a promising solution for low-cost and environmentally friendly
   fabrication for flexible electronic devices.}},

Title = {{Brown carbon aerosol in the North American continental troposphere:
   sources, abundance, and radiative forcing}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Chemical components of organic aerosol (OA) selectively absorb light at
   short wavelengths. In this study, the prevalence, sources, and optical
   importance of this so-called brown carbon (BrC) aerosol component are
   investigated throughout the North American continental tropospheric
   column during a summer of extensive biomass burning. Spectrophotometric
   absorption measurements on extracts of bulk aerosol samples collected
   from an aircraft over the central USA were analyzed to directly quantify
   BrC abundance. BrC was found to be prevalent throughout the 1 to 12 km
   altitude measurement range, with dramatic enhancements in
   biomass-burning plumes. BrC to black carbon (BC) ratios, under
   background tropospheric conditions, increased with altitude, consistent
   with a corresponding increase in the absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE)
   determined from a three-wavelength particle soot absorption photometer
   (PSAP). The sum of inferred BC absorption and measured BrC absorption at
   365 nm was within 3\% of the measured PSAP absorption for background
   conditions and 22\% for biomass burning. A radiative transfer model
   showed that BrC absorption reduced top-of-atmosphere (TOA) aerosol
   forcing by similar to 20\% in the background troposphere. Extensive
   radiative model simulations applying this study background tropospheric
   conditions provided a look-up chart for determining radiative forcing
   efficiencies of BrC as a function of a surface-measured BrC : BC ratio
   and single scattering albedo (SSA). The chart is a first attempt to
   provide a tool for better assessment of brown carbon's forcing effect
   when one is limited to only surface data. These results indicate that
   BrC is an important contributor to direct aerosol radiative forcing.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3293-3299}},
Abstract = {{Morphogenesis involves a complex series of cell signaling, migration and
   differentiation events that are coordinated as tissues self-assemble
   during embryonic development. Collective cell movements such as those
   that occur during morphogenesis have typically been studied in 2D with
   single layers of cultured cells adhering to rigid substrates such as
   glass or plastic. In vivo, the intricacies of the 3D microenvironment
   and complex 3D responses are pivotal in the formation of functional
   tissues. To study such processes as collective cell movements within 3D
   multilayered tissues, we developed a microfluidic technique capable of
   producing complex 3D laminar multicellular structures. We call this
   technique ``3D tissue-etching{''} because it is analogous to techniques
   used in the microelectromechanics (MEMS) field where complex 3D
   structures are built by successively removing material from a monolithic
   solid through subtractive manufacturing. We use a custom-designed
   microfluidic control system to deliver a range of tissue etching
   reagents (detergents, chelators, proteases, etc.) to specific regions of
   multilayered tissues. These tissues were previously isolated by
   microsurgical excision from embryos of the African claw-toed frog,
   Xenopus laevis. The ability to shape the 3D form of multicellular
   tissues and to control 3D stimulation will have a high impact on tissue
   engineering and regeneration applications in bioengineering and medicine
   as well as provide significant improvements in the synthesis of highly
   complex 3D integrated multicellular biosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Solid amorphous TiO2 mesospheres were synthesized by controlled
   hydrolysis of Ti-containing precursors. Subsequently, solid TiO2
   mesospheres were exploited as scaffolds and subjected to a one-step
   external template-free hydrothermal treatment, yielding intriguing
   hollow anatase TiO2 mesospheres. The synthetic protocol was optimized by
   investigating the effect of buffer reagents and fluoride ions on the
   formation of hollow TiO2 spheres. The diameter of hollow mesospheres,
   ranging from 308 to 760 nm, can be readily tailored by varying the
   precursor concentration. The average thickness of a shell composed of
   TiO2 nanocrystals was approximately 40 nm with a mean crystal size of
   12.4-20.0 nm. Such hollow TiO2 mesospheres possessed a large surface
   area and were employed in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue
   under UV irradiation. Interestingly, the synthetic conditions were found
   to exert a significant influence on the photocatalytic ability of hollow
   TiO2 mesospheres. The correlation between the degradation ability of
   hollow TiO2 mesospheres and the precursor concentration as well as the
   hydrothermal time was scrutinized. The optimal photocatalytic
   performance of hollow TiO2 mesospheres was identified.}},

Abstract = {{Here we detail the fibrillation process for cellulose and mercerized
   cellulose pulps. Native and mercerized cellulose showed a high degree of
   purity as indicated by alpha-cellulose content measurement and XRD
   analysis. Furthermore, a stark change in fiber morphology indicated
   aggregation of fibrils on the surface due to mercerization. Fibrillation
   of pulp was carried out in the following subsequent steps:
   Disintegration, PFI refining, microgrinding by 20 passes and 60 passes
   in a Super Mass Colloider respectively. Fiber samples were collected at
   every stage and highly uniform films were made by ultrafiltration and
   hot press method. The fibers and films made from fibers were then
   characterized by measuring physical properties, contact angle, thermal,
   mechanical, and SEM analysis. The main objective was to characterize the
   physical properties of the films made from different degrees of
   fibrillation. The films obtained were of fairly close grammage
   approximately 35 g m(-2). The target grammage was 40 g m(-2), and the
   slightly lower grammage indicated some fiber loss during the fabrication
   process. Additionally, it was observed that the density of the films
   increased with increasing degree of fibrillation from about 180 g m(-3)
   to 455 g m(-3) for cellulose I and 95 g m(-3) to 385 g m(-3) for
   cellulose II. Cellulose I films showed some contact angle to begin with
   which increased at every stage (14-64 degrees), whereas cellulose II
   films did not display a contact angle until the final stage of
   fibrillation. The films also showed increasing strength and an evolution
   of tensile strength from initially displaying a tear behavior indicating
   poor bonding to typical micro fibrillated cellulose films behavior as
   the fibers became increasingly fibrillated. The ultimate tensile
   strength for cellulose changed from tear behavior with no defined break
   to 134.5 MPa. While on the other hand, the same change for cellulose II
   was a maximum of 75.1 MPa from tear behavior. Increasing fibrillation of
   fibrils in both cases showed a decrease in fiber size, well
   differentiated for the two types of pulps at every stage.}},

Title = {{A molecular dynamics study of bond exchange reactions in covalent
   adaptable networks}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{6305-6317}},
Abstract = {{Covalent adaptable networks are polymers that can alter the arrangement
   of network connections by bond exchange reactions where an active unit
   attaches to an existing bond then kicks off its pre-existing peer to
   form a new bond. When the polymer is stretched, bond exchange reactions
   lead to stress relaxation and plastic deformation, or the so-called
   reforming. In addition, two pieces of polymers can be rejoined together
   without introducing additional monomers or chemicals on the interface,
   enabling welding and reprocessing. Although covalent adaptable networks
   have been researched extensively in the past, knowledge about the
   macromolecular level network alternations is limited. In this study,
   molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the
   macromolecular details of bond exchange reactions in a recently reported
   epoxy system. An algorithm for bond exchange reactions is first
   developed and applied to study a crosslinking network formed by epoxy
   resin DGEBA with the crosslinking agent tricarballylic acid. The trace
   of the active units is tracked to show the migration of these units
   within the network. Network properties, such as the distance between two
   neighboring crosslink sites, the chain angle, and the initial modulus,
   are examined after each iteration of the bond exchange reactions to
   provide detailed information about how material behaviors and
   macromolecular structure evolve. Stress relaxation simulations are also
   conducted. It is found that even though bond exchange reactions change
   the macroscopic shape of the network, microscopic network characteristic
   features, such as the distance between two neighboring crosslink sites
   and the chain angle, relax back to the unstretched isotropic state.
   Comparison with a recent scaling theory also shows good agreement.}},

Title = {{Aerosol characterization over the southeastern United States using
   high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry: spatial and seasonal
   variation of aerosol composition and sources with a focus on organic
   nitrates}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{7307-7336}},
Abstract = {{!We deployed a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer
   (HR-ToF-AMS) and an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) to
   characterize the chemical composition of submicron non-refractory
   particulate matter (NR-PM1) in the southeastern USA. Measurements were
   performed in both rural and urban sites in the greater Atlanta area,
   Georgia (GA), and Centreville, Alabama (AL), for approximately 1 year as
   part of Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology study
   (SCAPE) and Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS). Organic aerosol
   (OA) accounts for more than half of NR-PM1 mass concentration regardless
   of sampling sites and seasons. Positive matrix factorization (PMF)
   analysis of HR-ToF-AMS measurements identified various OA sources,
   depending on location and season. Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and cooking
   OA (COA) have important, but not dominant, contributions to total OA in
   urban sites (i.e., 21-38\% of total OA depending on site and season).
   Biomass burning OA (BBOA) concentration shows a distinct seasonal
   variation with a larger enhancement in winter than summer. We find a
   good correlation between BBOA and brown carbon, indicating biomass
   burning is an important source for brown carbon, although an additional,
   unidentified brown carbon source is likely present at the rural
   Yorkville site. Isoprene-derived OA factor (isoprene-OA) is only
   deconvolved in warmer months and contributes 18-36\% of total OA. The
   presence of isoprene-OA factor in urban sites is more likely from local
   production in the presence of NOx than transport from rural sites.
   More-oxidized and less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA and
   LO-OOA, respectively) are dominant fractions (47-79 \%) of OA in all
   sites. MO-OOA correlates well with ozone in summer but not in winter,
   indicating MO-OOA sources may vary with seasons. LO-OOA, which reaches a
   daily maximum at night, correlates better with estimated nitrate
   functionality from organic nitrates than total nitrates.
   Based on the HR-ToF-AMS measurements, we estimate that the nitrate
   functionality from organic nitrates contributes 63-100\% to the total
   measured nitrates in summer. Furthermore, the contribution of organic
   nitrates to total OA is estimated to be 5-12\% in summer, suggesting
   that organic nitrates are important components in the ambient aerosol in
   the southeastern USA. The spatial distribution of OA is investigated by
   comparing simultaneous HR-ToF-AMS measurements with ACSM measurements at
   two different sampling sites. OA is found to be spatially homogeneous in
   summer due possibly to stagnant air mass and a dominant amount of
   regional secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the southeastern USA. The
   homogeneity is less in winter, which is likely due to spatial variation
   of primary emissions.
   We observe that the seasonality of OA concentration shows a clear
   urban/rural contrast. While OA exhibits weak seasonal variation in the
   urban sites, its concentration is higher in summer than winter for rural
   sites. This observation from our year-long measurements is consistent
   with 14 years of organic carbon (OC) data from the SouthEastern Aerosol
   Research and Characterization (SEARCH) network. The comparison between
   short-term measurements with advanced instruments and long-term
   measurements of basic air quality indicators not only tests the
   robustness of the short-term measurements but also provides insights in
   interpreting long-term measurements. We find that OA factors resolved
   from PMF analysis on HR-ToF-AMS measurements have distinctly different
   diurnal variations. The compensation of OA factors with different
   diurnal trends is one possible reason for the repeatedly observed,
   relatively flat OA diurnal profile in the southeastern USA. In addition,
   analysis of long-term measurements shows that the correlation between OC
   and sulfate is substantially stronger in summer than winter. This
   seasonality could be partly due to the effects of sulfate on isoprene
   SOA formation as revealed by the short-term intensive measurements.}},

Title = {{Secondary organic aerosol formation from the beta-pinene+NO3 system:
   effect of humidity and peroxy radical fate}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{7497-7522}},
Abstract = {{The formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the oxidation of
   beta-pinene via nitrate radicals is investigated in the Georgia Tech
   Environmental Chamber (GTEC) facility. Aerosol yields are determined for
   experiments performed under both dry (relative humidity (RH) <2 \%) and
   humid (RH = 50\% and RH = 70 \%) conditions. To probe the effects of
   peroxy radical (RO2) fate on aerosol formation, ``RO2+NO3 dominant{''}
   and ``RO2+HO2 dominant{''} experiments are performed. Gas-phase organic
   nitrate species (with molecular weights of 215, 229, 231, and 245 amu,
   which likely correspond to molecular formulas of C10H17NO4, C10H15NO5,
   C10H17NO5, and C10H15NO6, respectively) are detected by chemical
   ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) and their formation mechanisms are
   proposed. The NO+ (at m/z 30) and NO2+ (at m/z 46) ions contribute about
   11\% to the combined organics and nitrate signals in the typical aerosol
   mass spectrum, with the NO+:NO2+ ratio ranging from 4.8 to 10.2 in all
   experiments conducted. The SOA yields in the ``RO2+NO3 dominant{''} and
   ``RO2+HO2 dominant{''} experiments are comparable. For a wide range of
   organic mass loadings (5.1-216.1 mu g m(-3)), the aerosol mass yield is
   calculated to be 27.0-104.1 \%. Although humidity does not appear to
   affect SOA yields, there is evidence of particle-phase hydrolysis of
   organic nitrates, which are estimated to compose 45-74\% of the organic
   aerosol. The extent of organic nitrate hydrolysis is significantly lower
   than that observed in previous studies on photooxidation of volatile
   organic compounds in the presence of NOx. It is estimated that about 90
   and 10\% of the organic nitrates formed from the beta-pinene+NO3
   reaction are primary organic nitrates and tertiary organic nitrates,
   respectively. While the primary organic nitrates do not appear to
   hydrolyze, the tertiary organic nitrates undergo hydrolysis with a
   lifetime of 3-4.5 h. Results from this laboratory chamber study provide
   the fundamental data to evaluate the contributions of monoterpene+NO3
   reaction to ambient organic aerosol measured in the southeastern United
   States, including the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) and the
   Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE) study.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the relationship between the number concentration of
   boundary-layer cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and light extinction to
   investigate underlying aerosol processes and satellite-based CCN
   estimates. For a variety of airborne and ground-based observations not

   alpha is the Angstrom exponent. The deviation of 1 km horizontal average
   data from this approximation is typically within a factor of 2.0.
   partial derivative logCCN / partial derivative log sigma is less than
   unity because, among other explanations, growth processes generally make
   aerosols scatter more light without increasing their number. This,
   barring special meteorology-aerosol connections, associates a doubling
   of aerosol optical depth with less than a doubling of CCN, contrary to

Title = {{Highly Flexible Silicone Coated Neural Array for Intracochlear
   Electrical Stimulation}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We present an effective method for tailoring the flexibility of a
   commercial thin-film polymer electrode array for intracochlear
   electrical stimulation. Using a pneumatically driven dispensing system,
   an average 232 +/- 64 mu m (mean +/- SD) thickness layer of silicone
   adhesive coating was applied to stiffen the underside of polyimide
   multisite arrays. Additional silicone was applied to the tip to protect
   neural tissue during insertion and along the array to improve surgical
   handling. Each array supported 20 platinumsites (180 mu m dia., 250 mu m
   pitch), spanning nearly 28 mm in length and 400 mu m in width. We report
   an average intracochlear stimulating current threshold of 170 +/- 93 mu
   A to evoke an auditory brainstem response in 7 acutely deafened felines.
   A total of 10 arrays were each inserted through a round window approach
   into the cochlea's basal turn of eight felines with one delamination
   occurring upon insertion (preliminary results of the in vivo data
   presented at the 48th Annual Meeting American Neurotology Society,
   Orlando, FL, April 2013, and reported in Van Beek-King 2014). Using
   microcomputed tomography imaging (50 mu m resolution), distances ranging
   from 100 to 565 mu m from the cochlea's central modiolus were measured.
   Our method combines the utility of readily available commercial devices
   with a straightforward postprocessing step on the order of 24 hours.}},

Title = {{Fabrication of oleophobic paper with tunable hydrophilicity by treatment
   with non-fluorinated chemicals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{14651-14660}},
Abstract = {{Hydrophilic-oleophobic surfaces have attracted significant attention
   recently due to their potential use in technologies ranging from
   oil-water separation to self-cleaning surfaces. However, existing
   methods rely heavily on fluorinated coating materials, which are harmful
   to the environment. In this manuscript, a simple, solution based method
   to fabricate oleophobic paper with tunable hydrophilicity using a
   non-fluorinated material is reported for the first time. Wetting control
   is achieved by paper surface modification using a thin film of
   hydrolyzed methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS). Hydrophilicity is tuned by
   adjusting the sonication time during MTMS hydrolysis. Si-29 NMR and
   ATR-FTIR analyses reveal that the change in hydrophilicity is caused by
   varying the concentration of polar silanol groups in the MTMS solution
   and, ultimately, on the film surface. The modified paper displays
   wetting behavior ranging from superhydrophilic/oleophobic (immediate
   water absorption; motor oil contact angle, 64.2 degrees +/- 1.4 degrees)
   to amphiphobic (water contact angle 85.2 degrees +/- 3.4 degrees; motor
   oil contact angle 61.2 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees) as a function of
   hydrolysis time. For all surface-modified samples, no absorption of
   motor oil is observed for several weeks, indicating stable oil
   resistance. Based upon results from SEM, optical profilometry, and air
   permeability, the intrinsic porosity of paper is also largely retained
   after coating.}},

Abstract = {{Endowing graphene sponge with compressibility and conductivity offers
   the possibility to regenerate piezoresistivity and is therefore of great
   interest in the field of sensors. In this work, highly compressible
   three-dimensional graphene-only sponge (CGS) was prepared through a
   facile method by using ammonium sulfide and ammonia solutions under mild
   conditions. The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared CGSs
   can be controlled by adjusting the mass ratio of graphene oxide (GO) to
   ammonium sulfide which changed from a metallic sheen bulk with a
   leaf-shaped structure to a black sponge with a porous structure.
   Besides, by simply changing the concentrations of GO, CGSs with
   different porosity, conductivity as well as mechanical strength were
   obtained. Moreover, the resultant CGSs show ultralow density (as low as
   4.9 mg cm(-3)), high porosity (as much as 99.8\%), great compressibility
   (as much as the strain of 80\%), and excellent stability (100 cycles)
   during compression. Furthermore, the sensitive variation of electrical
   resistance and cycle stability was validated under the compressive
   strain of 50\% which make CGSs great candidates for pressure-responsive
   sensors, elastic conductors and other applications.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{12728-12736}},
Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles have the potential for
   use as a multimodal cancer therapy agent due to their ability to carry
   anticancer drugs and generate localized heat when exposed to an
   alternating magnetic field, resulting in combined chemotherapy and
   hyperthermia. To explore this potential, we synthesized SPIOs with a
   phospholipid-polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating, and loaded Doxorubicin
   (DOX) with a 30.8\% w/w loading capacity when the PEG length is
   optimized. We found that DOX-loaded SPIOs exhibited a sustained DOX
   release over 72 hours where the release kinetics could be altered by the
   PEG length. In contrast, the heating efficiency of the SPIOs showed
   minimal change with the PEG length. With a core size of 14 nm, the SPIOs
   could generate sufficient heat to raise the local temperature to 43
   degrees C, sufficient to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells. Further, we
   found that DOX-loaded SPIOs resulted in cell death comparable to free
   DOX, and that the combined effect of DOX and SPIO-induced hyperthermia
   enhanced cancer cell death in vitro. This study demonstrates the
   potential of using phospholipid-PEG coated SPIOs for
   chemotherapy-hyperthermia combinatorial cancer treatment with increased
   efficacy.}},

Title = {{Stick-slip water penetration into capillaries coated with swelling
   hydrogel}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{5933-5939}},
Abstract = {{We have observed intriguing stick-slip behavior during capillary
   pressure driven filling of borosilicate microtubes coated with hydrogel
   on their inner wall. Swelling of hydrogel upon exposure to a translating
   waterfront is accompanied by ``stick-and-slip'' motion. This results in
   the macroscopic filling velocity for water penetration into glass
   capillaries coated with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) being
   constant throughout the filling process, and reduced by three orders of
   magnitude when compared to filling of uncoated capillaries. A simple
   scaling analysis is used to introduce a possible explanation by
   considering the mechanisms responsible for pinning and unpinning of the
   contact line. The explanation assumes that the time scale for water
   diffusion into a hydrogel film and the resulting swelling/change of the
   local meniscus contact angle define the duration of each ``stick''
   event. The ``slip'' length scale is in turn established by the
   elastocapillary deformation of dry hydrogel at the pinning point of the
   contact line. The sequential dynamics of these processes then determine
   the rate of water filling into a swelling capillary. Collectively, these
   experimental and theoretical results provide a new conceptual framework
   for liquid motion confined by soft, dynamically evolving polymer
   interfaces, in which the system creates an energy barrier to further
   motion through elasto-capillary deformation, and then lowers the barrier
   through diffusive softening. This insight has implications for optimal
   design of microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices based on
   stimuli-responsive smart polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Light activated polymers are a novel group of active materials that
   deform when irradiated with light at specific wavelengths. This paper
   focuses on the understanding and evaluation of light activated covalent
   adaptable networks formed by radical polymerization reactions, which
   have potential applications as novel actuators, surface patterning, and
   light-induced bending and folding. In these polymer networks, free
   radicals are generated upon light irradiation and lead to evolution of
   the polymer network structure through bond exchange reactions. It is
   well known that oxygen is an important inhibitor in radical-based
   chemistry as oxygen reacts with free radicals and renders them as
   inactive species towards further propagation and reaction. However, it
   is unclear how radical depletion by oxygen may affect the light-induced
   actuation. This paper studies the effects of oxygen on both stress
   relaxation and bending actuation. Light induced stress relaxation
   experiments are conducted in an environmental chamber where the
   concentration of oxygen is controlled by the nitrogen flow. A
   constitutive model that considers oxygen diffusion, radical termination
   due to oxygen, and the polymer network evolution is developed and used
   to study the stress relaxation and bending, and the model predictions
   agree well with experiments. Parametric studies are conducted to
   identify the situations where the effects of oxygen are negligible and
   other conditions where they must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we explore efficient transformation of broadband wave
   energy into low-power electricity using patterned polymer piezoelectrics
   integrated with an Elliptical Acoustic Mirror (EAM) configuration. The
   mirror under consideration features a semi-elliptical continuous mirror
   with a rectangular arrangement of harvesting material overlapping the
   geometrical focus of the mirror. Spatial and temporal transformation of
   the wave propagation field into the frequency-wavenumber domain is
   performed in order to identify the wavenumber content inside the mirror
   region. A frequency-domain Root-Mean-Square (RMS) evaluation is then
   applied in order to guarantee broadband harvesting characteristics to
   the resulting Distributed Harvester (DH). Computational modeling and
   experimental testing are employed to quantify performance enhancement of
   the presented approach in the 20-120 kHz range, where broadband focusing
   characteristics of the continuous EAM are confirmed experimentally.
   Additionally the patterned configuration with proper wiring results in
   substantial power enhancement over 20-60 kHz, i.e. the neighborhood of
   the center frequency used in its Fourier transform-based design.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting using a disk-type piezoelectric
   bimorph with thickness poled circular piezoelectric laminates is
   explored theoretically and experimentally. The bimorph disk consists of
   two circular laminates electrically connected in series and shunted
   through the outer surface electrodes to an electrical load for
   characterizing the power output and piezoelectrically shunted vibration
   in response to base excitation. The bimorph disk with free edge
   conditions is mounted to the vibrating base from its center and the
   focus is placed on the fundamental axisymmetric vibration mode.
   Electromechanical coupling is introduced to the distributed-parameter
   model of the thin circular plate and a resistive load is considered
   across the electrodes. Following a modal analysis-based electroelastic
   solution, closed-form expressions are obtained for the voltage output
   and shunted vibration frequency response functions by accounting for the
   two-way coupling in the presence of a finite electrical load impedance.
   Experimental validations of the electroelastic model are given for two

Abstract = {{This paper investigates analytical modeling and experimental validation
   of Ultrasonic Acoustic Energy Transfer (UAET) for low-power electricity
   transfer to exploit in wireless applications ranging from medical
   implants to underwater sensor systems. A piezoelectric receiver bar is
   excited by incident acoustic waves originating from a source of known
   strength located at a specific distance from the receiver. The receiver
   is a free-free piezoelectric cylinder operating in the 33-mode of
   piezoelectricity with a fundamental resonance frequency above the
   audible frequency range. In order to extract the electrical power
   output, the piezoelectric receiver bar is shunted to a generalized
   resistive-reactive circuit. The goal is to quantify the electrical power
   delivered to the load (connected to the receiver) in terms of the source
   strength. Experimental validations are presented along with parameter
   optimization studies. Sensitivity of the electrical power output to the
   excitation frequency in the neighborhood of the receiver's underwater
   resonance frequency, source-to-receiver distance, and source-strength
   level are reported. Resistive and resistive-reactive electrical loading
   cases are discussed for performance enhancement and frequency-wise

Abstract = {{In this work, Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC)-based piezoelectric structures
   are employed for underwater mechanical base excitation (vibration energy
   harvesting) and electrical biomimetic actuation in bending operation at
   low frequencies. The MFC technology (fiber-based piezoelectric
   composites with interdigitated electrodes) exploits the effective
   33-mode of piezoelectricity and strikes a balance between structural
   deformation and force levels for actuation to use in underwater
   locomotion, in addition to offering high power density for energy
   harvesting to enable battery-less underwater sensors. Following in-air
   electroelastic composite model development, it is aimed to establish
   semi-analytical models that can predict the underwater dynamics of thin
   MFC cantilevers for different length-to-width aspect ratios. In-air
   analytical electroelastic dynamics of MFCs is therefore coupled with
   added mass and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping effects of fluid to
   describe the underwater electrohydroelastic dynamics in harvesting and
   actuation. To this end, passive plates of different aspect ratios are
   tested to extract and explore the repeatability of the inertia and drag
   coefficients in Morison's equation. The focus is placed on the first two
   bending modes in this semi-analytical approach. Additionally, nonlinear
   dependence of the output power density to aspect ratio is characterized

Abstract = {{Hydraulic pressure energy harvesters (HPEH) are devices that convert the
   dynamic pressure within hydraulic systems into usable electrical power
   through axially loaded piezoelectric stacks excited off-resonance by the
   fluid. Within hydraulic systems, the dominant frequency is typically a
   harmonic of the pump operating frequency. The pressure fluctuations
   coupled with the piezoelectric stack can be amplified by creating a
   housing design that includes a Helmholtz resonator tuned to the dominant
   frequency of the fluid excitation. A Helmholtz resonator is an acoustic
   device that consists of a cavity coupled to a fluid medium via a neck,
   or in this case a port connection to the fluid flow, that acts as an
   amplifier when within the bandwidth of its resonance. The implementation
   of a piezoelectric stack within the HPEH allows for a Helmholtz
   resonator to be included within the fluidic environment despite the
   significantly higher than air static pressures typical of fluid
   hydraulic systems (on the order of one to tens of MPa). The resistive
   losses within the system, such as from energy harvesting and viscous
   losses, can also be used to increase the bandwidth of the resonance;
   thus increasing the utility of the device. This paper investigates the
   design, modeling, and performance of hydraulic pressure energy
   harvesters utilizing a Helmholtz resonator design.}},

Abstract = {{The global atmospheric iron (Fe) cycle is parameterized in the global
   3-D chemical transport model TM4-ECPL to simulate the proton-and the
   organic ligand-promoted mineral-Fe dissolution as well as the
   aqueousphase photochemical reactions between the oxidative states of Fe
   (III/II). Primary emissions of total (TFe) and dissolved (DFe) Fe
   associated with dust and combustion processes are also taken into
   account, with TFe mineral emissions calculated to amount to similar to
   35 Tg-Fe yr(-1) and TFe emissions from combustion sources of similar to
   2 Tg-Fe yr(-1). The model reasonably simulates the available Fe
   observations, supporting the reliability of the results of this study.
   Proton-and organic ligand-promoted Fe dissolution in present-day
   TM4-ECPL simulations is calculated to be similar to 0.175 Tg-Fe yr(-1),
   approximately half of the calculated total primary DFe emissions from
   mineral and combustion sources in the model (similar to 0.322 Tg-Fe
   yr(-1)). The atmospheric burden of DFe is calculated to be similar to
   0.024 Tg-Fe. DFe deposition presents strong spatial and temporal
   variability with an annual flux of similar to 0.496 Tg-Fe yr(-1), from
   which about 40\% (similar to 0.191 TgFe yr(-1)) is deposited over the
   ocean. The impact of air quality on Fe deposition is studied by
   performing sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850),
   present (year 2008) and future (year 2100) emission scenarios. These
   simulations indicate that about a 3 times increase in Fe dissolution may
   have occurred in the past 150 years due to increasing anthropogenic
   emissions and thus atmospheric acidity. Air-quality regulations of
   anthropogenic emissions are projected to decrease atmospheric acidity in
   the near future, reducing to about half the dust-Fe dissolution relative
   to the present day. The organic ligand contribution to Fe dissolution
   shows an inverse relationship to the atmospheric acidity, thus its
   importance has decreased since the preindustrial period but is projected
   to increase in the future. The calculated changes also show that the
   atmospheric DFe supply to the globe has more than doubled since the
   preindustrial period due to 8-fold increases in the primary non-dust
   emissions and about a 3-fold increase in the dust-Fe dissolution flux.
   However, in the future the DFe deposition flux is expected to decrease
   (by about 25 \%) due to reductions in the primary non-dust emissions
   (about 15 \%) and in the dust-Fe dissolution flux (about 55 \%). The
   present level of atmospheric deposition of DFe over the global ocean is
   calculated to be about 3 times higher than for 1850 emissions, and about
   a 30\% decrease is projected for 2100 emissions. These changes are
   expected to impact most on the high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll oceanic
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distributions and sources of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments from the Yangtze Estuary were
   systematically analyzed. The results indicated significant spatial
   variations. The mean of Sigma PAHs in different sampling times in a year
   varied from 128.5 +/- 51.4 to 307.8 +/- 108.9 ng g(-1). Samples
   collected during the flood season showed higher PAH concentrations and
   larger PAH fluctuations compared with those collected during the dry
   season. This variation was mainly ascribed to the change in the river
   flow rate. Higher values of Sigma PAHs were observed in the inner
   estuary than the adjacent coastal area over a year because of diffusion
   and degradation effects. Analysis of PAH abundance revealed a
   predominant proportion of light PAHs with two to three rings, with
   phenanthrene being the most abundant. Based on principal component
   analysis, vehicular emissions, coal and biomass combustion were the main
   sources of PAHs.}},

Abstract = {{Multidimensional fibrous carbon scaffolds, derived from carbonized
   filter papers (CFPs), were used to support SnO2 nanocrystals (NCs, with
   a size of 4-5 nm) to form a free-standing SnO2NC@CFP hybrid anode for
   Li-ion batteries. The SnO2NC particles are well accreted on the surfaces
   of 1D carbon fibers and 2D ultrathin carbon sheets while maintaining 3D
   interconnected pores of the carbon matrices for fast ionic transport.
   The SnO2NC@CFP hybrid electrode exhibits long-term higher energy density
   than the commercial graphite anode, and excellent rate capability,
   mainly due to good dispersion of SnO2 in the multidimensional conductive
   carbon. In particular, the reversible deformation of the flexible
   fibrous carbon matrices, as inferred from in situ Raman spectroscopy and
   SEM image analysis, facilitates stress release from the active SnO2NCs
   during discharge-charge cycling while maintaining the structural
   integrity of the self-supported SnO2NC@CFP anode. These demonstrate that
   the rational combination of the multidimensional architecture of
   deformable carbon with nanoscale active materials is ideally suited for
   high-performance Li-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Legged robots must traverse complex terrain consisting of particles of
   varying size, shape and texture. While much is known about how robots
   can effectively locomote on hard ground and increasingly on homogeneous
   granular media, principles of locomotion over heterogeneous granular
   substrates are relatively unexplored. To systematically discover how
   substrate heterogeneity affects ambulatory locomotion, we investigate
   how the presence of a single boulder (3D printed convex objects of
   different geometries) embedded in fine granular media affects the
   trajectory of a small (150 g) six legged robot. Using an automated
   system to collect thousands of locomotion trials, we observed that
   trajectories were straight before the interaction with the boulder, and
   scattered to different angles after the interaction depending on the
   leg-boulder contact positions. However, this dependence of scattering
   angle upon contact zone was relatively insensitive to boulder shape,
   orientation and roughness. 1 Inspired by this insensitivity, here we
   develop an anticipatory control scheme which uses the scattering
   information in coordination with a tail induced substrate jamming. Our
   scheme allows the robot to ``envision{''} outcomes of the interaction
   such that the robot can prevent trajectory deviation before the
   scattering occurs. We hypothesize that (particularly during rapid
   running or in the presence of noisy sensors) appropriate substrate
   manipulation can allow a robot to remain in a favorable locomotor
   configuration and avoid catastrophic interactions.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{5190-5197}},
Abstract = {{A viable strategy for uniform organo-silica hybrid nanoparticles and
   nanocapsules was developed. The key to our strategy is the
   implementation of spherical star-like homopolymers and diblock
   copolymers with well-controlled molecular weights that form unimolecular
   micelles in solution as nanoreactors. Organo-silica hybrid nanoparticles
   were crafted by introducing trimethoxysilyl functionalities to the arm
   of starlike homopolymers. Quite intriguingly, organo-silica hybrid
   nanocapsules with an interior cavity were created when the
   trimethoxysilyl moieties were incorporated into the outer block of
   star-like diblock copolymers. The diameter of hybrid nanoparticles and
   the shell thickness of hybrid nanocapsules can be readily tailored via
   the living polymerization of star-like homopolymer and diblock copolymer
   nanoreactors, respectively. These hybrid nanoparticles and nanocapsules
   may find promising applications in polymer nanocomposites, water
   purification, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. We envision that
   the nanoreactor strategy is general and robust. By rationally designing
   nonlinear yet structurally regular polymers possessing metal-containing
   units, other exotic metal- and metal oxide-containing nanostructures can
   also be easily accessed for a variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel protocol to prepare multifunctional magnetic organic-inorganic
   nanostructured catalysts of Fe3O4@ organosilicon/Ag with tailored
   properties is developed. Such nanostructure design endows the catalysts
   with superparamagnetism (11.6 emu g(-1)), excellent oxidation
   resistance, and catalytic activity. Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are
   encapsulated with porous organosilicon via improved self-assembly of a
   flexible-bridged organosilicon precursor without templates.
   Subsequently, dispersed Ag NPs are in situ grown on the porous
   microparticles via a silver mirror reaction. The as-prepared
   multifunctional catalysts are characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a vibration sample
   magnetometer, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, and
   nitrogen adsorption and desorption, respectively. The resultant hybrid
   microparticles possess micro-and nano-pores, and exhibit a small
   hysteresis loop and low coercivity. Meaningfully, they exhibit
   exceptional catalytic performance for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol in
   the presence of sodium borohydride and could be reused at least 9 times
   with excellent stability by means of convenient magnetic separation. The
   catalysts could be employed to reduce other dyes such as methylene blue,
   orange G and rhodamine B, and their corresponding reductions follow
   pseudo-first-order reactions. Therefore, the proposed structure design
   and scalable route for the synthesis of hierarchical catalysts can pave
   the way for synthesizing other catalyst systems to address the diverse

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{71}},
Pages = {{57339-57345}},
Abstract = {{Stable optical properties of high transmittance and low yellow index are
   required for a polyimide film as a flexible display substrate, but
   thermal processes could result in its color change by thermal
   imidization. To prevent the color change, anti-oxidants have been used,
   but as yet though, the effect of oxidation in polyimide has remained
   unexplored. We explore the yellow index and absorbance changes of
   fluorinated polyimide after thermal imidization to determine the color
   change kinetics. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of
   anti-oxidants on film color change, showing that anti-oxidants even
   accelerate the color change due to their decomposition. Both
   experimental findings and density functional theory calculations suggest
   that the oxidative stability for the thermal imidization could have a
   modest impact, and in turn yellow index is less dependent on the
   oxidation of fluorinated polyimide, attributed to mild interaction
   between fluorinated polyimide and oxygen insufficient to form strong
   oxidation of diamine groups.}},

Title = {{Mechanically programmed shape change in laminated elastomeric composites}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{5754-5764}},
Abstract = {{Soft, anisotropic materials, such as myocardium in the heart and the
   extracellular matrix surrounding cells, are commonly found in nature.
   This anisotropy leads to specialized responses and is imperative to
   material functionality, yet few soft materials exhibiting similar
   anisotropy have been developed. Our group introduced an anisotropic
   shape memory elastomeric composite (A-SMEC) composed of non-woven,
   aligned polymer fibers embedded in an elastomeric matrix. The composite
   exhibited shape memory (SM) behavior with significant anisotropy in
   room-temperature shape fixing. Here, we exploit this anisotropy by
   bonding together laminates with oblique anisotropy such that tensile
   deformation at room temperature mechanical programming - results in
   coiling. This response is a breakthrough in mechanical programming,
   since non-affine shape change is achieved by simply stretching the
   layered A-SMECs at room temperature. We will show that pitch and
   curvature of curled geometries depend on fiber orientations and the
   degree of strain programmed into the material. To validate experimental
   results, a model was developed that captures the viscoplastic response
   of A-SMECs. Theoretical results correlated well with experimental data,
   supporting our conclusions and ensuring attainability of predictable
   curling geometries. We envision these smart, soft, shape changing
   materials will have aerospace and medical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of the non-line-of-sight vapor deposition techniques, such
   as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD),
   offer unique opportunities to produce well-defined high surface area
   current collectors, thin films or various nanostructures of active
   (ion-storage) materials, protective coatings, solid electrolytes and
   improved separators. These features hold significant promise for solving
   emerging issues in advanced LiBs and supercapacitors. This paper reviews
   recent developments and applications of CVD and ALD for these energy
   storage devices, providing selected examples and outlining critical
   challenges for further exploration.}},
