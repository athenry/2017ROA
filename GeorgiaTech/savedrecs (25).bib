Abstract = {{A series of injection experiments was conducted in a He le-Shaw
   cell-like radial-flow device filled with fine sands to better understand
   the fundamental failure/flow mechanisms when dense granular media were
   invaded and displaced by a fluid. Both aqueous glycerin solutions and
   polyacrylamide solutions were used as the invading fluid. The
   experimental findings suggest that as the injection velocity and fluid
   viscosity (or polymer concentration) increase, there is a transition
   from the solid-like to the fluid-like behavior in the granular media
   response. On the basis of the patterns of grain displacements and fluid
   flow, four distinct failure/flow regimes can be identified from the
   experiments: the simple radial-flow regime, the infiltration- or
   leakoff-dominated regime, the grain-displacement-dominated regime, and
   the viscous-fingering-dominated regime. These failure/flow patterns
   emerge as a result of competition among various forms of energy
   dissipation (i.e., viscous dissipation through flow in porous media,
   dissipation by means of grain displacements, and viscous dissipation
   through flow in thin channels).}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a method to render stainless steel surfaces
   superhydrophobic while maintaining their corrosion resistance. Creation
   of surface roughness on 304 and 316 grade stainless steels was performed
   using a hydrofluoric acid bath. New insight into the etch process is
   developed through a detailed analysis of the chemical and physical
   changes that occur on the stainless steel surfaces. As a result of
   intergranular corrosion, along with metallic oxide and fluoride
   redeposition, surface roughness was generated on the nano- and
   microscales. Differences in alloy composition between 304 and 316 grades
   of stainless steel led to variations in etch rate and different levels
   of surface roughness for similar etch times. After fluorocarbon film
   deposition to lower the surface energy, etched samples of 304 and 316
   stainless steel displayed maximum static water contact angles of 159.9
   and 146.6 degrees, respectively. However, etching in HF also caused both
   grades of stainless steel to be susceptible to corrosion. By passivating
   the HF-etched samples in a nitric acid bath, the corrosion resistant
   properties of stainless steels were recovered. When a three step process
   was used, consisting of etching, passivation and fluorocarbon
   deposition, 304 and 316 stainless steel samples exhibited maximum
   contact angles of 157.3 and 134.9 degrees, respectively, while
   maintaining corrosion resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability and security of broadcasting is critical in Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSNs). Since reliability and security compete for the same
   resources, we are interested in jointly solving for error control coding
   (to achieve reliability) and integrity for a broadcast scenario. We
   assume Byzantine attacks in which the adversary can compromise nodes and
   then drop (or modify) the legitimate packets or inject its own packets.
   For reliable and efficient multihop broadcasting, it is critical to
   reduce the energy consumption and latency. To prevent the adversary from
   consuming the scarce network resources by injecting bogus packets, each
   receiver node should make sure that packets it receives are authentic
   and it filters out malicious packets immediately. We build our
   authentication scheme, on top of a reliable and energy efficient
   broadcasting protocol called Collaborative Rateless Broadcast (CRBcast)
   to improve efficiency and reliability. On contrary to the previous
   schemes, our scheme is resilient with respect to Byzantine adversary as
   well as routing and flooding attacks and protocol exploits. Moreover, we
   compared our scheme with the previously proposed broadcast
   authentication schemes and showed that our scheme outperforms them in
   terms of efficiency and data availability. This is a crucial improvement
   over the previous schemes that ensure availability by flooding,
   introducing very large communication overhead and latency. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper has been motivated by the need to reduce the number of live
   animal tests in the development of an automated live-bird transfer
   system (LBTS) for the poultry meat-processing industry. Simulation-based
   models have been developed, which carefully address key engineering
   issues prior to live animal tests so that physical experiments can be
   focused on understanding reflex issues such as fear and escape behavior.
   To gain insights into the effects of operational timing on the LBTS
   handling performance, the multibody dynamics is modeled numerically
   based on the method of explicit dynamic finite element analysis (FEA)
   using off-the-shelf FEA packages. The findings also offer information on
   contact forces and their locations acting on the object's body and legs
   by the compliant fingers and grippers respectively for optimizing
   designs and avoiding damage to the object. Specifically, this paper
   discusses computational issues such as time-step considerations and
   highly damped behavior of compliant fingers when modeling using dynamic
   FEA methods. The FEA model has been validated by comparing simulated
   handling of an ellipsoidal object by a pair of robotic hands with
   multiple compliant fingers against published experimental data. It is
   expected that the FEA-based method presented here can be extended to a
   spectrum of applications where flexible multibody dynamics involving
   large deformable contacts and highly damped behaviors plays an important
   role. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the accuracy and effective service life of
   commercially available Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments with repetitive
   loading.
   Methods: We obtained 6 brands of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (SWM)
   from commercial vendors identified from the Internet and the federal
   registry. Five monofilaments of each brand were subjected to repeat
   loading cycles, allowed to rest over night and loaded again the next
   day. First, sets of five monofilaments were loaded 25 times for each of
   five days. Then sets of five monofilaments were subjected to 200 loading
   cycles a day for 15 days. A testing jig ensured each SWM was loaded
   perpendicular to a digital pressure plate. The buckling force was
   measured via the pressure plate to determine failure loads. Several
   statistical techniques were used to examine the behavior of the
   monofilaments over repeated loadings: time series analysis, ANOVA and
   nonparametric comparisons of load distributions.
   Results: The monofilaments tested were neither precise nor accurate. The
   plasticity of filaments increased with repeated loadings resulting in
   lower bending forces. Individual and average bending forces varied
   widely both within and between monofilament brands. All monofilaments
   showed a typical material failure pattern. Initially the bending force
   was high but rapidly decreased and then leveled out at levels 1-2 g
   lower than the starting values. After resting over night, the initial
   bending force was again high but usually not as high as the previous day
   and bending forces decreased and then leveled out. Most monofilaments
   did not start at the accepted 10-g buckling force but varied by up to
   30\% (p < 0.01). At best, monofilaments starting at the accepted 10 +/-
   1 g buckling force would remain within a usable range (9-11 g) for 7-9
   days or to evaluate 70-90 patients.
   Conclusion: Commercially available SWM have significant variability
   within and between devices from different manufacturers. Their actual
   bending force varies widely from their designated 10 g value. When used
   they have a short service life where the instrument is within 10\% of
   their initial bending force which is not usually the stated 10 g of
   force. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of the Locally Competitive Algotihm (LCA), which
   is a Hopfield-style neural network that efficiently solves sparse
   approximation problems (e.g., approximating a vector from a dictionary
   using just a few nonzero coefficients). This class of problems plays a
   significant role in both theories of neural coding and applications in
   signal processing. However, the LCA lacks analysis of its convergence
   properties, and previous results on neural networks for nonsmooth
   optimization do not apply to the specifics of the LCA architecture. We
   show that the LCA has desirable convergence properties, such as
   stability and global convergence to the optimum of the objective
   function when it is unique. Under some mild conditions, the support of
   the solution is also proven to be reached in finite time. Furthermore,
   some restrictions on the problem specifics allow us to characterize the
   convergence rate of the system by showing that the LCA converges
   exponentially fast with an analytically bounded convergence rate. We
   support our analysis with several illustrative simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Causal discovery seeks to recover cause-effect relationships from
   statistical data using graphical models. One goal of this paper is to
   provide an accessible introduction to causal discovery methods for
   climate scientists, with a focus on constraint-based structure learning.
   Second, in a detailed case study constraint-based structure learning is
   applied to derive hypotheses of causal relationships between four
   prominent modes of atmospheric low-frequency variability in boreal
   winter including the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO), Eastern Pacific
   Oscillation (EPO), Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern, and North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results are shown in the form of static
   and temporal independence graphs also known as Bayesian Networks. It is
   found that WPO and EPO are nearly indistinguishable from the
   cause-effect perspective as strong simultaneous coupling is identified
   between the two. In addition, changes in the state of EPO (NAO) may
   cause changes in the state of NAO (PNA) approximately 18 (3-6) days
   later. These results are not only consistent with previous findings on
   dynamical processes connecting different low-frequency modes (e. g.,
   interaction between synoptic and low-frequency eddies) but also provide
   the basis for formulating new hypotheses regarding the time scale and
   temporal sequencing of dynamical processes responsible for these
   connections. Last, the authors propose to use structure learning for
   climate networks, which are currently based primarily on correlation
   analysis. While correlation-based climate networks focus on similarity
   between nodes, independence graphs would provide an alternative
   viewpoint by focusing on information flow in the network.}},

   to horizontal support surface perturbation in the anesthetized cat:
   insights into the role of autogenic feedback in whole body postural
   control. J Neurophysiol 108: 1253-1261, 2012. First published June 6,
   2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00929.2011.-Intact cats and humans respond to
   support surface perturbations with broadly tuned, directionally
   sensitive muscle activation. These muscle responses are further
   sensitive to initial stance widths (distance between feet) and
   perturbation velocity. The sensory origins driving these responses are
   not known, and conflicting hypotheses are prevalent in the literature.
   We hypothesize that the direction-, stance-width-, and
   velocity-sensitive muscle response during support surface perturbations
   is driven largely by rapid autogenic proprioceptive pathways. The
   primary objective of this study was to obtain direct evidence for our
   hypothesis by establishing that muscle spindle receptors in the intact
   limb can provide appropriate information to drive the muscle response to
   whole body postural perturbations. Our second objective was to determine
   if spindle recordings from the intact limb generate the heightened
   sensitivity to small perturbations that has been reported in isolated
   muscle experiments. Maintenance of this heightened sensitivity would
   indicate that muscle spindles are highly proficient at detecting even
   small disturbances, suggesting they can provide efficient feedback about
   changing postural conditions. We performed intraaxonal recordings from
   muscle spindles in anesthetized cats during horizontal, hindlimb
   perturbations. We indeed found that muscle spindle afferents in the
   intact limb generate broadly tuned but directionally sensitive
   activation patterns. These afferents were also sensitive to initial
   stance widths and perturbation velocities. Finally, we found that
   afferents in the intact limb have heightened sensitivity to small
   perturbations. We conclude that muscle spindle afferents provide an
   array of important information about biomechanics and perturbation
   characteristics highlighting their potential importance in generating
   appropriate muscular response during a postural disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops a stochastic approach to model short-crested stormy
   seas as random fields both in space and time. Defining a space-time
   extreme as the largest surface displacement over a given sea surface
   area during a storm, associated statistical properties are derived by
   means of the theory of Euler characteristics of random excursion sets in
   combination with the Equivalent Power Storm model. As a result, an
   analytical solution for the return period of space-time extremes is
   given. Subsequently, the relative validity of the new model and its
   predictions are explored by analyzing wave data retrieved from NOAA buoy
   42003, located in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, offshore
   Naples, Florida. The results indicate that, as the storm area increases
   under short-crested wave conditions, space-time extremes noticeably
   exceed the significant wave height of the most probable sea state in
   which they likely occur and that they also do not violate Stokes
   Miche-type upper limits on wave heights.}},

Abstract = {{Nonreacting supersonic airflow over a wall cavity with a rear ramp both
   with and without an upstream strut is studied with hydroxyl-tagging
   velocimetry and large-eddy simulation (LES). An OH grid formed by
   crossing 11 lines by 11 lines is used to obtain velocities at similar to
   120 grid points. The OH grid is tracked with a new template-matching
   method that determines both linear and rotational displacements. Mean
   and rms fluctuation velocity profiles both with and without the strut
   are analyzed and compared with results obtained from LES, and there is
   good overall agreement between the two methods. The experimental and LES
   results demonstrate that installing an upstream strut increased cavity
   recirculation along the centerline relative to the no-strut
   configuration. In addition, the shear layer is observed to grow more
   quickly and impinge higher on the ramp wall. Some disagreements are
   found in the measured and predicted propagation of the weak compression
   wake formed by the trailing edge of the strut and in the location of the
   velocity gradients in the cavity shear layer; possible reasons are

Abstract = {{Acoustoelasticity, or the change in elastic wave speeds with stress, is
   a well-studied phenomenon for bulk waves. The effect of stress on Lamb
   waves is not as well understood, although it is clear that anisotropic
   stresses will produce anisotropy in the Lamb wave dispersion curves.
   Here the theory of acoustoelastic Lamb wave propagation is developed for
   isotropic media subjected to a biaxial, homogeneous stress field. It is
   shown that, as expected, dispersion curves change anisotropically for
   most stresses, modes, and frequencies. Interestingly, for some
   mode-frequency combinations, changes in phase velocity are isotropic
   even for a biaxial stress field. Theoretical predictions are compared to
   experimental results for several Lamb wave modes and frequencies for
   uniaxial loads applied to an aluminum plate, and the agreement is
   reasonably good. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{A continuous scanning laser Doppler velocimetry (CSLDV) technique is
   used to measure the low frequency broadband vibrations associated with
   human skeletal muscle vibrations (typically f<100 Hz) by continuously
   varying the orientation of laser beam over distances that are short
   compared to the characteristic wavelengths of the vibrations. The high
   frequency scan (compared to the vibration frequency) enables the
   detection of broadband translational and angular velocities at a single
   point using amplitude demodulation of the CSDLV signal. For instance,
   linear scans allow measurement of the normal surface velocity and one
   component of angular velocity vector, while circular scans allow
   measurement of an additional angular velocity component. This CSLDV
   technique is first validated here using gel samples mimicking soft
   tissues and then applied to measure multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) of
   a subject's hand exhibiting fatigue-induced tremor. Hence this CSLDV
   technique potentially provides a means for measuring multiple DOF of
   small human body parts (e. g., fingers, tendons, small muscles) for
   various applications (e. g., haptic technology, remote surgery) when the
   use of skin-mounted sensors (e. g. accelerometers) can be problematic
   due to mass-loading artifacts or tethering issues. (C) 2012 Acoustical

Abstract = {{Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) were deposited onto silicon substrates by
   direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering. The influences of sputtering
   power and sputtering time on the AgNP film morphology were studied using
   atomic force microscopy. The particle size was successfully tuned from
   19 nm to 53 nm by varying the sputtering time at a dc power of 10 W.
   When Rhodamine 6G (R6G) was used as the probe molecule, the AgNP films
   showed significant surface enhanced Raman scattering effect. In
   particular, it is found that larger particles show stronger enhancement
   for lower concentrations of R6G while smaller particles display stronger
   enhancement for higher concentrations of R6G. (C) 2012 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{We developed a modular tube-shaped device as a proof of principle to
   enable the programmed release of encapsulated molecules for controlled
   drug delivery. Each drug-delivery tube module was prepared by assembling
   two separate silicone tubes in a series, one filled with a model
   compound (sodium fluorescein) and the other with a diffusional barrier
   material (polyethylene oxide, PEO). We varied the length of the
   PEO-filled tubes to control the release from the drug-delivery tube
   devices. The onset times and periods of drug release increased with the
   length of the PEO tube. To program the drug release, therefore, we
   prepared devices with combinations of drug-delivery tube modules with
   different lengths of PEO-filled tubes. Using PEO-filled tubes with very
   different lengths achieved a pulsatile drug release while a continuous
   drug release was realized by using PEO-filled tubes with small
   differences in length. We concluded that the modular combination of
   drug-delivery tubes, each composed of a diffusionbarrier tube of
   different length, demonstrates good potential for applications in
   programmed drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{By converting ambient energy into electricity, energy harvesting is
   capable of at least offsetting, or even replacing, the reliance of small
   portable electronics on traditional power supplies, such as batteries.
   Here we demonstrate a novel and simple generator with extremely low cost
   for efficiently harvesting mechanical energy that is typically present
   in the form of vibrations and random displacements/deformation. Owing to
   the coupling of contact charging and electrostatic induction, electric
   generation was achieved with a cycled process of contact and separation
   between two polymer films. A detailed theory is developed for
   understanding the proposed mechanism. The instantaneous electric power
   density reached as high as 31.2 mW/cm(3) at a maximum open circuit
   voltage of 110 V. Furthermore, the generator was successfully used
   without electric storage as a direct power source for pulse
   electrodeposition (PED) of micro/nanocrystalline silver structure. The
   cathodic current efficiency reached up to 86.6\%. Not only does this
   work present a new type of generator that is featured by simple
   fabrication, large electric output, excellent robustness, and extremely
   low cost, but also extends the application of energy-harvesting
   technology to the field of electrochemistry with further utilizations
   including, but not limited to, pollutant degradation, corrosion
   protection, and water splitting.}},

Abstract = {{Energy generation and energy storage are two distinct processes that are
   usually accomplished using two separated units designed on the basis of
   different physical principles, such as piezoelectric nanogenerator and
   Li-ion battery; the former converts mechanical energy into electricity,
   and the latter stores electric energy as chemical energy. Here, we
   introduce a fundamental mechanism that directly hybridizes the two
   processes into one, in which the mechanical energy is directly converted
   and simultaneously stored as chemical energy without going through the
   intermediate step of first converting into electricity. By replacing the
   polyethylene (PE) separator as for conventional Li battery with a
   piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) film, the piezoelectric
   potential from the PVDF film as created by mechanical straining acts as
   a charge pump to drive Li ions to migrate from the cathode to the anode
   accompanying charging reactions at electrodes. This new approach can be
   applied to fabricating a self-charging power cell (SCPC) for sustainable
   driving micro/nanosystems and personal electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) investigation of the Mars Science
   Laboratory (MSL) addresses the chemical and isotopic composition of the
   atmosphere and volatiles extracted from solid samples. The SAM
   investigation is designed to contribute substantially to the mission
   goal of quantitatively assessing the habitability of Mars as an
   essential step in the search for past or present life on Mars. SAM is a
   40 kg instrument suite located in the interior of MSL's Curiosity rover.
   The SAM instruments are a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a tunable laser
   spectrometer, and a 6-column gas chromatograph all coupled through solid
   and gas processing systems to provide complementary information on the
   same samples. The SAM suite is able to measure a suite of light isotopes
   and to analyze volatiles directly from the atmosphere or thermally
   released from solid samples. In addition to measurements of simple
   inorganic compounds and noble gases SAM will conduct a sensitive search
   for organic compounds with either thermal or chemical extraction from
   sieved samples delivered by the sample processing system on the
   Curiosity rover's robotic arm.}},

Abstract = {{The radiative properties of dense nanofluids are investigated. For
   nanofluids, scattering and absorbing of electromagnetic waves by
   nanoparticles, as well as light absorption by the matrix/fluid in which
   the nanoparticles are suspended, should be considered. We compare five
   models for predicting apparent radiative properties of nanoparticulate
   media and evaluate their applicability. Using spectral absorption and
   scattering coefficients predicted by different models, we compute the
   apparent transmittance of a nanofluid layer, including multiple
   reflecting interfaces bounding the layer, and compare the model
   predictions with experimental results from the literature. Finally, we
   propose a new method to calculate the spectral radiative properties of
   dense nanofluids that shows quantitatively good agreement with the
   experimental results. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli expression system continues to dominate the bacterial

   new developments in overcoming its shortcomings are reviewed in this
   paper, including antibiotics-free selection plasmids, extracellular
   production, and posttranslational modifications. The ability for E. coli
   to make mg glycosylated proteins promises even broader applications of
   the E. coli system in the future. Significant progresses have also been
   made over the past few years in alternative bacterial expression
   systems. Notably, the Lactoccocus lactis system has proven to be a
   viable choice for membrane proteins. Additionally, several Pseudomonas
   systems were developed and achieved product titers comparable to E. coli
   systems. Other bacterial systems such as Streptomyces, coryneform
   bacteria, and halophilic bacteria offer advantages in some niche areas,
   providing more choices of bacterial expression systems for recalcitrant
   proteins. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Developing wireless nanodevices and nanosystems is critical for sensing,
   medical science, environmental/infrastructure monitoring, defense
   technology, and even personal electronics. It is highly desirable for
   wireless devices to be self-powered without using a battery. We have
   developed piezoelectric nanogenerators that can serve as self-sufficient
   power sources for micro-/nanosystems. For wurtzite structures that have
   non-central symmetry, such as ZnO, GaN, and InN, a piezoelectric
   potential (piezopotential) is created by applying a strain. The
   nanogenerator uses the piezopotential as the driving force, responding
   to dynamic straining of piezoelectric nanowires. A gentle strain can
   produce an output voltage of up to 20-40 V from an integrated
   nanogenerator. Furthermore, piezopotential in the wurtzite structure can
   serve as a ``gate{''} voltage that can effectively tune/control charge
   transport across an interface/junction; electronics based on such a
   mechanism are referred to as piezotronics, with applications such as
   electronic devices that are triggered or controlled by force or
   pressure, sensors, logic units, and memory. By using the piezotronic
   effect, we show that optoelectronic devices fabricated using wurtzite
   materials can provide superior performance for solar cells, photon
   detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Piezotronic devices are likely to
   serve as ``mediators{''} for directly interfacing biomechanical action
   with silicon-based technology. This article reviews our study of ZnO
   nanostructures over the last 12 years, with a focus on nanogenerators
   and piezotronics.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of the pursuit of a maneuvering target
   by a group of pursuers distributed in the plane. This pursuit problem is
   solved by associating it with a Voronoi-like partitioning problem that
   characterizes the set of initial positions from which the target can be
   intercepted by a given pursuer faster than any other pursuer from the
   same group. In the formulation of this partitioning problem, the target
   does not necessarily travel along prescribed trajectories, as it is
   typically assumed in the literature, but, instead, it can apply an
   ``evading{''} strategy in an effort to delay or, if possible, escape
   capture. We characterize an approximate solution to this problem by
   associating it with a standard Voronoi partitioning problem.
   Subsequently, we propose a relay pursuit strategy, that is, a special
   group pursuit scheme such that, at each instant of time, only one
   pursuer is assigned the task of capturing the maneuvering target. During
   the course of the relay pursuit, the pursuer-target assignment changes
   dynamically with time based on the (time varying) proximity relations
   between the pursuers and the target. This proximity information is
   encoded in the solution of the Voronoi-like partitioning problem.
   Simulation results are presented to highlight the theoretical
   developments. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Low-Cost Thin Glass Interposers as a Superior Alternative to Silicon and
   Organic Interposers for Packaging of 3-D ICs}},

Abstract = {{Interconnecting integrated circuits (ICs) and 3-D-ICs to the system
   board (printed circuit board) are currently achieved using organic or
   silicon-based interposers. Organic interposers face several challenges
   in packaging 2-D and 3-D-ICs beyond the 32-nm node, primarily due to
   their poor dimensional stability and coefficient of thermal expansion
   (CTE) mismatch to silicon. Silicon interposers made with back-end of
   line wafer processes can achieve the required wiring and I/O density,
   but their high-cost limit them to high-performance applications. Glass
   is proposed as a superior alternative to organic and silicon-based
   interposers for packaging of future ICs and 3-D-ICs with highest I/Os at
   lowest cost. This paper presents for the first time a novel thin and
   large panel glass interposer capable of scaling to 700 mm and larger
   panels with potential for significant cost reduction over interposers
   made on 200-mm or 300-mm wafers. The formation of small through vias at
   high speed has been the biggest technical barrier for the adoption of
   glass as an interposer and system substrate; and this paper describes
   pioneering research in via-formation in thin glass substrates, using a
   novel ``polymer-on-glass{''} approach. Electrical modeling and design of
   through package vias (TPVs) in glass is discussed in detail, and the
   feasibility of 50-mu m pitch TPVs in 180-mu m thin glass substrates has
   been demonstrated. The excellent surface finish and low CTE of glass
   leads to increased I/O density, and increased functionality per unit
   area leading to system miniaturization.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: To ascertain whether freezing of gait (FOG) and
   stride reduction (SR) may be relieved by the use of an attachable,
   adjustable laser (the Mobilaser).
   Methods: Seven parkinsonian patients with FOG and SR were randomized in
   an open-label, randomized, cross-over clinical study at a tertiary
   referral center. The Mobilaser was attached to a 4-wheeled walker by
   Velcro and switched on, producing an adjustable red line, which the
   subjects stepped on or over while ambulating a standardized course. The
   length of time each subject took, and the number of freezes they
   experienced traversing the course, using a 4-wheeled walker with the
   device turned on and off, were compared.
   Results: A total of 7 patients were investigated; however, one was
   excluded from the study due to severe deconditioning, prohibiting
   completion of the testing. Of the 6 enrolled, all subjects took less
   time to ambulate the course using the attachable, adjustable laser than
   without it (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.03). In addition, the total
   number of freezes was less in all 6 subjects when using the device than
   without it. No adverse events occurred during the trial.
   Discussion and Conclusions: The Mobilaser is potentially an effective
   and safe device for alleviating parkinsonian FOG and SR.}},

Title = {{Unexpected Specificity of Interspecies Cobamide Transfer from Geobacter

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{78}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains conserve energy from reductive
   dechlorination reactions catalyzed by corrinoid-dependent reductive
   dehalogenase enzyme systems. Dehalococcoides lacks the ability for de
   novo corrinoid synthesis, and pure cultures require the addition of
   cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) for growth. In contrast, Geobacter
   lovleyi, which dechlorinates tetrachloroethene to cis-1,2-dichloroethene
   (cis-DCE), and the nondechlorinating species Geobacter sulfurreducens
   have complete sets of cobamide biosynthesis genes and produced 12.9 +/-
   2.4 and 24.2 +/- 5.8 ng of extracellular cobamide per liter of culture
   suspension, respectively, during growth with acetate and fumarate in a
   completely synthetic medium. G. lavleyi-D. mccartyi strain BAV1 or
   strain FL2 cocultures provided evidence for interspecies corrinoid
   transfer, and cis-DCE was dechlorinated to vinyl chloride and ethene
   concomitant with Dehalococcoides growth. In contrast, negligible
   increase in Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA gene copies and insignificant
   dechlorination occurred in G. sulfurreducens-D. mccartyi strain BAV1 or
   strain FL2 cocultures. Apparently, G. lovleyi produces a cobamide that
   complements Dehalococcoides' nutritional requirements, whereas G.
   sulfurreducens does not. Interestingly, Dehalococcoides dechlorination
   activity and growth could be restored in G.
   sulfurreducens-Dehalococcoides cocultures by adding 10 mu M
   5',6'-dimethylbenzimidazole. Observations made with the G.
   sulfurreducens-Dehalococcoides cocultures suggest that the exchange of
   the lower ligand generated a cobalamin, which supported Dehalococcoides
   activity. These findings have implications for in situ bioremediation
   and suggest that the corrinoid metabolism of Dehalococcoides must be
   understood to faithfully predict, and possibly enhance, reductive
   dechlorination activities.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular environment is a physical support that is critical to cell
   adhesion, migration, and differentiation. In this work, cell-derived
   matrices (CDMs) were obtained by separately culturing fibroblasts,
   preosteoblasts, and chondrocytes. The cells were grown on a coverslip
   and subjected to decellularization using detergents and enzymes. The
   resulting matrices were named fibroblast-derived matrix (FDM),
   preosteoblast-derived matrix (PDM), and chondrocyte-derived matrix
   (CHDM). We hypothesize that the unique compositional and structural
   feature of each CDM provides cells with a distinct microenvironment
   capable of functioning as a different signaling cue in the regulation of
   preosteoblast and rat bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (BMSC)
   osteogenic differentiation. SEM images show that each cell type creates
   its unique surface texture in a fibrillar structure. Three major
   macromolecules, fibronectin, type I collagen, and laminin, were clearly
   identified using both immunofluorescence and Western blot, in which FDM
   exhibited a much stronger signal of each ECM component than that of PDM
   or CHDM. For early cell morphology, BMSCs on the CDMs were highly
   elongated in a spindle-like shape. Both preosteoblasts and BMSCs
   proliferated well on CDMs comparable to the control. Once preosteoblasts
   were cultured for 2 weeks, their osteogenic activity was significantly
   different depending on the type of CDM. Using Alizarin red and von Kossa
   staining, we found that the cells on the FDM were much more osteogenic
   than the other groups. Furthermore, FDM was the most effective in
   upregulating the osteogenic markers, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
   osteopontin, osteocalcin, and type I collagen. In particular, we
   observed a 2.5-fold increase in ALP activity with FDM compared to that
   of control and CHDM. In stark contrast, CHDM was very poor in
   stimulating osteogenic differentiation of preosteoblasts. Interestingly,
   these results were reproducible with the use of BMSCs, which are much
   more heterogeneous in cell populations than preosteoblasts. CHDM was
   still very weak in triggering the osteogenesis of BMSCs, whereas both
   FDM and PDM were equally competitive. This study demonstrates that a
   combination of factors (surface texture and composition) shape a unique
   cellular microenvironment, which serves as a physical cue toward the
   osteogenic differentiation of preosteoblasts and BMSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of proteomics data with biological knowledge is a recent
   trend in bioinformatics. A lot of biological information is available
   and is spread on different sources and encoded in different ontologies
   (e.g. Gene Ontology). Annotating existing protein data with biological
   information may enable the use (and the development) of algorithms that
   use biological ontologies as framework to mine annotated data. Recently
   many methodologies and algorithms that use ontologies to extract
   knowledge from data, as well as to analyse ontologies themselves have
   been proposed and applied to other fields. Conversely, the use of such
   annotations for the analysis of protein data is a relatively novel
   research area that is currently becoming more and more central in
   research. Existing approaches span from the definition of the similarity
   among genes and proteins on the basis of the annotating terms, to the
   definition of novel algorithms that use such similarities for mining
   protein data on a proteome-wide scale. This work, after the definition
   of main concept of such analysis, presents a systematic discussion and
   comparison of main approaches. Finally, remaining challenges, as well as
   possible future directions of research are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A sensor module that integrates a thin film polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF) piezoelectric strain sensor and an in situ data logging platform
   has been designed and implemented for monitoring of the feed and
   transverse forces in the peripheral end milling process. The module,
   which is mounted on the tool shank, measures the dynamic strain(s)
   produced in the tool and logs the data into an on-board card for later
   retrieval. The close proximity between the signal source and the PVDF
   sensor(s) minimizes the attenuation and distortion of the signal along
   the transmission path and provides high-fidelity signals. It also
   facilitates the employment of a first principles model based on the
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and constitutive equations of the
   piezoelectric sensor material to relate the in situ measured PVDF sensor
   signals to the feed and transverse forces acting on the tool. The PVDF
   sensor signals are found to compare well with the force signals measured
   by a platform-type piezoelectric force dynamometer in peripheral end
   milling experiments. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006366]}},

Abstract = {{The thermal and photolytic decomposition of poly(propylene carbonate)
   (PPC) in the presence of a photoacid generator (PAG) was studied. The
   mechanism of previously observed shifts in the decomposition temperature
   of PPC was investigated. The decomposition temperature of PPC can be
   altered when PPC/PAG films contact copper metal. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that a small amount Cu(I) was
   incorporated into the PPC/PAG film causing the increased stability and
   the Cu(I) concentration was similar to that of the PAG. PPC/PAG
   temperature stability was studied for a number of iodonium and
   sulfonium-based PAGs. Every iodonium-based PAG showed a PPC
   decomposition temperature shift and no sulfonium-based PAG showed the
   thermal stability effect. It appears that Cu(I) interacts with iodonium
   in the cation of the PAG causing a change in the acid creation mechanism
   of the PAG. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hafnium oxide (HfO2 or hafnia) holds promise as a high-index dielectric
   in optical devices and thermal barrier coatings, because of its
   transparency over a broad spectrum (from the ultraviolet to the
   mid-infrared) and chemical and thermal stability at high temperatures.
   In the present work, thin hafnia films of thicknesses from about 180 to
   500 nm are deposited on Si substrates using reactive magnetron
   sputtering. The crystalline structure and surface topography are
   characterized by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy,
   respectively. The optical and radiative properties of the film-substrate
   composites are measured at room temperature using spectroellipsometry
   and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry. The optical constants are
   obtained from about 0.37 to 500 mu m by fitting suitable models to the
   experimental results. Optical properties and dielectric function
   modeling are discussed with correlation to both film thickness and
   surface roughness. It is found that a single-oscillator
   dielectric-function model can describe radiative properties from about 1
   to 20 mu m. By combining Cauchy's formula (for the visible and
   near-infrared regions) with a multiple-oscillator Lorentz model (for the
   far-infrared region), a dielectric function is obtained for the HfO2
   films that is applicable from the visible to the far-infrared. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We present an in-depth analysis of time-resolved interaction force
   (TRIF) mode imaging for atomic force microscopy (AFM). A nonlinear model
   of an active AFM probe, performing simultaneous topography and material
   property imaging on samples with varying elasticity and adhesion is
   implemented in Simulink (R). The model is capable of simulating various
   imaging modes, probe structures, sample material properties, tip-sample
   interaction force models, and actuation and feedback schemes. For
   passive AFM cantilevers, the model is verified by comparing results from
   the literature. As an example of an active probe, the force sensing
   integrated readout and active tip (FIRAT) probe is used. Simulation
   results indicate that the active and damped nature of FIRAT provides a
   significant level of control over the force applied to the sample,
   minimizing sample indentation and topography error. Active tip control
   (ATC) preserves constant contact time during force control for stable
   contact while preventing the loss of material property information such
   as elasticity and adhesive force. Simulation results are verified by
   TRIF mode imaging of the samples with both soft and stiff regions. (C)

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional television (3DTV) is believed to be the future of
   television broadcasting that would replace current 2D HDTV technology.
   Future 3DTV would bring a more life-like and visually immersive home
   entertainment experience, in which users will have the freedom to
   navigate through the scene to choose a different viewpoint. A desired
   view can be synthesized at the receiver side using depth image-based
   rendering (DIBR). While this approach has many advantages, one of the
   key challenges in DIBR is how to fill the holes caused by disocclusion
   regions and wrong depth values. In this paper, we propose two new
   approaches for disocclusion removal in DIBR. Both approaches namely
   hierarchical hole-filling (HHF) and depth adaptive hierarchical
   hole-filling eliminate the need for any smoothing or filtering of the
   depth map. Both techniques use a pyramid-like approach to estimate the
   hole pixels from lower resolution estimates of the 3D wrapped image. The
   lower resolution estimates involve a pseudo zero canceling plus Gaussian
   filtering of the wrapped image. The depth adaptive HHF incorporates the
   depth information to produce a higher resolution rendering around
   previously occluded areas. Experimental results show that HHF and depth
   adaptive HHF yield virtual images and stereoscopic videos that are free
   of geometric distortions and a better rendering quality both
   subjectively and objectively than traditional hole-filling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A triple-mode class-AB balanced linear power amplifier (PA) is realized
   in standard 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. For the average efficiency
   enhancement, the triple-mode operation realizes a switched-quadrature
   coupler with a balanced topology to achieve robust load insensitivity.
   The PA and RF switches uniquely utilize the isolation port of the
   switched-quadrature coupler as a signal path in a low-power (LP) mode of
   operation, and the incorporated output matching network satisfies the
   vertical bar Gamma vertical bar = 1 condition from the quadrature
   coupler in the LP mode while providing the necessary load-pull impedance
   from the PA output side in the high-power (HP) mode. To obtain low loss
   and high quality factor (Q) of the passive output-combining network, a
   transformer-based quadrature coupler is implemented using a
   silicon-based integrated passive device process. With a 3.4-V power
   supply, the PA transmits a maximum output power of 28.4 dBm with 40.7\%
   of power-added efficiency (PAE) and linear output power up to 26.6 dBm
   with 35\% of the PAE using a 3-GPP WCDMA modulated signal. With the
   triple-mode operation, a PAE at 16 dBm is enhanced from 11.1\% to 17\%,
   and 47 mA of quiescent current is saved. The PA also shows robust
   operation under 2.5:1 of VSWR condition, achieving 1 dB of the gain
   variation and less than 3.9 dB of ACLR variation. This work demonstrates
   the potential of a highly efficient CMOS PA for WCDMA applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present a field-programmable analog array designed for accurate
   low-power mixed-signal computation. This 25-mm(2) 350 nm-CMOS
   reconfigurable analog IC incorporates digital enhancements to increase
   compatibility in embedded mixed-signal systems. The chip contains 78
   computational analog blocks (CABs) which house a variety of processing
   elements. There are 36 general CABs with hundreds of common analog
   primitives for computation, 18 digital-to-analog converter (DAC) CABs,
   each with 8-b compilable DAC capabilities, and 24 vector-matrix
   multiplier CABs, for low-power parallel processing. A floating-gate
   routing matrix connects these analog elements to one another, both
   within individual CABs and between CABs. To facilitate digital
   interfacing and dynamic reconfigurability, we included a novel network
   of volatile switches based on digital shift and select registers that
   control analog switches. These dynamically controlled switches span all
   of the rows and columns of the internal routing, allowing for run-time
   system modification and scanning I/O. The digital registers can also
   double as on-chip memory. We introduce a new hybrid floating-gate switch
   matrix, which includes switches that eliminate previously observed
   mismatch issues to provide highly precise computation. To highlight the
   potential of this digitally enhanced analog processor, we demonstrate a

Abstract = {{Although several subjective and objective quality assessment methods
   have been proposed in the literature for images and videos from single
   cameras, no comparable effort has been devoted to the quality assessment
   of multicamera images. With the increasing popularity of multiview
   applications, quality assessment of multicamera images and videos is
   becoming fundamental to the development of these applications. Image
   quality is affected by several factors, such as camera configuration,
   number of cameras, and the calibration process. In order to develop an
   objective metric specifically designed for multicamera systems, we
   identified and quantified two types of visual distortions in multicamera
   images: photometric distortions and geometric distortions. The relative
   distortion between individual camera scenes is a major factor in
   determining the overall perceived quality. In this paper, we show that
   such distortions can be translated into luminance, contrast, spatial
   motion, and edge-based structure components. We propose three different
   indices that can quantify these components. We provide examples to
   demonstrate the correlation among these components and the corresponding
   indices. Then, we combine these indices into one multicamera image
   quality measure (MIQM). Results and comparisons with other measures,
   such as peak signal-to noise ratio, mean structural similarity, and
   visual information fidelity show that MIQM outperforms other measures in
   capturing the perceptual fidelity of multicamera images. Finally, we
   verify the results against subjective evaluation.}},

Title = {{The Pros and Cons of Compressive Sensing for Wideband Signal
   Acquisition: Noise Folding versus Dynamic Range}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity present in many signals
   to reduce the number of measurements needed for digital acquisition.
   With this reduction would come, in theory, commensurate reductions in
   the size, weight, power consumption, and/or monetary cost of both signal
   sensors and any associated communication links. This paper examines the
   use of CS in the design of a wideband radio receiver in a noisy
   environment. We formulate the problem statement for such a receiver and
   establish a reasonable set of requirements that a receiver should meet
   to be practically useful. We then evaluate the performance of a CS-based
   receiver in two ways: via a theoretical analysis of its expected
   performance, with a particular emphasis on noise and dynamic range, and
   via simulations that compare the CS receiver against the performance
   expected from a conventional implementation. On the one hand, we show
   that CS-based systems that aim to reduce the number of acquired
   measurements are somewhat sensitive to signal noise, exhibiting a 3 dB
   SNR loss per octave of subsampling, which parallels the classic
   noise-folding phenomenon. On the other hand, we demonstrate that since
   they sample at a lower rate, CS-based systems can potentially attain a
   significantly larger dynamic range. Hence, we conclude that while a
   CS-based system has inherent limitations that do impose some
   restrictions on its potential applications, it also has attributes that
   make it highly desirable in a number of important practical settings.}},

Abstract = {{To develop a model of shared healthcare delivery that includes primary
   care providers (PCP) and ensures best practice in follow-up of pediatric
   cancer survivors.
   Structured interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) were used to
   ascertain familiarity and confidence in providing care to survivors.
   Partnerships were made with HCP societies, and survivor care lectures
   were given at HCP meetings. HCP's preferences for ongoing continuing
   education (CE) opportunities were ascertained. Cancer SurvivorLink(TM),
   a web-based tool, was developed to allow patients to securely store
   their healthcare documents and share them electronically with registered
   HCPs. Educational material developed for Cancer SurvivorLink(TM)
   includes CE modules and QuickFacts-concise summaries of late effects.
   Website utilization was monitored utilizing Google Analytics.
   HCPs described moderate to very low familiarity with survivor care, but
   high interest in online CE learning. Thirty-one lectures were given to
   HCP groups to increase awareness. Preferred types of ongoing CE were:
   lectures, online text, and video modules. CE material was developed
   based on feedback from HCPs and website utilizations and includes 19
   QuickFacts and 5 CE modules. During the first year, the website had 471
   unique visitors and 1,129 total visits. QuickFacts received 345 views
   with Neurocognitive, Survivor Care 101, and Endocrine being most
   visited, and 49 CME modules have been completed.
   PCPs are interested in partnering in models of shared care for pediatric
   cancer survivors. Effective educational initiatives include lectures
   within HCP's professional education constructs and web-based CE
   opportunities. PCP involvement in survivor care alleviates some barriers
   to care such as geographic distance to the the cancer center and ensures
   that more pediatric cancer survivors receive recommended coordinated
   surveillance for late effects of cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study sought to evaluate the performance of microaxial
   ventricular assist devices for the purposes of supporting failing Fontan
   physiology by decreasing central venous pressure.
   Methods: Three Abiomed Impella pumps (Abiomed, Inc, Danvers, Mass) were
   evaluated in a mock circulatory system of the Fontan circuit. The local
   response of pressures and flows to pump function was assessed as a
   function of pump speed and pulmonary vascular resistance at a high
   baseline central venous pressure. For one device, subsequent modeling
   studies were conducted using a lumped parameter model of the single
   ventricle circuit.
   Results: The left ventricular devices (Impella 2.5, 5.0) were shown to
   be suboptimal as single device solutions for cavopulmonary support. The
   small area of these devices relative to vessel diameter led to
   significant flow recirculation without an obstructive separator in
   place. Furthermore, downstream pressure augmentation adversely affected
   the pressure in the superior vena cava. The use of 2 devices would be
   mandatory for successful support. The right-sided device (Impella RP),
   whose outflow was positioned in the left pulmonary artery, demonstrated
   decreased flow recirculation and did not impede superior caval venous
   flow. Although static pressure is still required to drive flow through
   the opposite lung, numeric modeling demonstrated the potential for
   modest but significant improvements in lowering the central venous
   pressure (2-8 mm Hg).
   Conclusions: Left-sided microaxial pumps are not well suited for
   cavopulmonary support because of severe flow recirculation and the need
   for multiple devices. The right-ventricular Impella device provides
   improved performance by directing flow into the pulmonary artery,
   resulting in modest decreases in central venous pressure. (J Thorac

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{144}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Transection of the secondary chordae on the anterior leaflet
   of the mitral valve to relieve leaflet tethering and reduce
   regurgitation is an experimentally proven procedure to correct
   functional mitral regurgitation. In the present study, we sought to
   investigate whether transecting the secondary chordae would have an
   effect on the marginal chordal force on the same leaflet.
   Methods: Adult porcine mitral valves (n = 8) were studied in a pulsatile
   heart simulator, in which the papillary muscle positions can be
   precisely positioned. Miniature transducers were inserted into the
   anterior marginal chordae to measure the chordal forces. Each valve was
   studied under baseline conditions, 3 different tethering conditions
   (apical, apical-lateral, and apical-lateral-posterior), and after
   chordal cutting in the 3 tethering conditions. The temporal changes and
   peak and average marginal chordal forces under each condition are
   reported.
   Results: Apical tethering increased the marginal chordal force by an
   average of 96\% but remained unchanged after chordal cutting. With
   apical-lateral tethering, the marginal chordal force increased by 210\%
   from baseline and increased further to 350\% of baseline after chordal
   cutting. After apical-lateral-posterior tethering, the marginal chordal
   force increased to 335\% of baseline before transection and by 548\%
   after transection.
   Conclusions: The increase in the marginal chordal force after secondary
   chordal cutting depends on the location of the papillary muscles and the
   extent of leaflet tethering. Although chordal cutting might not alter
   the valve mechanics under minimal leaflet tethering, it significantly
   affects the mechanics when the leaflet tethering is more pronounced,
   which is typically seen in patients with functional mitral
   regurgitation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012;144:624-33)}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Advances in the geometric design of blood-contacting
   components are critically important as the use of minimally invasive,
   intravascular blood pumps becomes more pervasive in the treatment of
   adult and pediatric patients with congestive heart failure. The present
   study reports on the evaluation of uniquely shaped filaments and
   diffuser blades in the development of a protective stent for an
   intravascular cavopulmonary assist device for patients with a single
   ventricle.
   Methods: We performed numeric modeling, hydraulic testing of 11 stents
   with an axial flow blood pump, and blood bag experiments (n = 6) of the
   top-performing stent geometries to measure the levels of hemolysis. A
   direct comparison using statistical analyses, including regression
   analysis and analysis of variance, was completed.
   Results: The stent geometry with straight filaments and diffuser blades
   that extended to the vessel wall outperformed all other stent
   configurations. The pump with this particular stent was able to generate
   pressures of 2 to 32 mm Hg for flow rates of 0.5 to 4 L/min at 5000 to
   7000 RPM. A comparison of the experimental performance data to the
   numeric predictions demonstrated an excellent agreement within 16\%. The
   addition of diffuser blades to the stent reduced the flow vorticity at
   the pump outlet. The average and maximum normalized index of hemolysis
   level was 0.0056 g/100 L and 0.0064 g/100 L, respectively.
   Conclusions: The specialized design of the stents, which protect the
   vessel wall from the rotating components of the pump, proved to be
   advantageous by further augmenting the pressure generation of the pump,
   reducing the flow vorticity at the pump outlet, and enhancing flow
   control. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012; 144:704-9)}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) have tremendous potential for in vivo
   molecular imaging because of their high sensitivity. However, the
   diagnostic potential of UCAs has been difficult to exploit because
   current UCAs are based on pre-formed microbubbles, which can only detect
   cell surface receptors. Here, we demonstrate that chemical reactions
   that generate gas forming molecules can be used to perform molecular
   imaging by ultrasound in vivo. This new approach was demonstrated by
   imaging reactive oxygen species in vivo with allylhydrazine, a liquid
   compound that is converted into nitrogen and propylene gas after
   reacting with radical oxidants. We demonstrate that allylhydrazine
   encapsulated within liposomes can detect a 10 micromolar concentration
   of radical oxidants by ultrasound, and can image oxidative stress in
   mice, induced by lipopolysaccharide, using a clinical ultrasound system.
   We anticipate numerous applications of chemically-generated microbubbles
   for molecular imaging by ultrasound, given ultrasound's ability to
   detect small increments above the gas saturation limit, its spatial
   resolution and widespread clinical use.}},

   but improves the power density and sensitivity of the NG significantly.
   With no need of an external power source or batteries, the composite NG
   can efficiently convert the vortex motion in the atmosphere into
   electricity. Based on the Karman vortex street principle, ambient
   wind-speed measurements with the NG are demonstrated. Due to the simple
   structure, high sensitivity and good environment-friendly properties,
   the NG as an active sensor should play an important role in wireless
   environmental monitoring networks.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Quasi-spherical VO2 nanoparticles with uniform size and high
   crystallinity are ideal functional materials for applications in
   field-effect transistors, smart window coatings and switches. However,
   the synthesis of these VO2 nanoparticles has long been a challenge. This
   article presents a novel doping strategy for the simultaneous control of
   the size, morphology and polymorphology of VO2 nanoparticles. Doping can
   induce the change in crystal structure and exhibits a significant
   promoting effect on the formation of doped monoclinic VO2 (VO2 (M)).
   Specifically, by antimony (Sb3+) doping, hexagonal-shaped, well
   crystalline monoclinic VO2 nanoparticles with tunable sizes (8-30 nm)
   and controllable polymorphs were synthesized via a one-pot, hydrothermal
   method. Sb3+ dopants, which are larger in radius and lower in valence
   than V4+ ions, can introduce extra oxygen vacancies during the
   nucleation and growth of VO2 nanoparticles. These positively charged
   nuclei may suppress the adsorption of VO2+ aqua ions, and therefore
   inhibit the growth of the VO2 (M) nanoparticles. Comparably, Sb5+
   dopants that possess higher valence counts than V4+ ions can induce the
   growth of VO2 (M) particles to 200-300 nm width and above 500 nm length.
   The Sb3+-doped VO2 (M) nanoparticles exhibit excellent properties in
   metal-semiconductor transformation at transition temperatures ranging
   from 55-68 degrees C. Films obtained by casting these nanoparticles show
   excellent optical properties (both visible transmittance and infrared
   regulation), compared with those prepared from gas phases, such as
   sputtering. This synthetic strategy that involves the doping of an
   element with a different valence count than the matrix cation may be
   useful for controlling the solution growth of some technologically
   significant nanomaterials. In addition, the formation mechanism of solid
   and crystalline transformation was also studied by designing a specific
   reaction autoclave.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of a 3-year alendronate treatment on trabecular
   stresses/strains associated with microdamage initiation were
   investigated using finite element modeling (FEM). Severely damaged
   trabeculae in the low-dose treatment group were associated with
   increased stresses compared with the high-dose treatment group (p =
   0.006) and approached significance in the control group (p = 0.02).
   Alendronate, a commonly prescribed anti-remodeling agent, decreases
   fracture risk in the vertebrae, hip, and wrist of osteoporotic
   individuals. However, evaluation of microdamage accumulation in animal
   and human studies shows increased microdamage density relative to
   controls. Microstructural von Mises stresses associated with severe and
   linear damage have been found to decrease after 1 year of alendronate
   treatment. In the present study, stresses/strains associated with damage
   were assessed after 3 years of treatment to determine whether they
   continued to decrease with increased treatment duration.
   Microdamaged trabeculae visualized with fluorescent microscopy were
   associated with stresses and strains obtained using image-based FEM.
   Stresses/strains associated with severe, diffuse, and linearly damaged
   and undamaged trabeculae were compared among groups treated for 3 years
   with an osteoporotic treatment dose of alendronate, a Paget's disease
   treatment dose of alendronate, or saline control. Architectural
   characteristics and mineralization were also analyzed from
   three-dimensional microcomputed tomography reconstructed images.
   Severely damaged trabeculae in the osteoporotic treatment dose group
   were associated with increased stress compared with the Paget's disease
   treatment dose group (p = 0.006) and approached significance compared to
   the control group (p = 0.02). Trabecular mineralization in severely
   damaged trabeculae of the low-dose treatment group was significantly
   greater compared to severely damaged trabeculae in the high-dose
   treatment and control group, suggesting that changes at the tissue level
   may play a role in these findings.
   Trabecular level stresses associated with microdamage do not continue to
   decrease with prolonged alendronate treatment. Changes in mineralization
   may account for these findings.}},

Title = {{Characterization of ambient air pollution measurement error in a

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{101-108}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, geostatistical modeling has been used to inform air
   pollution health studies. In this study, distributions of daily ambient
   concentrations were modeled over space and time for 12 air pollutants.
   Simulated pollutant fields were produced for a 6-year time period over
   the 20-county metropolitan Atlanta area using the Stanford
   Geostatistical Modeling Software (SGeMS). These simulations incorporate
   the temporal and spatial autocorrelation structure of ambient
   pollutants, as well as season and day-of-week temporal and spatial
   trends; these fields were considered to be the true ambient pollutant
   fields for the purposes of the simulations that followed. Simulated
   monitor data at the locations of actual monitors were then generated
   that contain error representative of instrument imprecision. From the
   simulated monitor data, four exposure metrics were calculated: central
   monitor and unweighted, population-weighted, and area-weighted averages.
   For each metric, the amount and type of error relative to the simulated
   pollutant fields are characterized and the impact of error on an
   epidemiologic time-series analysis is predicted. The amount of error, as
   indicated by a lack of spatial autocorrelation, is greater for primary
   pollutants than for secondary pollutants and is only moderately reduced
   by averaging across monitors; more error will result in less statistical
   power in the epidemiologic analysis. The type of error, as indicated by
   the correlations of error with the monitor data and with the true
   ambient concentration, varies with exposure metric, with error in the
   central monitor metric more of the classical type (i.e., independent of
   the monitor data) and error in the spatial average metrics more of the
   Berkson type (i.e., independent of the true ambient concentration).
   Error type will affect the bias in the health risk estimate, with bias
   toward the null and away from the null predicted depending on the
   exposure metric; population-weighting yielded the least bias. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We present a wide bandwidth, compressed sensing based nonuniform
   sampling (NUS) system with a custom sample-and-hold chip designed to
   take advantage of a low average sampling rate. By sampling signals
   nonuniformly, the average sample rate can be more than a magnitude lower
   than the Nyquist rate, provided that these signals have a relatively low
   information content as measured by the sparsity of their spectrum. The
   hardware design combines a wideband Indium-Phosphide heterojunction
   bipolar transistor sample-and-hold with a commercial off-the-shelf
   analog-to-digital converter to digitize an 800 MHz to 2 GHz band (having
   100 MHz of noncontiguous spectral content) at an average sample rate of
   236 Ms/s. Signal reconstruction is performed via a nonlinear compressed
   sensing algorithm, and the challenges of developing an efficient
   implementation are discussed. The NUS system is a general purpose
   digital receiver. As an example of its real signal capabilities,
   measured bit-error-rate data for a GSM channel is presented, and
   comparisons to a conventional wideband 4.4 Gs/s ADC are made.}},

   pulse parameters in an instantaneous bandwidth spanning 100 MHz-2.5 GHz
   with the equivalent of 8 effective number of bits (ENOB) digitizing

   parameter recovery algorithm which extracts information about the signal
   without performing full time-domain signal reconstruction. This approach
   significantly reduces the computational overhead involved in retrieving
   desired information which demonstrates an avenue toward employing CS
   techniques in power-constrained real-time applications. The developed
   techniques are validated on CS samples physically measured by the
   fabricated RMPI and measurement results are presented. The parameter

Abstract = {{Capacitive touch screens are ubiquitous in today's electronic devices.
   Improved touch screen responsiveness and resolution can be achieved at
   the expense of the touch screen controller analog hardware complexity
   and power consumption. This paper proposes an alternative compressive
   sensing based approach to exploit the sparsity of simultaneous touches
   with respect to the number of sensor nodes to achieve similar levels of
   responsiveness. It is possible to reduce the analog data acquisition
   complexity at the cost of extra digital computations with less total
   power consumption. Using compressive sensing, in order to resolve the
   positions of the sparse touches, the number of measurements required is
   related to the number of touches rather than the number of nodes.
   Detailed measurement circuits and methodologies are presented along with
   the corresponding reconstruction algorithm.}},

Title = {{Probing and Mapping Electrode Surfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{67}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are potentially the most efficient and
   cost-effective solution to utilization of a wide variety of fuels beyond
   hydrogen (1-7). The performance of SOFCs and the rates of many chemical
   and energy transformation processes in energy storage and conversion
   devices in general are limited primarily by charge and mass transfer
   along electrode surfaces and across interfaces. Unfortunately, the
   mechanistic understanding of these processes is still lacking, due
   largely to the difficulty of characterizing these processes under in
   situ conditions. This knowledge gap is a chief obstacle to SOFC
   commercialization. The development of tools for probing and mapping
   surface chemistries relevant to electrode reactions is vital to
   unraveling the mechanisms of surface processes and to achieving rational
   design of new electrode materials for more efficient energy storage and
   conversion(2). Among the relatively few in situ surface analysis
   methods, Raman spectroscopy can be performed even with high temperatures
   and harsh atmospheres, making it ideal for characterizing chemical
   processes relevant to SOFC anode performance and degradation(8-12). It
   can also be used alongside electrochemical measurements, potentially
   allowing direct correlation of electrochemistry to surface chemistry in
   an operating cell. Proper in situ Raman mapping measurements would be
   useful for pin-pointing important anode reaction mechanisms because of
   its sensitivity to the relevant species, including anode performance
   degradation through carbon deposition(8, 10, 13, 14) ({''}coking{''})
   and sulfur poisoning(11, 15) and the manner in which surface
   modifications stave off this degradation(16). The current work
   demonstrates significant progress towards this capability. In addition,
   the family of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques provides a
   special approach to interrogate the electrode surface with nanoscale
   resolution. Besides the surface topography that is routinely collected
   by AFM and STM, other properties such as local electronic states, ion
   diffusion coefficient and surface potential can also be
   investigated(17-22). In this work, electrochemical measurements, Raman
   spectroscopy, and SPM were used in conjunction with a novel test
   electrode platform that consists of a Ni mesh electrode embedded in an
   yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte. Cell performance testing
   and impedance spectroscopy under fuel containing H2S was characterized,
   and Raman mapping was used to further elucidate the nature of sulfur
   poisoning. In situ Raman monitoring was used to investigate coking
   behavior. Finally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrostatic force
   microscopy (EFM) were used to further visualize carbon deposition on the
   nanoscale. From this research, we desire to produce a more complete
   picture of the SOFC anode.}},

Abstract = {{The instability of precast prestressed concrete bridge girders during
   construction have been of particular concern to bridge engineers. After
   they are installed on bearing supports, prestressed concrete girders are
   immediately subjected to environmental thermal loads that may be
   exacerbated by fabrication and construction errors. Thus, in this
   research, the environmental thermal loads, which cause extremes in
   thermal deformations in precast prestressed concrete girders, were
   determined. Then a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element sequential
   analysis procedure was developed to evaluate the behavior of a precast
   prestressed concrete girder subjected to both thermal loads and geometry
   and support imperfections during each construction stage. This analysis
   indicated instability in a 30-m long prestressed concrete BT-1600 girder
   when total lateral deformation in the middle height of the girder at
   mid-span exceeded about 25 cm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We present two frameworks for designing random search methods for
   discrete simulation optimization. One of our frameworks is very broad
   (in that it includes many random search methods), whereas the other one
   considers a special class of random search methods called point-based
   methods, that move iteratively between points within the feasible
   region. Our frameworks involve averaging, in that all decisions that
   require estimates of the objective function values at various feasible
   solutions are based on the averages of all observations collected at
   these solutions so far. Also, the methods are adaptive in that they can
   use information gathered in previous iterations to decide how simulation
   effort is expended in the current iteration. We show that the methods
   within our frameworks are almost surely globally convergent under mild
   conditions. Thus, the generality of our frameworks and associated
   convergence guarantees makes the frameworks useful to algorithm
   developers wishing to design efficient and rigorous procedures for
   simulation optimization. We also present two variants of the simulated
   annealing (SA) algorithm and provide their convergence analysis as
   example application of our point-based framework. Finally, we provide
   numerical results that demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of
   averaging and adaptivity in the context of SA. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The high mechanical mismatch between stiffness of silicon and metal
   microelectrodes and soft cortical tissue, induces strain at the neural
   interface which likely contributes to failure of the neural interface.
   However, little is known about the molecular outcomes of electrode
   induced low-magnitude strain (1 -5\%) on primary astrocytes, microglia
   and neurons. In this study we simulated brain micromotion at the
   electrode brain interface by subjecting astrocytes, microglia and
   primary cortical neurons to low-magnitude cyclical strain using a
   biaxial stretch device, and investigated the molecular outcomes of
   induced strain in vitro. In addition, we explored the functional
   consequence of astrocytic and microglial strain on neural health, when
   they are themselves subjected to strain. Quantitative real-time PCR
   array (qRT-PCR Array) analysis of stretched astrocytes and microglia
   showed strain specific upregulation of an Interleukin receptor
   antagonist - IL-36Ra (previously IL-1F5), to similar to 1018 and similar
   to 236 fold respectively. Further, IL-36Ra gene expression remained
   unchanged in astrocytes and microglia treated with bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) indicating that the observed upregulation in
   stretched astrocytes and microglia is potentially strain specific.
   Zymogram and western blot analysis revealed that mechanically strained
   astrocytes and microglia upregulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2
   and 9, and other markers of reactive gliosis such as glial fibrillary
   acidic protein (GFAP) and neurocan when compared to controls. Primary
   cortical neurons when stretched with and without IL-36Ra, showed a
   similar to 400 fold downregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor
   superfamily, member lib (TNFRSF11b). Significant upregulation of members
   of the caspase cysteine proteinase family and other pro-apoptotic genes
   was also observed in the presence of IL-36Ra than in the absence of
   IL-36Ra. Adult rats when implanted with microwire electrodes showed
   upregulation of IL-36Ra (similar to 20 fold) and IL-1Ra (similar to 1500
   fold) 3 days post-implantation (3 DPI), corroborating in vitro results,
   although these transcripts were drastically down regulated by similar to
   20 fold and similar to 1488 fold relative to expression levels 3 DPI, at
   the end of 12 weeks post-implantation (12 WPI). These results
   demonstrate that IL receptor antagonists may be negatively contributing
   to neuronal health at acute time-points post-electrode implantation. (C)

Abstract = {{Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) have been identified as one of
   the key areas in the field of wireless communication, wherein sparseness
   and delay are particularly high. They are emerging as a promising
   technology in vehicular, planetary/interplanetary, military/tactical,
   disaster response, underwater and satellite networks. DTNs are
   characterized by large end-to-end communication latency and the lack of
   end-to-end path from a source to its destination. These characteristics
   pose several challenges to the security of DTNs. Especially, Byzantine
   attacks in which one or more legitimate nodes have been compromised and
   fully controlled by the adversary can give serious damages to the
   network in terms of latency and data availability. Using
   reputation-based trust management systems is shown to be an effective
   way to handle the adversarial behavior in Mobile Ad hoc Networks
   (MANETs). However, because of the unique characteristics of DTNs, those
   traditional techniques do not apply to DTNs. Our main objective in this
   paper is to develop a robust trust mechanism and an efficient and low
   cost malicious node detection technique for DTNs. Inspired by our recent
   results on reputation management for online systems and e-commerce, we
   develop an iterative malicious node detection mechanism for DTNs
   referred as ITRM. The proposed scheme is a graph-based iterative
   algorithm motivated by the prior success of message passing techniques
   for decoding low-density parity-check codes over bipartite graphs.
   Applying ITRM to DTNs for various mobility models, we observed that the
   proposed iterative reputation management scheme is far more effective
   than well-known reputation management techniques such as the Bayesian
   framework and EigenTrust. Further, we concluded that the proposed scheme
   provides high data availability and packet-delivery ratio with low
   latency in DTNs under various adversary attacks which attempt to both
   undermine the trust and detection scheme and the packet delivery
   protocol.}},

Abstract = {{This work develops a simple, practical yet easily realizable method for
   low cost measurement of phase and amplitude distortions in radio
   frequency power amplifiers (RF PA). Amplitude-to-amplitude (AM-AM) and
   amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) distortions are two significant distortion
   effects in PAs at high output power levels, causing out of band
   interference in the transmitted signal and bit errors in the received
   signal. Traditional measurements of amplitude and phase distortion in RF
   PAs require the use of expensive vector network analyzers. In this work,
   we propose the use of phase-to-amplitude conversion to develop a low
   cost and accurate test methodology for AM-AM and AM-PM measurement using
   simple load board test circuitry along with software based difference
   generation and peak detection mechanisms. Using either simple sine wave
   stimulus with power sweep or a single amplitude modulated RF stimulus,
   both distortion effects can be measured with high accuracy for nominal
   devices as well as over process and voltage variations, while allowing
   significant reduction in test cost.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{169-174}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The nudged elastic band method has been used to calculate the activation
   energies for the nucleation of the leading partial dislocation from
   grain boundaries in pure f.c.c. copper under tensile loading at 0 K. Two
   planar grain boundaries, Sigma 5\{210\} and Sigma 7\{530\}, and a Sigma
   5\{210\} grain boundary containing a ledge (stepped grain boundary) as a
   grain boundary defect have been studied. The activation energy for the
   nucleation of the partial dislocation is found to be significantly lower
   from the grain boundary containing the defect and that there is no real
   correlation between the activation energy and the change in interfacial
   energy of the interface during the nucleation process. This
   investigation shows that classic molecular dynamics simulations cannot
   be used to determine activation energies and additionally, and more
   importantly, that dislocation nucleation is much more likely to occur at
   defect sites. However, it is found that the activation energy from
   planar grain boundaries increases sharply as the external load is
   decreased away from the critical stress, and that the critical stress
   for partial dislocation nucleation can be found simply with molecular
   dynamics simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, exact three-dimensional analysis for torsion of

   remarkable effects of electrode and size effects on interface stresses

   properties are formulated while axis of torsion and the polarization
   axes of each layer make different orientations with respect to each
   other. An exact formulation for n-layer piezoelectric device with
   rectangular cross section is presented to compensate considerable
   deviation of previous studies' results from exact solution due to the
   assumption of linear distribution for the electric potential. In order
   to improve the performance of the transducers, being utilized in
   industry, several case studies are presented in order to investigate the
   influence of different parameters, e.g. thickness and material
   properties of electrodes over shear and peel stresses. Besides, a

   dimensions of weld such as penetration depth, reinforcement height and
   bead width are measured. Regression analysis that includes stepwise
   regression and corrected Akaike's information criterion (AICc) is
   performed to build prediction models that use the reflection
   coefficients as predictors. The model predictions are validated using

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We designed and implemented a control algorithm for sensor-mediated
   chemical plume tracking in a turbulent flow environment. In our design,
   we focused on development of a signal processing strategy capable of
   replicating behavioral responses of actively tracking blue crabs
   (Callinectes sapidus) to chemical stimuli. The control algorithm is
   evaluated in a hardware platform that allows motion in two directions
   (i.e. forward-back and left-right). The geometric arrangement of the
   sensor array is inspired by the location of blue crab sensor
   populations. Upstream motion is induced by a binary response to
   supra-threshold spikes of concentration, and cross-stream steering is
   controlled by contrast between bilaterally-separated sensors. Like
   animal strategies, the developed control algorithm is dynamic. This
   property allows the algorithm to function effectively in the highly
   irregular turbulent environment and produces adaptive adjustments of
   motion to minimize the distance to the source of a plume. Tracking
   trials indicate that roughly 80\% of the tracks successfully stop near
   the plume source location. Both success rate and movement patterns of
   the tracker compare favorably to that of blue crabs searching for
   odorant plume sources, thus suggesting that our sensory-mediated
   behavior hypothesis are generally accurate and that the associated
   tracking mechanisms may be successfully implemented in hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The Mexican jumping bean, Laspeyresia saltitans, consists of a hollow
   seed housing a moth larva. Heating by the sun induces movements by the
   larva which appear as rolls, jumps and flips by the bean. In this
   combined experimental, numerical and robotic study, we investigate this
   unique means of rolling locomotion. Time-lapse videography is used to
   record bean trajectories across a series of terrain types, including
   one-dimensional channels and planar surfaces of varying inclination. We
   find that the shell encumbers the larva's locomotion, decreasing its
   speed on flat surfaces by threefold. We also observe that the
   two-dimensional search algorithm of the bean resembles the
   run-and-tumble search of bacteria. We test this search algorithm using
   both an agent-based simulation and a wheeled Scribbler robot. The
   algorithm succeeds in propelling the robot away from regions of high
   temperature and may have application in biomimetic micro-scale
   navigation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who require mechanical
   ventilation due to acute respiratory failure also frequently require the
   administration of sedative agents. The need for sedation arises both
   from patient anxiety due to the loss of personal control and the
   unfamiliar and intrusive environment of the ICU, and also due to pain or
   other variants of noxious stimuli. While physicians select the agent(s)
   used for sedation and cardiovascular function, the actual administration
   of these agents is the responsibility of the nursing staff. If clinical
   decision support systems and closed-loop control systems could be
   developed for critical care monitoring and lifesaving interventions as
   well as the administration of sedation and cardiopulmonary management,
   the ICU nurse could be released from the intense monitoring of sedation,
   allowing her/him to focus on other critical tasks. One particularly
   attractive strategy is to utilize the knowledge and experience of
   skilled clinicians, capturing explicitly the rules expert clinicians use
   to decide on how to titrate drug doses depending on the level of
   sedation. In this paper, we extend the deterministic rule-based expert
   system for cardiopulmonary management and ICU sedation framework
   presented in {[}1] to a stochastic setting by using probability theory
   to quantify uncertainty and hence deal with more realistic clinical
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a frequency-domain formulation of the bridging
   multiscale method specifically developed to study the interaction of
   elastic waves with heterogeneities and defects. The adopted approach
   utilizes a coarse-scale discretization that captures the global wave
   behavior, while a localized fine-scale mesh resolves the portion of the
   domain around the discontinuity. The occurrence of spuricius waves at
   the interface is avoided by imposing proper dynamic compatibility
   conditions between the two domains. The formulation of such conditions
   is based on the two scale bridging. The frequency domain implementation
   of the bridging presented herein simplifies the dynamic compatibility
   operators between the discretizations which constitutes the major source
   of computational costs when implemented as part of commonly used time
   marching schemes. The potentials of the proposed technique are presented
   in the analysis of propagating elastic waves in several kinds of one-

Abstract = {{In this paper we provide rigorous proof for the convergence of an
   iterative voting-based image segmentation algorithm called Active Masks.
   Active Masks (AM) was proposed to solve the challenging task of
   delineating punctate patterns of cells from fluorescence microscope
   images. Each iteration of AM consists of a linear convolution composed
   with a nonlinear thresholding; what makes this process special in our
   case is the presence of additive terms whose role is to ``skew{''} the
   voting when prior information is available. In real-world
   implementation, the AM algorithm always converges to a fixed point. We
   study the behavior of AM rigorously and present a proof of this
   convergence. The key idea is to formulate AM as a generalized (parallel)
   majority cellular automaton, adapting proof techniques from discrete
   dynamical systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{191-198}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An investigation of heat recovery from industrial processes with large
   exhaust gas flow rates, but at very low temperatures, was conducted.
   Heat recovered from a gas stream at 120 degrees C was supplied to an
   absorption cycle to simultaneously generate chilled water and hot water
   to be used for space conditioning and/or process heating. With the steep
   increase in energy costs faced by industry, it may be possible to use
   previously unviable techniques. At nominal conditions, 2.26 MW of heat
   recovered from the waste heat stream yields a chilled hydronic fluid
   stream at 7 degrees C with a cooling capacity of 1.28 MW.
   Simultaneously, a second hydronic fluid stream can be heated from 43
   degrees C to 54 degrees C for a heating capacity of 3.57 MW. Based on
   the cost of electricity to generate this cooling without the waste heat
   recovery system, and the cost of natural gas for heating, savings of
   \$186/hr of operation may be realized. When extrapolated to annual
   operation with a 75\% capacity factor, savings of up to \$1.2 million
   can be achieved. The system requires large components to enable heat
   exchange over very small temperature differences, with the largest
   component being the waste heat driven desorber. Minor increases in heat
   source temperature result in substantial reductions in heat exchanger
   size. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Thermomechanical fatigue and bithermal-thermomechanical fatigue of a
   nickel-base single crystal superalloy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{165-171}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is a critical damage process incurred by
   turbine components. The most common methods for simulating the operating
   conditions of turbine components are either in-phase (IP) or
   out-of-phase (OP) TMF tests. However, due to the constantly changing
   temperature and applied load profile, it is challenging to decouple
   dominant damage mechanisms occurring in the material when relying solely
   on TMF test conditions. Further, the time to perform low(er) inelastic
   strain range TMF tests to failure can be cumbersome. This work proposes
   implementation of bithermal fatigue (BiF) tests to address these issues.
   Out-of-phase BiF tests are strain-controlled fatigue tests whereby a
   single cycle consists of an isothermal compressive half-cycle at the
   maximum temperature, followed by stress-free temperature change to the
   minimum temperature; the tensile half-cycle then occurs isothermally at
   the minimum temperature, followed by stress-free temperature change to
   the maximum temperature. Both conventional OP TMF and OP BiF tests were
   performed on nominally < 001 > oriented single crystal superalloy
   specimens. When plotting test results as inelastic strain range versus
   cycles to crack initiation, the OP BiF results exhibit a clear
   demarcation from the TMF data at a particular value of inelastic strain
   range; above which the results are primarily fatigue dominated and
   follow the trend of the OP TMF tests while below the results are
   environmentally dominated, creating a separate trend.
   Thermally-activated base material degradation supports the theory of
   damage driver segregation. A relationship is proposed relating the
   inelastic strain of BiF to that of TMF, for identical lives, within the
   environmentally dominated fatigue region. Finally, a life prediction
   model is proposed that includes fatigue and environmentally assisted
   damage mechanisms, which enables the life estimation of either test
   type. These relationships enable the use of BiF tests in place of, or in
   conjunction with, TMF tests, thereby providing insight into the dominant
   damage mechanisms present during testing and simplifying life prediction
   for more complex TMF cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-loop induction motor drives have wide applications in electric
   traction system and industrial processes. Accurate thermal monitoring
   not only protects the induction machines from overheating, but also
   boosts the usage and performance of the overall drive system.
   State-of-the-art thermal monitoring schemes for induction machines
   utilize thermal models, which are inaccurate for drive-fed machines and
   are not adaptive to varying cooling conditions. This paper proposes a
   nonintrusive thermal monitoring scheme for induction motors fed by
   closed-loop inverter drives. By applying offsets to the current
   controllers in the motor drive, dc currents are injected into the stator
   windings of the machine. The accurate estimation of the injected dc
   voltage is achieved by carefully analyzing and compensating for inverter
   nonidealities. The stator winding temperature can thus be monitored
   based on the estimated dc stator resistance. The method is nonintrusive
   because it eliminates the thermocouples, requires no hardware change to
   the existing motor drive, and has minimal impacts on the normal
   operation of the motor. The proposed method is practically implemented
   in a programmable inverter drive and is validated both by simulation and
   real-time experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Current hidden Markov acoustic modeling for large-vocabulary continuous
   speech recognition (LVCSR) heavily relies on the availability of
   abundant labeled transcriptions. Given that speech labeling is both
   expensive and time-consuming while there is a huge amount of unlabeled
   data easily available nowadays, the semi-supervised learning (SSL) from
   both labeled and unlabeled data aiming to reduce the development cost
   for LVCSR becomes more important than ever. In this paper, a new SSL
   approach is proposed which exploits the cross-view transfer learning for
   LVCSR through a committee machine consisting of multiple views learned
   from different acoustic features and randomized decision trees. In
   addition, a multi-objective learning scheme is developed in each view by
   maximizing a hybrid information-theoretic criterion which is established
   by the relative entropy between labeled data and their labels and the
   entropy of unlabeled data. The multi-objective scheme is then
   generalized to a unified SSL framework which can be interpreted into a
   variety of learning strategies under different weighting schemes.
   Experiments conducted on English Broadcast News using 50 hours of
   transcribed speech with 50 hours and 150 hours of untranscribed speech
   show the benefits of proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new and robust audio watermarking scheme based on
   lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD)
   is proposed. Specifically, the watermark data is efficiently inserted in
   the coefficients of the LWT low frequency subband taking advantage of
   both SVD and quantization index modulation (QIM). The use of QIM renders
   our scheme blind in nature. Furthermore, the synchronization code
   technique is also integrated into our hybrid LWT-SVD audio watermarking
   method. Experimental and analysis results demonstrate that the proposed
   LWT-SVD method is not only robust against both general signal processing
   attacks and desynchronization attacks but also achieve a very good
   tradeoff between robustness, imperceptibility and payload. Comparisons
   with the typical and related audio watermarking algorithms also show
   that our proposed method outperforms most of the selected algorithms.

Abstract = {{alpha-Amino ester hydrolases (AEH, E.C. 3.1.1.43) catalyze the synthesis
   and hydrolysis of alpha-amino beta-lactam antibiotics. The AEH enzymes
   have been shown to feature excellent synthetic capability but suffer
   from poor thermostability. AEH from Xanthomonas campestris exhibits an
   optimal activity temperature of 25 degrees C, an observed half-life of 5
   min at 30 degrees C, and a ``T-50{''} value, the temperature at which
   the half-life is 30 min, of 27 degrees C. To improve the thermostability
   of AEH, a modified structure-guided consensus model of seven homologous
   enzymes was generated along with analysis of the B-values from the
   available crystal structures of AEH from Xanthomonas citri. A family of
   stabilized variants was created including a consensus-driven triple
   variant, A275P/N186D/V622I. Independent NNK saturation of two high
   B-factor sites, K34 and E143, on the triple variant resulted in our best

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparison of the performance of different cutting
   tool coatings for Laser Assisted Micro-Milling (LAMM). A thermal model
   is used to predict the temperature rise in the material removal surface
   which helps in analyzing the severity of the thermal conditions

   carried out to evaluate the wear behavior of different commercially
   available (TiCN, TiAlN) and customized coated tools (TiSiN, Al2O3,
   Al2O3+ZrN). These coatings were selected since they have the capability
   to withstand the temperatures experienced in LAMM. The results of
   micro-milling experiments indicate that commercially available coatings
   like TiCN perform poorly due to their inferior adhesion characteristics
   with the base material. Delamination is found to be the principal wear
   mechanism of TiCN, TiSiN, and Alumina (Al2O3) coated tools for the
   conditions investigated in this study. In addition, the results indicate
   that the wear performance of TiAlN and Al2O3+ZrN coated tools is

Title = {{Adipose stem cells can secrete angiogenic factors that inhibit hyaline
   cartilage regeneration}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Adipose stem cells (ASCs) secrete many trophic factors
   that can stimulate tissue repair, including angiogenic factors, but
   little is known about how ASCs and their secreted factors influence
   cartilage regeneration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
   determine the effects ASC-secreted factors have in repairing chondral
   defects.
   Methods: ASCs isolated from male Sprague Dawley rats were cultured in
   monolayer or alginate microbeads supplemented with growth (GM) or
   chondrogenic medium (CM). Subsequent co-culture, conditioned media, and
   in vivo cartilage defect studies were performed.
   Results: ASC monolayers and microbeads cultured in CM had decreased
   FGF-2 gene expression and VEGF-A secretion compared to ASCs cultured in
   GM. Chondrocytes co-cultured with GM-cultured ASCs for 7 days had
   decreased mRNAs for col2, comp, and runx2. Chondrocytes treated for 12
   or 24 hours with conditioned medium from GM-cultured ASCs had reduced
   sox9, acan, and col2 mRNAs; reduced proliferation and proteoglycan
   synthesis; and increased apoptosis. ASC-conditioned medium also
   increased endothelial cell tube lengthening whereas conditioned medium
   from CM-cultured ASCs had no effect. Treating ASCs with CM reduced or
   abolished these deleterious effects while adding a neutralizing antibody
   for VEGF-A eliminated ASC-conditioned medium induced chondrocyte
   apoptosis and restored proteoglycan synthesis. FGF-2 also mitigated the
   deleterious effects VEGF-A had on chondrocyte apoptosis and phenotype.
   When GM-grown ASC pellets were implanted in 1 mm non-critical hyaline
   cartilage defects in vivo, cartilage regeneration was inhibited as
   evaluated by radiographic and equilibrium partitioning of an ionic
   contrast agent via microCT imaging. Histology revealed that defects with
   GM-cultured ASCs had no tissue ingrowth from the edges of the defect
   whereas empty defects and defects with CM-grown ASCs had similar amounts
   of neocartilage formation.
   Conclusions: ASCs must be treated to reduce the secretion of VEGF-A and
   other factors that inhibit cartilage regeneration, which can
   significantly influence how ASCs are used for repairing hyaline
   cartilage.}},

Abstract = {{Binding of selectins to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)
   mediates tethering and rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium during
   inflammation. Previous measurements obtained with a flow-chamber assay
   have shown that mutations of three tyrosines at the PSGL-1 N-terminus
   (Y46, Y48, and Y51) increase the reverse rates and their sensitivity to
   the force of bonds with P- and L-selectin. However, the effects of these
   mutations on the binding affinities and forward rates have not been
   studied. We quantified these effects by using an adhesion frequency
   assay to measure two-dimensional affinity and kinetic rates at zero
   force. Wild-type PSGL-1 has 2.2- to 8.5-fold higher binding affinities
   for P- and L-selectin than PSGL-1 mutants with two of three tyrosines
   substituted by phenylalanines, and 9.6- to 49-fold higher affinities
   than the PSGL-1 mutant with all three tyrosines replaced. In descending
   order, the affinity decreased from wild-type to Y48/51F, Y46/51F,
   Y46/48F, and Y46/48/51F. The affinity difference's were attributed to
   major changes in the forward rate and minor changes in the reverse rate,
   suggesting that these tyrosines regulate the accessibility of PSGL-1 to
   P- and L-selectin via electrostatic interactions, which is supported by
   molecular-dynamics simulations. Our results provide insights into the
   structure-function relationship of receptor-ligand binding at a
   single-residue level.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells incorporating
   conjugated polymers (CPs) and nanocrystals (NCs) offer the potential to
   deliver efficient energy conversion with low-cost fabrication. The
   CP-based photovoltaic devices are complimented by an extensive set of
   advantageous characteristics from CPs and NCs, such as lightweight,
   flexibility, and solution-processability of CPs, combined with high
   electron mobility and size-dependent optical properties of NCs. Recent
   research has witnessed rapid advances in an emerging field of directly
   tethering CPs on the NC surface to yield an intimately contacted CP-NC
   nanocomposite possessing a well-defined interface that markedly promotes
   the dispersion of NCs within the CP matrix, facilitates the photoinduced
   charge transfer between these two semiconductor components, and provides
   an effective platform for studying the interfacial charge separation and
   transport. In this Review, we aim to highlight the recent developments
   in CP-NC nanocomposite materials, critically examine the viable
   preparative strategies geared to craft intimate CP-NC nanocomposites and
   their photovoltaic performance in hybrid solar cells, and finally
   provide an outlook for future directions of this extraordinarily rich
   field.}},

Abstract = {{The wetting behavior of solid surfaces can be altered dramatically by
   introducing surface roughness on the nanometer scale. Some of nature's
   most fascinating wetting phenomena are associated with surface
   roughness; they have inspired both fundamental research and the adoption
   of surface roughness as a design parameter for man-made functional
   coatings. So far the attention has focused primarily on macroscopic
   surfaces, but one should expect the wetting properties of colloidal
   particles to be strongly affected by roughness, too. Particle
   wettability, in turn, is a key parameter for the adsorption of particles
   at liquid interfaces and for the industrially important use of particles
   as emulsion stabilizers; yet, the consequence of particle roughness for
   emulsion stability remains poorly understood. In order to investigate
   the matter systematically, we have developed a surface treatment,
   applicable to micrometer-sized particles and macroscopic surfaces alike,
   that produces surface coatings with finely tunable nanoscale roughness
   and identical surface chemistry. Coatings with different degrees of
   roughness were characterized with regard to their morphology, charging,
   and wetting properties, and the results were correlated with the
   stability of emulsions prepared with coated particles of different
   roughness. We find that the maximum capillary pressure, a metric of the
   emulsions' resistance to droplet coalescence, varies significantly and
   in a nonmonotonic fashion with particle roughness. Surface topography
   and contact angle hysteresis suggest that particle roughness benefits
   the stability of our emulsions as long as wetting occurs homogeneously
   (Wenzel regime), whereas the transition toward heterogeneous wetting
   (Cassie-Baxter regime) is associated with a loss of stability.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the pH-responsive behavior of layer-by-layer (LbL)
   microcapsules fabricated from silk fibroin chemically modified with
   different poly amino acid side chains: cationic (silk-poly L-lysine,

   stable ultrathin shell microcapsules can be assembled with a dramatic
   increase in swelling, thickness, and microroughness at extremely acidic
   (pH < 2.5) and basic (pH > 11.0) conditions without noticeable
   disintegration. These changes are accompanied by dramatic changes in
   shell permeability with a 2 orders of magnitude increase in the
   diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the silk ionomer shells undergo
   remarkable softening with a drop in Young's modulus by more than 1 order
   of magnitude due to the swelling, stretching, and increase in material
   porosity. The ability to control permeability and mechanical properties
   over a wide range for the silk-based microcapsules, with distinguishing
   stability under harsh environmental conditions, provides an important
   system for controlled loading and release and applications in

Abstract = {{The biotransformation of n-tetradecylbenzyldimethy-lammonium chloride
   (C(14)BDMA-Cl), a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), under aerobic
   conditions by an enriched microbial community growing on benzalkonium
   chlorides (BACs) was investigated. Biotransformation of C(14)BDMA-Cl
   commenced with cleavage of the C-alkyl-N bond and formation of
   benzyldimethylamine (BDMA). BDMA was further degraded, but in contrast
   to a previously reported BAC biotransformation pathway, neither
   benzylmethylamine (BMA) nor benzylamine (BA) was detected as a BDMA
   biotransformation product. Kinetic assays further confirmed that BMA and
   BA were not intermediates of C(14)BDMA-Cl transformation by the enriched
   community. Thus, BDMA is thought to be transformed to dimethylamine and
   benzoic acid via debenzylation. The biomass-normalized rate of
   C(14)BDMA-Cl biotransformation was 0.09 mu mol/{[}mg of volatile
   suspended solids (VSS).h]. The Microtox acute toxicity EC50 value of
   BDMA was 500 times higher than that of C(14)BDMA-Cl. Thus, the aerobic
   biotransformation of C(14)BDMA-Cl to BDMA results in substantial
   toxicity reduction. Phylogenetic analysis of Bacteria diversity
   indicated that the majority of the sequenced clones (98\% of the clone
   library) belonged to the genus Pseudomonas.}},

Abstract = {{Highly p-type GaN films with hole concentrations exceeding 6 x 10(19)
   cm(-3) grown by metal-modulated epitaxy are electrically characterized.
   Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements at cryogenic temperatures
   reveal minimal carrier freeze-out in highly doped samples, while less
   heavily doped samples exhibited high resistivity and donor-compensated
   conductivity as is traditionally observed. Effective activation energies
   as low as 43 meV were extracted, and a maximum Mg activation efficiency
   of 52\% was found. In addition, the effective activation energy was
   found to be negatively correlated to the hole concentration. These
   results indicate the onset of the Mott-Insulator transition leading to
   impurity band conduction. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{With assistance from a nano-manipulator system inside a scanning
   electron microscope chamber, mechanical and electrical properties of ZnO
   nanorings were investigated. The change of a fractured nanoring to
   nearly straight nanobelts was strong evidence to support the previously
   proposed electrostatic-force-induced self-coiling model, and our
   computational simulation results indicated the fracture force was 25-30
   mu N. The contact between a tungsten tip of the manipulator and a ZnO
   nanoring was confirmed as the Schottky type; therefore, the change of
   I-V curves of the nanoring under compression was attributed to the
   Schottky barrier height changes. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We report a detailed investigation of the defect structures in
   aluminosilicate single-walled nanotubes via multiple advanced
   solid-state NMR techniques. A combination of H-1-Si-29 and H-1-Al-27
   FSLG-HETCOR, H-1 CRAMPS, and H-1-Si-29 CP/MAS experiments were employed
   to evaluate the proton environments around Al and Si atoms in the final
   nanotube structure. The H-1 CRAMPS spectra of dehydrated aluminosilicate
   nanotubes revealed the proton environments in great detail. Integration
   of these results with the findings from the H-1-Si-29 and H-1-Al-27
   FSLG-HETCOR and H-1-Si-29 CP/MAS data allows the structural assignment
   of all the chemical shifts and the identification of various types of
   defect structures in the aluminosilicate nanotube wall. In particular,
   we identify five main types of defect structures arising from specific
   atomic vacancies in the nanotube structure. It is estimated that similar
   to 16\% of Si atoms in the nanotube inner wall are involved in a defect
   structure. The characterization of the detailed structure of the
   nanotube wall is expected to have significant implications for its
   chemical properties and applications.}},

Abstract = {{We studied molecular sieving properties of zeolitic imidazolate
   framework-8 (ZIF-8) by estimating the thermodynamically corrected
   diffusivities of probe molecules at 35 degrees C. From helium (2.6 A) to
   iso-C4H10 (5.0 A), the corrected diffusivity drops 14 orders of
   magnitude. Our results further suggest that the effective aperture size
   of ZIF-8 for molecular sieving is in the range of 4.0 to 4.2 A, which is
   significantly larger than the XRD-derived value (34 A) and 17) between
   the well-known aperture size of zeolite 4A (3.8 A) and 5A (4.3 A).
   Interestingly, because of aperture flexibility, the studied C-4
   hydrocarbon molecules that are larger than this effective aperture size
   still adsorb in the micropores of ZIF-8 with kinetic selectivities for
   iso-C4H8/iso-C4H10 of 180 and n-C4H10/iso-C4H10 of 2.5 x 10(6). These
   unexpected molecular sieving properties open up new opportunities for
   ZIF materials for separations that cannot be economically achieved by
   traditional microporous adsorbents such as synthetic zeolites.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate/epoxy and exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets/epoxy
   nanocomposites were prepared and studied varying the filler content.
   Morphological characteristics were examined via scanning electron
   microscopy, while structural changes occurring in barium titanate as a
   function of temperature were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction.
   Broadband dielectric spectroscopy was employed for determining the
   dielectric response of the prepared systems. Based on the conducted
   analysis it was found that three relaxation processes are present in the
   spectra of the examined materials. From the slower to the faster one,
   these are interfacial polarization, glass to rubber transition of the
   polymer matrix, and rearrangement of polar side groups of the polymer
   chain. Systems' functionality and energy storing efficiency were
   assessed in terms of dielectric reinforcing function. Finally, the
   energy density of all systems was evaluated. Composite systems with
   embedded graphite nanoplatelets exhibit higher energy storing
   efficiency, while thermally induced structural changes in ferroelectric
   particles provide functional behavior to barium titanate composites. (C)

Abstract = {{Airfoils and wings undergoing static and dynamic stall still elude
   accurate simulation by computational methods. While significant emphasis
   has been placed on the quantification of grid dependence, as well as
   influence of the turbulence method, many elements defining temporal
   convergence remain ad hoc. To address this, convergence and accuracy for
   two different turbulence methods were examined for both static and
   dynamic stall. New approaches to define numerical convergence that
   include an assessment of the physical accuracy have been developed and
   evaluated via a blind analysis at other stall conditions. A key finding
   is the need to ensure that the combination of time step and
   subiterations achieves a true second order accurate solution. It was
   also observed that accurate prediction of separation was controlled
   primarily by the turbulent transport terms, while the mean flow
   equations influenced reattachment. Temporal convergence of dynamic stall
   can be quantitatively assessed by an approach developed in this effort.

Abstract = {{We investigate the thermal transport in isolated single layer graphene
   (SLG) and SLG supported on Cu substrate using equilibrium molecular
   dynamics simulations and relaxation time approximation (RTA) method. We
   observe significant changes in the SLG dispersion curve in low frequency
   and low wave-vector region due to the interaction with Cu substrate.
   Several new phonon modes related to out-of-plane vibrations appear at
   the low frequency and small wave vector regions, but their contribution
   to graphene thermal conductivity is negligible. The thermal conductivity
   of graphene decreases by 44\% due to the interactions with Cu substrate
   for high interaction strength parameter in Lennard-Jones potential
   formulation for graphene-Cu interaction. The phonon mode analysis
   through the RTA approach shows that the acoustic phonons dominate the
   thermal transport for both isolated and supported graphenes. The
   longitudinal acoustic (LA), transverse acoustic (TA), and out-of-plane
   acoustic (ZA) phonons contribute 654, 330, and 361W/mK to the lattice
   thermal conductivity of isolated graphene, respectively. The phonon life
   time of ZA modes decreases by order of magnitude due to the interactions

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture information is critical for applications like landslide
   susceptibility analysis and military trafficability assessment. Existing
   technologies cannot observe soil moisture at spatial scales of
   hillslopes (e. g., 10(0) to 10(2) m) and over large areas (e. g., 10(2)
   to 10(5) km(2)) with sufficiently high temporal coverage (e. g., days).
   Physics-based hydrologic models can simulate soil moisture at the
   necessary spatial and temporal scales, albeit with error. We develop and
   test a data assimilation framework based on the ensemble Kalman filter
   for constraining uncertain simulated high-resolution soil moisture
   fields to anticipated remote sensing products, specifically NASA's Soil
   Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, which will provide global L band
   microwave observation approximately every 2-3 days. The framework
   directly assimilates SMAP synthetic 3 km radar backscatter observations
   to update hillslope-scale bare soil moisture estimates from a
   physics-based model. Downscaling from 3 km observations to hillslope
   scales is achieved through the data assimilation algorithm. Assimilation
   reduces bias in near-surface soil moisture (e. g., top 10 cm) by
   approximately 0.05 m(3)/m(3) and expected root-mean-square errors by at
   least 60\% in much of the watershed, relative to an open loop
   simulation. However, near-surface moisture estimates in channel and
   valley bottoms do not improve, and estimates of profile-integrated
   moisture throughout the watershed do not substantially improve. We
   discuss the implications of this work, focusing on ongoing efforts to
   improve soil moisture estimation in the entire soil profile through
   joint assimilation of other satellite (e. g., vegetation) and in situ
   soil moisture measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Aromatic organoarsenicals roxarsone (ROX) and p-arsanilic acid (ASA) are
   common feed additives for livestock and could be released into the
   environment via animal manure and agricultural runoff. To evaluate their
   environmental fate, the adsorption behavior of ROX and ASA was
   investigated with two common soil metal oxides. goethite (FeOOH) and
   aluminum oxide (Al2O3), under different reactant loading, water pH and
   competing ion conditions. ROX and ASA exhibit essentially identical
   adsorption characteristics. FeOOH and Al2O3 exhibit similar adsorption
   trends for both organoarsenicals; however, the adsorption efficiency on
   the surface site basis was about three times lower for Al2O3 than for
   FeOOH. The adsorption reaction is favorable at neutral and acidic pH.
   Phosphate and natural organic matter significantly interfere with
   aromatic arsenical adsorption on both metal oxides, whereas sulfate and
   nitrate do not. Pre-adsorbed aromatic arsenicals can be quickly but not
   completely displaced by phosphate, indicating that ion exchange is not
   the only mechanism governing the adsorption process. The adsorption
   envelope was successfully modeled by a diffuse double layer surface
   complexation model, identifying the critical role of di-anionic
   organoarsenic species in the adsorption. Results of this research can
   help predict and control the mobility of aromatic arsenicals in the
   environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsoventral (DV) axis of the Drosophila embryo is patterned by a
   nuclear gradient of the Rel family transcription factor, Dorsal (Dl),
   that activates or represses numerous target genes in a region-specific
   manner. Here, we demonstrate that signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases
   (RTK) reduces nuclear levels and transcriptional activity of Dl, both at
   the poles and in the mid-body of the embryo. These effects depend on
   wntD, which encodes a Dl antagonist belonging to the Wingless/Wnt family
   of secreted factors. Specifically, we show that, via relief of Groucho-
   and Capicua-mediated repression, the Torso and EGFR RTK pathways induce
   expression of WntD, which in turn limits Dl nuclear localization at the
   poles and along the DV axis. Furthermore, this RTK-dependent control of
   Dl is important for restricting expression of its targets in both
   contexts. Thus, our results reveal a new mechanism of crosstalk, whereby
   RTK signals modulate the spatial distribution and activity of a
   developmental morphogen in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 years much attention has been given to characterizing
   the spatial accuracy of fMRI based signals and to techniques that
   improve on its co-localization with neuronal activity. While the vast
   majority of fMRI studies have always used the conventional positive BOLD
   signal, alternative contrast options have demonstrated superior spatial
   specificity. One of these options surfaced shortly after the initial
   BOLD fMRI demonstrations and was motivated by optical imaging studies
   which revealed an early signal change that was much smaller but
   spatially more specific than the delayed positive response. This early
   signal change was attributed to oxygenation changes prior to any
   subsequent blood flow increases. After observation of this biphasic
   hemodynamic response in fMRI, because this early response resulted in a
   small MR signal decrease prior to the onset of the large signal
   increase, it became known as the ``initial dip{''}. While the initial
   dip in fMRI was subsequently reported by many studies, including those
   in humans, monkeys, and cats, there were conflicting views about the
   associated mechanisms and whether it could be generalized across brain
   regions or species, in addition to whether or not it would prove
   fruitful for neuroscience. These discrepancies, along with the
   implications that the initial dip might increase the spatial specificity
   of BOLD fMRI from 2 to 3 mm to something more closely associated with
   neural activity, resulted in lot of buzz and controversy in the
   community for many years. In this review, the authors provide an account
   of the story of the initial dip in MR based functional imaging from the
   Minnesota perspective, where the first demonstrations,
   characterizations, and applications of the initial dip commenced. (C)

Abstract = {{We use polypropylene (PP, an apolar polymer) and cellulose nano whiskers
   (CNW, a polar material) to produce nano polymer composites with enhanced
   mechanical and thermal properties. To improve compatibility, maleic
   anhydride grafted PP has also been used as a coupling agent. To enhance
   the uniform distribution of CNW in the composite, the matrix polymer is
   dissolved in toluene, and sonification and magnetic stirring are
   applied. Good film transparency indicates uniform CNW dispersion, but
   CNW domains in the composite film observed under an scanning electron
   microscope may indicate slight agglomeration of CNW in the composite
   film. The tensile strength of the composite compared with neat PP
   improves by 70-80\% with the addition of CNW. The crystallinity has also
   been improved by about 50\% in the CNW reinforced samples. As the
   content of CNW increases, the composite exhibits higher thermal
   degradation temperature, higher hydrophilicity, and higher thermal
   conductivity. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2012}},

Title = {{Krylov subspace methods for computing hydrodynamic interactions in
   Brownian dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic interactions play an important role in the dynamics of
   macromolecules. The most common way to take into account hydrodynamic
   effects in molecular simulations is in the context of a Brownian
   dynamics simulation. However, the calculation of correlated Brownian
   noise vectors in these simulations is computationally very demanding and
   alternative methods are desirable. This paper studies methods based on
   Krylov subspaces for computing Brownian noise vectors. These methods are
   related to Chebyshev polynomial approximations, but do not require
   eigenvalue estimates. We show that only low accuracy is required in the
   Brownian noise vectors to accurately compute values of dynamic and
   static properties of polymer and monodisperse suspension models. With
   this level of accuracy, the computational time of Krylov subspace
   methods scales very nearly as O(N-2) for the number of particles N up to
   10 000, which was the limit tested. The performance of the Krylov
   subspace methods, especially the ``block{''} version, is slightly better
   than that of the Chebyshev method, even without taking into account the
   additional cost of eigenvalue estimates required by the latter.
   Furthermore, at N = 10000, the Krylov subspace method is 13 times faster
   than the exact Cholesky method. Thus, Krylov subspace methods are
   recommended for performing large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations
   with hydrodynamic interactions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{A convenient and efficient deiodination polycondensation method for the

   N-Halosuccinimides, iodine, and bromine were evaluated as halogenating

   of 3,4-dioxypyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acids, which were then polymerized
   at 60 degrees C using dichloromethane or chloroform as solvent. When
   iodine and N-iodosuccinimide were employed as electrophilic halogen
   sources, the methodology produced macromolecules (M-n = 6.2-22.9 kDa) in
   satisfactory yields (55-71\%) for two
   N-alkyl-3,4-dialkyloxypyrrole-based monomers that were tested. This
   method can be employed to produce a variety of XDOP-based homopolymers
   and regioregular copolymers starting from discrete oligomers under

Abstract = {{The properties of supramolecular assemblies in conjugated macromolecular
   systems are strongly dependent on single chain effects. We report that
   differences in regioregularity (RR) of side chain attachment in
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as small as ca. 4\% are sufficient to
   induce dramatic changes in the electronic and morphological properties
   of the material. Casting the electronic absorption spectra in the
   framework of Spano's model g reveals that the conjugation length is
   surprisingly sensitive to RR, with differences in free exciton bandwidth
   between the two P3HT samples approaching 73 meV. The enhanced main chain
   planarization motivates a concomitant increase in nanofibril width as
   well as crystallinity observed in thin films of the higher RR variant.
   This observation correlates well with the field effect mobilities that
   are attenuated by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in the lower RR polymer
   film. We suggest that the increased intrachain order coupled with a
   reduced fraction of grain boundaries in the higher RR film is
   responsible for the reported differences.}},

   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06)
   functionals. We have considered a number of surface conditions to better
   understand the impact of surface hydroxylation and intrinsic and
   extrinsic surface defects, including zinc vacancies, oxygen vacancies,
   zinc interstitials, and aluminum dopants on the surface electronic
   properties. Our calculations point to large variations in surface work
   function and energy band gap as a function of the surface model; these
   variations can be attributed to changes in surface charge carrier
   density and to additional surface states induced by the defects. The
   calculated shifts in O(1s) core-level binding energy of the surface
   oxygens in different bonding configurations are in good agreement with
   experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data and point to the
   presence of two distinct OH-species on the ZnO surface. Our results also
   show that the electron-compensation centers induced by zinc vacancies
   can be stabilized by intrinsic and/or extrinsic n-type doping near the
   surface; such n-type doping can lead to better performance of organic

Abstract = {{A large fraction of submicron atmospheric aerosol particles contains
   both organic material and inorganic salts. As the relative humidity
   cycles in the atmosphere and the water content of the particles
   correspondingly changes, these mixed particles can undergo a range of
   phase transitions, possibly including liquid-liquid phase separation. If
   liquid-liquid phase separation occurs, the gas-particle partitioning of
   atmospheric semivolatile organic compounds, the scattering and
   absorption of solar radiation, and the reactive uptake of gas species on
   atmospheric particles may be affected, with important implications for
   climate predictions. The actual occurrence of liquid-liquid phase
   separation within individual atmospheric particles has been considered
   uncertain, in large part because of the absence of observations for
   real-world samples. Here, using optical and fluorescence microscopy, we
   present images that show the coexistence of two noncrystalline phases
   for real-world samples collected on multiple days in Atlanta, GA as well
   as for laboratory-generated samples under simulated atmospheric
   conditions. These results reveal that atmospheric particles can undergo
   liquid-liquid phase separations. To explore the implications of these
   findings, we carried out simulations of the Atlanta urban environment
   and found that liquid-liquid phase separation can result in increased
   concentrations of gas-phase NO3 and N2O5 due to decreased particle
   uptake of N2O5.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an effective chemical etching treatment to remove
   a boron-rich layer which has a significant negative impact on n-type
   silicon (Si) solar cells with boron emitter. A nitric acid-grown
   oxide/silicon nitride stack passivation on the boron-rich layer-etched
   boron emitter markedly decreases the emitter saturation current density
   J(0e) from 430 to 100 fA/cm(2). This led to 1.6\% increase in absolute
   cell efficiency including 22 mV increase in open-circuit voltage V-oc
   and 1.9 mA/cm(2) increase in short-circuit current density J(sc). This
   resulted in screen-printed large area (239 cm(2)) n-type Si solar cells

Title = {{Effects of solute breakthrough curve tail truncation on residence time
   estimates: A synthesis of solute tracer injection studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic transport and retention strongly affect biogeochemical
   processes that are critical to stream ecosystems. Tracer injection
   studies are often used to characterize solute transport and retention in
   stream reaches, but the range of processes accurately resolved with this
   approach is not clear. Solute residence time distributions depend on
   both in-stream mixing and exchange with the hyporheic zone and the
   larger groundwater system. Observed in-stream breakthrough curves have
   most commonly been modeled with in-stream advection-dispersion plus an
   exponential residence time distribution, but process-based models
   suggest that hyporheic exchange is a fractal process, and that hyporheic
   residence time distributions are more appropriately characterized by
   power law tailing. We synthesized results from a variety of
   tracer-injection studies to investigate the information content of
   tracer breakthrough curves. We found that breakthrough curve tails are
   often not well characterized in stream tracer experiments. The two main
   reasons for this are: 1) experimental truncation of breakthrough curves,
   which occurs when sampling ends before all tracer mass reaches the
   sampling location, and 2) sensitivity truncation of breakthrough curves,
   when tracer concentrations in the tail are too low to be detected
   reliably above background levels. Tail truncation reduces observed mass
   recovery and obscures assessment of breakthrough curve tailing and
   solute residence time. Failure to consider tail truncation leads to
   underestimation of hyporheic exchange and solute retention and to
   corresponding overestimation of hyporheic biogeochemical transformation
   rates. Based on these findings, we propose criteria for improved design
   of in-stream tracer injection experiments to improve assessment of
   solute tailing behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Cathepsins S and K are potent mammalian proteases secreted into the
   extracellular space and have been implicated in elastin and collagen
   degradation in diseases such as atherosclerosis and osteoporosis.
   Studies of individual cathepsins hydrolyzing elastin or collagen have
   provided insight into their binding and kinetics, but cooperative or
   synergistic activity between cathepsins K and S is less described. Using
   fluorogenic substrate assays, Western blotting, cathepsin zymography,
   and computational analyses, we uncovered cathepsin cannibalism, a novel
   mechanism by which cathepsins degrade each other as well as the
   substrate, with cathepsin S predominantly degrading cathepsin K. As a
   consequence of these proteolytic interactions, a reduction in total
   hydrolysis of elastin and type I collagen was measured compared with
   computationally predicted values derived from individual cathepsin
   assays. Furthermore, type I collagen was preserved from hydrolysis when
   a 10-fold ratio of cathepsin S cannibalized the highly collagenolytic
   cathepsin K, preventing its activity. Elastin was not preserved due to
   strong elastinolytic ability of both enzymes. Together, these results
   provide new insight into the combined proteolytic activities of
   cathepsins toward substrates and each other and present kinetic models
   to consider for more accurate predictions and descriptions of these
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{We fabricated a regular array of Ag/SiO2/Au multi-segment cylindrical

   scattering (SERS) active substrate using an advanced soft-nanoimprint
   lithographic technique. The SERS spectra results for Rhodamine 6G (R6G)
   molecules on the Ag/SiO2/Au multi-segment nanopatterns show that the
   highly ordered patterns and interlayer thickness are responsible for
   enhancing the sensitivity and reproducibility, respectively, The
   multi-segment nanopattern with a silica interlayer generates significant
   SERS enhancement (similar to EF = 1.2 x 10(6)) as compared to that of
   the bimetallic (Ag/Au) nanopatterns without a dielectric gap (similar to
   EF = 1.0 x 10(4)). Further precise control of the interlayer distances
   between the two metals plays an essential role in enhancing SERS
   performance for detecting low concentrations of analytes such as
   fluorescent (Rhodamine 6G) and DNA molecules. Therefore, the highly
   ordered multi-segment patterns provide great sensitivity and
   reproducibility of SERS based detection, resulting in a high performance

   dimethoxydimethylsilane and HFE 7200 (10:90 w/w) on a grooved silicon

Abstract = {{Neutron reflectivity (NR) measurements of ultrathin surface films (below
   30 nm) composed of Bombyx mori silk fibroin protein in combination with
   atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry were used to reveal the
   internal structural organization in both dry and swollen states.
   Reconstituted aqueous silk solution deposited on a silicon substrate
   using the spin-assisted layer-by-layer (SA-LbL) technique resulted in a
   monolayer silk film composed of random nanofibrils with constant
   scattering length density (SLD). However, a vertically segregated
   ordering with two different regions has been observed in dry, thicker,
   seven-layer SA-LbL silk films. The vertical segregation of silk
   multilayer films indicates the presence of a different secondary
   structure of silk in direct contact with the silicon oxide surface
   (first 6 nm). The layered structure can be attributed to interfacial
   beta-sheet crystallization and the formation of well-developed
   nanofibrillar nanoporous morphology for the initially deposited silk
   surface layers with the preservation of less dense, random coil
   secondary structure for the layers that follow. This segregated
   structure of solid silk films defines their complex nonuniform behavior
   in the D2O environment with thicker silk films undergoing delamination
   during swelling. For a silk monolayer with an initial thickness of 6 nm,
   we observed the increase in the effective thickness by 60\% combined
   with surprising decrease in density. Considering the nanoporous
   morphology of the hydrophobic silk layer, we suggested that the apparent
   increase in its thickness in liquid environment is caused by the air
   nanobubble trapping phenomenon at the liquid solid interface.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies ranging from solvent extraction and drug delivery to tissue
   engineering are beginning to benefit from the unique ability of ``smart
   polymers{''} to undergo controllable structural changes in response to
   external stimuli. The prototype is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (P(NIPAAm)) which exhibits an abrupt and reversible hydrophilic to
   hydrophobic transition above its lower critical solution temperature
   (LCST) of similar to 305 K We report here molecular dynamics simulations
   to show the deswelling mechanisms of the hydrated surface-grafted
   P(NIPAAm) brush at various temperatures such as 275, 290, 320, 345, and
   370 K. The deswelling of the P(NIPAAm) brush is clearly observed above
   the lower critical solution temperature below which the P(NIPAAm) brush
   is associated with water molecules stably. By simulating the
   poly(acrylamide) brush as a reference system having the upper critical
   solution temperature (UCST) behavior with the same conditions employed
   in the P(NIPAAm) brush simulations, we confirmed that the deswelling of
   P(NIPAAm) brush does not take place at a given range of temperatures,
   which validates our simulation procedure. By analyzing the pair
   correlation functions and the coordination numbers, we found that the
   dissociation of water from the P(NIPAAm) brush occurs mainly around the
   isopropyl group of the P(NIPAAm) above the LCST because of its
   hydrophobicity. We also found that the NH of the amide group in NIPAAm
   does not actively participate in the hydrogen bonding with water
   molecules because of the steric hindrance caused by the attached
   isopropyl group, and thereby the hydrogen bonding interactions between
   amide groups and water molecules are significantly weakened with
   increasing temperature, leading to deswelling of the hydrated P(NIPAAm)
   brush above the LCST through favorable entropic change. These results
   explain the experimental observations in terms of a simple molecular
   mechanism for polymer function.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of large covariance matrices has drawn considerable recent
   attention, and the theoretical focus so far has mainly been on
   developing a minimax theory over a fixed parameter space. In this paper,
   we consider adaptive covariance matrix estimation where the goal is to
   construct a single procedure which is minimax rate optimal
   simultaneously over each parameter space in a large collection. A fully
   data-driven block thresholding estimator is proposed. The estimator is
   constructed by carefully dividing the sample covariance matrix into
   blocks and then simultaneously estimating the entries in a block by
   thresholding. The estimator is shown to be optimally rate adaptive over
   a wide range of bandable covariance matrices. A simulation study is
   carried out and shows that the block thresholding estimator performs
   well numerically. Some of the technical tools developed in this paper
   can also be of independent interest.}},

Abstract = {{Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) using ureolytic
   bacteria shows promise in the field of geotechnical engineering for
   several different applications, such as ground improvement and
   groundwater control. This study examined optimal use and efficient
   control of Sporosarcina pasteurii to induce the precipitation of CaCO3
   in open environments. Laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the
   effect of changing treatment factors, such as chemical concentrations,
   retention times, and effective input rates (mol/L/h) on chemical
   efficiency. Chemical efficiency was measured based on weight
   measurements of CaCO3 precipitation compared with the amount of chemical
   reactants injected to samples. Based on the experimental results, the
   optimal time required for the precipitation process to take place in
   porous media for a specific range of bacterial optical density was
   determined. Results show that, below a certain urea and CaCl2 input rate
   (0:042 mol/L/h) and for a bacterial optical density (OD600) between 0.8
   and 1.2, the reaction efficiency remained high and the amount of
   precipitation was not affected by the liquid medium concentration (for
   input concentrations up to 1 M). However, the precipitation pattern at
   the pore scale was found to be affected by the injected concentration.
   Scanning electron microscopy images taken of different samples at
   different levels of cementation showed that, for the same amount of
   precipitation, the use of lower chemical concentrations in injections
   resulted in better distribution of calcite precipitation, especially at
   lower cementation levels. This variation in precipitation pattern is
   expected to affect the use of MICP for different applications. DOI:

Abstract = {{Transportation agencies have suffered stringent funding shortages for
   the past several years. As a result, many pavement preservation and
   rehabilitation projects have been substantially delayed. The financial
   consequences of delaying pavement rehabilitation need to be quantified
   so funding needs can be justified scientifically. Although studies on
   the basis of hypothetical data have been conducted to evaluate the
   effect of delaying treatments, there is no research using actual data to
   quantify the financial consequences of delaying pavement rehabilitation.
   This study is motivated by the need to remedy this situation. A method
   that quantifies the financial consequences of delaying rehabilitation
   using real-world data is proposed. The proposed method uses
   life-cycle-cost analysis (LCCA) and a composite performance indicator,
   pavement condition rating (PCR), to determine the treatment timing. The
   proposed method is validated using actual pavement performance data and
   maintenance history from the long-term pavement performance (LTPP)
   specific pavement studies-5 (SPS-5) in California. These pavement
   sections have the same pavement structure, traffic volume, environmental
   features, and similar rehabilitation treatments, but they have different
   treatment timings. Their annual life-cycle costs are computed and
   compared to quantitatively evaluate the financial consequences of
   delaying treatment. Preliminary results show that delaying
   rehabilitation of pavement sections (prerehabilitation PCR value < 60)
   increases the equivalent uniform annualized cost (EUAC) by approximately
   27.7\% for a 2-in. overlay and 28.3\% for a 5-in. overlay compared with
   the timely rehabilitation of pavement sections. Future research is also
   discussed in this paper. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000387. (C)

Abstract = {{This research examines the efficiency of thermomechanical pulp (TMP)
   fibers, both untreated and after chemical treatment to produce
   holocellulose and alpha-cellulose, for internal curing. In addition, the
   effect of TMP fibers on early hydration behavior was investigated. The
   results show that TMP and alpha-cellulose fibers had a negligible effect
   on cement hydration. Holocellulose, conversely, significantly reduced
   the rate of hydration, noticeably delaying setting time. The addition of
   the fibers in dosages to provide an additional amount of entrained water
   of 0.05 g per gram of cement resulted in a decrease of early autogenous
   shrinkage of cement paste. Holocellulose, reducing autogenous shrinkage
   of cement paste by 93\%, was shown to be the most effective for internal
   curing; however, its adverse effect on cement hydration may require
   acceleratory admixtures when used in concrete. Thermomechanical pulp and
   alpha-cellulose showed a similar efficiency in mitigating autogenous
   shrinkage; these fibers reduced shrinkage of cement paste by
   approximately 51 and 45\%, respectively. DOI:

Abstract = {{We study how the inelastic structural response predicted via synthetic
   seismograms is affected by the selection of site response models in
   ground motion simulations. We first generate synthetics for multiple
   scenarios and site conditions in Southern California using attenuation
   relations, site specific linear, viscoelastic and nonlinear analyses,
   and estimate the ground motion variability that results from the soil
   model selection. We next use bilinear single degree-of-freedom
   oscillators to demonstrate how this variability propagates to the
   inelastic structural response predictions. Results show high bias and
   scatter of the inelastic displacement ratio predicted using the
   empirical and linear elastic site response models relative to the
   nonlinear, for periods close to the fundamental period of the site. For
   the synthetic motions and sites used, we derive empirical correlations
   between the amount of bias and period range where it manifests, and
   selected input motion and site parameters. {[}DOI: 10.1193/1.4000056]}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptional activity from a specified promoter can provide a useful

   for selective tagging of proteins made in cells in which specified

   reagents for enrichment or with fluorescent dyes for visualization. The
   method allows state-selective analysis of the proteome, whereby proteins
   synthesized in predetermined physiological states can be identified. The
   approach is demonstrated by proteorne-wide labeling of bacterial
   proteins upon activation of the P-BAD promoter and the SoocRS regulon
   and provides a basis for analysis of more complex systems including
   spatially heterogeneous microbial cultures and biofilms.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all dietary lipids are transported from the intestine to venous
   circulation through the lymphatic system, yet the mechanisms that
   regulate this process remain unclear. Elucidating the mechanisms
   involved in the functional response of lymphatics to changes in lipid
   load would provide valuable insight into recent implications of
   lymphatic dysfunction in lipid related diseases. Therefore, we sought to
   develop an in situ imaging system to quantify and correlate lymphatic
   function as it relates to lipid transport. The imaging platform provides
   the capability of dual-channel imaging of both high-speed bright-field
   video and fluorescence simultaneously. Utilizing post-acquisition image
   processing algorithms, we can quantify correlations between vessel pump
   function, lymph flow, and lipid concentration of mesenteric lymphatic
   vessels in situ. All image analysis is automated with customized LabVIEW
   virtual instruments; local flow is measured through lymphocyte velocity
   tracking, vessel contraction through measurements of the vessel wall
   displacement, and lipid uptake through fluorescence intensity tracking
   of an orally administered fluorescently labelled fatty acid analogue,
   BODIPY FL C-16. This system will prove to be an invaluable tool for
   scientists studying intestinal lymphatic function in health and disease,
   and those investigating strategies for targeting the lymphatics with
   orally delivered drugs to avoid first pass metabolism. (C) 2012 Society

Abstract = {{Following a radioactive dispersal device (RDD) incident, it may be
   necessary to evaluate the internal contamination levels of a large
   number of potentially affected individuals to determine if immediate
   medical follow-up is necessary. Since the current laboratory capacity to
   screen for internal contamination is limited, rapid field screening
   methods can be useful in prioritising individuals. This study evaluated
   the suitability of a radiation portal monitor for such screening. A
   model of the portal monitor was created for use with models of six
   anthropomorphic phantoms in Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code
   Version 5 (MCNP) X-5 Monte Carlo Team (MCNP-A General Monte Carlo
   N-Particle Transport Code Version 5. LA-CP-03-0245. Vol. 2. Los Alamos
   National Laboratory, 2004.). The count rates of the portal monitor were
   simulated for inhalation and ingestion of likely radionuclides from an
   RDD for each of the phantoms. The time-dependant organ concentrations of
   the radionuclides were determined using Dose and Risk Calculation

Abstract = {{Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are used for sanitation in many
   poultry processing facilities. This work investigated the fate and
   effect of a mixture of benzalkonium chlorides (BACs), a class of QACs
   widely used in commercial antimicrobial formulations, on the biological
   nitrogen removal (BNR) processes. A laboratory-scale BNR system was
   operated continuously for 670 days, fed with poultry processing
   wastewater amended with a mixture of BACs. Initially, the nitrogen
   removal efficiency deteriorated at a BAC feed concentration of 5 mg/L
   due to the complete inhibition of nitrification. However, after 27 days
   of operation, the system recovered and achieved 100\% ammonia removal.
   High nitrogen removal efficiency was achieved even after the feed BAC
   concentration was stepwise increased up to 120 mg/L. Batch nitrification
   assays performed before, during, and after BAC exposure, showed that
   rapid microbial acclimation and BAC biodegradation contributed to the
   recovery of nitrification achieving efficient and stable long-term BNR
   system operation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli has been engineered to produce a variety of biofuel and
   biorefinery products. However, it can only produce these products from
   simple sugars, requiring large amounts of enzymes to depolymerize
   cellulose into monomer sugars. Engineering E. coli to directly use
   cellodextrin, the partial hydrolysis product of cellulose, potentially
   could reduce the requirement of enzyme thereby the overall cost. Through
   a combination of gene deletion, introduction of a synthetic operon, and
   periplasmic expression of a Saccharophagus cellodextrinase, we
   engineered, for the first time, an E. coli biocatalyst capable of
   producing BDO from cellodextrin. The success of the engineering strategy
   is evidenced by the high BDO yield (>80\%) from cellodextrin. We
   additionally demonstrate that the engineered biocatalyst can be
   advantageously used in a SSF process for BDO production from cellulose
   as the expression of cellodextrinase from a BDO producer augments the
   insufficient beta-glucosidase activities in a commercial cellulase
   cocktail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   table at peers can be guaranteed. More importantly, in order to enhance
   the performance of video data lookup operation without incurring extra
   overhead, we design a so-called Distributed Index Mapping and Management
   Mechanism (DIMM) for SDHT. Both analytical modeling and intensive
   simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   SDHT framework. Numerical results show that almost 90\% requested video
   data can be retrieved within one second in SDHT based systems, and SDHT
   needs only 26\% average bandwidth consumption when compared with similar
   one-hop DHT solutions such as D1HT. This indicates that SDHT framework
   is an appropriate data lookup solution for time-sensitive network
   applications such as P2P live streaming.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics of an ionic-liquid (IL) based absorption refrigeration
   system has been numerically analyzed. It provides an alternative to the
   normally toxic working fluids, such as the ammonia in conventional
   absorption systems. The use of ILs also eliminates crystallization and
   metal-compatibility problems of the water/LiBr system. Mixtures of
   refrigerants and imidazolium-based ILs are theoretically explored as the
   working fluid pairs in a miniature absorption refrigeration system, so
   as to utilize waste-heat to power a refrigeration/heat pump system for
   electronics cooling. A non-random two-liquid (NRTL) model was built and
   used to predict the solubility of the mixtures. Saturation temperatures
   at the evaporator and condenser were set at 25 degrees C and 50 degrees
   C, respectively, with the power dissipation of 100 W. Water in
   combination with {[}emim]{[}BF4] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   tetrafluoroborate) gave the highest coefficient of performance (COP)
   around 0.9. The refrigerant/IL compatibility indicated by the
   circulation ratio, alkyl chain length of the IL, and thermodynamic
   properties of the refrigerants, such as latent heat of evaporation were
   proven to be important factors in determining the performance of the
   absorption system. The negative effect of high viscosity was mitigated
   by dilution of the IL with the refrigerant and the use of slightly
   larger microfluidic channel heat exchangers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Linear Diophantine Constrained Intra-Fix for Frequency Domain
   Equalization of Multi-h CPM}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of constructing a symbol block to
   generate a cyclic multi-h continuous phase modulated (CPM) signal so as
   to permit frequency domain equalization (FDE) at the receiver. Like
   single-h CPM, the memory inherent in a multi-h CPM waveform requires the
   use of an additional segment, called an intra-fix, in each transmitted
   block. The intra-fix forces the transmitter state machine to regress to
   the state it had at the start of the block. The constraints on the
   symbols of the intra-fix, which ensure above condition, are shown to be
   a set of Linear Diophantine Equations (LDEs). Three different methods
   are proposed for finding the symbols of the intra-fix, such that the
   length of the intra-fix is minimized. The last two methods connect the
   problem of intra-fix insertion to the problem of trellis termination of
   the tilted phase. This connection enables us to state and justify that
   existing bounds established on the length of the terminating sequence
   are effective for the length of the intra-fix. We observe that multi-h
   CPM schemes typically require a shorter intra-fix, as compared to
   single-h CPM schemes having similar modulation parameters. We apply the
   proposed procedure to a dual-h CPM scheme.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Noncovalent interactions play an important role in the stabilization of
   biological molecules. The effective fragment potential (EFP) is a
   computationally inexpensive ab initio-based method for modeling
   intermolecular interactions in noncovalently bound systems. The accuracy
   of EFP is benchmarked against the S22 and S66 data sets for noncovalent
   interactions {[}Jurecka, P.; Sponer, J.; Cerny, J.; Hobza, P. Phys.
   Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006, 8, 1985; Rezac, J.; Riley, K E.; Hobza, P. J.
   Chem: Theory Comput. 2011, 7, 2427]. The mean unsigned error (MUE) of
   EFP interaction energies with respect to coupled-cluster singles,
   doubles, and perturbative triples in the complete basis set limit
   {[}CCSD(T)/CBS] is 0.9 and 0.6 kcal/mol for S22 and S66, respectively,
   which is similar to the MUE of MP2 and SCS-MP2 for the same data sets,
   but with a greatly reduced computational expense. Moreover, EFP
   outperforms classical force fields and popular DFT functionals such as
   B3LYP and PBE, while newer dispersion-corrected functionals provide a
   more accurate description of noncovalent interactions. Comparison of EFP
   energy components with the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)
   energies for the S22 data set shows that the main source of errors in
   EFP comes from Coulomb and polarization terms and provides a valuable
   benchmark for further improvements in the accuracy of EFP and force
   fields in general.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a nonempirical atoms-in-molecules (AIM) method for computing
   net atomic charges that simultaneously reproduce chemical states of
   atoms in a material and the electrostatic potential V(r) outside its
   electron distribution. This method gives accurate results for a variety
   of periodic and nonperiodic materials including molecular systems, solid
   surfaces, porous solids, and nonporous solids. This method, called
   DDEC/c3, improves upon our previously published DDEC/c2 method (Manz, T.
   A.; Sholl, D. S. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 6,2455-2468) by
   accurately treating nonporous solids with short bond lengths. Starting
   with the theory all AIM charge partitioning functionals with spherically
   symmetric atomic weights must satisfy, the form of the DDEC/c3
   functional is derived from first principles. The method is designed to
   converge robustly by avoiding conditions that lead to nearly flat
   optimization landscapes. In addition to net atomic charges, the method
   can also compute atomic multipoles and atomic spin moments. Calculations
   performed on a variety of systems demonstrate the method's accuracy,
   computational efficiency, and good agreement with available experimental
   data Comparisons to a variety of other charge assignment methods (Bader,
   natural population analysis, electrostatic potential fitting, Hirshfeld,
   iterative Hirshfeld, and iterative stockholder atoms) show that the
   DDEC/c3 net atomic charges are well suited for constructing flexible
   force fields for atomistic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting coherent wavefronts between passive receivers using
   cross-correlations of ambient noise (CAN) provides a means for
   monitoring the seismoacoustic environment without using active sources.
   However, using cross-correlations between single receivers can require a
   long recording time in order to extract stable coherent arrivals from
   CAN. This becomes an issue if the propagation medium fluctuates
   significantly during the recording period. To address this issue, this
   article presents a general spatio-temporal filtering procedure to
   enhance the emergence rate for coherent wavefronts extracted from
   time-averaged ambient noise correlations between two spatially separated
   arrays. The robustness of this array-based CAN technique is investigated
   using ambient shipping noise recorded over 24 h in the frequency band
   {[}250-850 Hz] on two vertical line arrays deployed 143 m apart in
   shallow water (depth 20 m). Experimental results confirm that the
   array-based CAN technique can significantly reduce the recording
   duration (e. g., from 22 h to 30 min) required for extracting coherent
   wavefronts of sufficient amplitude (e. g., 20 dB over residual temporal
   fluctations) when compared to conventional CAN implementations between
   single pairs of hydrophones. These improvements of the CAN technique
   could benefit the development of noise-based ocean monitoring
   applications such as passive acoustic tomography. (C) 2012 Acoustical

   lithiation-induced softening is considered, in contrast to the fact that
   mechanical driving forces always enhance diffusion when deformation is

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Effective thermal control systems are essential for reliable operation
   of spacecraft. A dual-driven intelligent combination control strategy is
   proposed to improve the temperate control and heat flux tracking
   effects. Both temperature regulation and heat flux tracking errors are
   employed to generate the final control action; their contributions are
   adaptively adjusted by a fuzzy fusing policy of control actions. To
   evaluate the control effects, describe a four-nodal mathematical model
   for analyzing the dynamic characteristics of the controlled heat pipe
   space cooling system (HP-SCS) consisting of an aluminum-ammonia heat
   pipe and a variable-emittance micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS)
   radiator. This dynamical model calculates the mass flow-rate and
   condensing pressure of the heat pipe working fluid directly from the
   systemic nodal temperatures, therefore, it is more suitable for control
   engineering applications. The closed-loop transient performances of four
   different control schemes have been numerically investigated. The

Title = {{Characterization of the homogeneous tissue mixture approximation in
   breast imaging dosimetry}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{5050-5059}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the estimate of normalized glandular dose in
   mammography and breast CT imaging obtained using the actual glandular
   tissue distribution in the breast to that obtained using the homogeneous
   tissue mixture approximation.
   Methods: Twenty volumetric images of patient breasts were acquired with
   a dedicated breast CT prototype system and the voxels in the breast CT
   images were automatically classified into skin, adipose, and glandular
   tissue. The breasts in the classified images underwent simulated
   mechanical compression to mimic the conditions present during
   mammographic acquisition. The compressed thickness for each breast was
   set to that achieved during each patient's last screening cranio-caudal
   (CC) acquisition. The volumetric glandular density of each breast was
   computed using both the compressed and uncompressed classified images,
   and additional images were created in which all voxels representing
   adipose and glandular tissue were replaced by a homogeneous mixture of
   these two tissues in a proportion corresponding to each breast's
   volumetric glandular density. All four breast images (compressed and
   uncompressed; heterogeneous and homogeneous tissue) were input into
   Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the normalized glandular dose during
   mammography (compressed breasts) and dedicated breast-CT (uncompressed
   breasts). For the mammography simulations the x-ray spectra used was
   that used during each patient's last screening CC acquisition. For the
   breast CT simulations, two x-ray spectra were used, corresponding to the
   x-ray spectra with the lowest and highest energies currently being used
   in dedicated breast CT prototype systems under clinical investigation.
   The resulting normalized glandular dose for the heterogeneous and
   homogeneous versions of each breast for each modality was compared.
   Results: For mammography, the normalized glandular dose based on the
   homogeneous tissue approximation was, on average, 27\% higher than that
   estimated using the true heterogeneous glandular tissue distribution
   (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test p = 0.00046). For dedicated breast CT, the
   overestimation of normalized glandular dose was, on average, 8\% (49 kVp
   spectrum, p = 0.00045) and 4\% (80 kVp spectrum, p = 0.000089). Only two
   cases in mammography and two cases in dedicated breast CT with a tube
   voltage of 49 kVp resulted in lower dose estimates for the homogeneous
   tissue approximation compared to the heterogeneous tissue distribution.
   Conclusions: The normalized glandular dose based on the homogeneous
   tissue mixture approximation results in a significant overestimation of
   dose to the imaged breast. This overestimation impacts the use of dose
   estimates in absolute terms, such as for risk estimates, and may impact
   some comparative studies, such as when modalities or techniques with
   different x-ray energies are used. The error introduced by the
   homogeneous tissue mixture approximation in higher energy x-ray
   modalities, such as dedicated breast CT, although statistically
   significant, may not be of clinical concern. Further work is required to
   better characterize this overestimation and potentially develop new
   metrics or correction factors to better estimate the true glandular dose
   to breasts undergoing imaging with ionizing radiation. 0 2012 American

Abstract = {{In this article, a new deterministic approximation method for Bayesian
   computation, known as design of experiments-based interpolation
   technique (Dolt), is proposed. The method works by sampling points from
   the parameter space using an experimental design and then fitting a
   kriging model to interpolate the unnormalized posterior. The
   approximated posterior density is a weighted average of normal
   densities, and therefore, most of the posterior quantities can be easily
   computed. Dolt is a general computing technique that is easy to
   implement and can be applied to many complex Bayesian problems.
   Moreover, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality as much as
   some quadrature methods. It can work using fewer posterior evaluations,
   which is a great advantage over the Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte
   Carlo methods, especially when dealing with computationally expensive
   posteriors. This article has supplementary material that is available

Title = {{A Bayesian Approach for Interpreting Mean Shifts in Multivariate Quality
   Control}},
Journal = {{TECHNOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{294-307}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Multivariate quality characteristics are often monitored using a single
   statistic or a few statistics. However, it is difficult to determine the
   causes of an out-of-control signal based on a few summary statistics.
   Therefore, if a control chart for the mean detects a change in the mean,
   the quality engineer needs to determine which means shifted and the
   directions of the shifts to facilitate identification of root causes. We
   propose a Bayesian approach that gives a direct answer to this question.
   For each mean, an indicator variable that indicates whether the mean
   shifted upward, shifted downward, or remained unchanged is introduced.
   Prior distributions for the means and indicators capture prior knowledge
   about mean shifts and allow for asymmetry in upward and downward shifts.
   The mode of the posterior distribution of the vector of indicators or
   the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of each indicator gives
   the most likely scenario for each mean. Evaluation of the posterior
   probabilities of all possible values of the indicators is avoided by
   employing Gibbs sampling. This renders the computational cost more
   affordable for high-dimensional problems. This article has supplementary
   materials online.}},

Abstract = {{Retail delivery of electric power through millimeter waves is relevant
   in developing areas where the market for communication devices outpaces
   the power grid infrastructure. It is also a critical component of an
   evolutionary path towards terrestrial and space-based renewable power

   millimeter wave beamed power delivery. It then considers design
   requirements for a retail beamed power architecture, in the context of
   rural India where power delivery is lagging behind the demand growth for
   connectivity. A survey of technology developments relevant to millimeter

Abstract = {{Tuning the surface wettability is of great interest for both scientific
   research and practical applications. We demonstrated reversible
   transition between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity on a ZnO
   nanorod/epoxy composite film. The epoxy resin serves as an adhesion and
   stress relief layer. The ZnO nanorods were exposed after oxygen reactive
   ion etching of the epoxy matrix. A subsequent chemcial treatment with
   fluoroalkyl and alkyl silanes resulted in a superhydrophobic surface
   with a water contact angle up to 158.4 degrees and a hysteresis as low
   as 1.3 degrees. Under UV irradiation, the water contact angle decreased
   gradually, and the surface eventually became superhydrophilic because of
   UV induced decomposition of alkyl silanes and hydroxyl absorption on ZnO
   surfaces. A reversible transition of surface wettability was realized by
   alternation of UV illumination and surface treatment. Such ZnO
   nanocomposite surface also showed improved mechanical robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Only limited information is available on the design, and synthesis of
   functional materials for preventing corrosion of metal nanostructures.
   In the nanometer regime, even noble metals are subject to chemical
   attack. Here, the corrosion behavior of noble metal nanoparticles coated
   with a conjugated polymer nanolayer was explored for the first time.
   Specifically, electrochemical corrosion and sulfur tarnishing behaviors
   were examined for Ag-polypyrrole (PPy) core-shell nanoparticles using
   potentiodynamic polarization and spectrophotometric analysis,
   respectively. First, the Ag-PPy nanoparticles exhibited enhanced
   resistance to electrochemically induced corrosion compared to their
   exposed silver counterparts. Briefly, a neutral PPy shell provided the
   highest protection efficiency (75.5\%), followed by sulfate ion-
   (61.3\%) and dodecylbenzenesulfonate ion- (53.6\%) doped PPy shells.
   However, the doping of the PPy shell with chloride ion induced an
   adverse effect (protection efficiency, -120\%). Second, upon exposure to
   sulfide ions, the Ag-PPy nanoparticles preserved their morphology and
   colloidal stability while the bare silver analog underwent significant
   structural deformation. To further understand the function of the PPy
   shell as a protection layer for the silver core, the catalytic activity
   of the nanostructures was also evaluated Using the reduction of
   4-nitrophenol as a representative example of a catalytic reaction, the
   rate constant for that reduction using the PPy encased Ag nanoparticles
   was found to be 1.1 x 10(-3) s(-1), which is approximately 33\% less
   than that determined for the parent silver. These results demonstrate
   that PPy can serve as both an electrical and chemical barrier for
   mitigating undesirable chemical degradation in corrosive environments,
   as well as provide a simple physical barrier to corrosive substances
   under appropriate conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the application of the recently introduced
   extended high-order sandwich panel theory to the global buckling of a
   sandwich beam/wide panel. Three different solution approaches using the
   extended high-order sandwich panel theory are presented to investigate
   the effects of simplifying the loading case by applying loads just on
   the face sheets and by including or excluding nonlinear axial strains in
   the core. The results are also compared with results from a benchmark
   elasticity solution and, furthermore, from the simple sandwich buckling
   formula by the earlier extended high-order sandwich panel theory. It is
   found that all three theories are close to the elasticity solution for
   ``soft{''} cores with E-I(c)/E-1(f) < 0.001. However, for ``moderate{''}
   cores, i.e., with E-I(c)/E-1(f) > 0.001, the theories diverge and the
   extended high-order sandwich panel theory is the most accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Both performance and energy cost are important concerns for current data
   center operators. Traditionally, however, IT and mechanical engineers
   have separately optimized the cyber and physical aspects of data center
   operations. This paper considers both of these aspects with the eventual
   goal of developing performance and power management techniques that
   operate holistically to control the entire cyber-physical complex of
   data center installations. Toward this end, we propose a balance of
   payments model for holistic power and performance management. As an
   example of coordinated cyber-physical system management, the
   energy-aware cyber-physical system (EaCPS) uses an application
   controller on the cyber side to guarantee application performance, and
   on the physical side, it utilizes electric current-aware capacity
   management (CACM) to smartly place executables to reduce the energy
   consumption of each chassis present in a data center rack. A web
   application, representative of a multi-tier web site, is used to
   evaluate the performance of the controller on the cyber side, the CACM
   control on the physical side, and the holistic EaCPS methods in a
   mid-size instrumented data center. Results indicate that coordinated
   EaCPS outperforms separate cyber and physical control modules.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of efficiently maintaining a large number (say millions) of
   statistics counters that need to be updated at very high speeds (e. g.,
   40 Gb/s) has received considerable research attention in recent years.
   This problem arises in a variety of router management and data streaming
   applications where large arrays of counters are used to track various
   network statistics and implement various counting sketches. It proves
   too costly to store such large counter arrays entirely in SRAM, while
   DRAM is viewed as too slow for providing wirespeed updates at such high
   line rates. In particular, we propose a DRAM-based counter architecture
   that can effectively maintain wirespeed updates to large counter arrays.
   The proposed approach is based on the observation that modern commodity
   DRAM architectures, driven by aggressive performance roadmaps for
   consumer applications, such as video games, have advanced architecture
   features that can be exploited to make a DRAM-based solution practical.
   In particular, we propose a randomized DRAM architecture that can
   harness the performance of modern commodity DRAM offerings by
   interleaving counter updates to multiple memory banks. The proposed
   architecture makes use of a simple randomization scheme, a small cache,
   and small request queues to statistically guarantee a near-perfect
   load-balancing of counter updates to the DRAM banks. The statistical
   guarantee of the proposed randomized scheme is proven using a novel
   combination of convex ordering and large deviation theory. Our proposed
   counter scheme can support arbitrary increments and decrements at
   wirespeed, and they can support different number representations,
   including both integer and floating point number representations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we solve a fundamental problem: how to use distributed
   random access to achieve the performance of centralized schedulers. We
   consider wireless networks with arbitrary topologies and spatial traffic
   distributions, where users can receive traffic from or send traffic to
   different users and different communication links may interfere with
   each other. The channels are assumed heterogeneous, and the random
   channel gains of different links may have different distributions. To
   resolve the network contention in a distributed way, each frame is
   divided into contention and transmission periods. The contention period
   is used to resolve conflicts, while the transmission period is used to
   send payload in collision-free scenarios. We design a multistage
   channel-aware Aloha scheme for the contention period to enable users
   with relatively better channel states to have higher probabilities of
   contention success while assuring fairness among all users. We show
   analytically that the proposed scheme completely resolves network
   contention and achieves throughput close to that of centralized
   schedulers. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is robust to any
   uncertainty in channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that
   it significantly improves network performance while maintaining fairness
   among different users. The proposed random access approach can be
   applied to different wireless networks, such as cellular, sensor, and
   mobile ad hoc networks, to improve quality of service.}},

Abstract = {{Testing of Radio Frequency (RF) circuits for nonlinearity specifications
   generally requires the use of multiple test measurements thereby
   contributing to increased test cost. Prior RF test methods have suffered
   from significant test calibration effort (training for supervised
   learners) when using compact tests or from increased test time due to
   direct specification measurement. On the other hand, due to aggressive
   technology scaling, there are plenty of digital transistors available
   that can be used to simplify testing of Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) and RF
   devices. In this paper, an RF test methodology is developed that: (a)
   allows RF devices to be tested for several distortion specifications
   using distortion model fitting algorithms in test time comparable to
   what can be achieved using supervised learning techniques while
   retaining the accuracy of direct specification measurement, (b) allows
   multiple RF specifications to be determined concurrently from a single
   data acquisition and (c) allows digital-compatible testing/BIST to be
   performed using digital testers or on-chip built in self-test (BIST)
   circuitry. With regard to (a), a key benefit is that no training of
   supervised learning algorithm is necessary. The proposed method based on
   distortion model fitting is shown to give excellent results across
   common RF performance metrics while providing 10x improvements in test
   time compared to previous methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present an adaptive reconfigurable active voltage doubler
   (VD)/rectifier (REC) (VD/REC) in standard CMOS, which can adaptively
   change its topology to either a VD or a REC by sensing the output
   voltage, leading to more robust inductive power transmission over an
   extended range. Both active VD and REC modes provide much lower dropout
   voltage and far better power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to
   their passive counterparts by adopting offset-controlled high-speed
   comparators that drive the rectifying switches at proper times in the
   high-frequency band. We have fabricated the active VD/REC in a 0.5-mu m
   3-metal 2-poly CMOS process, occupying 0.585 mm(2) of chip area. In an
   exemplar setup, VD/REC extended the power transmission range by 33\%
   (from 6 to 8 cm) in relative coil distance and 41.5\% (from 53 degrees
   to 75 degrees) in relative coil orientation compared to using the REC
   alone. While providing 3.1-V dc output across a 500-Omega load from
   2.15-(VD) and 3.7-V (REC) peak ac inputs at 13.56 MHz, VD/REC achieved
   measured PCEs of 70\% and 77\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is an efficient way to mitigate
   inter-cell interference (ICI) in multi-cell orthogonal frequency
   division multiple access (OFDMA) networks. In this paper, we investigate
   the throughput and the optimal threshold for the FFR scheme. The average
   cell throughputs are derived for both round robin (RR) and maximum SINR
   (MSINR) scheduling strategies when users are uniformly distributed in
   the cell region. It is shown from the analysis and simulation results
   that the throughput increases and the optimal distance threshold
   decreases with the number of users for both scheduling strategies. The
   optimal distance threshold approaches the minimum distance that users
   can be away from the base station when the number of users goes to
   infinity. The optimal distance threshold increases with the frequency
   reuse factor of the cell-edge region when the MSINR scheduling is used.
   The impact of the RR scheduling strategy on the optimal threshold of the
   FFR scheme is negligible. Simulation also demonstrates that the FFR
   scheme with the optimal threshold significantly outperforms that with
   the existing fixed threshold.}},

Title = {{OPERA: Optimal Routing Metric for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2884-2894}},

Abstract = {{Two main issues affect the existing routing metrics for cognitive radio
   ad hoc networks: i) they are often based on heuristics, and thus they
   have not been proved to be optimal; ii) they do not account for the
   route diversity effects, and thus they are not able to measure the
   actual cost of a route. In this paper, an optimal routing metric for
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks, referred to as OPERA, is proposed.
   OPERA is designed to achieve two features: i) Optimality: OPERA is
   optimal when combined with both Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford based routing
   protocols; ii) Accuracy: OPERA exploits the route diversity provided by
   the intermediate nodes to measure the actual end-to-end delay, by taking
   explicitly into account the unique characteristics of cognitive radio
   networks. A closed-form expression of the proposed routing metric is
   analytically derived for both static and mobile networks, and its
   optimality is proved rigorously. Performance evaluation is conducted
   through simulations, and the results reveal the benefits of adopting the
   proposed routing metric for cognitive radio ad hoc networks.}},

Abstract = {{1 alpha,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 {[}1,25(OH)2D3] acts on cells through
   traditional steroid hormone receptor-mediated gene transcription and by
   initiating rapid membrane-associated signaling pathways. Two receptors
   have been implicated in rapid signaling by 1,25(OH)2D3, the classical
   nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the more recently identified
   protein disulfide isomerase, family A, member 3 (Pdia3). Our lab along
   with other groups has established various tools to investigate the role
   of these two receptors, including gene knock-out, conditional knock-out,
   silencing, and over-expression in various model systems (growth plate
   chondrocytes, osteoblastic cells, chick intestinal epithelial cells,
   mouse embryoid bodies, extracellular matrix vesicles and isolated cell
   membranes). The data demonstrate the requirement for Pdia3 in
   1,25(OH)2D3 induced phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and protein kinase C (PKC)
   activation and downstream responses. Pdia3+/- heterozygote mice also
   exhibit both cartilage and bone defects. VDR is present on the plasma
   membrane and one VDR-/- mouse strain lacks transcaltachia, although
   1,25(OH)2D3 induced PKC activation and transcaltachia are not affected
   in another VDR-/- mouse strain. In the context of osteoblast
   differentiation, both receptors are expressed during osteogenic
   commitment of embryoid bodies and silencing of each causes a more mature
   osteoblast phenotype in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Pdia3 exists in
   caveolae, where it interacts with PLA2 activating protein (PLAA) and
   caveolin-1 to initiate rapid signaling via PLA2, phospholipase C (PLC),
   PKC, and ultimately the ERK1/2 family of mitogen activated protein
   kinases (MAPK). Using the growth plate chondrocyte and matrix vesicle
   models, we have demonstrated that Pdia3-dependent signaling in response
   to 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates growth plate physiology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of distributed containment control
   of a group of mobile autonomous agents with multiple stationary or
   dynamic leaders under both fixed and switching directed network
   topologies. First, when the leaders are stationary and all followers
   share an inertial coordinate frame, we present necessary and sufficient
   conditions on the fixed or switching directed network topology such that
   all followers will ultimately converge to the stationary convex hull
   formed by the stationary leaders for arbitrary initial states in a space
   of any finite dimension. When the directed network topology is fixed, we
   partition the (nonsymmetric) Laplacian matrix and explore its properties
   to derive the convergence results. When the directed network topology is
   switching, the commonly adopted decoupling technique based on the
   Kronecker product in a high-dimensional space can no longer be applied
   and we hence present an important coordinate transformation technique to
   derive the convergence results. The proposed coordinate transformation
   technique also has potential applications in other high-dimensional
   distributed control scenarios and might be used to simplify the analysis
   of a high-dimensional system to that of a one-dimensional system when
   the decoupling technique based on the Kronecker product cannot be
   applied. Second, when the leaders are dynamic and all followers share an
   inertial coordinate frame, we propose a distributed tracking control
   algorithm without velocity measurements. When the directed network
   topology is fixed, we derive conditions on the network topology and the
   control gain to guarantee that all followers will ultimately converge to
   the dynamic convex hull formed by the dynamic leaders for arbitrary
   initial states in a space of any finite dimension. When the directed
   network topology is switching, we derive conditions on the network
   topology and the control gain such that all followers will ultimately
   converge to the minimal hyperrectangle that contains the dynamic leaders
   and each of its hyperplanes is normal to one axis of the inertial
   coordinate frame in any high-dimensional space. We also show via some
   counterexamples that it is, in general, impossible to find distribute
   containment control algorithms without velocity measurements to
   guarantee that all followers will ultimately converge to the convex hull
   formed by the dynamic leaders under a switching network topology in a
   high-dimensional space. Simulation results are presented as a proof of
   concept. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the potential impacts of engineered metal oxide

   of seven different types of engineered metal oxide NPs against
   Paramecium multi-micronucleatum, a ciliated protozoan, using the 48 h
   LC50 (lethal concentration, 50\%) test. Our results showed that the 48 h
   LC50 values of these NPs to Paramecium ranged from 0.81 (Fe2O3 NPs) to
   9269 mg/L (Al2O3 NPs); their toxicity to Paramecium increased as
   follows: Al2O3 < TiO2 < CeO2 < ZnO < SiO2 < CuO < Fe2O3 NPs. On the
   basis of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, interfacial
   interactions between NPs and cell membrane were evaluated, and the
   magnitude of interaction energy barrier correlated well with the 48 h
   LC50 data of NPs to Paramecium; this implies that metal oxide NPs with
   strong association with the cell surface might induce more severe

Abstract = {{Interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with pathogen-derived peptide
   presented by the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule is
   central to adaptive immunity as it initiates intracellular signaling to
   trigger T cell response to infection. Kinetic parameters of this
   interaction have been under intensive investigation for more than two
   decades using soluble pMHCs and/or TCRs with at least one of them in the
   solution (three-dimensional (3D) methods). Recently, several techniques
   have been developed to enable kinetic analysis on live T cells with
   pMHCs presented by surrogate antigen presenting cells (APCs) or
   supported planar lipid bilayers (two-dimensional (2D) methods).
   Comparison of 2D versus 3D parameters reveals drastic differences with
   broader ranges of 2D affinities and on-rates and orders of magnitude
   faster 2D off-rates for functionally distinct pMHCs. Here we review new
   2D data and discuss how it may impact previously developed models of T
   cell discrimination between pMHCs of different potencies.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of individuals are at risk for deep venous thrombosis
   (DVT) due to alterations in multiple coagulation factors and inhibitors
   secondary to malignancy, drug interactions, or other general medical
   conditions. Traditional metrics of haemostasis such as prothrombin time,
   partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time, generally estimate
   anticoagulation status and bleeding risk rather than thrombosis risk.
   The objective of this study was to correlate a novel, systems-based
   metric of clotting potential to risk of DVT from a database derived from
   the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS). We utilised a computational model
   of blood coagulation, which addresses the interplay between biochemical
   factors, blood flow, and physiologic surface initiation of coagulation,
   to calculate an individualised, systems-based metric of clotting
   potential, termed the flow-simulated thrombin generation (FSTG), for 210
   pre-menopausal women in LETS. Both DVT and oral contraceptive (OC) use
   were associated with higher values of FSTG. We demonstrated a nearly
   three-fold increased risk of DVT for each standard deviation increase
   above the mean in FSTG determined under venous flow conditions, which
   remained highly predictive after adjustment for age and OC status
   (adjusted odds ratio 2.66; 95\% confidence interval 1.69-4.19;
   p<0.0001). In conclusion, a systems-based screening approach that
   integrates biochemical factors and flow haemodynamics identifies small
   subgroups of patients at risk of thrombosis that may benefit from oral
   anticoagulants.}},

Abstract = {{Biological inspirations have lead us to develop a switching strategy for
   a group of robotic sensing agents searching for a local minimum of an
   unknown noisy scalar field. Starting with individual exploration, the
   agents switch to cooperative exploration only when they are not able to
   converge to a local minimum at a satisfying rate. We derive a
   cooperative H-infinity filter that provides estimates of field values
   and field gradients during cooperative exploration and give sufficient
   conditions for the convergence and feasibility of the filter. The
   switched behavior from individual exploration to cooperative exploration
   results in faster convergence, which is rigorously justified by the
   Razumikhin theorem, to a local minimum. We propose that the switching
   condition from cooperative exploration to individual exploration is
   triggered by a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during
   cooperative exploration. In addition to theoretical and simulation
   studies, we develop a multiagent testbed and implement the switching
   strategy in a lab environment. We have observed consistency of
   theoretical predictions and experimental results, which are robust to
   unknown noises and communication delays.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the optimal timing is the core of preventive maintenance.
   Highway agencies always face with the challenge of determining optimal
   timing for preventive maintenance, particularly in China where there are
   no condition indicators designed for determining adequate timing for
   applying preventive maintenance and little literature relating to the
   development of pavement performance. This work presented the indicators,
   including crack ratio (R (C)), rutting depth (D (R)), international
   roughness index (I (IR)) and sideway force coefficient (C (SF)) to
   determine the adequate timing for preventive maintenance in China. The
   proper ranges of each indicator to apply to preventive maintenance were
   then recommended. They are 0.28\%-1.4\% for R (C), 10-15 mm for D (R),
   1.97-3.5 for I (IR), 40-50 for C (SF). Based on pavement condition
   survey data collected on the test roads in Hebei Province, China, on the
   application of slurry seal at different timings, the pavement
   performance was established and the adequate timings for applying slurry
   seal was studied. Based on benefit-cost analysis, it is suggested that
   the fourth year is the optimal timing for applying slurry seal based on
   the condition in China. A framework is established to determine the
   adequate timings of applying other preventive maintenance methods.}},

Abstract = {{A refreshable Braille cell as a tactile display pro-totype has been
   developed based on a 2 x 3 pneumatic microbubble actuator array and an
   array of commercial valves. The microbubble actuator acting as a Braille
   dot consists of a parylene corrugated diaphragm and an overcoated
   elastomer layer. Polyurethane (PU) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   elastomer-based Braille cells were fabricated and compared in terms of
   their displacement-pressure characteristics, force-displacement
   characteristics, dynamic response, and hysteresis of elastic
   deformation. Both PU- and PDMS-based pneumatic Braille cells demonstrate
   satisfactory properties against the static and vibrational tactile
   display requirements. The displacement of the PU-based Braille dot is
   0.56 mm at a 0.2-Hz operating frequency, and the generated force is 66
   mN at a 100-kPa applied pressure. The strong hysteresis observed in
   microbubble actuators made with PU elastomer is resolved by the use of
   PDMS elastomer. The refreshable Braille cell was also designed to meet
   the criteria of lightness and compactness to permit portable operation.
   The design is scalable with respect to the number of tactile actuators
   while maintaining fabrication simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the adsorption and mobility of metal organic framework
   (MOF)-supported metal nanoclusters is critical to the development of
   these catalytic materials. We present the first theoretical
   investigation of Au-, Pd-, and AuPd-supported clusters in a MOF, namely
   MOF-74. We combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a
   genetic algorithm (GA) to reliably predict the structure of the adsorbed
   clusters. This approach allows comparison of hundreds of adsorbed
   configurations for each cluster. From the investigation of Au-8, Pd-8,
   and Au4Pd4, we find that the organic part of the MOF is just as
   important for nanocluster adsorption as open Zn or Mg metal sites. Using
   the large number of clusters generated by the GA, we developed a
   systematic method for predicting the mobility of adsorbed clusters.
   Through the investigation of diffusion paths a relationship between the
   cluster's adsorption energy and diffusion barrier is established,
   confirming that Au clusters are highly mobile in the MOF-74 framework
   and Pd clusters are less mobile.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic circuit boards of computers consist of components which
   generate substantial amounts of heat during their operation. Among
   these, the microprocessor chip is one of the major sources of heat
   generation. In high-performance processor chips, the rates of heat
   generation are also correspondingly high. The performance of the chips
   themselves, as well as that of the neighboring electronic components are
   affected by the temperature levels attained, which in turn depend on the
   heat dissipation capability. Effective thermal management of
   microprocessor chips, following precise thermal characterization, is
   essential to avoid their untimely failure due to overheating. The
   selection of an appropriate cooling methodology and the design of an
   efficient cooling system for the microprocessor chip essentially require
   a clear knowledge of the heat dissipation rates during its operation. A
   comprehensive database of heat dissipation from microprocessor chips as
   a function of the activity level, based on actual measurements, is rare
   to find in the literature. A major reason for this is that conventional
   intrusive measurements on and around the chip are quite insufficient, as
   they will alter the performance, while the system is under operation. To
   overcome this, a nonintrusive digital interferometric measurement has
   been devised in this paper for obtaining the in situ temperature
   distributions and the heat dissipation patterns around the
   microprocessor chip, while it is under operation. The interferometric
   method utilizes interference of coherent laser beams to make
   measurements in the thermal field around the heat-dissipating component.
   An Intel Pentium 4 microprocessor with its integrated heat sink was used
   for experimentation. The computational load on the processor was varied
   utilizing a software package, thus varying the heat generation rates,
   and the base temperature of the fins in the heat sink attached to the
   microprocessor. Interferometric measurements were made to obtain the
   temperature distribution in the medium, and the patterns of heat
   dissipation from the fins' surfaces. Indicators of the heat transfer
   behavior, namely, the local heat flux values and the heat transfer
   coefficients were obtained from the experiments, using digital image
   processing techniques. Experiments were conducted at various fin-base
   temperatures, under free and forced convection conditions, to
   characterize the effect through a database of the heat dissipation
   level. In essence, a nonintrusive temperature measurement method coupled
   with digital image processing techniques has been successfully used for
   convective heat transfer studies on the microchip while the microchip is
   under operation.}},

Abstract = {{Interconnects in radio frequency (RF) packages have a strong tendency to
   deteriorate RF performance, especially in high-frequency systems. In
   this paper, comparison is made between the wirebonded and embedded
   flip-chip packages. X-band silicon-germanium low-noise amplifiers are
   used to evaluate the performance of these interconnects. Measured
   results show that the embedded flip-chip packages have better RF
   performance than the wirebonded packages for X-band applications. At 9.5
   GHz, the flip-chip interconnects contribute only 0.4 dB of insertion
   loss, while the wirebond interconnects contribute 2.2 dB of insertion
   loss. The flip-chip and wirebond interconnects are modeled and validated
   against measured results from 8 to 20 GHz. For the first time, multiple
   dies are put together in a single liquid crystal polymer package to
   compare the packaging effects, and to demonstrate the feasibility of
   embedding multiple dies within a single package for highly integrated

Abstract = {{Evolutionary algorithms can be applied to a variety of constrained
   network communication problems with centric type models. This paper
   shows that with real-world complex network communication problems of
   this type, sophisticated statistical search is required. This situation
   occurs due to the fact that these optimization problems are at least
   NP-complete. In order to appreciate the formal modeling of realistic
   communication networks, historical network design problems are presented
   and evolved into more complex real-world models with associated
   deterministic and stochastic solution approaches discussed. This
   discussion leads into the design of an innovative multiobjective
   evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to solve a very complex network design
   problem variation called the multicommodity capacitated network design
   problem (MCNDP). This variation represents a hybrid real-world
   communication architecture as reflected in real-world network centric
   models with directional communications, multiple objectives including
   costs, delays, robustness, vulnerability, and operating reliability
   within network constraints. Nodes in such centric systems can have
   multiple and varying link capacities as well as rates and information
   (commodity) quantities to be sent and received. Each commodity can also
   have independent prioritized bandwidth and spectrum requirements. The
   nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is selected as the MOEA
   framework which is modified and parallelized to solve the generic MCNDP.
   Since the MCNDP is highly constrained but with an enormous number of
   possible network communication topologies, a novel initialization
   procedure and mutation method are integrated resulting in reduced search
   space. Empirical results and analysis indicate that effective
   topological Pareto solutions are generated for use in highly
   constrained, communication-based network design.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium carbonate scaling occurs in the chip feed system and the cooking
   vessel of continuous digesters in pulp mills, and it arises from the
   reaction of calcium from wood chips with carbonate in the cooking
   liquor. Commercial antiscalants are typically expensive and rarely keep
   the system scale-free. Lignin derivatives have been proposed as
   antiscalants, because of their ability to chelate calcium, but they have
   not been adopted commercially. We demonstrate that addition of similar
   to 1\% black liquor to white liquor reduces or prevents calcium scaling,
   as shown by a simple new test that measures the degree to which scale
   resists abrasive removal from a metal surface. These findings were
   validated in a full-scale mill trial, where the black liquor not only
   inhibited calcium scale formation, but also removed existing scale.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel methodology called Design Scenarios (DSs)
   intended for use in conceptual design of buildings. DS enables
   multidisciplinary design teams to streamline the requirements
   definition, alternative generation, analysis, and decision-making
   processes by providing a methodology for building and managing
   requirements driven design spaces with parametric Computer Aided Design
   (CAD) tools. DS consists of four interdependent models: (1) Requirements
   Model - stakeholders and designers explicitly define and prioritize
   context specific design requirements; (2) Scenarios Model (SM) -
   designers formally transform these requirements into actions necessary
   to achieve them, and determine the geometric and material parameters,
   interrelationships, and potential conflicts; (3) Parametric Process
   Model (PPM) - CAD experts build and represent the technical
   implementation of a SM in a parametric model to enable design teams to
   manage and communicate its CAD models; (4) Alternative Analysis Model -
   analyze and visually report performance back to the designers and
   stakeholders. This paper motivates the need for the DS methodology
   thorough an industry case study, and establishes points of departure for
   the methodology through literature review. Next, the paper details the
   elements and methods in the methodology, describes its implementation
   into a software prototype, provides an illustrative example to explain,
   and an industry test case to validate how DS can potentially enable
   multidisciplinary teams to generate and communicate larger and better
   performing design spaces more efficiently than with traditional methods.

Abstract = {{The energy-filtering effect was successfully employed at the

   (P3HT) nanocomposites with the addition of Bi2Te3 nanowires, where
   low-energy carriers were strongly scattered by the appropriately
   engineered potential barrier of the P3HT-Bi2Te3 interface. The resulting
   P3HT-Bi2Te3 nanocomposites exhibited a high power factor of 13.6 mu W
   K(-2)m(-1) compared to that of 3.9 mu W K-2 m(-1) in P3HT. The transport

   the experimental measurements of electrical conductivity, Seebeck

Abstract = {{Cooperative navigation (CN) enables a group of cooperative robots to
   reduce their individual navigation errors. For a general multi-robot
   (MR) measurement model that involves both inertial navigation data and
   other onboard sensor readings, taken at different time instances, the
   various sources of information become correlated. Thus, this correlation
   should be solved for in the process of information fusion to obtain
   consistent state estimation. The common approach for obtaining the
   correlation terms is to maintain an augmented covariance matrix. This
   method would work for relative pose measurements, but is impractical for
   a general MR measurement model, because the identities of the robots
   involved in generating the measurements, as well as the measurement time
   instances, are unknown a priori. In the current work, a new consistent
   information fusion method for a general MR measurement model is
   developed. The proposed approach relies on graph theory. It enables
   explicit on-demand calculation of the required correlation terms. The
   graph is locally maintained by every robot in the group, representing
   all of the MR measurement updates. The developed method calculates the
   correlation terms in the most general scenarios of MR measurements while
   properly handling the involved process and measurement noise. A
   theoretical example and a statistical study are provided, demonstrating
   the performance of the method for vision-aided navigation based on a
   three-view measurement model. The method is compared, in a simulated
   environment, with a fixed-lag centralized smoothing approach. The method
   is also validated in an experiment that involved real imagery and
   navigation data. Computational complexity estimates show that the newly
   developed method is computationally efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Bioresorbable scaffolds with mechanical properties suitable for bone
   tissue engineering were fabricated from polycaprolactone (PCL) and
   hydroxyapatite (HA) by selective laser sintering (SLS) and modeled by
   finite-element analysis (FEA). Both solid gage parts and scaffolds
   having 1-D, 2-D and 3-D orthogonal, periodic porous architectures were
   made with 0, 10, 20 and 30 vol.\% HA. PCL:HA scaffolds manufactured by
   SLS had nearly full density (99\%) in the designed solid regions and had
   excellent geometric and dimensional control. Through optimization of the
   SLS process, the compressive moduli for our solid gage parts and
   scaffolds are the highest reported in the literature for additive
   manufacturing. The compressive moduli of solid gage parts were 299.3,
   311.2, 415.5 and 498.3 MPa for PCL:HA loading at 100:0, 90:10, 80:20 and
   70:30, respectively. The compressive effective stiffness tended to
   increase as the loading of HA was increased and the designed porosity
   was lowered. In the case of the most 3-D porous scaffold, the
   compressive modulus more than doubled from 14.9 to 36.2 MPa when
   changing the material from 100:0 to 70:30 PCL:HA. A micromechanical FEA
   model was developed to investigate the reinforcement effect of HA
   loading on the compressive modulus of the bulk material. Using a
   first-principles based approach, the random distribution of HA particles
   in a solidified PCL matrix was modeled for any HA loading to predict the
   bulk mechanical properties of the composites. The bulk mechanical
   properties were also used for FEA of the scaffold geometries. The
   results of the FEA were found to be in good agreement with experimental
   mechanical testing. The development of patient- and site-specific
   composite tissue-engineering constructs with tailored properties can be
   seen as a direct extension of this work on computational design, a
   priori modeling of mechanical properties and direct digital
   manufacturing. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{614-621}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Aortic arch reconstruction in neonates is commonly performed
   using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. However, concerns have arisen
   regarding potential adverse neurologic outcomes from this complex
   procedure, raising questions about the best arterial cannulation
   approach for cerebral perfusion and effective systemic hypothermia. In
   this study, we use computational fluid dynamics to investigate the
   effect of different cannulation strategies in neonates.
   Methods. We used a realistic template of a hypoplastic neonatal aorta as
   the base geometry to investigate four cannulation options: (1) right
   innominate artery, (2) innominate root, (3) patent ductus arteriosus
   (PDA), or (4) innominate root and PDA. Performance was evaluated
   according to the numerically predicted cerebral and systemic flow
   distributions compared with physiologic perfusion under neonatal
   conditions.
   Results. The four cannulation strategies were associated with different
   local hemodynamics; however, this did not translate into any significant
   effect on the measured flow distributions. The largest difference only
   represented 0.8\% of the cardiac output and was measured in the
   innominate artery, which received 23.2\% of the cardiac output in option
   3 vs 24\% in option 4. Pulmonary artery snaring benefited all systemic
   vessels uniformly.
   Conclusions. Because of the very high vascular resistances in neonates,
   downstream vascular resistances dictated flow distribution to the
   different vascular beds rather than the cannulation strategy, allowing
   the surgical team to choose their method of preference. However,
   patients with aortic coarctation warrant further investigation and will
   most likely benefit from a 2-cannulae approach (option 4). (Ann Thorac
   Surg 2012;94:614-21) (c) 2012 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{The hydration of tricalcium silicate (C3S) is accelerated by pressure.
   However, the extent to which temperature and/or cement additives modify

   pressure at different temperatures in the absence of additives, and at
   selected temperatures in the presence of retarding agents. The
   magnitudes of the apparent activation volumes for C3S hydration
   increased with the addition of the retarders sucrose, maltodextrin,
   aminotri(methylenephosphonic acid) and an AMPS copolymer. Pressure was
   found to retard the formation of Jaffeite relative to the degree of C3S
   hydration in high temperature experiments. For one cement slurry studied
   without additives, the apparent activation volume for C3S hydration
   remained close to similar to-28 cm(3) mol(-1) over the range 25 to 60
   degrees C. For another slurry, there were possible signs of a decrease
   in magnitude at the lowest temperature examined. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design methodology for robust and low-energy clock
   networks for ultralow voltage (ULV) circuits. We show that both clock
   slew and skew play important roles in achieving high maximum operating

   clock networks in ULV circuits are highly sensitive to process
   variations. We propose a variation-aware methodology that controls both
   clock skew and slew to maximize F-max and minimize clock power. In
   addition, we implement dynamic programming (DP)-based ULV clock routing
   and buffering methods (deferred merging and embedding) for deterministic
   and statistical conditions. Experimental results show that our clock
   network design method achieves lower energy (more than 20\% savings) at
   comparable or even higher F-max compared with the existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible plants, fungi and sessile animals reconfigure in wind and water
   to reduce the drag acting upon them. In strong winds and flood waters,
   for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce drag compared
   with rigid objects of similar surface area. Less understood is how a
   leaf attached to a flexible leaf stalk will roll up stably in an
   unsteady flow. Previous mathematical and physical models have only
   considered the case of a flexible sheet attached to a rigid tether in
   steady flow. In this paper, the dynamics of the flow around the leaf of
   the wild ginger Hexastylis arifolia and the wild violet Viola
   papilionacea are described using particle image velocimetry. The flows
   around the leaves are compared with those of simplified physical and
   numerical models of flexible sheets attached to both rigid and flexible
   beams. In the actual leaf, a stable recirculation zone is formed within
   the wake of the reconfigured cone. In the physical model, a similar
   recirculation zone is observed within sheets constructed to roll up into
   cones with both rigid and flexible tethers. Numerical simulations and
   experiments show that flexible rectangular sheets that reconfigure into
   U-shapes, however, are less stable when attached to flexible tethers. In
   these cases, larger forces and oscillations due to strong vortex
   shedding are measured. These results suggest that the three-dimensional
   cone structure in addition to flexibility is significant to both the
   reduction of vortex-induced vibrations and the forces experienced by the
   leaf.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the spatial distribution of human respiratory syncytial virus
   (hRSV) proteins and RNAs in infected cells is still under investigation,
   with many unanswered questions regarding the interaction of
   virus-induced structures and the innate immune system. Very few studies
   of hRSV have used subcellular imaging as a means to explore the changes
   in localization of retinoicacid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors
   or the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, in response to
   the infection and formation of viral structures. In this investigation,
   we found that both RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5
   (MDA5) colocalized with viral genomic RNA and the nucleoprotein (N) as
   early as 6 h postinfection (hpi). By 12 hpi, MDA5 and MAVS were observed
   within large viral inclusion bodies (IB). We used a proximity ligation
   assay (PLA) and determined that the N protein was in close proximity to
   MDA5 and MAVS in IBs throughout the course of the infection. Similar
   results were found with the transient coexpression of N and the
   phosphoprotein (P). Additionally, we demonstrated that the localization
   of MDA5 and MAVS in IBs inhibited the expression of interferon beta mRNA
   27-fold following Newcastle disease virus infection. From these data, we
   concluded that the N likely interacts with MDA5, is in close proximity
   to MAVS, and localizes these molecules within IBs in order to attenuate
   the interferon response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a
   specific function for hRSV IBs and of the hRSV N protein as a modulator
   of the innate immune response.}},

   paper we focus on the sales of event tickets in the Sports and

   tickets initially or as single events later in the selling horizon. We
   specifically study the optimal time to switch between these market
   segments dynamically as a function of the state of the system. Under
   Poisson demand processes, we find the optimal switching time is a set of
   time thresholds that depends on the remaining inventory and time left in
   the horizon. We use numerical experiments to show that significant
   profit improvements can be obtained by dynamically deciding the optimal
   switch time over the case when the date is announced in advance. We also
   study an extension where ``early switch to a low-demand event{''} is
   allowed.}},

Abstract = {{The surface properties of materials contribute to host cellular response
   and play a significant role in determining the overall success or
   failure of an implanted biomaterial. Rough titanium (Ti) surface
   microtopography and high surface free energy have been shown to enhance
   osteoblast maturation in vitro and increase bone formation in vivo.
   Whereas the surface properties of Ti are known to affect osteoblast
   response, host bone quality also plays a significant role in determining
   successful osseointegration. One factor affecting host bone quality is
   patient age. We examined both in vitro and in vivo whether response to
   Ti surface features was affected by animal age. Calvarial osteoblasts
   isolated from 1-, 3-, and 11-month-old rats all displayed a reduction in
   cell number and increases in alkaline phosphatasespecific activity and
   osteocalcin in response to increasing Ti surface microtopography and
   surface energy. Further, osteoblasts from the three ages examined
   displayed increased production of osteocalcin and local factors
   osteoprotegerin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, and active
   transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 in response to increasing Ti
   surface roughness and surface energy. Latent TGF-beta 1 only increased
   in cultures of osteoblasts from 1- and 3-month-old rats. Treatment with
   the systemic osteotropic hormone 1a,25(OH)2D3 further enhanced the
   response of osteoblasts to Ti surface features for all three age groups.
   However, osteoblasts derived from 11-month-old animals had a reduced
   response to 1a,25(OH)2D3 compared to osteoblasts derived from 1-or
   3-month-old animals. These results were confirmed in vivo. Ti implants
   placed in the femoral intramedullary canal of old (9-month-old) mice
   yielded lower bone-to-implant contact and neovascularization in response
   to Ti surface roughness and energy compared to younger (2-month-old)
   mice. These results show that rodent osteoblast maturation in vitro as
   well as new bone formation in vivo is reduced with age. Whether
   comparable age differences exist in humans needs to be determined. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: Optimizing flow and diminishing power loss in the Fontan
   circuit can improve hemodynamic efficiency, potentially improving the
   long-term outcomes. Computerized modeling has predicted improved
   energetics with a Y-graft Fontan.
   Methods: From August to December 2010, 6 consecutive children underwent
   completion Fontan (n = 3) or Fontan revision (n = 3) using a bifurcated
   polytetrafluoroethylene Y-graft (18 X 9 X 9 mm in 2, 20 X 10 X 10 mm in
   4) connecting the inferior vena cava to the right and left pulmonary
   arteries with separate graft limbs. The patents underwent magnetic
   resonance imaging (n = 5) or computed tomography (n = 1). Computational
   fluid dynamics assessed Fontan hemodynamics, power loss, and inferior
   vena cava flow splits to the branch pulmonary arteries. The clinical
   parameters were compared with those from 12 patients immediately
   preceding the present series who had undergone a lateral Fontan
   procedure.
   Results: Despite longer crossclamp and bypass times (not statistically
   significant), the Y-graft Fontan patients had postoperative courses
   similar to those of the conventional Fontan patients. Other than 2 early
   readmissions for pleural effusions managed with diuretics, at 6 to 12
   months of follow-up (mean, 8 months), all 6 patients had done well.
   Postoperative flow modeling demonstrated a balanced distribution of
   inferior vena cava flow to both pulmonary arteries with minimal flow
   disturbance. Improvements in hemodynamics and efficiency were noted when
   the Y-graft branches were anastomosed distally and aligned tangentially
   with the branch pulmonary arteries.
   Conclusions: The present preliminary surgical experience has
   demonstrated the clinical feasibility of the bifurcated Y-graft Fontan.
   Computational fluid dynamics showed acceptable hemodynamics with low
   calculated power losses and a balanced distribution of inferior vena
   cava flow to the pulmonary arteries as long as the branch grafts were
   anastomosed distally. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012;144:383-9)}},

Abstract = {{We report an in situ transmission electron microscopy study of the
   electrochemical behavior of few-layer graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
   synthesized by longitudinal splitting the multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs). Upon lithiation, the GNRs were covered by a nanocrystalline
   lithium oxide layer attached to the surfaces and edges of the GNRs, most
   of which were removed upon delithiation, indicating that the
   lithiation/delithiation processes occurred predominantly at the surfaces
   of GNRs. The lithiated GNRs were mechanically robust during the tension
   and compression tests, in sharp contrast to the easy and brittle
   fracture of the lithiated MWCNTs. This difference is attributed to the
   unconfined stacking of planar carbon layers in GNRs leading to a weak
   coupling between the intralayer and interlayer deformations, as opposed
   to the cylindrically confined carbon nanotubes where the interlayer
   lithium produces large tensile hoop stresses within the
   circumferentially-closed carbon layers, causing the ease of brittle
   fracture. These results suggest substantial promise of graphene for
   building durable batteries. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new algorithm is presented to solve constrained nonlinear optimal
   control problems, with an emphasis on highly nonlinear dynamical
   systems. The algorithm, called HDDP, is a hybrid variant of differential
   dynamic programming, a proven second-order technique that relies on
   Bellman's Principle of Optimality and successive minimization of
   quadratic approximations. The new hybrid method incorporates nonlinear
   mathematical programming techniques to increase efficiency: quadratic
   programming subproblems are solved via trust region and range-space
   active set methods, an augmented Lagrangian cost function is utilized,
   and a multiphase structure is implemented. In addition, the algorithm
   decouples the optimization from the dynamics using first- and
   second-order state transition matrices. A comprehensive theoretical
   description of the algorithm is provided in this first part of the two
   paper series. Practical implementation and numerical evaluation of the
   algorithm is presented in Part 2.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper series, a new solver, called HDDP, was

   In the present paper, the algorithm is extended to include practical

   involve both academic and applied problems to show that HDDP is capable
   of solving a wide class of constrained, nonlinear optimization problems.
   First, the algorithm is verified to converge in a single iteration on a
   simple multi-phase quadratic problem with trivial dynamics.
   Successively, more complicated constrained optimal control problems are
   then solved demonstrating robust solutions to problems with as many as 7
   states, 25 phases, 258 stages, 458 constraints, and 924 total control

   of electromagnetic flowmeter}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Advances in computing technology enable dry calibration of
   large-diameter electromagnetic (EM) flowmeters at low cost, which has
   been recognized as an effective alternative to traditional flow rigs.
   Dry calibration requiring no actual liquid in the measuring pipe
   utilizes the magnetic field distribution reconstructed from measured
   boundary conditions to determine the sensitivity of the EM flowmeter.
   However, because sensors have finite sizes, and the fact that inner
   linings of the measuring pipe deform due to mechanical stresses, a
   measurement dead domain (MDD) exists between the measured boundary
   surface and the pipe wall. As the MDD is often close to the magnetic
   exciting unit, neglecting it results in significant errors in dry
   calibration. This paper offers a practical method combining iterative
   optimization and reconstruction to estimate the magnetic field in the
   MDD from the field data on the measured boundary surface. The method has
   been validated on an off-the-shelf industrial EM flowmeter by comparing
   the estimated field in the MDD with experimental measurements. It has
   been demonstrated that accurately accounting for the immeasurable field
   in the MDD eliminates more than two-thirds of the dry calibration
   errors. The estimation method illustrated here can also be extended to
   measure other physical fields which obey similar governing equations.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a semiparametric approach called the nonparanormal SKEPTIC
   for efficiently and robustly estimating high-dimensional undirected
   graphical models. To achieve modeling flexibility, we consider the
   nonparanormal graphical models proposed by Liu, Lafferty and Wasserman
   {[}J. Mach. Learn. Res. 10 (2009) 2295-2328]. To achieve estimation
   robustness, we exploit nonparametric rank-based correlation coefficient
   estimators, including Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. We prove that
   the nonparanormal SKEPTIC achieves the optimal parametric rates of
   convergence for both graph recovery and parameter estimation. This
   result suggests that the nonparanormal graphical models can be used as a
   safe replacement of the popular Gaussian graphical models, even when the
   data are truly Gaussian. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conduct
   thorough numerical simulations to compare the graph recovery performance
   of different estimators under both ideal and noisy settings. The
   proposed methods are then applied on a large-scale genomic data set to
   illustrate their empirical usefulness. The R package huge implementing
   the proposed methods is available on the Comprehensive R Archive

Abstract = {{Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function
   from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of
   interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from
   anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet
   the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity
   (FC) studies has yet to be established. This article introduces a
   data-driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole
   brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of
   homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to compare
   methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of
   clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation
   atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford,
   Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random
   parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI
   homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the
   voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random
   parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated.
   ROI size and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest
   impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the
   resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and thus
   offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher
   numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent FC patterns
   present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can
   be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering
   software have been made publicly available at: . Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the application of the molecular dynamics simulation
   approach to the high-resolution visualization of the plastic material
   flow at the tool/workpiece interface during orthogonal cutting. MD
   simulation techniques have been applied to nano-scale processes, but due
   to restrictions in the model size and computational time, they have not
   been utilized to investigate processes occurring at the micro-scale.
   Techniques employed to extend the MD simulation techniques to the
   micro-scale are discussed. Preferred ranges for model parameters that
   provide for sufficient resolution in order to adequately describe the
   characteristic features of the plastic material flow, yet achieve
   significant reduction in the model computational times, are identified.
   An investigation of the plastic material flow at the tool/workpiece
   interface as the uncut chip thickness increases from 10\% to 90\% of the
   edge radius of the tool was undertaken. A key observation is that there
   is a marked variation in the geometry of the observed characteristic
   features, most notable being the rotation and growth of the stable
   built-up edge as the uncut chip thickness increases. Furthermore, the
   transition between the plowing and cutting regimes is observed.}},

Title = {{Discussion paper: Has renaming the high fidelity generalized method of
   cells been justified?}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{15-16}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The high fidelity generalized method of cells (HFGMC) has been
   originally developed by Aboudi (2001) and Aboudi et al. (2001) as a
   micromechanical method for periodic multi-phase composite media. A
   computational implementation of the HFGMC equations has been proposed by
   Bansal and Pindera (2004) to enhance numerical efficiency, still with
   direct reference to the HFGMC formulation. Later, the same computational
   implementation is recast as a new method called ``finite volume direct
   averaging micromechanics{''} (FVDAM), starting by Bansal and Pindera
   (2006). The current discussion paper has two aims. The first is to show
   that the FVDAM is not a new method and that it has the same assumptions
   and identical governing equations as those originally derived by the
   HFGMC. The only difference is in the solution procedure where
   intermediate dependent variables, in the form of average displacements
   at the interfaces, are used instead of directly solving for the unknown
   micro-variables; the coefficients of the displacement polynomials. Thus,
   renaming the HFGMC micromodel to FVDAM has not been justified. In fact,
   (Haj-Ali and Aboudi, 2009) have shown that the same reduction of
   variables can be achieved by a simple static condensation carried out at
   the global system of equations instead of introducing intermediate
   variables. The second aim of this paper is to address misrepresentations
   in a recent discussion paper by the FVDAM authors claiming, in part,
   that the HFGMC method using parametric geometry of the subcells should
   follow their formulation (termed parametric FVDAM). We show that the
   latter is limited to an incomplete quadratic expansion of the
   displacement and an approximation in the form of a priori constant
   Jacobian of the parametric mapping. However, the HFGMC with arbitrary
   cell geometry, (Haj-Ali and Aboudi, 2010), has been formulated in a
   direct and general manner, i.e. retaining the full quadratic expansion
   of the displacement together with the complete Jacobian. Thus, the
   parametric FVDAM is a special case of the parametric HFGMC, i.e. when
   the Jacobian is sampled and evaluated only at one point, namely the
   origin of the parametric coordinate system. The intended new
   contribution of Haj-Ali and Aboudi (2010) to refined micromechanics and
   progressive damage has been completely ignored by the FVDAM-discussion
   paper. Therefore, in order to maintain scientific clarity, it is
   strongly advocated to preserve the original name of the HFGMC method,
   regardless of the different computational implementations used for
   solving the governing equations for both orthogonal and parametric
   geometries of the subcells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neuronal networks produce reliable functional output throughout the
   lifespan of an animal despite ceaseless molecular turnover and a
   constantly changing environment. Central pattern generators, such as
   those of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), are able to
   robustly maintain their functionality over a wide range of burst
   periods. Previous experimental work involving extracellular recordings
   of the pyloric pattern of the STG has demonstrated that as the burst
   period varies, the inter-neuronal delays are altered proportionally,
   resulting in burst phases that are roughly invariant. The question
   whether spike delays within bursts are also proportional to pyloric
   period has not been explored in detail. The mechanism by which the
   pyloric neurons accomplish phase maintenance is currently not obvious.
   Previous studies suggest that the co-regulation of certain ion channel
   properties may play a role in governing neuronal activity. Here, we
   observed in long-term recordings of the pyloric rhythm that spike delays
   can vary proportionally with burst period, so that spike phase is
   maintained. We then used a conductance-based model neuron to determine
   whether co-varying ionic membrane conductances results in neural output
   that emulates the experimentally observed phenomenon of spike phase
   maintenance. Next, we utilized a model neuron database to determine
   whether conductance correlations exist in model neuron populations with
   highly maintained spike phases. We found that co-varying certain
   conductances, including the sodium and transient calcium conductance
   pair, causes the model neuron to maintain a specific spike phase
   pattern. Results indicate a possible relationship between conductance
   co-regulation and phase maintenance in STG neurons.}},

Title = {{Association of Coronary Wall Shear Stress With Atherosclerotic Plaque
   Burden, Composition, and Distribution in Patients With Coronary Artery
   Disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Background-Extremes of wall shear stress (WSS) have been associated with
   plaque progression and transformation, which has raised interest in the
   clinical assessment of WSS. We hypothesized that calculated coronary WSS
   is predicted only partially by luminal geometry and that WSS is related
   to plaque composition.
   Methods and Results-Twenty-seven patients with coronary artery disease
   underwent virtual histology intravascular ultrasound and Doppler
   velocity measurement for computational fluid dynamics modeling for WSS
   calculation in each virtual histology intravascular ultrasound segment
   (N=3581 segments). We assessed the association of WSS with plaque burden
   and distribution and with plaque composition. WSS remained relatively
   constant across the lower 3 quartiles of plaque burden (P=0.08) but
   increased in the highest quartile of plaque burden (P<0.001). Segments
   distal to lesions or within bifurcations were more likely to have low
   WSS (P<0.001). However, the majority of segments distal to lesions
   (80\%) and within bifurcations (89\%) did not exhibit low WSS. After
   adjustment for plaque burden, there was a negative association between
   WSS and percent necrotic core and calcium. For every 10 dynes/cm(2)
   increase in WSS, percent necrotic core decreased by 17\% (P=0.01), and
   percent dense calcium decreased by 17\% (P<0.001). There was no
   significant association between WSS and percent of fibrous or fibrofatty
   plaque components (P=NS).
   Conclusions-In patients with coronary artery disease: (1) Luminal
   geometry predicts calculated WSS only partially, which suggests that
   detailed computational techniques must be used to calculate WSS. (2) Low
   WSS is associated with plaque necrotic core and calcium, independent of
   plaque burden, which suggests a link between WSS and coronary plaque
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{The bone marrow niche for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contains
   different amounts of bone and fat that vary with age and certain
   pathologies. How this dynamic niche environment may affect their
   differentiation potential and/or healing properties for clinical
   applications remains unknown, largely due to the lack of physiologically
   relevant in vitro models. We developed an enabling platform to isolate
   and study effects of signaling interactions between tissue-scale,
   laminated hydrogel modules of multiple cell types in tandem. We applied
   this platform to co- and tri-culture of primary human MSCs, osteoblasts,
   and adipocytes over 18 days in vitro. Each cell type was analyzed
   separately with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and
   histochemistry for several mesenchymal lineage markers. Distinct
   expression dynamics for osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and
   myogenic transcriptional regulators resulted within each cell type
   depending on its culture setting. Incorporating this data into
   multivariate models produced latent identifiers of each emergent cell
   type dependent on its co- or tri-culture setting. Histological staining
   showed sustained triglyceride storage in adipocytes regardless of
   culture condition, but transient alkaline phosphatase activity in both
   osteoblasts and MSCs. Taken together, our results suggest novel emergent
   phenotypes for MSCs, osteoblasts, and adipocytes in bone marrow that are
   dependent on and result in part from paracrine interactions with their
   neighboring cell types.}},

   Taking advantage of the emerging chip multicore processor (CMP)
   technology, this article proposes a generalized framework for
   parallelizing traffic sign detection in a large number of
   high-resolution video log images. Based on an improved contour finding
   and workload identification strategy, task and data parallelism in
   traffic sign detection are fully developed at multiple levels. A
   generalized parallelization framework for dynamic workload scheduling
   using adaptive work-stealing of thread pool and dynamic circular
   lock-free double-ended queue is then proposed. Experimental results on
   14,514 images provided by the Louisiana Department of Transportation
   show that the parallelized traffic sign detection algorithm has great
   potential to improve computation time with a parallel speedup of up to
   18 times on multilevel parallel configurations and different CMP
   platforms while keeping the same accuracy as the serial version.}},

Title = {{Sexual dimorphism in multiple aspects of 3D facial symmetry and

Abstract = {{Accurate measurement of facial sexual dimorphism is useful to
   understanding facial anatomy and specifically how faces influence, and
   have been influenced by, sexual selection. An important facial aspect is
   the display of bilateral symmetry, invoking the need to investigate
   aspects of symmetry and asymmetry separately when examining facial
   shape. Previous studies typically employed landmarks that provided only
   a sparse facial representation, where different landmark choices could
   lead to contrasting outcomes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism is only
   tested as a difference of sample means, which is statistically the same
   as a difference in population location only. Within the framework of
   geometric morphometrics, we partition facial shape, represented in a
   spatially dense way, into patterns of symmetry and asymmetry, following
   a two-factor anova design. Subsequently, we investigate sexual
   dimorphism in symmetry and asymmetry patterns separately, and on
   multiple aspects, by examining (i) population location differences as
   well as differences in population variance-covariance; (ii) scale; and
   (iii) orientation. One important challenge in this approach is the
   proportionally high number of variables to observations necessitating
   the implementation of permutational and computationally feasible
   statistics. In a sample of gender-matched young adults (1825 years) with
   self-reported European ancestry, we found greater variation in male
   faces than in women for all measurements. Statistically significant
   sexual dimorphism was found for the aspect of location in both symmetry
   and asymmetry (directional asymmetry), for the aspect of scale only in
   asymmetry (magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry) and, in contrast, for the
   aspect of orientation only in symmetry. Interesting interplays with
   hypotheses in evolutionary and developmental biology were observed, such
   as the selective nature of the force underpinning sexual dimorphism and
   the genetic independence of the structural patterns of fluctuating
   asymmetry. Additionally, insights into growth patterns of the soft
   tissue envelope of the face and underlying skull structure can also be
   obtained from the results.}},

Abstract = {{A deeper understanding of the composition and organization of
   extracellular matrix molecules in native, healthy meniscus tissue is
   required to fully appreciate the degeneration that occurs in joint
   disease and the intricate environment in which an engineered meniscal
   graft would need to function. In this study, regional variations in the
   tissue-level and pericellular distributions of collagen types I, II and
   VI and the proteoglycans aggrecan, biglycan and decorin were examined in
   the juvenile bovine meniscus. The collagen networks were extensively,
   but not completely, colocalized, with tissue-level organization that
   varied with radial position across the meniscus. Type VI collagen
   exhibited close association with large bundles composed of type I and II
   collagen and, in contrast to type I and II collagen, was further
   concentrated in the pericellular matrix. Aggrecan was detected
   throughout the inner region of the meniscus but was restricted to the
   pericellular matrix and sheaths of collagen bundles in the middle and
   outer regions. The small proteoglycans biglycan and decorin exhibited
   regional variations in staining intensity but were consistently
   localized in the intra- and/or peri-cellular compartments. These results
   provide insight into the complex hierarchy of extracellular matrix
   organization in the meniscus and provide a framework for better
   understanding meniscal degeneration and disease progression and
   evaluating potential repair and regeneration strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural two-point correlation functions (TPCFs) are a well-known
   class of statistical descriptors that can be used for the
   characterization and reconstruction of microstructurally heterogeneous
   media. The core of this study is the presentation and verification of a
   new estimation for the TPCF of an arbitrary phase in a multiphase
   heterogeneous medium based on the composition of the TPCFs for the other
   phases or alternatively other subcomposites. The necessary conditions
   for the new estimation to be a phase-TPCF consisting of the limit
   conditions, slope condition at the origin, triangular inequality and the
   positivity of its spectral density are successfully verified. To
   demonstrate the validity of our proposed estimation, the TPCFs of two
   phases of a three-phase heterogeneous material are evaluated separately
   using their SEM images. Then the proposed composition approach is
   utilized to estimate the TPCF of the third phase, which compares well
   with its TPCF evaluated directly using its SEM image. As a separate
   verification attempt, we applied the proposed estimation to the TPCF of
   a low concentration sample of ZrO2 nanocomposite to estimate the TPCF of
   another ZrO2 nanocomposite of higher concentration. The estimated TPCF
   compares again well with the one evaluated directly from SAXS data.
   Finally, we calculate the effective thermal properties of the same high
   concentration ZrO2 nanocomposite by employing the newly estimated TPCF
   in the strong-contrast relations. The observed agreements make the
   proposed composition technique quite reliable to be applied to similar
   problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{27-35}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis and assessment of risk to civil infrastructure has
   two components: probability of a potentially damaging event and
   consequence of damage, measured in terms of financial or human losses.
   Decision models that have been utilized during the past three decades
   take into account the probabilistic component rationally, but address
   decision-maker attitudes toward consequences and risk only to a limited
   degree. The application of models reflecting these attitudes to
   decisions involving low-probability, high-consequence events that may
   impact civil infrastructure requires a fundamental understanding of risk
   acceptance attitudes and how they affect individual and group choices.
   In particular, the phenomenon of risk aversion may be a significant
   factor in decisions for civil infrastructure exposed to low-probability
   events with severe consequences, such as earthquakes, hurricanes or
   floods. This paper utilizes cumulative prospect theory to investigate
   the role and characteristics of risk-aversion in assurance of structural

Abstract = {{The congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with increased
   leaflet calcification, ascending aortic dilatation, aortic stenosis (AS)
   and regurgitation (AR). Although underlying genetic factors have been
   primarily implicated for these complications, the altered mechanical
   environment of BAVs could potentially accelerate these pathologies. The
   objective of the current study is to characterize BAV hemodynamics in an
   in vitro system. Two BAV models of varying stenosis and jet eccentricity
   and a trileaflet AV (TAV) were constructed from excised porcine AVs.
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments were conducted at
   physiological flow and pressure conditions to characterize fluid
   velocity fields in the aorta and sinus regions, and ensemble averaged
   Reynolds shear stress and 2D turbulent kinetic energy were calculated
   for all models. The dynamics of the BAV and TAV models matched the
   characteristics of these valves which are observed clinically. The
   eccentric and stenotic BAV showed the strongest systolic jet (V = 4.2
   m/s), which impinged on the aortic wall on the non-fused leaflet side,
   causing a strong vortex in the non-fused leaflet sinus. The magnitudes
   of TKE and Reynolds stresses in both BAV models were almost twice as
   large as comparable values for TAV, and these maximum values were
   primarily concentrated around the central jet through the valve orifice.
   The in vitro model described here enables detailed characterization of
   BAV flow characteristics, which is currently challenging in clinical
   practice. This model can prove to be useful in studying the effects of
   altered BAV geometry on fluid dynamics in the valve and ascending aorta.
   These altered flows can be potentially linked to increased calcific
   responses from the valve endothelium in stenotic and eccentric BAVs,
   independent of concomitant genetic factors.}},

Abstract = {{Managing the temperatures and heat transfer in the fuel cell of a solid
   oxide fuel cell (SOFC) gas turbine (GT) hybrid fired on coal syngas
   presents certain challenges over a natural gas based system, in that the
   latter can take advantage of internal reforming to offset heat generated
   in the fuel cell. Three coal based SOFC/GT configuration designs for
   thermal management in the main power block are evaluated using steady
   state numerical simulations developed in ASPEN PLUS. A comparison is
   made on the basis of efficiency, operability issues and component
   integration. To focus on the effects of different power block
   configurations, the analysis assumes a consistent syngas composition in
   each case, and does not explicitly include gasification or syngas
   cleanup. A fuel cell module rated at 240 MW was used as a common basis
   for three different methods. Advantages and difficulties for each
   configuration are identified in the simulations. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This study proposes a spectral domain algorithm to remove the
   deterministic non-periodic trend from a time series using a class of
   fast, sharp and diffusive filters. These filters are principally the
   iterative moving least squares methods weighted using Gaussian windows.
   The responses of the filters expressed in analytic forms are proven to
   be diffusive. If it is a polynomial of finite degree, the embedded trend
   can be decoupled by the filters with specific order and iteration steps.
   The filters' order, transition zone, error tolerance, iteration number
   and smoothing factor are subject to two algebraic equations to form a
   specific class. The operation counts of all filters are slightly larger
   than twice that applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It is
   numerically shown for a given transition zone and tolerance, there is a
   filter generating the shortest error penetration distance among all the
   filters. If either the trend or a spectral band is the main concern,
   there is an optimal strategy to shrink the error penetration distance.
   The numerical results show the filter has better performance than
   several existing methods. In addition, four examples successfully show
   direct applications of the filter's response. (C) 2012 The Franklin

Abstract = {{The effect of typical membrane processing conditions on the structure,
   interfacial morphology, and gas separation performance of MOF/polymer
   nanocomposite membranes is investigated. In particular, the
   ZIF-8/Matrimid (R) nanocomposite membrane system is examined, and it is
   shown that ultrasonication a commonly employed particle dispersion
   method - induces significant changes in the shape, size distribution,
   and structure of ZIF-8 particles suspended in an organic solvent during
   membrane processing. Dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy
   reveal that ZIF-8 nanoparticles undergo substantial Ostwald ripening
   when subjected to high intensity ultrasonication as often required in
   the formation of MOF/polymer nanocomposite membranes. Other
   characterization techniques reveal that the ripened particles exhibit
   lower pore volumes and lower surface areas compared to the as-made
   material. ZIF-8/Matrimid (R) composite membranes fabricated using two
   sonication methods show significant differences in microstructure.
   Permeation measurements show significant enhancement in permeability of
   CO2 and increased CO2/CH4 selectivity in membranes fabricated with
   high-intensity sonication. In contrast, composite membranes prepared
   with low-intensity sonication are found to be defective. A careful
   evaluation of MOF membrane processing conditions, as well as knowledge
   of the properties of the MOF material after these membrane processing
   steps, are necessary to develop reliable processing-structure-property
   relations for MOF-containing membranes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Inflammation and damage promote monocyte adhesion to endothelium and
   cardiovascular disease (CVD). Elevated inflammation and increased
   monocyte-endothelial cell interactions represent the initial stages of
   vascular remodeling associated with a multitude of CVDs. Cathepsins are
   proteases produced by both cell types that degrade elastin and collagen
   in arterial walls, and are upregulated in CVD. We hypothesized that the
   inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and
   monocyte binding would stimulate cathepsins K and V expression and
   activity in endothelial cells that may be responsible for initiating
   local proteolysis during CVD. Confluent human aortic endothelial cells
   were stimulated with TNF alpha or THP-1 monocyte co-cultures, and
   multiplex cathepsin zymography was used to detect changes in levels of
   active cathepsins K, L, S, and V. Direct monocyte-endothelial cell
   co-cultures stimulated with TNF alpha generated maximally observed
   cathepsin K and V activities compared to either cell type alone (n = 3,
   p < 0.05) by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent manner.
   Inhibition of JNK with SP6000125 blocked upregulation of cathepsin K
   activity by 49 \% and cathepsin V by 81 \% in endothelial cells.
   Together, these data show that inflammatory cues and
   monocyte-endothelial cell interactions upregulate cathepsin activity via
   JNK signaling axis and identify a new mechanism to target toward slowing
   the earliest stages of tissue remodeling in CVD.}},

Abstract = {{Cell interactions with their extracellular matrix (ECM)
   microenvironments play a major role in directing cellular processes that
   can drive wound healing and tissue regeneration but, if uncontrolled,
   lead to pathological progression. One such process, epithelial to
   mesenchymal transition (EMT), if finely controlled could have
   significant potential in regenerative medicine approaches. Despite
   recent findings that highlight the influence of biochemical and
   mechanical properties of the ECM on EMT, it is still unclear how these
   two orthogonal cues act synergistically to control epithelial cell
   phenotype. Here, we cultured lung epithelial cells on combinations of
   different mutants of fibronectin's cell binding domain that
   preferentially engage specific integrins and substrates of varying
   stiffness. Our results suggest that while stiff substrates induce
   spontaneous EMT, this response can be overcome by with fragments of
   fibronectin that support a3 and a5 integrin engagement. Furthermore, we
   found that substrate-induced EMT correlates with transforming growth
   factor beta activation by resident epithelial cells and is dependent on
   Rho/ROCK signaling. Suppressing cell-contractility was sufficient to
   maintain an epithelial phenotype. Our results suggest that
   integrin-specific engagement of fibronectin adhesive domains and the
   mechanics of the ECM act synergistically to direct EMT.(C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to further develop previously reported
   mechanistic predictive model that simulates boron removal in full-scale
   seawater reverse osmosis (RO) desalination processes to take into
   account the effect of membrane fouling. Decrease of boron removal and
   reduction in water production rate by membrane fouling due to enhanced
   concentration polarization were simulated as a decrease in solute mass
   transfer coefficient in boundary layer on membrane surface. Various
   design and operating options under fouling condition were examined
   including single-versus double-pass configurations, different number of
   RO elements per vessel, use of RO membranes with enhanced boron
   rejection, and pH adjustment. These options were quantitatively compared
   by normalizing the performance of the system in terms of E-min, the
   minimum energy costs per product water. Simulation results suggested
   that most viable options to enhance boron rejection among those tested
   in this study include: i) minimizing fouling, ii) exchanging the
   existing SWRO elements to boron-specific ones, and iii) increasing pH in
   the second pass. The model developed in this study is expected to help
   design and optimization of the RO processes to achieve the target boron
   removal at target water recovery under realistic conditions where
   membrane fouling occurs during operation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Innovative printing technology enables fine feature deposition (below 10
   mu m) of electronic materials onto low-temperature, non-planar
   substrates without masks. This could be a promising technology to meet
   the requirements of present and future microelectronic systems. Silver
   nanoparticles (NP) ink is widely used for printed electronics; however,
   its electrical conductivity is low compared to bulk materials. In order
   to improve the electrical conductivity of printed tracks for the aerosol
   printing technique, we developed a novel carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/silver
   NP ink by mechanical stirring and sonication. The produced sample inks
   with different concentration of CNTs that were printed with a Maskless
   Mesoscale Material Deposition ((MD)-D-3) Aerosol Jet (R) printing
   system. The dimensions of the printed lines were determined by atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) and the electrical resistivity was evaluated
   using the four-point method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used
   to characterize the morphology of printed tracks. We found that the CNTs
   bridged the defects in some printed silver lines, thereby lowering the
   electrical resistivity by 38\%. However, no further improvements were
   observed with a higher CNT concentration in the silver NP ink samples.
   We hypothesize that CNT bridges connects the defects thus decreasing the
   resistivity of printed silver lines when CNT concentration is under the
   percolation level. However, due to aggregation of CNTs when it is above
   a concentration threshold, the resistivity of printed silver lines stops
   decreasing and even increases because of Schottky barrier effect. (C)

Abstract = {{Generally, the derivation of an inventory policy requires the knowledge
   of the underlying demand distribution. Unfortunately, in many settings
   demand is not completely observable in a direct way or inventory records
   may be inaccurate. A variety of factors, including the potential
   inaccuracy of inventory records, motivate managers to seek replenishment
   policies where the inventory is reviewed periodically and a fixed
   quantity Q is ordered once the inventory level is found to be under a
   certain point r. To apply such a policy, however, firms must derive the
   values r and Q without a clear understanding of the demand distribution.
   We develop estimators of the first two moments of the (periodic) demand
   by means of renewal theoretical concepts and a regression-based method,
   and use these estimators in conjunction with the Power Approximation
   (PA) method of Ehrhardt and Mosier (1984) to obtain an (r, Q)
   replenishment policy. The proposed methodology is robust and easy to
   code into a spreadsheet application. A series of numerical studies are
   carried out to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the estimators,
   and to investigate the impact of the estimation on the optimality of the
   inventory policies. Our experiments indicate that the proposed (r, Q)
   policy is very close, with regard to the expected total cost per period,
   to the (s, S) policy obtained via the PA method when the demand process
   is fully observable and inventory records are accurate. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new magnetic wall-climbing car as a mobile sensor
   node for health monitoring and dynamic testing of large civil

   electromagnetically driven compliant beam connecting the axles not only
   offers an effective means to negotiate corners when maneuvering on
   ferromagnetic surfaces, but also serves as a sensor attachment device.
   Specifically, this paper presents the design concept of a novel magnetic
   flexonic mobile node incorporating a compliant beam and permanent
   magnets, and a 2-D model for simulating the deformed shape of the
   compliant beam. Simulation results show that there exist consistent
   relations between input/output displacements and rotation angle for
   control implementation in sensor attachment and corner negotiation
   regardless of gravity direction or the critical force for buckling.
   Experiment results are also provided to validate the theoretical model

Abstract = {{A multisensor approach that capitalizes on the existing magnetic fields
   in permanent-magnet-based actuators to achieve unobtrusive high-accuracy
   position sensing is presented. As magnetic-field models are position
   dependent, their inverse problems are often highly nonlinear with
   nonunique solution. This paper illustrates the principle and motivation
   for a multisensor approach using the concepts of parametric spaces to
   take advantage of multiple independent sensor measurements to induce a
   unique field-position correspondence in multisource fields. A direct
   mapping approach using supervised back-propagation artificial neural
   networks is utilized to attain positional information from distributed
   field measurements. Using an experimental rotary setup containing 24
   magnetic sources, the measurements obtained from a network of magnetic
   Hall-effect sensors are statistically characterized and used to
   investigate the factors affecting the accuracy of the sensing system. Of
   particular interest are the combined effects of the number and spatial
   configuration of the sensors. Two types of sensor arrangement are
   investigated: an in-phase configuration consisting of evenly spaced
   sensors and a staggered configuration where unevenly spaced sensors
   concurrently measure different points of a periodic field. Using a
   network of 24 single-axis Hall-effect sensors in staggered
   configuration, the system is capable of achieving nanodegree angular
   positional accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Complex engineering systems, such as aircraft, industrial processes, and
   transportation systems, are experiencing a paradigm shift in the way
   they are operated and maintained. Instead of traditional scheduled or
   breakdown maintenance practices, they are maintained on the basis of
   their current state/condition. Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) is
   becoming the preferred practice since it improves significantly the
   reliability, safety and availability of these critical systems. CBM
   enabling technologies include sensing and monitoring, information
   processing, fault diagnosis and failure prognosis algorithms that are
   capable of detecting accurately and in a timely manner incipient
   failures and predicting the remaining useful life of failing components.
   If such technologies are to be implemented on-line and in real-time, it
   is essential that an integrating system architecture be developed that
   possesses features of modularity, flexibility and interoperability while
   exhibiting attributes of computational efficiency for both on-line and
   off-line applications. This paper presents a .NET framework as the
   integrating software platform linking all constituent modules of the
   fault diagnosis and failure prognosis architecture. The inherent
   characteristics of the NET framework provide the proposed system with a
   generic architecture for fault diagnosis and failure prognosis for a
   variety of applications. Functioning as data processing, feature
   extraction, fault diagnosis and failure prognosis, the corresponding
   modules in the system are built as NET components that are developed
   separately and independently in any of the NET languages. With the use
   of Bayesian estimation theory, a generic particle-filtering-based
   framework is integrated in the system for fault diagnosis and failure
   prognosis. The system is tested in two different applications bearing
   spalling fault diagnosis and failure prognosis and brushless DC motor
   turn-to-turn winding fault diagnosis. The results suggest that the
   system is capable of meeting performance requirements specified by both
   the developer and the user for a variety of engineering systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Rolling-element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery.
   It is important to accurately predict in real-time the health condition
   of bearings so that maintenance practices can be scheduled to avoid
   malfunctions or even catastrophic failures. In this paper, an Interval
   Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (IT2FNN) is proposed to perform
   multi-step-ahead condition prediction of faulty bearings. Since the
   IT2FNN defines an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system in the form of a
   multi-layer neural network, it can integrate the merits of each, such as
   fuzzy reasoning to handle uncertainties and neural networks to learn
   from data. The interval type-2 fuzzy linguistic process in the IT2FNN
   enables the system to handle prediction uncertainties, since the type-2
   fuzzy sets are such sets whose membership grades are type-1 fuzzy sets
   that can be used in failure prediction due to the difficult
   determination of an exact membership function for a fuzzy set. Noisy
   data of faulty bearings are used to validate the proposed predictor,
   whose performance is compared with that of a prevalent type-1 condition
   predictor called Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The
   results show that better prediction accuracy can be achieved via the
   IT2FNN. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a neurodynamic approach to model predictive
   control (MPC) of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems based on two
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The echo state network (ESN) and
   simplified dual network (SDN) are adopted for system identification and
   dynamic optimization, respectively. First, the unknown nonlinear system
   is identified based on the ESN with input-output training and testing
   samples. Then, the resulting nonconvex optimization problem associated
   with nonlinear MPC is decomposed via Taylor expansion. To estimate the
   higher order unknown term resulted from the decomposition, an online
   supervised learning algorithm is developed. Next, the SDN is applied for
   solving the relaxed convex optimization problem to compute the optimal
   control actions over the predicted horizon. Simulation results are
   provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the
   proposed approach. The proposed RNN-based approach has many desirable
   properties such as global convergence and low complexity. It is shown
   that the RNN-based nonlinear MPC scheme is effective and potentially
   suitable for real-time MPC implementation in many applications.}},

Abstract = {{The use of microcantilevers as (bio)chemical sensors usually involves
   the application of a chemically sensitive layer. The coated device
   operates either in a static bending regime or in a dynamic flexural

   both the static and the dynamic modes, others may suffer from certain
   shortcomings depending on the type of coating, the medium of operation
   and the sensing application. Such shortcomings include lack of
   selectivity and reversibility of the sensitive coating and a reduced
   quality factor due to the surrounding medium. In particular, the
   performance of microcantilevers excited in their standard out-of-plane
   dynamic mode drastically decreases in viscous liquid media. Moreover,
   the responses of coated cantilevers operating in the static bending mode
   are often difficult to interpret. To resolve these performance issues,
   the following emerging unconventional uses of microcantilevers are
   reviewed in this paper: (1) dynamic-mode operation without using a
   sensitive coating, (2) the use of in-plane vibration modes (both
   flexural and longitudinal) in liquid media, and (3) incorporation of
   viscoelastic effects in the coatings in the static mode of operation.
   The advantages and drawbacks of these atypical uses of microcantilevers
   for chemical sensing in gas and liquid environments are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{The intrinsic electrical properties of thin organic layers/semiconductor
   interfaces are challenging to probe because of large tunneling currents
   through the molecular layer and damage during device fabrication. We
   present here a method to protect the interface with an Al2O3 layer
   gently deposited on top using atomic layer deposition. The resulting
   two-layered gate stack can be characterized with capacitance and
   conductance measurements. The protected interface shows an inherent high
   quality with low D-it, less than 2 x 10(11) cm(-2) eV(-1) for n-type
   Si(111) surface, best measured using mercury probe. The additional
   procedures required to fabricate MOS capacitors lead to an increase in
   D-it. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Many-body perturbation theory in the G(0)W(0) approximation is an
   increasingly popular tool for calculating electron removal energies and
   fundamental gaps for molecules and solids. However, the predictive power
   of G(0)W(0) is limited by its sensitivity to the density functional
   theory (DFT) starting point. We introduce a nonempirical scheme, which
   allows us to find a reliable DFT starting point for G(0)W(0)
   calculations. This is achieved by adapting the amount of Hartree-Fock
   exchange in a hybrid DFT functional. The G(0)W(0) spectra resulting from
   this starting point reliably predict experimental photoelectron spectra
   for a test set of 13 typical organic semiconductor molecules.}},

Abstract = {{We report an experimental investigation of the adsorption properties of
   two important small-pore metal-organic framework (MOF) materials
   recently identified for gas separation applications, through the
   development and use of a high-pressure/high-temperature quartz crystal
   microbalance (QCM) device. In particular, we characterize in detail the
   CO2, CH4, and N-2 adsorption characteristics of the MOFs
   Cu(4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bisbenzoate)(1.5) (referred to as
   Cu-hfipbb) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90). We first
   describe the construction of a QCM-based adsorption measurement
   apparatus. Single-component adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N-2 in
   the two MOFs were then measured at temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 C
   and pressures ranging from 0.3 to 110 psi. In both materials, the order
   of adsorption strength is CO2 > CH4 > N-2. We find that adsorption in
   the 1-D channels of Cu-hfipbb can be well described by a single-site
   Langmuir model. On the other hand, adsorption in ZIF-90 follows a more
   complex behavior, commensurate with its pore structure consisting of
   large porous cages connected in three dimensions by small windows. The
   nongravimetric QCM-based measurement techniques are shown to be a
   valuable microanalytical tool for the study of molecular adsorption in
   MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccine delivery
   to the skin by vaccine-coated microneedles; however there is little
   information on the effects of adjuvants using this approach for
   vaccination. Here we investigate the use of TLR ligands as adjuvants
   with skin-based delivery of influenza subunit vaccine. BALB/c mice
   received 1 mu g of monovalent H1N1 subunit vaccine alone or with 1 mu g
   of imiquimod or poly(I:C) individually or in combination via coated
   microneedle patches inserted into the skin. Poly(I:C) adjuvanted subunit
   influenza vaccine induced similar antigen-specific immune responses
   compared to vaccine alone when delivered to the skin by microneedles.
   However, imiquimod-adjuvanted vaccine elicited higher levels of serum
   IgG2a antibodies and increased hemagglutination inhibition titers
   compared to vaccine alone, suggesting enhanced induction of functional
   antibodies. In addition, imiquimod-adjuvanted vaccine induced a robust
   IFN-gamma cellular response. These responses correlated with improved
   protection compared to influenza subunit vaccine alone, as well as
   reduced viral replication and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
   in the lungs. The finding that microneedle delivery of imiquimod with
   influenza subunit vaccine induces improved immune responses compared to
   vaccine alone supports the use of TLR7 ligands as adjuvants for
   skin-based influenza vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{The anisotropy inherent to many planar organic molecules leads to a high
   sensitivity of various fundamental processes to the orientation of
   molecules within films and at heterojunctions. Such processes include
   absorption, charge and exciton transport, energy levels, and charge
   transfer, all of which are critical to organic solar cell operation.
   Here,an in-depth study of bilayer cells consisting of a donor/acceptor
   interface between zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and fullerene (C60) is
   conducted and devices with the typically deposited standing up (edge-on)
   orientation are compared to those with ZnPc lying flat (face-on). The
   face-on ZnPc-based device allows for an increase in all solar cell
   parameters, substantially increasing power conversion efficiency from
   1.5\% to 2.8\%. Spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements reveal a
   >50\% increase in ZnPc signal, from which only 12\% is accounted for by
   the increase in absorption associated with the face-on orientation. The
   increase in internal quantum efficiency is accounted for via an improved
   charge transfer. The results of this study indicate that proper
   consideration of the orientation between donor and acceptor needs to be
   taken in order to fully optimize the numerous processes required for
   photovoltaic energy conversion.}},

Title = {{Deformation and surface uplift associated with serpentinization at
   mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{We employ the classical problem of an inclusion in an elastic half-space
   to model effects of sub-surface serpentinization on crustal deformation,
   change of stress state, and surface uplift. At the TAG hydrothermal
   field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the model suggests that an anomalous
   salient 3 km in diameter and 100 m high that projects 3.5 km westward
   from the east valley wall may have resulted from a relatively
   deep-seated well-serpentinized body exhibiting transformational strain.
   The associated large strains would likely result in sub-surface
   fracturing or faulting, but surface uplift may be relatively insensitive
   to the exact depth and shape of the serpentinized region.
   Serpentinization of a region beneath the footwall of the TAG detachment
   fault will tend to promote slip along some overlying normal faults,
   which may then enhance fluid pathways to the deeper crust to continue
   the serpentinization process. Our solution for the Miyazaki Plain above
   the Kyushu-Palau subduction zone in SW Japan explains the observed
   uplift of approximate to 120 m. The small transformational strains
   associated with serpentinization in this region may promote thrust-type
   events in the aseismic slip zone near the upper boundary of the
   subducting Philippine Sea Plate as well as intraplate earthquakes
   associated with normal faulting. The rate of serpentinization needed to
   produce the observed uplift at the Miyazaki Plain is significantly
   greater than that needed at TAG, though significantly smaller on per
   unit volume basis. Thermal effects of serpentinization in both regions
   appear to be small, but uplift data provide an additional constraint on
   inferring serpentinization from geological and seismological
   observations.}},

   an injection-locked oscillator (ILO) was implemented using a
   cross-coupled design with fundamental frequency injection at the device
   drains. The VCO exhibits an output power of 8.2 dBm and a peak
   efficiency of 15.64\%. The tuneable range of the VCO is 45.5-47.5 GHz.
   The measured phase noise is 2106.51 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset. This VCO
   achieves the highest reported efficiency and output power for
   silicon-based monolithic millimetrewave oscillators to the best of the
   authors' knowledge. The ILO exhibits a locking range of approximately 3
   GHz for a 210 dBm injected signal and an output power of 5.2 dBm for the

Abstract = {{A biosensor based on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) for detection of
   toxic chemicals in water was developed. SOB are acidophilic
   microorganisms that get their energy through the oxidation of reduced
   sulfur compounds in the presence of oxygen to produce sulfuric acid. The
   reaction results in an increase in electrical conductivity (EC) and a
   decrease in pH. The bioassay is based on the inhibition of SOB in the
   presence of toxic chemicals by measuring changes in EC and pH. The
   effect of different physical factors such as HRT, inorganic sulfur (S
   degrees) particle size, and temperature on detection of Cr6+ was
   studied. The detection of Cr6+ (50 ppb) was improved by decreasing the
   hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 30 to 10 mm and increasing S degrees
   particle size from 1 to 4.75 mm. Detection time was shorter at 30
   degrees C compared to 45 degrees C and the SOB were active over a wide
   range of temperatures with a maximum temperature for growth at 45
   degrees C. This novel biosensor is simple, highly sensitive to low Cr6+
   concentrations (50 ppb), and also minimizes detection time. The present
   findings can be applied to the proper continuous screening of water
   ecosystem toxicity.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Essentially any behavior in simple and complex animals depends on
   neuronal network function. Currently, the best-defined system to study
   neuronal circuits is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, as the
   connectivity of its 302 neurons is exactly known. Individual neurons can
   be activated by photostimulation of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) using blue
   light, allowing to directly probe the importance of a particular neuron
   for the respective behavioral output of the network under study. In
   analogy, other excitable cells can be inhibited by expressing
   Halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis (NpHR) and subsequent
   illumination with yellow light. However, inhibiting C. elegans neurons
   using NpHR is difficult. Recently, proton pumps from various sources
   were established as valuable alternative hyperpolarizers. Here we show
   that archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense and a proton
   pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can be utilized to
   effectively inhibit excitable cells in C. elegans. Arch is the most
   powerful hyperpolarizer when illuminated with yellow or green light
   while the action spectrum of Mac is more blue-shifted, as analyzed by
   light-evoked behaviors and electrophysiology. This allows these tools to
   be combined in various ways with ChR2 to analyze different subsets of
   neurons within a circuit. We exemplify this by means of the polymodal
   aversive sensory ASH neurons, and the downstream command interneurons to
   which ASH neurons signal to trigger a reversal followed by a directional
   turn. Photostimulating ASH and subsequently inhibiting command
   interneurons using two-color illumination of different body segments,
   allows investigating temporal aspects of signaling downstream of ASH.}},

Abstract = {{Interregional connections of the brain measured with diffusion
   tractography can be used to infer valuable information regarding both
   brain structure and function. However, different tractography algorithms
   can generate networks that exhibit different characteristics, resulting
   in poor reproducibility across studies. Therefore, it is important to
   benchmark different tractography algorithms to quantitatively assess
   their performance. Here we systematically evaluated a newly introduced
   tracking algorithm, global tractography, to derive anatomical brain
   networks in a fiber phantom, 2 post-mortem macaque brains, and 20 living
   humans, and compared the results with an established local tracking
   algorithm. Our results demonstrated that global tractography accurately
   characterized the phantom network in terms of graph-theoretic measures,
   and significantly outperformed the local tracking approach. Results in
   brain tissues (post-mortem macaques and in vivo humans), however, showed
   that although the performance of global tractography demonstrated a
   trend of improvement, the results were not vastly different than that of
   local tractography, possibly resulting from the increased fiber
   complexity of real tissues. When using macaque tracer-derived
   connections as the ground truth, we found that both global and local
   algorithms generated non-random patterns of false negative and false
   positive connections that were probably related to specific fiber
   systems and largely independent of the tractography algorithm or tissue
   type (post-mortem vs. in vivo) used in the current study. Moreover, a
   close examination of the transcallosal motor connections, reconstructed
   via either global or local tractography, demonstrated that the lateral
   transcallosal fibers in humans and macaques did not exhibit the denser
   homotopic connections found in primate tracer studies, indicating the
   need for more robust brain mapping techniques based on diffusion MRI
   data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a new acoustic nonlinearity parameter beta(T). It
   is shown that beta(T) is associated with the interaction between a
   longitudinal wave and a shear wave in isotropic elastic solids with
   quadratic nonlinearity. Experimental measurements are conducted to
   demonstrate that the collinear wave mixing technique is capable of
   measuring beta(T) nondestructively. Further, it is shown that beta(T) is
   well-correlated with the plastic deformation in Al-6061 alloys. These
   results indicate that collinear wave mixing is a promising method for
   nondestructive assessment of plastic deformation, and possibly, fatigue
   damage in metallic materials. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   material recovered from 7.2 GPa closely resembled that for the sample
   during initial compression at similar to 5.5 GPa. The PDFs indicated
   that the amorphization, densification, and relaxation of the amorphous

Title = {{Effect of crystallographic orientation on ductile scribing of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of crystallographic orientation on
   the mode of material removal (ductile vs. brittle) in diamond scribing
   of single crystal silicon (c-Si) and offers an explanation for the
   observed effects in terms of the combined role of phase transformation
   and slip generation. Single-point diamond scribing tests are performed
   on (1 1 1), (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) crystallographic planes in the < 1 1 1
   >, < 1 1 0 >, < 1 0 0 > and < 1 1 2 > directions. In all cases, the
   material removal mechanism transitions from ductile-to-brittle fracture
   as the depth of scribing increases. The critical depth of
   ductile-to-brittle transition is found to vary considerably. Scribing on
   the (0 0 1) Si surface exhibits significant brittle fracture, while
   ductile removal is achieved on the (1 1 1) plane at scribing depths
   greater than 1 mu m. In addition, on a given crystallographic plane,
   brittle fracture is found to always dominate in the (1 0 0) direction
   compared to the (1 1 1) direction. These results are explained by the
   roles of phase transformation and slip generation in the material. For a
   given scribing depth, orientations for which slip systems are easily
   activated require higher load and therefore produce higher tensile
   stress in the material, which leads to increased brittle fracture. This
   explanation is found to be consistent with the experimental data
   presented in this paper and those available in literature. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Mukherjee {[}Mukherjee, J., 2011. On approximating Euclidean metrics by

   Lett. 32,824-831] recently introduced a class of distance functions
   called weighted t-cost distances that generalize m-neighbor, octagonal,
   and t-cost distances. He proved that weighted t-cost distances form a
   family of metrics and derived an approximation for the Euclidean norm in
   Z(n). In this note we compare this approximation to two previously
   proposed Euclidean norm approximations and demonstrate that the
   empirical average errors given by Mukherjee are significantly optimistic
   in R-n. We also propose a simple normalization scheme that improves the
   accuracy of his approximation substantially with respect to both average
   and maximum relative errors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide band gap semiconducting material and has been
   considered as an alternative material in dye-sensitized solar cell

   conversion efficiency. In this work, the way of hydrothermally grown ZnO
   NT arrays on the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate is presented by
   utilizing a systematic study. By adjusting the hydrothermal reaction
   parameters, we attained the optimizing reaction conditions on the ITO
   substrate. Moreover, ZnO NT arrays are introduced as a photoanode on
   various substrates, such as optical fiber and ITO glass, for DSSCs
   applications. We took the contrast test with conversion efficiency of
   the DSSC based on ZnO NT arrays versus ZnO nanowire arrays on the ITO
   substrate, which the DSSC based on ZnO NT arrays shows significantly
   enhanced power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the conversion
   efficiency of DSSC based on the ZnO NT arrays grown on an optical fiber

   model to determine the H-2 permeabilities of three hollow fibers
   (composite, polyester, and polypropylene) commonly used in the H-2-based
   membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR). The H-2 permeabilities spanned a wide
   range: 1.6 x 10(-6), 1.8 x 10(-7), and 6.6 x 10(-8) m(3) H-2 @ standard
   temperature and pressure m membrane thickness/m(2) hollow fiber surface
   area d bar for the composite, polypropylene, and polyester hollow
   fibers, respectively; this represents a ratio of the maximum H-2 flux
   for composite:polypropylene:polyester hollow fibers = 32:3.3:1. The H-2
   permeabilities were then used to correlate hollow-fiber type to
   contaminant-removal flux in previous MBfR experiments. Only the
   experiments with composite hollow fibers were not routinely limited by
   H-2 delivery, although fouling by mineral precipitates lowered the H-2
   flux in some cases. Since existing contaminant-removal data for the
   polyester hollow fibers were not adequate, we did special experiments to
   investigate the effect of H-2 pressure on contaminant removal in the
   MBfR with the polyester hollow fibers. We confirmed that this hollow
   fiber was operated at its maximum H-2-delivery capacity based on its H-2
   permeability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of metal nucleation on graphene is essential for
   promising future applications, especially of magnetic metals which can
   be used in spintronics or computer storage media. A common method to
   study the grown morphology is to measure the nucleated island density n
   as a function of growth parameters. Surprisingly, the growth of Fe on
   graphene is found to be unusual because it does not follow classical
   nucleation: n is unexpectedtly high, it increases continuously with the
   deposited amount theta and shows no temperature dependence. These
   unusual results indicate the presence of long range repulsive

Abstract = {{The structural and cooperative catalytic characteristics of acid and
   base co-functionalized mesoporous silica synthesized through grafting
   and co-condensation methods are investigated. It is shown that
   incorporation of the mutually reactive amine and carboxylic acid
   functional groups is aided by a protecting group in the grafting method.
   Using a thermally cleavable protecting group on the carboxylic acid
   organosilane, the differential effect of silanol removal and acid group
   functionalization on catalytic activity is studied. For samples prepared
   here by both the co-condensation and grafting procedures, the removal of
   silanols and the introduction of the carboxylic acid has a negative
   impact on activity of the catalyst in aldol condensations under the
   conditions used here. These results demonstrate that a weaker Bronsted
   acid silanol is more effective in cooperatively catalyzing the aldol
   condensation in combination with an amine base than the stronger
   carboxylic acid for all the materials prepared in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are promising materials for
   energy efficient separations of light gases. In this work, we report a
   detailed microscopic study of carbon dioxide and methane self-diffusion
   in three CMS membrane derived from 6FDA/BPDA(1:1)-DAM and Matrimid
   polymers. In addition to diffusion of one-component sorbates, diffusion
   of a carbon dioxide/methane mixture was investigated. Self-diffusion
   studies were performed by the multinuclear (i.e., H-1 and C-13) pulsed
   field gradient (PFG) NMR technique which combines the advantages of high
   field (17.6 T) NMR and high magnetic field gradients (up to 30 T/m).
   Diffusion measurements were carried out at different temperatures and
   for a broad range of the root-mean-square displacements of gas molecules
   inside the membranes. The diffusion data obtained from PFG NMR are
   compared with the corresponding results of membrane permeation
   measurements reported previously for the same membrane types. The
   observed differences between the transport diffusivities and
   self-diffusion coefficients of carbon dioxide and methane are discussed.}},

Title = {{Estimation of dynamic flux profiles from metabolic time series data}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Advances in modern high-throughput techniques of molecular
   biology have enabled top-down approaches for the estimation of parameter
   values in metabolic systems, based on time series data. Special among
   them is the recent method of dynamic flux estimation (DFE), which uses
   such data not only for parameter estimation but also for the
   identification of functional forms of the processes governing a
   metabolic system. DFE furthermore provides diagnostic tools for the
   evaluation of model validity and of the quality of a model fit beyond
   residual errors. Unfortunately, DFE works only when the data are more or
   less complete and the system contains as many independent fluxes as
   metabolites. These drawbacks may be ameliorated with other types of
   estimation and information. However, such supplementations incur their
   own limitations. In particular, assumptions must be made regarding the
   functional forms of some processes and detailed kinetic information must
   be available, in addition to the time series data.
   Results: The authors propose here a systematic approach that supplements
   DFE and overcomes some of its shortcomings. Like DFE, the approach is
   model-free and requires only minimal assumptions. If sufficient time
   series data are available, the approach allows the determination of a
   subset of fluxes that enables the subsequent applicability of DFE to the
   rest of the flux system. The authors demonstrate the procedure with
   three artificial pathway systems exhibiting distinct characteristics and
   with actual data of the trehalose pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the proposed method
   successfully complements DFE under various situations and without a
   priori assumptions regarding the model representation. The proposed
   method also permits an examination of whether at all, to what degree, or
   within what range the available time series data can be validly
   represented in a particular functional format of a flux within a pathway
   system. Based on these results, further experiments may be designed to
   generate data points that genuinely add new information to the structure
   identification and parameter estimation tasks at hand.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the facile fabrication of efficient porous alumina
   membrane-based SERS substrates that avoid the cumbersome stages of
   chemical surface modification of the pores and premixing/infiltration of
   nanoparticles with analytes. The design relies on higher light
   transmission through the SERS substrates by widening the cylindrical
   pore diameter to 355 nm and in situ growth of uniform silver
   nanoparticles on the inner walls. Electromagnetic simulations confirm
   that the interaction of excitation light with the nanoparticles along
   the pore walls can be maximized in such a membrane when the
   nanoparticles are placed within the first 14 mu m of the pore depth. For
   common benchmark Raman analytes such as benzenethiol and Rhodamine 6G,
   nanomolar detection limits are readily obtained without any additional
   chemical surface functionalization and/or additional premixing and
   preconcentration of metal nanoparticles and analytes. Moreover, a high
   enhancement of 10(6) and a micromolar detection limit are achieved for
   nonresonant, Raman-stealthy perchloric acid molecules. Quantum
   mechanical calculations of perchloric acid bound to nanostructured
   silver clusters with different sizes and binding sites suggest that the
   maximum chemical enhancement is achieved for molecules located at the
   tips of the (111) planes of silver lattices, which are abundantly
   available on the nanoparticles grown in this study.}},

Abstract = {{The CO2 adsorption characteristics of prototypical
   poly(ethyleneimine)/silica composite adsorbents can be drastically
   enhanced by altering the acid/base properties of the oxide support via
   incorporation of Zr into the silica support. Introduction of an optimal
   amount of Zr resulted in a significant improvement in the CO2 capacity
   and amine efficiency under dilute (simulated flue gas) and ultradilute
   (simulated ambient air) conditions. Adsorption experiments combined with
   detailed characterization by thermogravimetric analysis,
   temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ FT-IR spectroscopy
   clearly demonstrate a stabilizing effect of amphoteric Zr sites that
   enhances the adsorbent capacity, regenerability, and stability over
   continued recycling. It is suggested that the important role of the
   surface properties of the oxide support in these polymer/oxide composite
   adsorbents has been largely overlooked and that the properties may be
   even further enhanced in the future by tuning the acid/base properties
   of the support.}},

Abstract = {{The detrimental effects of hydrogen and helium on structural materials
   undergoing irradiation are well documented, if not well understood.
   There is experimental evidence to suggest that a synergistic effect
   between the two elements exists, which results in increased damage when
   both are present. This situation is expected in the next generation of
   fusion and fission reactors, so a fundamental understanding of these
   synergistic interactions is needed to predict materials performance. We
   perform atomistic simulations of hydrogen and helium bubbles in
   body-centered cubic iron to determine the mechanism behind this effect.
   We first develop an interatomic potential suitable for describing the
   interactions between hydrogen and helium. Through analysis of the
   energetics and structure of these bubbles, we explain the observed
   synergy as a consequence of bubble growth through helium induced loop
   punching, aided by the presence of hydrogen, instead of as a direct
   interaction between hydrogen and helium. The hydrogen benefits from an
   increased area of free surface on which to bind.}},

Abstract = {{To describe the aggregation kinetics of nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous
   dispersions, a new equation for predicting the attachment efficiency is
   presented. The rationale is that at nanoscale, random kinetic motion may
   supersede the role of interaction energy in governing the aggregation
   kinetics of NPs, and aggregation could occur exclusively among the
   fraction of NPs with the minimum kinetic energy that exceeds the
   interaction energy barrier (E-b). To justify this rationale, we examined
   the evolution of particle size distribution (PSD) and frequency
   distribution during aggregation, and further derived the new equation of
   attachment efficiency on the basis of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
   and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The new equation was
   evaluated through aggregation experiments with CeO2 NPs using
   time-resolved-dynamic light scattering (TR-DLS). Our results show that
   the prediction of the attachment efficiencies agreed remarkably well
   with experimental data and also correctly described the effects of ionic
   strength, natural organic matter (NOM), and temperature on attachment
   efficiency. Furthermore, the new equation was used to describe the
   attachment efficiencies of different types of engineered NPs selected
   from the literature and most of the fits showed good agreement with the
   inverse stability ratios (1/W) and experimentally derived results,
   although some minor discrepancies were present. Overall, the new
   equation provides an alternative theoretical approach in addition to 1/W
   for predicting attachment efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The development of energy-sustainable and energy-efficient economy
   depends on the ability to produce low-cost high-performance renewable
   materials for electrical energy storage devices. The electrical double
   layer capacitors (EDLCs) with nanostructured activated carbon (AC)
   electrodes from natural precursors have attracted considerable attention
   due to their great cycle stability, combined with moderate cost and
   attractive overall performance. Such ACs offer high specific surface
   area, high electrical conductivity, relatively low price, easy and
   environmental friendly production in large quantities. The recent
   developments in the synthesis of such AC materials allow for the greatly
   enhanced specific capacitance in a wide range of electrolytes. This
   review provides a summary of a recent research progress in synthesis and
   understanding the critical structure-property relationships for
   nanostructured ACs and highlights the trends for the future developments
   of ACs for EDLC applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microelectronic control of drug delivery devices enables precise
   management of drug delivery profiles. Iontophoresis patches offer
   microelectronic control over delivery in a noninvasive manner, but these
   are limited to the administration of relatively small molecules at small
   doses. Infusion pumps are widely used for delivery of insulin and other
   drugs; however, they require an invasive catheter that many patients
   find inconvenient and can be a site of infection. Implanted pumps avoid
   these problems, but they require long-term commitment associated with
   surgical implantation. An alternative is an implanted microchip
   containing many protected reservoirs filled with drug powder that is
   selectively released under microelectronic control. This device offers
   the promise of long-term drug stability in the solid state and precise
   digital drug dosing. Building on more than 10 years of preclinical
   studies, this wirelessly controlled microchip technology recently
   underwent a first-in-human clinical study. The microchip was implanted
   subcutaneously in the abdomen of eight female patients with
   osteoporosis. A remote operator was able to establish a wireless link
   with the microchip to program the schedule of human parathyroid hormone
   dosing from the device. This study showed that the wireless microchips
   produced pharmacokinetics similar to those from subcutaneous injections
   of the drug and produced less variable drug levels in the blood. There
   were also no toxic or adverse events due to the microchip or drug. This
   study represents an important step towards more widespread use of
   microelectronic control of drug delivery to improve pharmaceutical
   therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Vision trackers have been proposed as a promising alternative for
   tracking at large-scale, congested construction sites. They provide the
   location of a large number of entities in a camera view across frames.
   However, vision trackers provide only two-dimensional (2D) pixel
   coordinates, which are not adequate for construction applications. This
   paper proposes and validates a method that overcomes this limitation by
   employing stereo cameras and converting 2D pixel coordinates to
   three-dimensional (3D) metric coordinates. The proposed method consists
   of four steps: camera calibration, camera pose estimation, 2D tracking,
   and triangulation. Given that the method employs fixed, calibrated
   stereo cameras with a long baseline, appropriate algorithms are selected
   for each step. Once the first two steps reveal camera system parameters,
   the third step determines 2D pixel coordinates of entities in subsequent
   frames. The 2D coordinates are triangulated on the basis of the camera
   system parameters to obtain 3D coordinates. The methodology presented in
   this paper has been implemented and tested with data collected from a
   construction site. The results demonstrate the suitability of this
   method for on-site tracking purposes. DOI:

Abstract = {{Source localization by matched-field processing (MFP) generally involves
   solving a number of computationally intensive partial differential
   equations. This paper introduces a technique that mitigates this
   computational workload by ``compressing{''} these computations. Drawing
   on key concepts from the recently developed field of compressed sensing,
   it shows how a low-dimensional proxy for the Green's function can be
   constructed by backpropagating a small set of random receiver vectors.
   Then the source can be located by performing a number of ``short{''}
   correlations between this proxy and the projection of the recorded
   acoustic data in the compressed space. Numerical experiments in a
   Pekeris ocean waveguide are presented that demonstrate that this
   compressed version of MFP is as effective as traditional MFP even when
   the compression is significant. The results are particularly promising
   in the broadband regime where using as few as two random
   backpropagations per frequency performs almost as well as the
   traditional broadband MFP but with the added benefit of generic
   applicability. That is, the computationally intensive backpropagations
   may be computed offline independently from the received signals, and may
   be reused to locate any source within the search grid area. (C) 2012

Title = {{Recirculation zone dynamics of a transversely excited swirl flow and
   flame}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the response of the vortex breakdown region of a
   swirling, annular jet to transverse acoustic excitation for both
   non-reacting and reacting flows. This swirling flow field consists of a
   central vortex breakdown region, two shear layers, and an annular fluid
   jet. The vortex breakdown bubble, a region of highly turbulent
   recirculating flow in the center of the flowfield, is the result of a
   global instability of the swirling jet. Additionally, the two shear
   layers originating from the inner and outer edge of the annular nozzle
   are convectively unstable and rollup due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz
   instability. Unlike the convectively unstable shear layers that respond
   in a monotonic manner to acoustic forcing, the recirculation zone
   exhibits a range of response characteristics, ranging from minimal
   response to exhibiting abrupt bifurcations at large forcing amplitudes.
   In this study, the response of the time-average and fluctuating
   recirculation zone is measured as a function of forcing frequency,
   amplitude, and symmetry. The time-average flow field is shown to exhibit
   both monotonically varying and abrupt bifurcation features as acoustic
   forcing amplitude is increased. The unsteady motion in the recirculation
   zone is dominated by the low frequency precession of the vortex
   breakdown bubble. In the unforced flow, the azimuthal m = -2 and m = -1
   modes (i.e., disturbances rotating in the same direction as the swirl
   flow) dominate the velocity disturbance field. These modes correspond to
   large scale deformation of the jet column and two small-scale precessing
   vortical structures in the recirculation zone, respectively. The
   presence of high amplitude acoustic forcing changes the relative
   amplitude of these two modes, as well as the character of the
   self-excited motion. For the reacting flow problem, we argue that the
   direct effect of these recirculation zone fluctuations on the flame
   response to flow forcing is not significant. Rather, flame wrinkling in
   response to flow forcing is dominated by shear layer disturbances.
   Recirculation zone dynamics primarily influence the time-average flame
   features (such as spreading angle). These influences on the flame
   response are indirect, as they control the transfer function relating
   shear layer fluctuations and the resulting flame response. (C) 2012

Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A new apparatus that measures soil erosion in a flume is described. It
   is designed to measure a bed material's erosion rate and approximate its
   corresponding applied shear stress (erosion function). The apparatus, or
   Sediment Erosion Rate Flume (SERF), is unlike similar devices, in that
   during an erosion test, sample advancement is computer-controlled
   through a feedback loop via a series of lasers, ultrasonic depth
   sensors, and a Servo-stepper motor. Because of this computerized control
   mechanism, the SERF can be used to measure near-instantaneous erosion
   rate as opposed to average erosion rate over an elapsed time domain.
   Also, included with the SERF is a device that can measure shear stress
   directly for a sample with a certain uniform roughness. Using the SERF,
   erosion versus time curves were used to estimate erosion rate for both
   synthetic and natural samples. For synthetic samples, a roughness
   approximation was conducted to estimate shear stress. Tests with the
   shear stress sensor appear to indicate that smooth-wall approximations
   used in previous flume-style erosion rate testing apparatuses
   under-predict shear stress. However, further analysis of erosion results
   indicates that the smooth-wall approximation is conservative; and until
   a direct method for measuring shear stress is discovered, it may be
   appropriate for devices like this. Using this rationale, erosion
   functions were estimated for natural samples.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. This study seeks to determine the intraocular pharmacokinetics
   of molecules and particles injected into the suprachoroidal space of the
   rabbit eye in vivo using a hollow microneedle.
   METHODS. Suprachoroidal injections of fluorescein and fluorescently
   tagged dextrans (40 and 250 kDa), bevacizumab, and polymeric particles
   (20 nm to 10 mu m in diameter) were performed using microneedles in New
   Zealand white rabbits. The fluorescence intensity within the eye was
   monitored in each animal using an ocular fluorophotometer to determine
   the distribution of the injected material in the eye over time as
   compared with intravitreal injection of fluorescein. Fundus photography
   and histology were performed as well.
   RESULTS. Molecules and particles injected near the limbus using a
   microneedle flowed circumferentially around the eye within the
   suprachoroidal space. By targeting the suprachoroidal space, the
   concentration of injected materials was at least 10-fold higher in the
   back of the eye tissues than in anterior tissues. In contrast,
   intravitreal injection of fluorescein targeted the vitreous humor with
   no significant selectivity for posterior versus anterior segment
   tissues. Half-lives in the suprachoroidal space for molecules of
   molecular weight from 0.3 to 250 kDa ranged from 1.2 to 7.9 hours. In
   contrast, particles ranging in size from 20 nm to 10 mu m remained
   primarily in the suprachoroidal space and choroid for a period of months
   and did not clear the eye. No adverse effects of injection into the
   suprachoroidal space were observed.
   CONCLUSION. Injection into the suprachoroidal space using a microneedle
   offers a simple and minimally invasive way to target the delivery of
   drugs to the choroid and retina. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging modality for various medical
   applications. Its spectroscopic data might be able to be used to
   noninvasively detect cancer. Quantitative analysis is often necessary in
   order to differentiate healthy from diseased tissue. We propose the use
   of an advanced image processing and classification method in order to
   analyze hyperspectral image data for prostate cancer detection. The
   spectral signatures were extracted and evaluated in both cancerous and
   normal tissue. Least squares support vector machines were developed and
   evaluated for classifying hyperspectral data in order to enhance the
   detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect prostate
   cancer in tumor-bearing mice and on pathology slides. Spatially resolved
   images were created to highlight the differences of the reflectance
   properties of cancer versus those of normal tissue. Preliminary results
   with 11 mice showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the
   hyperspectral image classification method are 92.8\% to 2.0\% and 96.9\%
   to 1.3\%, respectively. Therefore, this imaging method may be able to

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of small animals for human disease studies,
   small-animal whole-body molecular imaging plays an important role in
   biomedical research. Currently, none of the existing imaging modalities
   can provide both anatomical and glucose molecular information, leading
   to higher costs of building dual-modality systems. Even with image
   co-registration, the spatial resolution of the molecular imaging
   modality is not improved. Utilizing a ring-shaped confocal photoacoustic
   computed tomography system, we demonstrate, for the first time, that
   both anatomy and glucose uptake can be imaged in a single modality.
   Anatomy was imaged with the endogenous hemoglobin contrast, and glucose
   metabolism was imaged with a near-infrared dye-labeled 2-deoxyglucose.

Abstract = {{Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have led to the rapid
   growing research interest in reverse engineering of biomolecular systems
   (REBMS). `Data-driven' approaches, i.e. data mining, can be used to
   extract patterns from large volumes of biochemical data at
   molecular-level resolution while `design-driven' approaches, i.e.
   systems modeling, can be used to simulate emergent system properties.
   Consequently, both data- and design-driven approaches applied to -omic
   data may lead to novel insights in reverse engineering biological
   systems that could not be expected before using low-throughput
   platforms. However, there exist several challenges in this fast growing
   field of reverse engineering biomolecular systems: (i) to integrate
   heterogeneous biochemical data for data mining, (ii) to combine top-down
   and bottom-up approaches for systems modeling and (iii) to validate
   system models experimentally. In addition to reviewing progress made by
   the community and opportunities encountered in addressing these
   challenges, we explore the emerging field of synthetic biology, which is
   an exciting approach to validate and analyze theoretical system models
   directly through experimental synthesis, i.e. analysis-by-synthesis. The
   ultimate goal is to address the present and future challenges in reverse
   engineering biomolecular systems (REBMS) using integrated workflow of
   data mining, systems modeling and synthetic biology.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) of silicon has proven to be a
   fast and effective method to fabricate 1D, 2D, and 3D micro- to
   nano-scale features in silicon. It has been shown that platinum
   catalysts deposited using focused ion beam (FIB) are a viable catalyst
   for MaCE; however, the feature fidelity of channels etched with FIB
   patterned catalysts are found to be significantly lower than catalysts
   formed using e-beam lithography. In this work we show that gallium (Ga+)
   ions implanted into the silicon during sample exposure result in
   significant etching in the irradiated regions as well as long-distance
   etching peripheral regions. The accelerating voltage, dose, and etching
   time were varied to show that the etch depth depends primarily on
   accelerating voltage and is largely independent of dose while the width
   of the peripheral region was found to scale with dose. The slope of the
   peripheral etching region was found to vary with both accelerating
   voltage and dose with three different etching times evaluated to examine
   how the etch profile evolves over time. These results show that Ga+ ions
   do participate in MaCE and care must be taken when a Ga+ ion based FIB
   is used. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

   the unintentional doping of CVD graphene films}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The effect of vacuum annealing followed by exposure to oxygen and water
   vapor on the unintentional doping of CVD-grown graphene was
   investigated. CVD graphene samples were cycled between room temperature
   and 500 degrees C in vacuum while in situ Raman measurements were
   recorded. During the heating and cooling cycle, a hysteresis in the
   Raman response due to the desorption of p-dopants was observed. Upon
   exposure to O-2 gas or air, a blue shift in the Raman response with
   respect to the as grown film was observed which was due to increased
   adsorption of p-dopants on the sample. Experiments showed that a
   combination of water vapor and oxygen is more effective in p-doping the
   samples than just oxygen and that the doping effects are reversible in
   both cases. Electrical measurements performed on back-gated field effect
   graphene devices indicate that shifts in the Dirac point correlate well
   to the shifts in the Raman peak positions as well as changes found in
   XPS and Kelvin Probe measurements, verifying the changes in doping of
   the graphene. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{We demonstrated the energy harvesting potential and piezotronic effect
   in vertically aligned CdSe nanowire (NW) arrays for the first time. The
   CdSe NW arrays were grown on a mica substrate by the vapor liquid solid
   process using a CdSe thin film as seed layer and platinum as catalyst.
   High-resolution transmission electron microscopy image and selected area
   electron diffraction pattern indicate that the CdSe NWs have a wurtzite
   structure and growth direction along < 0001 >. Using conductive atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), an average output voltage of 30.7 mV and maximum
   of 137 mV were obtained. To investigate the effect of strain on electron
   transport, the current voltage characteristics of the NWs were studied
   by positioning an AFM tip on top of an individual NW. By applying normal
   force/stress on the NW, the Schottky barrier between the Pt and CdSe was
   found to be elevated due to the piezotronic effect. With the change of
   strain of 0.12\%, a current decreased from 84 to 17 pA at 2 V bias. This
   paper shows that the vertical CdSe NW array is a potential candidate for
   future piezo-phototronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{While digital microstructures can be produced using various numerical
   models, quantitative characterization of these microstructures is often
   limited to a few attributes, such as grain diameter, the number of faces
   per grain and their distributions. A large number of topological and
   geometric properties that are useful for both experimental and
   theoretical analysis of microstructure property relations have yet to be
   explored. To address this problem, we developed a series of numerical
   methods to compute geometric and topological properties of the
   microstructures. To test these methods, we performed a quantitative
   analysis of the digital microstructures obtained from a phase field
   simulation during isotropic grain growth. The new characterization
   methods allow us to not only identify each individual microstructure
   entity, including grain cell, grain boundary interface, triple junction
   line and vertex point, but also calculate the interface area, the triple
   junction length, and the curvature of grain boundary interfaces and
   triple junction lines. The detailed time evolution of these
   microstructural attributes, particularly the distributions of interface
   area and the length of triple junction lines, is extracted during the
   grain-coarsening process. The quantitative information gives us a
   detailed picture of grain growth in the phase field model that has not
   been seen before. Both the quantitative microstructures and the dynamic
   behavior are expected to serve as a benchmark for comparison to the
   microstructures obtained from other methods, including experiments. (C)

Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are natural physical features of the world's
   oceans. They create steep physiochemical gradients in the water column,
   which most notably include a dramatic draw down in oxygen concentrations
   over small vertical distances (<100 m). Microbial communities within
   OMZs play central roles in ocean and global biogeochemical cycles, yet
   we still lack a fundamental understanding of how microbial biodiversity
   is distributed across OMZs. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to
   investigate microbial diversity across a vertical gradient in the water
   column during three seasons in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP)
   OMZ. Based on analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene
   fragments, we found that both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity
   declined steeply along the transition from oxygen-rich surface water to
   the permanent OMZ. We observed similar declines in the diversity of
   protein-coding gene categories, suggesting a decrease in functional
   (trait) diversity with depth. Metrics of functional and trait dispersion
   indicated that microbial communities are phylogenetically and
   functionally more over-dispersed in oxic waters, but clustered within
   the OMZ. These dispersion patterns suggest that community assembly
   drivers (e.g., competition, environmental filtering) vary strikingly
   across the oxygen gradient. To understand the generality of our
   findings, we compared OMZ results to two marine depth gradients in
   subtropical oligotrophic sites and found that the oligotrophic sites did
   not display similar patterns, likely reflecting unique features found in
   the OMZ. Finally, we discuss how our results may relate to niche theory,
   diversity-energy relationships and stress gradients.}},

Abstract = {{In Business Process Management System (BPMS), process modeling is a
   troublesome task for a designer with little or insufficient experience.
   It is widely recognized in practice that only a proficient process
   designer is able to utilize process modeling tools effectively.
   Furthermore, although a process modeling tool can be effective in BPMS,
   a considerable amount of effort is required from enterprises in order to
   reconfigure business processes for convenient process modeling
   environments. This paper proposes a proximity score measurement approach
   to facilitate process modeling. Our approach has three salient features.
   First, it utilizes a proximity score to provide an analysis about the
   degree to which an activity is related with another activity in business
   processes. We argue that this analysis is critical in assisting process
   designers to initiate their process design with the best possible
   process reference model. Second, we developed a suite of methods for
   convenient process modeling, particularly suitable for novice designers,
   including the method of determining the proximity score measurement
   (PSM), and the methods of finding the respective process reference model
   and calculating homogeneity. We demonstrate that a process reference
   model is a convenient and effective way for a designer lacking
   experience to be guided to design his own process model. The homogeneity
   score can help the process designer to determine the suitable class to
   which a new model may belong. This further facilitates the versioning of
   the process model. Third but not the least, we develop a prototype of
   our system and conduct the experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
   our approach. Our experimental results show that the proximity score
   measurement approach is efficient and effective for process designers to
   perform process modeling in BPMS environments.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of InGaN alloys via Metal-Modulated Epitaxy has been
   investigated. Transient reflection high-energy electron diffraction
   intensities for several modulation schemes during the growth of 20\%
   InGaN were analyzed, and signatures associated with the accumulation,
   consumption, and segregation of excess metal adlayers were identified. A
   model for shuttered, metal-rich growth of InGaN was then developed, and
   a mechanism for indium surface segregation was elucidated. It was found
   that indium surface segregation only occurs after a threshold of excess
   metal is accumulated, and a method of quantifying this indium surface
   segregation onset dose is presented. The onset dose of surface
   segregation was found to be indium-composition dependent and between 1
   and 2 monolayers of excess metal. Below this surface threshold off
   excess metal, metal-rich growth can occur without indium surface
   segregation. Since at least 2 monolayers of excess metal will accumulate
   in the case of metal-rich, unshuttered growth of InGaN at the low
   temperatures required to suppress thermal and spinodal decomposition,
   this study reveals that some form of modulation must be employed to
   maintain this adlayer thickness. These theories were applied in the
   growth of InGaN with varying compositions using Metal-Modulated Epitaxy.
   Single-phase, high-quality InGaN films with compositions throughout the
   miscibility gap with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.8 nm were
   obtained, demonstrating the feasibility of shuttered, metal-rich InGaN

Title = {{Accelerated barrier optimization compressed sensing (ABOCS)
   reconstruction for cone-beam CT: Phantom studies}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{4588-4598}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) enable accurate CT
   image reconstruction from highly undersampled and noisy projection
   measurements, due to the sparsifiable feature of most CT images using
   total variation (TV). These novel reconstruction methods have
   demonstrated advantages in clinical applications where radiation dose
   reduction is critical, such as onboard cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging in
   radiation therapy. The image reconstruction using CS is formulated as
   either a constrained problem to minimize the TV objective within a small
   and fixed data fidelity error, or an unconstrained problem to minimize
   the data fidelity error with TV regularization. However, the
   conventional solutions to the above two formulations are either
   computationally inefficient or involved with inconsistent regularization
   parameter tuning, which significantly limit the clinical use of CS-based
   iterative reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an optimization
   algorithm for CS reconstruction which overcomes the above two drawbacks.
   Methods: The data fidelity tolerance of CS reconstruction can be well
   estimated based on the measured data, as most of the projection errors
   are from Poisson noise after effective data correction for scatter and
   beam-hardening effects. We therefore adopt the TV optimization framework
   with a data fidelity constraint. To accelerate the convergence, we first
   convert such a constrained optimization using a logarithmic barrier
   method into a form similar to that of the conventional TV regularization
   based reconstruction but with an automatically adjusted penalty weight.
   The problem is then solved efficiently by gradient projection with an
   adaptive Barzilai-Borwein step-size selection scheme. The proposed
   algorithm is referred to as accelerated barrier optimization for CS
   (ABOCS), and evaluated using both digital and physical phantom studies.
   Results: ABOCS directly estimates the data fidelity tolerance from the
   raw projection data. Therefore, as demonstrated in both digital
   Shepp-Logan and physical head phantom studies, consistent reconstruction
   performances are achieved using the same algorithm parameters on scans
   with different noise levels and/or on different objects. On the
   contrary, the penalty weight in a TV regularization based method needs
   to be fine-tuned in a large range (up to seven times) to maintain the
   reconstructed image quality. The improvement of ABOCS on computational
   efficiency is demonstrated in the comparisons with
   adaptive-steepest-descent-projection-onto-convex-sets (ASD-POCS), an
   existing CS reconstruction algorithm also using constrained
   optimization. ASD-POCS alternatively minimizes the TV objective using
   adaptive steepest descent (ASD) and the data fidelity error using
   projection onto convex sets (POCS). For similar image qualities of the
   Shepp-Logan phantom, ABOCS requires less computation time than ASD-POCS
   in MATLAB by more than one order of magnitude.
   Conclusions: We propose ABOCS for CBCT reconstruction. As compared to
   other published CS-based algorithms, our method has attractive features
   of fast convergence and consistent parameter settings for different
   datasets. These advantages have been demonstrated on phantom studies.

Abstract = {{Key factors limiting the greater use of linear motors are motor cost and
   complexity of controls. This paper develops an adaptive sliding-mode
   position control of a coupled-phase linear variable reluctance (LVR)
   motor for high-precision applications. With several distinct features,
   the LVR motor can be considered a strong candidate for high-performance
   linear motion applications due to its simple structure, compactness, and
   low cost with no permanent magnet. The adaptive position controller
   based on sliding-mode control is considered because of its simple
   structure and robustness against uncertain perturbations and external
   disturbances. The designed controller consists of the following: 1) an
   inner force control loop based on the sinusoidal flux model for
   simplicity and computational efficiency and 2) an outer position control
   based on the adaptive sliding-mode control to enhance the system
   robustness and to achieve high accuracy for high-precision applications.
   The LVR motor prototype was constructed for laboratory test, and the
   controller is implemented on a real-time DSP-based controller card. The
   comparative experimental results clearly show that the proposed
   controller is suitable for controlling the LVR motor system for
   high-accuracy applications and effective for reducing the chattering.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this project was to develop and validate a methodology for
   measuring manual wheelchair movement. The ability to study wheelchair
   movement is necessary across a number of clinical and research topics in
   rehabilitation, including the outcomes of rehabilitation interventions,
   the long-term effects of wheelchair propulsion on shoulder health, and
   improved wheelchair prescription and design. This study used a
   wheel-mounted accelerometer to continuously measure distance wheeled,
   and to continuously determine if the wheelchair is moving. Validation of
   the system and algorithm was tested across typical mobility-related
   activities of daily living, which included short slow movements with
   frequent starts, stops, and turns, and straight, steady state
   propulsion. Accuracy was found to be greater than 90\% across wheelchair
   and wheel types (spoke and mag), propulsion techniques (manual and
   foot), speeds, and everyday mobility-related activities of daily living.
   Although a number of approaches for wheelchair monitoring are currently
   present in the literature, many are limited in the data they provide.
   The methodology presented in this paper can be applied to a variety of
   commercially available products that record bi-axial accelerations, and
   used to answer many research questions in wheeled mobility. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Patterns with gaps have traditionally been used as signatures of protein
   families or as features in binary classification. Current alignment-free
   algorithms construct phylogenies by comparing the repertoire and
   frequency of ungapped blocks in genomes and proteomes. In this article,
   we measure the quality of phylogenies reconstructed by comparing
   suitably defined sets of gapped motifs that occur in mitochondrial
   proteomes. We study the dependence between the quality of reconstructed
   phylogenies and the density, number of solid characters, and statistical
   significance of gapped motifs. We consider maximal motifs, as well as
   some of their compact generators. The average performance of suitably
   defined sets of gapped motifs is comparable to that of popular
   string-based alignment-free methods. Extremely long and sparse motifs
   produce phylogenies of the same or better quality than those produced by
   short and dense motifs. The best phylogenies are produced by motifs with
   3 or 4 solid characters, while increasing the number of solid characters
   degrades phylogenies. Discarding motifs with low statistical
   significance degrades performance as well. In maximal motifs, moving
   from the smallest basis to bases with higher redundancy leads to better
   phylogenies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents several classes of control laws for steering an
   agent, that is, an aerial or marine vehicle, in the presence of a both
   temporally and spatially varying drift field induced by local
   winds/currents. The navigation problem is addressed assuming various
   information patterns about the drift field in the vicinity of the agent.
   In particular, three cases are considered: namely, when the agent has
   complete information about the local drift, when the drift field is
   partially known, and when the drift field is completely unknown. By
   first establishing a duality between the navigation problem and a
   special class of problems of pursuit of a maneuvering target, several
   navigation schemes are presented, which are appropriately tailored to
   the fidelity of the information about the local drift available to the
   agent. The proposed navigation laws are dual to well-known pursuit
   strategies, such as pure pursuit, parallel guidance/navigation,
   line-of-sight guidance, motion camouflage, and pursuit with
   neutralization. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the
   theoretical developments.}},

   Detection of tactile inputs in the rat vibrissa pathway. J Neurophysiol
   108: 479-490, 2012. First published April 18, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00004.2012.-The rapid detection of sensory inputs is
   crucial for survival. Sensory detection explicitly requires the
   integration of incoming sensory information and the ability to
   distinguish between relevant information and ongoing neural activity. In
   this study, head-fixed rats were trained to detect the presence of a
   brief deflection of their whiskers resulting from a focused puff of air.
   The animals showed a monotonic increase in response probability and a
   decrease in reaction time with increased stimulus strength. High-speed
   video analysis of whisker motion revealed that animals were more likely
   to detect the stimulus during periods of reduced self-induced motion of
   the whiskers, thereby allowing the stimulus-induced whisker motion to
   exceed the ongoing noise. In parallel, we used voltage-sensitive dye
   (VSD) imaging of barrel cortex in anesthetized rats receiving the same
   stimulus set as those in the behavioral portion of this study to assess
   candidate codes that make use of the full spatiotemporal representation
   and to compare variability in the trial-by-trial nature of the cortical
   response and the corresponding variability in the behavioral response.
   By application of an accumulating evidence framework to the population
   cortical activity measured in separate animals, a strong correspondence
   was made between the behavioral output and the neural signaling, in
   terms of both the response probabilities and the reaction times. Taken
   together, the results here provide evidence for detection performance
   that is strongly reliant on the relative strength of signal versus
   noise, with strong correspondence between behavior and parallel
   electrophysiological findings.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management has become a critical issue for high heat flux
   electronics and energy systems. Integrated two-phase microchannel
   liquid-cooling technology has been envisioned as a promising solution,
   but with great challenges in flow instability. In this work, silicon
   nanowires were synthesized in situ in parallel silicon microchannel
   arrays for the first time to suppress the flow instability and to
   augment flow boiling heat transfer. Significant enhancement in flow
   boiling heat transfer performance was demonstrated for the
   nanowire-coated microchannel heat sink, such as an early onset of
   nucleate boiling, a delayed onset of flow oscillation, suppressed
   oscillating amplitudes of temperature and pressure drop, and an
   increased heat transfer coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{While pseudocapacitors represent a promising option for electrical
   energy storage, the performance of the existing ones must be
   dramatically enhanced to meet today's ever-increasing demands for many
   emerging applications. Here we report a nanostructured, rnixed-valent

   (similar to 2530 F/g of manganese oxide, measured at 0.61 A/g in a
   two-electrode configuration with loading of active materials similar to
   0.16 mg/cm(2)) while maintaining excellent power density and cycling
   life. The dramatic performance enhancement is attributed to its unique
   mixed-valence state with porous nanoarchitecture, which may facilitate
   rapid mass transport and enhance surface double-layer capacitance, while
   promoting facile redox reactions associated with charge storage by both
   Mn and O sites, as suggested by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
   (XAS) and density functional theory calculations. The new charge storage
   mechanisms (in addition to redox reactions of cations) may offer
   critical insights to rational design of a new-generation energy storage

Abstract = {{A 3D ZnO nanowire-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with unique
   ``caterpillar-like{''} structure was designed. Because of the
   significant improvement of the total ZnO nanowire surface area, the
   amount of light absorption was substantially increased. This increase in
   the light harvesting efficiency enables us to achieve an overall power
   conversion efficiency as high as 5.20\%, which is the highest reported
   value to date for ZnO nanowire-based DSSCs. A branched-multilayered
   design of ZnO nanowire arrays grown from ZnO nanofiber seed layers
   proves to be very successful in fabricating 3D ZnO nanowire arrays.
   Practically, electrospun ZnO nanowires were used as the seeds in
   multilayer growth of ZnO nanowire arrays with a unique
   ``caterpillar-like{''} structure. This unique structure significantly
   enhances the surface area of the ZnO nanowire arrays, leading to higher
   short-circuit currents. Additionally, this design resulted in closer
   spacing between the nanowires and more direct conduction pathways for
   electron transfer. Thus, the open-circuit voltage was so significantly
   improved as a direct result of the reduction in electron recombination.}},

Abstract = {{The Hofstadter butterfly spectrum for Landau levels in a two-dimensional
   periodic lattice is a rare example exhibiting fractal properties in a
   truly quantum system. However, the observation of this physical
   phenomenon in a conventional material will require a magnetic field
   strength several orders of magnitude larger than what can be produced in
   a modern laboratory. It turns out that for a specific range of
   rotational angles twisted bilayer graphene serves as a special system
   with a fractal energy spectrum under laboratory accessible magnetic
   field strengths. This unique feature arises from an intriguing
   electronic structure induced by the interlayer coupling. Using a
   recursive tight-binding method, we systematically map out the spectra of
   these Landau levels as a function of the rotational angle. Our results
   give a complete description of LLs in twisted bilayer graphene for both
   commensurate and incommensurate rotational angles and provide
   quantitative predictions of magnetic field strengths for observing the
   fractal spectra in these graphene systems.}},

Abstract = {{We present that the electroluminescence (EL) properties of Mg-doped
   p-type GaN thin films can be tuned by the piezo-phototronic effect via
   adjusting the minority carrier injection efficiency at the
   metal-semiconductor (M-S) interface by strain induced polarization
   charges. The device is a metal-semiconductor-metal structure of iridium
   tin oxide (ITO)-GaN-ITO. Under different straining conditions, the
   changing trend of the transport properties of GaN films can be divided
   into two types, corresponding to the different c-axis orientations of
   the films. An extreme value was observed for the integral EL intensity
   under certain applied strain due to the adjusted minority carrier
   injection efficiency by piezoelectric charges introduced at the M-S
   interface. The external quantum efficiency of the blue EL at 430 nm was
   changed by 5.84\% under different straining conditions, which is 1 order
   of magnitude larger than the change of the green peak at 540 nm. The
   results indicate that the piezophototronic effect has a larger impact on
   the shallow acceptor states related EL process than on the one related
   to the deep acceptor states in p-type GaN films. This study has great
   significance on the practical applications of GaN in optoelectronic
   devices under a working environment where mechanical deformation is
   unavoidable such as for flexible/printable light emitting diodes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the dynamic assignment of cross-trained servers to stations in
   understaffed lines with finite buffers. Our objective is to maximize the
   production rate. We identify optimal server assignment policies for
   systems with three stations, two servers, different flexibility
   structures, and either deterministic service times and arbitrary buffers
   or exponential service times and small buffers. We use these policies to
   develop server assignment heuristics for Markovian systems with larger
   buffer sizes that appear to yield near-optimal throughput. In the
   deterministic setting, we prove that the best possible production rate
   with full server flexibility and infinite buffers can be attained with
   partial flexibility and zero buffers, and we identify the critical
   skills required to achieve this goal. We then present numerical results
   showing that these critical skills, employed with an effective server
   assignment policy, also yield near-optimal throughput in the Markovian
   setting, even for small buffer sizes. Thus, our results suggest that
   partial flexibility is sufficient for near-optimal performance, and that
   flexibility structures that are effective for deterministic and
   infinite-buffered systems are also likely to perform well for
   finite-buffered stochastic systems.}},

Abstract = {{Unpromoted and Rb-promoted Mo2C nanoparticles (similar to 1 nm in size)
   were synthesized on alpha-alumina and used for CO hydrogenation. The
   reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor system operating at 573 K
   and 30 bar with a gas flow rate of 24,000 cm(3) g(Mo)(-1) h(-1) and
   H-2/CO ratio of 1:1. Unpromoted Mo2C functioned as a Fischer-Tropsch
   catalyst producing mostly hydrocarbons at the standard conditions.
   Passivation of freshly synthesized Mo2C nanoparticles in 1\% O-2 prior
   to CO hydrogenation decreased - the Fischer-Tropsch activity of the
   catalyst by about 40\% compared with a nonpassivatecl sample. Addition
   of Rb promoter to Mo2C shifted the selectivity of the catalyst by
   inhibiting the formation of hydrocarbons while preserving the formation
   of alcohols. The presence of Rb with Mo2C also reduced substantially the
   sensitivity of the catalyst to passivation by 1\% O-2 compared with
   unpromoted Mo2C. The partial oxidation of the Mo2C nanoparticles by
   passivation and partial reduction by syngas was, confirmed by Mo K edge
   X-ray absorption spectroscopy.}},

Journal = {{ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane libraries consisting of films with composition gradients of
   aliphatic polyisocyanate and hydroxy-terminated polyacrylate resin were
   characterized using methods of H-1 NMR microimaging (i.e., magnetic
   resonance imaging, (MRI)) and solid-state NMR. Molecular mobilities and
   underlying structural information were extracted as a function of the
   relative content of each of the two components. Routine NMR
   microirnaging using the spinecho sequence only allows investigations of
   transverse relaxation of magnetization at echo times >2 ms. A
   single-exponential decay was found, which is likely due to free,
   noncross-linked polymer chains. The mobility of these chains decreases
   with increasing content of the aliphatic polyisocyanate. The concept of
   a 1D NMR profiler is introduced as a novel modality for library
   screening, which allows the convenient measurement of static solid-state
   NMR spectra as a function of spatial location along a library sample
   that is repositioned in the rf coil between experiments. With this setup
   the complete transverse relaxation function was measured using Bloch
   decays and spin echoes. For all positions within the
   gradient-composition film, relaxation data consisted of at least three
   components that were attributed to a rigid highly cross-linked resin, an
   intermediate cross-linked but mobile constituent, and the highly mobile
   free polymer chains (the latter is also detectable by MRI). Analysis of
   this overall relaxation function measured via Bloch decays and spin
   echoes revealed only minor changes in the mobilities of the individual
   fractions. Findings with respect to the most mobile components are
   consistent with the results obtained by NMR microimaging. The major
   effect is the significant increase in the rigid-component fraction with
   the addition of the hydroxy-terminated polyacrylate resin.}},

Title = {{In Situ TEM Experiments of Electrochemical Lithiation and Delithiation

Abstract = {{Understanding the microscopic mechanisms of electrochemical reaction and
   material degradation is crucial for the rational design of
   high-performance lithium ion batteries (LIBs). A novel nanobattery
   assembly and testing platform inside a transmission electron microscope
   (TEM) has been designed, which allows a direct study of the structural
   evolution of individual nanowire or nanoparticle electrodes with
   near-atomic resolution in real time. In this review, recent progresses
   in the study of several important anode materials are summarized. The
   consistency between in situ and ex situ results is shown, thereby
   validating the new in situ testing paradigm. Comparisons between a
   variety of nanostructures lead to the conclusion that electrochemical
   reaction and mechanical degradation are material specific, size
   dependent, and geometrically and compositionally sensitive. For example,
   a highly anisotropic lithiation in Si is observed, in contrast to the
   nearly isotropic response in Ge. The Ge nanowires can develop a spongy
   network, a unique mechanism for mitigating the large volume changes
   during cycling. The Si nanoparticles show a critical size of similar to
   150 nm below which fracture is averted during lithiation, and above
   which surface cracking, rather than central cracking, is observed. In
   carbonaceous nanomaterials, the lithiated multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) are drastically embrittled, while few-layer graphene
   nanoribbons remain mechanically robust after lithiation. This distinct
   contrast manifests a strong geometrical embrittlement effect as compared
   to a relatively weak chemical embrittlement effect. In oxide nanowires,
   discrete cracks in ZnO nanowires are generated near the lithiation
   reaction front, leading to leapfrog cracking, while a mobile dislocation
   cloud at the reaction front is observed in SnO2 nanowires. This contrast
   is corroborated by ab initio calculations that indicate a strong
   chemical embrittlement of ZnO, but not of SnO2, after a small amount of
   lithium insertion. In metallic nanowires such as Al, delithiation causes
   pulverization, and the product nanoparticles are held in place by the
   surface Li-Al-O glass tube, suggesting possible strategies for improving
   electrode cyclability by coatings. In addition, a new in situ chemical
   lithiation method is introduced for fast screening of battery materials
   by conventional TEM. Evidently, in situ nanobattery experiments inside
   TEM are a powerful approach for advancing the fundamental understanding
   of electrochemical reactions and materials degradation and therefore
   pave the way toward rational design of high-performance LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical energy storage and conversion is vital to a clean,
   sustainable, and secure energy future. Among all electrochemical energy
   storage devices, metal-air batteries have potential to offer the highest
   energy density, representing the most promising systems for portable
   (electronics), mobile (electrical vehicles), and stationary
   (micro-grids) applications. To date, however, many fundamental issues
   are yet to be overcome to realize this potential. For example, efficient
   catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution
   reaction (OER) at the air-electrode are yet to be developed to
   significantly reduce the polarization loss in metal-air batteries, which
   severely hinders the rate capability, energy efficiency, and operational
   life. In this progress report, a brief overview is first presented of
   the critical issues relevant to air-electrodes in metal-air batteries.
   Some recent advancements in the development of non-precious catalysts
   for ORR in Li-air and Zn-air batteries are then highlighted, including
   transition metal oxides, low-dimensional carbon-based structures, and
   other catalysts such as transition-metal macrocycles and metal nitrides.
   New directions and future perspectives for metal-air batteries are also
   outlined.}},

   May 9, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00002.2012.-The formation of vascular
   networks during embryogenesis and early stages of development
   encompasses complex and tightly regulated growth of blood vessels,
   followed by maturation of some vessels, and spatially controlled
   disconnection and pruning of others. The adult vasculature, while more
   quiescent, is also capable of adapting to changing physiological
   conditions by remodeling blood vessels. Numerous studies have focused on
   understanding key factors that drive vessel growth in the adult in
   response to ischemic injury. However, little is known about the extent
   of vessel rarefaction and its potential contribution to the final
   outcome of vascular recovery. We addressed this topic by characterizing
   the endogenous phases of vascular repair in a mouse model of hindlimb
   ischemia. We showed that this process is biphasic. It encompasses an
   initial rapid phase of vessel growth, followed by a later phase of
   vessel rarefaction. In healthy mice, this process resulted in partial
   recovery of perfusion and completely restored the ability of mice to run
   voluntarily. Given that the ability to revascularize can be compromised
   by a cardiovascular risk factor such as diabetes, we also examined
   vascular repair in diabetic mice. We found that paradoxically both the
   initial growth and subsequent regression of collateral vessels were more
   pronounced in the setting of diabetes and resulted in impaired recovery
   of perfusion and impaired functional status. In conclusion, our findings
   demonstrate that the formation of functional collateral vessels in the
   hindlimb requires vessel growth and subsequent vessel rarefaction. In
   the setting of diabetes, the physiological defect was not in the initial
   formation of vessels but rather in the inability to sustain newly formed
   vessels.}},

Abstract = {{The large number of voids induced by the thermal effect from solder
   reflow process is one of the technical challenges for flip chip package
   techniques typically with no-flow underfills. The underfill voids could
   extensively reduce the life cycle in thermal cyclic test. This paper
   reviewed classical heterogeneous bubble nucleation theories to model
   voids nucleation occurring on the phase boundary of solid solder and
   liquidus underfill to control the nucleation during flip chip assembly
   process using no-flow underfill materials. On the heterogeneous voids
   nucleation, the properties of nucleation sites (such as density and
   surface tension) that determine void formation were explored using
   nano-sized fillers. Thus, this experiment investigated the effect of
   nano-sized fillers, which are potential nucleation sites in the no-flow
   underfill material, on the void formation by changing the nano-sized
   filler type and concentration. Eventually, we proposed a formulation
   guideline of no-flow underfill materials using nano-sized fillers to
   effectively prevent the underfill voiding during flip chip assembly

Abstract = {{Based on the investigation of spatial variations of impact-echo signals
   for different source and receiver locations, a simple multisensor data
   fusion strategy is proposed to increase the accuracy of nondestructive
   evaluation of concrete structures using the impact-echo test. The data
   fusion strategy fuses the ratios between spectral amplitudes of the
   delamination and concrete bottom echo signals (D/B ratios) from multiple
   source-receiver arrays. The fused D/B ratios demonstrate different
   characteristics for test locations above the delamination, above the
   sound concrete, and across the delamination boundary. These
   characteristics can be used to accurately locate the delamination and
   its boundaries without increasing testing time. The applicability of the
   multisensor data fusion for impact-echo testing is validated using both
   numerical simulation and experimental testings.}},

Abstract = {{An in-plane constant-efficiency variable-diffraction-angle grating and
   an in-plane high-angular-selectivity grating are combined to enable a
   new compact silicon diffractive sensor. This sensor is fabricated in
   silicon-on-insulator and uses telecommunications wavelengths. A single
   sensor element has a micron-scale device size and uses intensity-based
   (as opposed to spectral-based) detection for increased integrability.
   In-plane diffraction gratings provide an intrinsic splitting mechanism
   to enable a two-dimensional sensor array. Detection of the relative
   values of diffracted and transmitted intensities is independent of
   attenuation and is thus robust. The sensor prototype measures refractive
   index changes of 10(-4). Simulations indicate that this sensor
   configuration may be capable of measuring refractive index changes three
   or four orders of magnitude smaller. The characteristics of this sensor
   type make it promising for lab-on-a-chip applications. (C) 2012 Optical

   maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policies for complex resource
   allocation systems through classification theory: The linear case,{''}
   IEEE Trans. Autom. Control, vol. 56, 2011), we have proposed the
   reformulation of the synthesis of the maximally permissive deadlock
   avoidance policy for certain classes of complex resource allocation
   systems (RAS) as the design of a linear compact classifier effecting the
   dichotomy of the underlying reachable state space into its safe and
   unsafe subspaces. In thiswork, we extend the results of A. Nazeem et al.
   for the case that the sought dichotomy cannot be represented by a linear
   classifier. We propose new classification schemes for this more complex
   case and establish formally their completeness, i.e., their ability to
   provide an effective classifier for every instance of the considered RAS
   class. We also provide effective and computationally efficient
   procedures for the synthesis of the sought classifiers. Finally, the
   effectiveness and the efficacy of our approaches are demonstrated and
   assessed through a series of computational experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model-based tracking control design for
   small-scale unmanned helicopters. The design objective is for the
   helicopter to track predefined inertial position (or velocity) and
   heading reference trajectories. The controller is based on a nominal
   linear state-space model that successfully captures the small-scale
   helicopter coupled multivariable dynamics. The flight controller is
   composed of two feedback loops that regulate the tracking error of the
   longitudinal-lateral and heading-heave motion of the helicopter,
   respectively. The tracking error is determined by constructing a
   reference state generator based on the linear helicopter model and the
   reference outputs. The state generator can be systematically designed
   using the backstepping approach for systems in feedback form and by
   applying a physically meaningful approximation to the linear helicopter
   model. The controller performance is successfully tested using a
   realistic flight simulator.}},

   focus on ``critical outputs,{''} which vary as a function of the

   techniques to address this problem. We design closed-loop stable,

Abstract = {{Tongue drive system (TDS) is a novel tongue-operated assistive
   technology (AT) for the mobility impaired, to empower them to access
   computers and drive powered wheelchairs (PWC) using their free voluntary
   tongue motion. We have evaluated the TDS performance in five sessions
   over 5-8 weeks to study the learning process in different tasks of
   computer access and PWC navigation on nine able-bodied subjects who
   already had tongue piercing and used our magnetic tongue studs
   throughout the trial. Computer access tasks included on-screen maze
   navigation and issuing random commands to measure the TDS information
   transfer rate. PWC navigation included driving through a similar to 50-m
   obstacle course using three control strategies. Some of the qualitative
   aspects of using the TDS were also evaluated based on the two Likert
   scale questionnaires, one of which was short (eight questions) and asked
   at the end of each session and the other one (46 questions) at the end
   of the trial. Included in this study was also a task to measure the
   tongue fatigue as a result of using the TDS continuously for a few
   hours. All performance measures showed significant improvement from the
   first to the second session as well as further gradual improvements
   throughout the rest of the sessions, suggesting a rapid learning
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DNA vaccination in the skin
   using microneedles improves protective immunity compared to conventional
   intramuscular (IM) injection of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the
   influenza hemagglutinin (HA). In vivo fluorescence imaging demonstrated
   the expression of a reporter gene delivered to the skin using a solid
   microneedle patch coated with plasmid DNA. Vaccination at a low dose (3
   mu g HA DNA) using microneedles generated significantly stronger humoral
   immune responses and better protective responses post-challenge compared
   to IM vaccination at either low or high (10 mu g HA DNA) dose.
   Vaccination using microneedles at a high (10 mu g) dose further
   generated improved post-challenge protection, as measured by survival,
   recall antibody-secreting cell responses in spleen and bone marrow, and
   interferon (IFN)-gamma cytokine T-cell responses. This study
   demonstrates that DNA vaccination in the skin using microneedles induces
   higher humoral and cellular immune responses as well as improves
   protective immunity compared to conventional IM injection of HA DNA
   vaccine. Received 10 October 2011; accepted 18 March 2012; advance

Abstract = {{Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) are described in which there is
   anelasticity in strain recovery response (under zero load) after
   uniaxial tensile loading. This strain retention is shown as a function
   of time after release of load and is further characterized by thermal,
   X-ray, and stress/strain experiments. It was found that, at temperatures
   in the smectic phase far below the isotropization temperature, this LCN
   film retains significant levels of strain when in the monodomain state.
   On free recovery (zero load) of the LCN film there is a rapid elastic
   response followed by a slow anelastic response for those films that had
   undergone a polydomain-to-monodomain transition during the initial
   imposed strain regimen. It is postulated that the mechanism leading to
   the strain retention involves nanosegregation-driven pinning of unfolded
   hairpins in shallow energy wells and that this effect is responsible for
   the thermally activated recovery of strain (shape memory) at elevated
   temperatures. Stressstrain curves of pre-strained C11(MeHQ)Si8XL10 LC

Abstract = {{Ad hoc distributed simulation is an approach to predicting future states
   of operational systems. It is based on embedding online simulations into
   a sensor network and adding communication and synchronization among the
   simulators. While prior work focused on this approach in the context of
   online management of transportation systems, this paper describes a
   generalization of the methodology and shows how it can be applied to
   embedded simulations of systems that can be modeled as open networks of
   queues. An implementation of an ad hoc queueing network simulation is
   described. The flows of units across links connecting nodes in different
   simulators are approximated by renewal processes whose parameters are
   updated dynamically. The synchronization mechanism uses random sampling
   to update flow rates across the ad hoc components. Preliminary results
   show that the ad hoc queueing network simulation can provide predictions
   comparable to sequential simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Pluripotent and multipotent stem cells adopt an osteoblastic phenotype
   when cultured in environments that enhance their osteogenic potential.
   Embryonic stem cells differentiated as embryoid bodies (EBs) in
   osteogenic medium containing beta-glycerophosphate exhibit increased
   expression of bone markers, indicating that cells are osteoblastic.
   Interestingly, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25D) enhances the
   osteogenic phenotype not just in EBs but also in multipotent adult
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 1,25D acts on osteoblasts via classical
   vitamin D receptors (VDR) and via a membrane 1,25D-binding protein
   {[}protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (PDIA3)], which
   activates protein kinase C -signaling. The aims of this study were to
   determine whether these receptors are regulated during osteogenic
   differentiation of stem cells and if stem cells and differentiated
   progeny are responsive to 1,25D. mRNA and protein levels for VDR, PDIA3,
   and osteoblast-associated proteins were measured in undifferentiated
   cells and in cells treated with osteogenic medium. Mouse EBs expressed
   both VDR and PDIA3, but VDR increased as cells underwent osteogenic
   differentiation. Human MSCs expressed Pdia3 at constant levels
   throughout differentiation, but VDR increased in cells treated with
   osteogenic medium. These results suggest that both 1,25D signaling
   mechanisms are important, with PDIA3 playing a greater role during early
   events and VDR playing a greater role in later stages of
   differentiation. Understanding these coordinated events provide a
   powerful tool to control pluripotent and multipotent stem cell
   differentiation through induction medium.}},

Abstract = {{Structural health monitoring systems employing in situ guided wave
   transducers are being considered for civil, mechanical, and aerospace
   applications. In particular, guided wave-based imaging methods have been
   applied to graphically depict the area of interest and localize the
   damage. Most existing imaging techniques have relied on scattered waves
   extracted by baseline subtraction to quantify the effects of damage on
   the guided waves. In many cases, however, baseline data may not have
   been recorded or may be ineffective for baseline subtraction because of
   uncompensated variations between baseline and in-service signals.
   Proposed here is an alternative approach whereby source signals are
   first adaptively estimated from the in-service signals, direct arrivals
   are then calculated by forward propagation, and scattered signals are
   obtained by subtraction of the direct arrivals. Images using these
   scattered signals can then be created by, for example, delay-and-sum
   methods. This approach is demonstrated using synthetic signals generated
   by ray tracing and conventional delay-and-sum imaging. Its feasibility
   is further demonstrated with experimental data recorded on an aluminum
   plate using a single in situ transducer as a source and a laser
   vibrometer to record guided signals around the periphery of the region
   of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Limited knowledge exists regarding the forces that act on
   devices implanted in the mitral annulus. Determining the peak
   magnitudes, directions, rates, variation throughout the cardiac cycle,
   and change with left ventricular pressure (LVP) will aid in device
   development and evaluation.
   Methods. Novel transducers with the ability to measure forces in the
   septal-lateral and transverse directions were implanted in six healthy
   ovine subjects. Forces were measured for cardiac cycles reaching a peak
   LVP of 90, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mm Hg.
   Results. The septal-lateral force was observed to significantly increase
   from 3.9 +/- 0.8 N (90) to 5.2 +/- 1.0 N (125) p < 0.001, 5.9 +/- 0.9 N
   (150) p < 0.001, 6.4 +/- 1.2 N (175) p < 0.001, and 6.7 +/- 1.5 N (200
   mm Hg) p < 0.001. Similarly, the transverse force was seen to increase
   from 2.6 +/- 0.6 N (90) to 3.8 +/- 1.0 N (125) p < 0.01, 4.6 +/- 1.3 N
   (150) p < 0.001, 4.3 +/- 1.2 N (175) p < 0.001, and 3.5 +/- 0.7 N (200
   mm Hg) p < 0.05. In comparison, the septal-lateral force was
   significantly greater than the transverse force at 90 (p < 0.05), 125 (p
   < 0.05), 175 (p < 0.001), and 200 mm Hg (p < 0.0005).
   Conclusions. Annular forces and their variations with LVP through the
   cardiac cycle are described. The results demonstrate differences in
   force magnitude and rate for increasing levels of LVP between the
   septal-lateral and transverse directions. These directional differences
   have strong implications in the development of future mitral devices.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel algorithm for compressive imaging that exploits both
   the sparsity and persistence across scales found in the 2D wavelet
   transform coefficients of natural images. Like other recent works, we
   model wavelet structure using a hidden Markov tree (HMT) but, unlike
   other works, ours is based on loopy belief propagation (LBP). For LBP,
   we adopt a recently proposed ``turbo{''} message passing schedule that
   alternates between exploitation of HMT structure and exploitation of
   compressive-measurement structure. For the latter, we leverage Donoho,
   Maleki, and Montanari's recently proposed approximate message passing
   (AMP) algorithm. Experiments with a large image database suggest that,
   relative to existing schemes, our turbo LBP approach yields
   state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with substantial reduction
   in complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the flows generated by the pulsations of jellyfish bells is
   crucial for understanding the mechanics and efficiency of their swimming
   and feeding. Recent experimental and theoretical work has focused on the
   dynamics of vortices in the wakes of swimming jellyfish with relatively
   simple oral arms and tentacles. The significance of bell pulsations for
   generating feeding currents through elaborate oral arms and the
   consequences for particle capture are not as well understood. To isolate
   the generation of feeding currents from swimming, the pulsing kinematics
   and fluid flow around the benthic jellyfish Cassiopea spp. were
   investigated using a combination of videography, digital particle image
   velocimetry and direct numerical simulation. During the rapid
   contraction phase of the bell, fluid is pulled into a starting vortex
   ring that translates through the oral arms with peak velocities that can
   be of the order of 10. cm. s(-1). Strong shear flows are also generated
   across the top of the oral arms throughout the entire pulse cycle. A
   coherent train of vortex rings is not observed, unlike in the case of
   swimming oblate medusae such as Aurelia aurita. The phase-averaged flow
   generated by bell pulsations is similar to a vertical jet, with induced
   flow velocities averaged over the cycle of the order of 1-10. mm. s(-1).
   This introduces a strong near-horizontal entrainment of the fluid along
   the substrate and towards the oral arms. Continual flow along the
   substrate towards the jellyfish is reproduced by numerical simulations
   that model the oral arms as a porous Brinkman layer of finite thickness.
   This two-dimensional numerical model does not, however, capture the
   far-field flow above the medusa, suggesting that either the
   three-dimensionality or the complex structure of the oral arms helps to
   direct flow towards the central axis and up and away from the animal.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-film polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric sensors have long been
   recognized as a promising alternative to traditional metal foil strain
   gauges in applications where only dynamic or quasistatic signals are of
   interest. Compared to metal foil strain gauges, polyvinylidene fluoride
   sensors feature high sensitivity, high dynamic range, and broad
   frequency bandwidth. However, transverse sensitivity of the
   polyvinylidene fluoride sensor is higher than that of a metal foil
   strain gauge, making it more difficult to isolate a particular strain
   component or a deformation mode when the host structure is under complex
   loading. In addition, polyvinylidene fluoride films are sensitive to
   changes in ambient temperature due to the pyroelectric effect. In this
   article, three temperature-compensated polyvinylidene fluoride sensor
   rosette designs are proposed for isolating specific strain component(s)
   and deformation mode(s) of interest. First-principles based models are
   derived to relate the polyvinylidene fluoride sensor rosette output to
   the actual elastic strain component of interest. Experimental validation
   is conducted to verify the proposed models and to compare the
   performance of the polyvinylidene fluoride sensor rosettes with their
   metal foil strain gauge counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic arrays of hybrid-shunted piezoelectric actuators are used to
   suppress vibrations of an aluminum plate over broad frequency bands.
   Commonly, piezoelectric-shunted networks are used for individual mode
   control, through tuned, resonant resistive/inductive circuits, and for
   broadband vibration attenuation, through negative impedance converters.
   Periodically placed resonant shunts allow for broadband reduction
   resulting from the attenuation of propagating waves in frequency bands
   which are defined by the spatial periodicity of the array and by the
   shunting parameters considered on the circuit. Such attenuation
   typically occurs at medium-high frequencies, while negative impedance
   converter networks are effective in reducing the vibration amplitudes of
   the lower modes of the structure. In this article, the combination of
   periodic resonant shunts and negative impedance converter networks on
   the same aluminum panel is studied to verify the possibility of
   combining the advantages of the two concepts. Both numerical and
   experimental investigations demonstrate that broadband attenuation is
   achieved in the mid-high frequency regimes due to the presence of
   resistive/inductive networks, while the combination with negative
   impedance converter circuits is responsible for amplitude reduction of
   the full frequency spectrum. Numerical simulations and frequency
   response measurements on a plate demonstrate that an attenuation region
   of about 1000 Hz is achieved with a maximum 8 dB vibration reduction.}},

Title = {{Robust Leak Tests for Transmission Systems Using Nonlinear Mixed-Effect

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Problem: Leakage of the transmission fluid or oil in powertrain systems
   (i.e., transmissions, cylinder heads, engine blocks, etc.) can cause
   engine overheating and/or permanent damage. Therefore, it is crucial to
   run a leak test to inspect for any possible porosity in the casting
   parts. However, the inspection results for the amount of leakage at
   given testing times are sensitive to the tested part's temperature,
   which varies from part to part but was not previously incorporated in
   the leak testing systems. The objective of this paper is to develop a
   robust leak testing system that is insensitive to the part temperature
   variations in real production processes.
   Approach: In the production line, a part is tested at a temperature that
   is generally not equal to the calibration temperature at which the
   inspection threshold for leakage was set. To achieve a robust leak test
   that is insensitive to temperature variation in the tested part, we
   propose a temperature compensation algorithm to adjust the measured leak
   flow, taking into account the tested part temperature and the
   calibration temperature. For this purpose, a nonlinear mixed-effect
   model is first developed for modeling the leak flow profile as a
   function of both the leak testing time and the part temperature. Then,
   the fitted mixed-effect model is used to adjust the leak flow based on
   the calibration temperature. If the amount of the adjusted leakage at
   the given inspection time exceeds the inspection threshold, the part is
   rejected; otherwise, the part is accepted.
   Results: The proposed compensation algorithm is developed and validated
   using a set of training samples and another set of test samples,
   respectively. We use the percentage of error reduction in the leak flow
   measurements at different temperatures as the criterion to validate the
   developed compensation algorithm. The results show that the average
   percentage of error reduction for the test samples is about 92\%. This
   indicates a significant improvement in the leak testing results.}},

Abstract = {{Culturing multipotent adult mesenchymal stem cells as 3D aggregates
   augments their differentiation potential and paracrine activity. One
   caveat of stem cell spheroids, though, can be the limited diffusional
   transport barriers posed by the inherent 3D structure of the
   multicellular aggregates. In order to circumvent such limitations,
   polymeric microparticles have been incorporated into stem cell
   aggregates as a means to locally control the biochemical and physical
   properties of the 3D microenvironment. However, the introduction of
   biomaterials to the 3D stem cell microenvironment could alter the
   mechanical forces sensed by cells within aggregates, which in turn could
   impact various cell behaviors and overall spheroid mechanics. Therefore,
   the objective of this study was to determine the acute effects of
   biomaterial incorporation within mesenchymal stem cell spheroids on
   aggregate structure and mechanical properties. The results of this study
   demonstrate that although gelatin microparticle incorporation results in
   similar multicellular organization within human mesenchymal stem cell
   spheroids, the introduction of gelatin materials significantly impacts
   spheroid mechanical properties. The marked differences in spheroid
   mechanics induced by microparticle incorporation may hold major
   implications for in vitro directed differentiation strategies and offer
   a novel route to engineer the mechanical properties of tissue constructs

   stem cells in a 3-D culture environment. Adipose derived stem cells
   (ADSCs) have been widely studied and have shown promise as a potential
   source of osteogenic progenitor cells. Previous work had investigated
   the effect of 25 mu M resveratrol on the osteogenic differentiation of
   rat ADSCs in a 3-D environment and found that pre-treating cells for one
   passage prior to seeding on the scaffold yielded significantly more
   mineralization than untreated cells. We first sought to investigate
   whether this result was also observable with human ADSCs and found that
   the human cells did not respond to 25 mu M resveratrol in a positive
   manner suggesting a species specific difference in resveratrol dosage.
   Therefore, we next investigated multiple doses at or below 25 mu M
   resveratrol for both rat and human ADSCs. We found that doses below 25
   mu M caused significantly more mineralization than 0 (untreated) and 25
   mu M treated cells in a 3-D culture environment. Further, we observed
   species differences in the total amount of mineralized matrix, as well
   as the mean mineral density suggesting that the nature of mineralization
   of the extracellular matrix was different between species. Histological
   examination of the scaffolds showed that the human cell constructs
   remain highly cellular in nature with small pockets of mineralization,
   while rat cell constructs showed much larger and more mature mineralized
   nodules. Taken together, we demonstrate dose dependent differences in
   the mineralization response of human and rat ADSCs to resveratrol
   treatment, suggesting that in vitro pre-conditioning of 3D
   adipose-derived stem cell constructs may be an effective strategy to
   promote osteogenic differentiation prior to implantation. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The use of tissue grafting for the repair of large bone defects has
   numerous limitations including donor site morbidity and the risk of
   disease transmission. These limitations have prompted research efforts
   to investigate the effects of combining biomaterial scaffolds with
   biochemical cues to augment bone repair. The goal of this study was to
   use a critically-sized rat femoral segmental defect model to investigate
   the efficacy of a delivery system consisting of an electrospun
   polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber mesh tube with a silk fibroin hydrogel
   for local recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) delivery.
   Bilateral 8 mm segmental femoral defects were formed in 13-week-old
   Sprague Dawley rats. Perforated electrospun PCL nanofiber mesh tubes
   were fitted into the adjacent native bone such that the lumen of the
   tubes contained the defect (Kolambkar et al., 2011b). Silk hydrogels
   with or without BMP-2 were injected into the defect. Bone regeneration
   was longitudinally assessed using 2D X-ray radiography and 3D
   microcomputed topography (mu CT). Following sacrifice at 12 weeks after
   surgery, the extracted femurs were either subjected to biomechanical
   testing or assigned for histology. The results demonstrated that silk
   was an effective carrier for BMP-2. Compared to the delivery system
   without BMP-2, the delivery system that contained BMP-2 resulted in more
   bone formation (p < 0.05) at 4, 8, 12 weeks after surgery. Biomechanical
   properties were also significantly improved in the presence of BMP-2 (p
   < 0.05) and were comparable to age-matched intact femurs. Histological
   evaluation of the defect region indicated that the silk hydrogel has
   been completely degraded by the end of the study. Based on these
   results, we conclude that a BMP-2 delivery system consisting of an
   electrospun PCL nanofiber mesh tube with a silk hydrogel presents an
   effective strategy for functional repair of large bone defects. (C) 2011

Title = {{A Numerical Investigation of Blood Damage in the Hinge Area of Aortic
   Bileaflet Mechanical Heart Valves During the Leakage Phase}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Previous experimental and numerical blood studies have shown that high
   shear stress levels, long exposure times to these shear stresses, and
   flow recirculation promote thromboembolism. Artificial heart valves, in
   particular bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs), are prone to
   developing thromboembolic complications. These complications often form
   at the hinge regions of BMHVs and the associated geometry has been shown
   to affect the local flow dynamics and the associated thrombus formation.
   However, to date no study has focused on simulating the motion of
   realistically modeled blood elements within the hinge region to
   numerically estimate the hinge-related blood damage. Consequently, this
   study aims at (a) simulating the motion of realistically modeled
   platelets during the leakage (mid-diastole) phase in different BMHV
   hinge designs placed in the aortic position and (b) quantitatively
   comparing the blood damage associated with different designs. Three
   designs are investigated to assess the effects of hinge geometry and
   dimensions: a 23 mm St. Jude Medical Regent (TM) valve hinge with two
   different gap distances between the leaflet ear and hinge recess; and a
   23 mm CarboMedics (CM) aortic valve hinge. The recently developed
   lattice-Boltzmann method with external boundary force method is used to
   simulate the hinge flow and capture the dynamics and surface shear
   stresses of individual platelets. A blood damage index (BDI) value is
   then estimated based on a linear shear stress-exposure time BDI model.
   The velocity boundary conditions are obtained from previous 3D
   large-scale simulations of the hinge flow fields. The trajectories of
   the blood elements in the hinge region are found to be qualitatively
   similar for all three hinges, but the shear stresses experienced by
   individual platelets are higher for the CM hinge design, leading to a
   higher BDI. The results of this study are also shown to be in good
   agreement with previous studies, thus validating the numerical method
   for future research in BMHV flows. This study provides a general
   numerical tool to optimize the hinge design based on both hemodynamic
   and thromboembolic performance.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most difficult challenges in medical imaging is the accurate
   segmentation of mineralized tissues. This process is complicated when
   studying developmental or regenerative processes due to the changes in
   mineral density that these tissues undergo over time. To address these
   limitations an algorithm was developed to enable the use of computed
   tomography (CT) to study tissues of varying and heterogeneous
   mineralization. To examine and validate this algorithm a study was
   performed on the development of murine cranial sutures. C57Bl/6J mice
   ranging in age from 6 to 25 days were imaged using micro-CT (mu CT). The
   algorithm was developed to segment the bones of both the posterior
   frontal (PF) and coronal (COR) sutures. For the curved COR suture, an
   addition to the algorithm was developed to reconstruct images that were
   perpendicular to the suture about all three axes. The algorithm showed
   excellent linear correlation (R (2) > 0.96) with serial histomorphometry
   and nearly a 1:1 relationship between all measures. The algorithm was
   validated with serial histology. The algorithm showed that the PF suture
   fused between days 12 and 20 but then showed a significant increase in
   bone volume after day 20. The algorithm developed provides an accurate
   method to segment the irregular sutures of the mouse calvaria.}},

Abstract = {{Porous and nonporous supported liquid crystalline membranes were
   produced by impregnating porous cellulose nitrate supports with
   cholesteric liquid crystal (LC) materials consisting of
   4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) mixed with a cholesterol-based dopant
   (cholesteryl oleyl carbonate {[}COC], cholesteryl nonanoate {[}CN], or
   cholesteryl chloride {[}CC]). The membranes exhibit selectivity for
   R-phenylglycine and R-1-phenylethanol because of increased interactions
   between the S enantiomers and the left-handed cholesteric phase. The
   selectivity of both phenylglycine and 1-phenylethanol in 5CB/CN
   membranes decreases with effective pore diameter while the
   permeabilities increase, as expected. Phenylglycine, which is insoluble
   in the LC phase, exhibits no transport in the nonporous (completely
   filled) membranes; however, 1-phenylethanol, which is soluble in the LC
   phase, exhibits transport but negligible enantioselectivity. The
   enantioselectivity for 1-phenylethanol was higher (1.20 in 5CB/COC and
   5CB/CN membranes) and the permeability was lower in the cholesteric
   phase than in the isotropic phase. Enantioselectivity was also higher in
   the 5CB/COC cholesteric phase than in the nematic phase of undoped 5CB
   (1.03). Enantioselectivity in the cholesteric phase of 5CB doped with CC
   (1.1), a dopant lacking hydrogen bonding groups, was lower than in the
   5CB/COC phases. Finally, enantioselectivity increases with the dopant
   concentration up to a plateau value at approximately 17?mol\%. Chirality

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are potentially the most efficient and

   understanding of coking and its prevention. Here we report Raman
   spectroscopic mapping and monitoring of carbon deposition on SOFC anode
   surfaces under both ex situ and in situ conditions. Carbon mapping was
   successfully demonstrated with a model Ni-YSZ electrode exposed to a
   CH4-containing atmosphere at high temperature (625 degrees C), while
   carbon deposition over time in a wet C3H8 atmosphere was directly
   monitored on a similar anode system as well as a BaO-modified system.
   This spectroscopic technique provides valuable insight into the
   mechanism of carbon deposition, which is vital in achieving rational

Abstract = {{This paper describes an enhanced physics-inspired model to predict the
   life of the second-generation single crystal superalloy PWA 1484
   experiencing out-of-phase (OP) thermomechanical fatigue (TMF).
   Degradation due to either pure fatigue or a coupling between fatigue and
   environmental attack are the primary concerns under this loading. The
   life model incorporates the effects of material anisotropy by utilizing
   the inelastic shear strain on the slip system having the highest Schmid
   factor while accounting for the effects of temperature-dependent slip
   spacing and stress-assisted ?' depletion. Both conventional TMF and
   special bithermal fatigue (BiF) experiments were conducted to isolate
   and therefore better understand the interactions between these
   degradation mechanisms. The influences of crystallographic orientation,
   applied mechanical strain range, cycle maximum temperature and high
   temperature hold times were assessed. The resulting physics-inspired
   life estimation model for OP TMF and OP BiF predicts the number of
   cycles to crack initiation as a function of crystal orientation, applied
   strain amplitude and stresses, temperature, cycle time (including
   dwells), and surface roughness within a factor of 2.}},

Abstract = {{Classical work in model reference adaptive control for uncertain
   nonlinear dynamical systems with a radial basis function (RBF) neural
   network adaptive element does not guarantee that the network weights
   stay bounded in a compact neighborhood of the ideal weights when the
   system signals are not persistently exciting (PE). Recent work has
   shown, however, that an adaptive controller using specifically recorded
   data concurrently with instantaneous data guarantees boundedness without
   PE signals. However, the work assumes fixed RBF network centers, which
   requires domain knowledge of the uncertainty. Motivated by reproducing
   kernel Hilbert space theory, we propose an online algorithm for updating
   the RBF centers to remove the assumption. In addition to proving
   boundedness of the resulting neuro-adaptive controller, a connection is
   made between PE signals and kernel methods. Simulation results show
   improved performance.}},

Abstract = {{Spallation failure of oxide scale in high-temperature environment,
   usually occurring at the oxide-alloy interface, primarily originates
   from the interfacial defects such as cracks. At the same time, the
   substrate alloy usually experience plastic deformation during
   high-temperature oxidation process. In this study, we extend our
   previous work on stress-diffusion interaction in the oxidation of Fe-Cr
   alloys by including the inelastic deformation of alloys and use it to
   study the growth mechanism of a crack lying along oxide-alloy interface.
   The results predict that the plasticity of alloy helps to prevent the
   crack from growing. It is also found that faster diffusion of species
   will lead to higher level of interfacial failure driving force.
   Reduction of Cr ion diffusion in oxide by introduction of the reactive
   element in the alloy will help to prevent interfacial crack growth.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Endoscopic methods to perform intracardiac procedures are of
   enormous interest, with the introduction of transcatheter techniques for
   complex cardiac procedures. In the present study, we demonstrate the use
   of a novel transapical cardioscopy system to visualize intracardiac
   structures in a porcine model.
   Methods: The cardioscope was designed to mount a miniature CCD camera at
   its tip and was covered in a blunt convex Plexiglass top that allowed
   displacement and visualization of the tissue in front of the
   cardioscope. Transapical access for 11-mm cardioscopy was performed by
   way of a median sternotomy (n = 4) and minithoracotomy (n = 1) in an
   anesthetized porcine model, and various cardiac structures were imaged
   under beating heart conditions. The images from the camera were
   projected onto a monitor for the operator to guide cardioscope
   positioning.
   Results: Video images and identification of structures on the left side
   of an in vivo beating porcine heart were obtained. Initially, the
   papillary muscle and mitral valve components were evaluated. The left
   atrium was entered, and the pulmonary vein orifices and atrial appendage
   were confirmed. Next, the camera was positioned within the left
   ventricle, and the ventricular portion of the trileaflet aortic valve
   was inspected. Using direct visualization, the camera was passed into
   the proximal ascending aorta. The left and right coronary arteries were
   also visualized. A catheter was introduced by way of a side port to
   confirm the position of the aortic valve leaflets during visualization.
   The pig experienced no significant decrease in blood pressure and
   maintained a stable heart rate throughout the procedure. The port was
   removed, and the transapical incision was closed with minimal blood loss
   during the procedure and closure of the orifice.
   Conclusions: Transapical cardioscopy is a novel approach that allows for
   precise visualization of intracardiac structures within a beating
   porcine heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. This technique
   might allow for more successful minimally invasive valvular,
   intracardiac, or ascending aortic procedures without the use of
   radiation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012;144:231-4)}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Annuloplasty for functional tricuspid regurgitation may
   sometimes be ineffective because of chamber dilation and valve
   tethering. This study compared a novel technique, right ventricle
   (RV)-papillary muscle approximation, with annuloplasty in
   experimentally-produced tricuspid regurgitation.
   Methods: RVs of isolated porcine hearts (n = 10) were statically
   pressurized, which led to RV dilation and central tricuspid
   regurgitation. Regurgitant flow was measured with a saline
   solution-filled column. The head of the anterior papillary muscle was
   approximated to 4 points on the ventricular septum. Next, a prosthetic
   ring was implanted, and then RV-papillary muscle approximation was
   combined. Tricuspid annular dimension, RV geometry, and tricuspid valve
   tethering were analyzed with 3-dimensional echocardiography.
   Results: Tricuspid regurgitation (2270 +/- 186 mL/min) was reduced by
   RV-papillary muscle approximation alone (214 +/- 45 mL/min; P < .05)
   more than by annuloplasty alone (724 +/- 166 mL/min; P < .05). Combined
   RV-papillary muscle approximation and annuloplasty resulted in the least
   regurgitation (80 +/- 39 mL/min). RV-papillary muscle approximation
   reduced tricuspid septolateral diameter (25\%; P < .05), and annular
   area (23\%; P < .05), as did annuloplasty. RV-papillary muscle
   approximation also reduced RV sphericity index (33\%; P < .05) and
   tricuspid tethering height (54\%; P < .05), whereas annuloplasty did
   not. Direction of RV-papillary muscle approximation did not
   independently affect outcomes.
   Conclusions: This ex vivo study suggests that RV-papillary muscle
   approximation potentially repairs tricuspid regurgitation better than
   annuloplasty by improving ventricular sphericity and valve tethering as
   well as annular dimension. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012;144:235-42)}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and wettability of titanium (Ti) surfaces directly
   impact osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. These surface
   properties are important variables that control initial interactions of
   an implant with the physiological environment, potentially affecting
   osseointegration. The objective of this study was to use polyelectrolyte
   thin films to investigate how surface chemistry modulates response of
   human MG63 osteoblast-like cells to surface microstructure. Three
   polyelectrolytes, chitosan, poly(L-glutamic acid), and poly(L-lysine),
   were used to coat Ti substrates with two different microtopographies
   (PT, Sa = 0.37 mu m and SLA, Sa = 2.54 mu m). The polyelectrolyte
   coatings significantly increased wettability of PT and SLA without
   altering micron-scale roughness or morphology of the surface. Enhanced
   wettability of all coated PT surfaces was correlated with increased cell
   numbers whereas cell number was reduced on coated SLA surfaces. Alkaline
   phosphatase specific activity was increased on coated SLA surfaces than
   on uncoated SLA whereas no differences in enzyme activity were seen on
   coated PT compared to uncoated PT. Culture on chitosan-coated SLA
   enhanced osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin production. Integrin expression
   on smooth surfaces was sensitive to surface chemistry, but microtexture
   was the dominant variable in modulating integrin expression on SLA.
   These results suggest that surface wettability achieved using different
   thin films has a major role in regulating osteoblast response to Ti, but
   this is dependent on the microtexture of the substrate. (C) 2012

Title = {{Analysis of Sandwich Beams With a Compliant Core and With In-Plane
   Rigidity-Extended High-Order Sandwich Panel Theory Versus Elasticity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{A new one-dimensional high-order theory for orthotropic elastic sandwich
   beams is formulated. This new theory is an extension of the high-order
   sandwich panel theory (HSAPT) and includes the in-plane rigidity of the
   core. In this theory, in which the compressibility of the soft core in
   the transverse direction is also considered, the displacement field of
   the core has the same functional structure as in the high-order sandwich
   panel theory. Hence, the transverse displacement in the core is of
   second order in the transverse coordinate and the in-plane displacements
   are of third order in the transverse coordinate. The novelty of this
   theory is that it allows for three generalized coordinates in the core
   (the axial and transverse displacements at the centroid of the core and
   the rotation at the centroid of the core) instead of just one (midpoint
   transverse displacement) commonly adopted in other available theories.
   It is proven, by comparison to the elasticity solution, that this
   approach results in superior accuracy, especially for the cases of
   stiffer cores, for which cases the other available sandwich
   computational models cannot predict correctly the stress fields
   involved. Thus, this theory, referred to as the ``extended high-order
   sandwich panel theory{''} (EHSAPT), can be used with any combinations of
   core and face sheets and not only the very ``soft{''} cores that the
   other theories demand. The theory is derived so that all core/face sheet
   displacement continuity conditions are fulfilled. The governing
   equations as well as the boundary conditions are derived via a
   variational principle. The solution procedure is outlined and numerical
   results for the simply supported case of transverse distributed loading
   are produced for several typical sandwich configurations. These results
   are compared with the corresponding ones from the elasticity solution.
   Furthermore, the results using the classical sandwich model without
   shear, the first-order shear, and the earlier HSAPT are also presented
   for completeness. The comparison among these numerical results shows
   that the solution from the current theory is very close to that of the
   elasticity in terms of both the displacements and stress or strains,
   especially the shear stress distributions in the core for a wide range
   of cores. Finally, it should be noted that the theory is formulated for
   sandwich panels with a generally asymmetric geometric layout. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient intrinsic finite element approach for
   modeling and analyzing the forced dynamic response of helical springs.
   The finite element treatment employs intrinsic curvature (and strain)
   interpolation and vice rotation (and displacement) interpolation and,
   thus, can accurately and efficiently represent initially curved and
   twisted beams with a sparse number of elements. The governing equations
   of motion contain nonlinearities necessary for large curvatures. In
   addition, a constitutive model is developed, which captures coupling due
   to nonzero initial curvature and strain. The method is employed to
   efficiently study dynamically-loaded helical springs. Convergence
   studies demonstrate that a sparse number of elements accurately capture
   spring dynamic response, with more elements required to resolve higher
   frequency content, as expected. Presented results also document rich,
   amplitude-dependent frequency response. In particular, moderate loading
   amplitudes lead to the presence of secondary resonances (not captured by
   linearized models), while large loading amplitudes lead to complex
   dynamics and transverse buckling. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005820]}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Boom cranes are used for numerous material-handling and manufacturing
   processes in factories, shipyards, and construction sites. All cranes
   lift their payloads by hoisting them up using overhead suspension
   cables. Boom cranes move payloads by slewing their base about a vertical
   axis, luffing their boom in and out from the base, and changing the
   length of the suspension cable. These motions induce payload
   oscillation. The problem of payload oscillation becomes more challenging
   when the payload exhibits double-pendulum dynamics that produce two
   varying frequencies of oscillation. This paper studies the swing
   dynamics of such cranes. It also applies input shaping to reduce the
   two-mode oscillatory dynamics. Experiments confirm several of the
   interesting dynamic effects. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005933]}},

   test the emittance measurement facility, which includes a heated sample
   holder, a blackbody source, mirror assembly, a polarizer, and a
   Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer with different detectors. The
   measured emittance spectra of the Fabry-Perot structure exhibit peak

Abstract = {{A 25\% increase in bidimensional products (BPs) of tumor diameter has
   been used as a criterion for brain tumor progression. We studied
   intra-observer variability in measurements of BPs. Ten patients with
   contrast-enhancing glioblastoma multiforme underwent baseline and
   follow-up MR imaging. Seven observers measured BPs in various planes.
   Differences in BPs between scans were expressed as a percentage of
   baseline. This calculation was performed for both readings of the
   baseline and follow-up scans. Differences between change from baseline
   to follow-up on each reading (termed D values) were calculated for each
   reader (total of 196 D values). Median D value in each plane was
   calculated for each reader. Range of D values was 12.36-33.64\% in axial
   plane (average 10.63\%), 12.18-38.62\% in coronal plane (average
   26.84\%) and 15.12-35.48\% in sagittal plane (average 26.11\%). Across
   all planes, 88 (45\%) D values were > 25\%. When all imaging planes for
   any single observation were combined, in 76\% of cases, at least one D
   value of > 25\% was seen. Based on the high degree of intra-observer
   variability, tumor measurements producing an increase in BP of > 25\%
   can routinely be obtained solely by chance.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-terms between imaging and diffusion gradients, unaccounted for
   during tensor calculations, can lead to erroneous estimation of
   diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) in regions of isotropic and
   anisotropic diffusion. Cross-term of magnitude 136.8 +/- 1.6 s/mm(2),
   artificially introduced in the slice-encode direction, caused an
   increase in FA in isotropic phantom from 0.0546 +/- 0.0001 to 0.0996 +/-
   0.0001, while the change in chimpanzee brain depended on the orientation
   of the white matter (WM). Mean diffusivity (MD) remained unchanged in
   isotropic phantom, but increased by similar to 20\% in the WM due to
   cross-terms. A bias was observed in the principal eigenvectors in both
   phantom and chimpanzee brain, resulting in significant increase in
   midline crossing fibers along the bias than perpendicular to it in
   tractography in chimpanzee brain. Post hoc correction of these artifacts
   was achieved by estimating the cross-term factors using calibration
   scans on an isotropic phantom and modifying the b-matrix before tensor
   calculation. Upon correction, the FA and MD values closely resembled the
   values obtained from sequence without cross-terms, and the bias in
   principal eigenvectors was eliminated. Customized sequences involving
   large b-values, high-resolution imaging, or long diffusion or echo times
   should therefore be evaluated and any residual cross-terms corrected
   before implementation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{167-172}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a Kelvin probe based inspection technique which
   measures surface potentials (SP) at various illumination conditions and
   derives the delta surface potential (Delta Vsp) and surface band bending
   (phi) of photovoltaic (PV) cells. The Delta Vsp is the difference of
   surface potential measured in light and dark conditions respectively.
   The delta surface potential (Delta Vsp) is related to charge injection
   and carrier lifetime, while the surface band bending (phi) is associated
   with the surface condition. A white light and short wavelength light
   illuminations are used to distinguish the bulk effects from that of the
   surface.
   A scanning vibrating Kelvin probe system was built to image PV cells
   with and without illumination. Experiments were performed on both single
   crystalline silicon (sc-Si) and multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) cells.
   It is found that the sc-Si cells possess a higher Delta Vsp but a lower
   phi than that of mc-Si cells. The average Delta Vsp and phi are 350 mV
   and 50 mV for the sc-Si cells, and 280 mV and 110 mV for the mc-Si
   cells. Process defects on a surface could affect both parameters, and it
   is found that the Delta Vsp is not uniform and could be reduced to 170
   mV at a defect on the mc-Si cells. The high Delta Vsp and low phi(s) are
   expected to contribute to the high conversion efficiency on a cell. (C)

   construct the material manifold for several examples of bodies with

Abstract = {{Log-linear learning is a learning algorithm that provides guarantees on
   the percentage of time that the action profile will be at a potential
   maximizer in potential games. The traditional analysis of log-linear
   learning focuses on explicitly computing the stationary distribution and
   hence requires a highly structured environment. Since the appeal of
   log-linear learning is not solely the explicit form of the stationary
   distribution, we seek to address to what degree one can relax the
   structural assumptions while maintaining that only potential function
   maximizers are stochastically stable. In this paper, we introduce slight
   variants of log-linear learning that provide the desired asymptotic
   guarantees while relaxing the structural assumptions to include
   synchronous updates, time-varying action sets, and limitations in
   information available to the players. The motivation for these
   relaxations stems from the applicability of log-linear learning to the
   control of multi-agent systems where these structural assumptions are
   unrealistic from an implementation perspective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a synthetic polymer derived from polyvinyl
   acetate through partial or full hydroxylation. PVA is commonly used in
   medical devices due to its low protein adsorption characteristics,
   biocompatibility, high water solubility, and chemical resistance. Some
   of the most common medical uses of PVA are in soft contact lenses, eye
   drops, embolization particles, tissue adhesion barriers, and as
   artificial cartilage and meniscus. The purpose of this review is to
   evaluate the available published information on PVA with respect to its
   safety as a medical device implant material for cartilage replacement.
   The review includes historical clinical use of PVA in orthopedics, and
   in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies. Finally, the safety
   recommendation involving the further development of PVA cryogels for
   cartilage replacement is addressed. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes are often modified to be stable in the aqueous phase by
   adding extensive hydrophilic surface functional groups. The stability of
   such CNTs in water with soil or sediment is one critical factor
   controlling their environmental fate. We conducted a series of
   experiments to quantitatively assess the association between water
   dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and three soil minerals
   (kaolinite, smectite, or shale) in aqueous solution under different
   sodium concentrations. C-14-labeling was used in these experiments to
   unambiguously quantify MWCNTs. The results showed that increasing ionic
   strength strongly promoted the removal of MWCNTs from aqueous phase. The
   removal tendency is inversely correlated with the soil minerals' surface
   potential and directly correlated with their hydrophobicity. This
   removal can be interpreted by the extended
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) theory especially for kaolinite
   and smectite. Shale, which contains large and insoluble organic
   materials, sorbed MWCNTs the most strongly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The lithographic characteristics of electron-beam (e-beam)-induced
   cross-linking of an epoxy-polynorbornene (PNB) mixture were studied in
   an effort to explore the feasibility of using this material as a
   high-contrast, high-sensitivity e-beam-imageable dielectric material.
   High resolution (for isolated lines) and e-beam sensitivity were
   obtained for specific mixtures of PNB-epoxy materials. The interaction
   of an electron beam with the PNB mixture, which includes epoxy
   cross-linkers, a photoacid generator (PAG), and a sensitizer, was
   investigated. The contribution of each of the components to the
   contrast, resolution for isolated lines, and e-beam sensitivity was
   evaluated. Cross-linking of the irradiated PNB polymer, by itself, was
   found to occur at relatively high e-beam doses. The primary route to
   high sensitivity was through epoxy ring-opening and PNB cross-linking by
   e-beam activation of the PAG. The effects of the post-exposure bake and
   aqueous-develop conditions on the lithographic characteristics were
   investigated. Physical structures with critical dimension of 100 nm to
   500 nm were fabricated with line edge roughness of 13.5 nm. Contrast
   values as high as approximately 8 were obtained at doses as low as 0.38

Abstract = {{The hypothesis is that leveraging automated data collection technology
   for site status analysis would play a more significant role in advancing
   decision making in construction projects if applied to traditional labor
   intensive management work tasks. Such manual data record keeping is, for
   example, progress tracking measurements and reporting of daily work
   status and process flows. Recent research on material tracking has
   demonstrated that the implementation of automated material tracking
   technology is feasible. Studies have yet to demonstrate whether the same
   or other technology can be used on other resource types, including
   workers, and furthermore, in advancing technology that works
   bi-directional: (1) collect and analyze data, and (2) return automated
   feedback to the decision makers at the management or even the workforce
   level. Despite a rigorous cost-benefit, hardware reliability and safety
   tests, implementation of technology in field operations is often
   performed on an as-needs basis. Project based case studies are effective
   research tools to measure the benefits and barriers that technology
   comes with. This paper will demonstrate results to the design,
   development, and furthermore and mainly, the effective and affordable
   implementation of a state-of-the-art wireless passive RFID-based
   technology system that collects and distributes information from and to
   decision makers. The developed technology was tested for several
   consecutive months on more than 50 construction workers, material carts
   and work related items, and personnel and material lifts that were
   critical in a high-rise building renovation project. Metrics to measure
   success in the phases of data collection, the signal and data
   processing, and in the use of newly generated or already available
   information for advanced decision making based on passive RFID
   technology will be presented. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices based on electro-thermal
   actuation have been used over the past few years to perform tensile
   tests on nanomaterials. However, previous MEMS designs only allowed
   small (e.g., < 100 nm) total displacement range without a significant
   increase in temperature near the nanospecimens (< 20A degrees C),
   thereby limiting the design of the load sensor or the range of
   nanomaterials to test. Here we characterize the thermo-mechanical
   behavior of three MEMS devices, using optical displacement measurements,
   micro-Raman temperature measurements, and finite element modeling. We
   observe the increase in temperature near the nanospecimen gap per
   displacement of thermal actuator to linearly decrease with the distance
   between nanospecimen gap and thermal actuator. We also present a MEMS
   device that can provide up to 1.6 mu m of total displacement with less
   than 10A degrees C increase in temperature near the nanospecimens, more
   than one order of magnitude improvement with respect to previously
   published MEMS material testing setups. This MEMS device can be used for
   accurate, temperature-controlled tensile testing of nanocrystalline

Abstract = {{It has recently been shown that the dynamics of complex interfaces can
   be treated by hyperelastic finite deformation, and the Cauchy stress
   tensor can be written as a tensor derivative of the interfacial energy.
   In the present study, the analytical nature of this tensor derivative
   was further explored, resulting in a more useful constitutive relation
   between the stress tensor and the Finger strain tensor. To accommodate
   the interfacial relaxation effects, an energy balance principle was
   adopted in developing a nonlinear relaxation model which was then used
   in a visco-hyperelastic formulation for stress determination. Case
   studies on this visco-hyperelastic model were performed, and validations
   against known results were attempted. While at small deformation rates,
   the new model agrees with the linear viscoelastic calculations, as well
   as Doi and Ohta's scaling predictions, high nonlinearity was observed at
   large deformation rates. (C) 2012 The Society of Rheology.

Abstract = {{Fracture healing is highly sensitive to mechanical conditions; however,
   the effects of mechanical loading on large bone defect regeneration have
   not been evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effects of
   functional loading on repair of critically sized segmental bone defects.
   About 6-mm defects were created in rat femora, and each defect received
   5 mu g recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2),
   delivered in alginate hydrogel. Limbs were stabilized by either stiff
   fixation plates for the duration of the study or compliant plates that
   allowed transfer of compressive ambulatory loads beginning at week 4.
   Healing was assessed by digital radiography, microcomputed tomography,
   mechanical testing, histology, and finite element modeling. Loading
   significantly increased regenerate bone volume and average polar moment
   of inertia. The response to loading was location-dependent with the
   polar moment of inertia increased at the proximal end of the defect but
   not the distal end. As a result, torsional stiffness was 58\% higher in
   the compliant plate group, but failure torque was not altered. In single
   samples assessed for histology from each group, a qualitatively greater
   amount of cartilage and a lesser degree of remodeling to lamellar bone
   occurred in the loaded group compared to the stiff plate group. Finally,
   principal strain histograms, calculated by FE modeling, revealed that
   the compliant plate samples had adapted to more efficiently distribute
   loads in the defects. Together, these data demonstrate that functional
   transfer of axial loads alters BMP-induced large bone defect repair by
   increasing the amount and distribution of bone formed within the defect.

Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{789-802}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The primary objective of cooperation in cognitive radio (CR) networks is
   to increase the spectrum access efficiency and improve the network
   performance. However, Byzantine adversaries or unintentional erroneous
   conduct in cooperation can lead to destructive behavior of CR users that
   can decrease their own and others' performances. This work presents a
   dynamic solution for cooperation reliability in conditions with
   constraints typical for a CR network. Specifically, in CR networks, the
   information on the success of cooperation can be limited only to cases
   with interference; when malicious, cooperators can be completely
   non-correlated and can alter behavior; and the set of available
   cooperators can dynamically change in time. In order to face these
   challenges, each CR user autonomously decides with whom to cooperate by
   learning cooperators behavior with a reinforcement learning (RL)
   algorithm. This RL algorithm determines the suitability of the available
   cooperators, and selects the most appropriate ones to cooperate with the
   objective to increase the efficiency of spectrum access in CR networks.
   The simulation results demonstrate the learning capabilities of the
   proposed solution and especially its reliable behavior under highly
   unreliable conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and analyze a new class of estimators for the variance
   parameter of a steady-state simulation output process. The new
   estimators are computed by averaging individual estimators from
   ``folded{''} standardized time series based on overlapping batches
   composed of consecutive observations. The folding transformation on each
   batch can be applied more than once to produce an entire set of
   estimators. We establish the limiting distributions of the proposed
   estimators as the sample size tends to infinity while the ratio of the
   sample size to the batch size remains constant. We give analytical and
   Monte Carlo results showing that, compared to their counterparts
   computed from nonoverlapping batches, the new estimators have roughly
   the same bias but smaller variance. In addition, these estimators can be
   computed with order-of-sample-size work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Large-scale porous SiC was fabricated by a combination of Pt-assisted
   etching and reactive ion etching. It was found that the surface
   roughness of combined etchings increased dramatically in comparison with
   metal-assisted etching or reactive ion etching only. To reduce the
   surface energy, the porous SiC surface was functionalized with
   perfluorooctyl trichlorosilane, resulting in a superhydrophobic SiC
   surface with a contact angle of 169.2 degrees and a hysteresis of 2.4
   degrees. The superhydrophobicity of the SiC surface showed a good
   long-term stability in an 85 degrees C/85\% humidity chamber. Such
   superhydrophobicity was also stable in acidic or basic solutions, and
   the pH values showed little or no effect on the SiC surface status. In
   addition, enhancement of porosity-induced photoluminescence intensity
   was found in the superhydrophobic SiC samples. The robust
   superhydrophobic SiC surfaces may have a great potential for microfluid
   device, thermal ground plane, and biosensor applications.}},

Abstract = {{Microneedle delivery of nucleic acids, in particular plasmid DNA (pDNA),
   to the skin represents a potential new approach for the clinical
   management of genetic skin diseases and cutaneous cancers, and for
   intracutaneous genetic immunisation. In this study excised human skin
   explants were used to investigate and optimise key parameters that will
   determine stable and effective microneedle-facilitated pDNA delivery.
   These include (i) high dose-loading of pDNA onto microneedle surfaces,
   (ii) stability and functionality of the coated pDNA, (iii) skin
   penetration capability of pDNA-coated microneedles, and (iv) efficient
   gene expression in human skin. Optimisation of a dip-coating method
   enabled significant increases in the loading capacity, up to 100 mu g of
   pDNA per 5-microneedle array. Coated microneedles were able to
   reproducibly perforate human skin at low (>1 N) insertion forces. The
   physical stability of the coated pDNA was partially compromised on
   storage, although this was improved through the addition of saccharide
   excipients without detriment to the biological functionality of pDNA.
   The pDNA-coated microneedles facilitated reporter gene expression in
   viable human skin. The efficiency of gene expression from coated
   microneedles will depend upon suitable DNA loading, efficient and
   reproducible skin puncture and rapid in situ dissolution of the plasmid
   at the site of delivery. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thalamic neurons respond to visual scenes by generating synchronous
   spike trains on the timescale of 10-20 ms that are very effective at
   driving cortical targets. Here we demonstrate that this synchronous
   activity contains unexpectedly rich information about fundamental
   properties of visual stimuli. We report that the occurrence of
   synchronous firing of cat thalamic cells with highly overlapping
   receptive fields is strongly sensitive to the orientation and the
   direction of motion of the visual stimulus. We show that this stimulus
   selectivity is robust, remaining relatively unchanged under different
   contrasts and temporal frequencies (stimulus velocities). A
   computational analysis based on an integrate-and-fire model of the
   direct thalamic input to a layer 4 cortical cell reveals a strong
   correlation between the degree of thalamic synchrony and the nonlinear
   relationship between cortical membrane potential and the resultant
   firing rate. Together, these findings suggest a novel population code in
   the synchronous firing of neurons in the early visual pathway that could
   serve as the substrate for establishing cortical representations of the
   visual scene.}},

   With pump power of 4.6 W and sample irradiance of 310 mW, we achieved

   imaged 200 nm nanospheres as well as all three cytoskeletal elements

   demonstrating the resolving power of synchronization-free STED over
   conventional diffraction limited imaging. It also allowed us to discover
   that, Dylight 650, exhibits improved performance over ATTO647N, a
   fluorophore frequently used in STED. Furthermore, we applied
   synchronization-free STED to image fluorescently-labeled intracellular
   viral RNA granules, which otherwise cannot be differentiated by confocal

Abstract = {{Direct capture of CO2 from air is a concept that, if successfully
   implemented, could lead to capture of CO2 from disperse sources. We have
   developed process models to consider the viability of adsorption-based
   air capture technologies. Our models focus on using an amino-modified
   silica adsorbent, TRI-PE-MCM-41, and a structured monolithic contactor
   unit. We have studied several different temperature swing adsorption
   processes using the purity of CO2 and annual product throughput as
   metrics for comparing process performance. This analysis identifies some
   of the operational parameters, adsorbent characteristics, and other
   factors that have a significant effect on the performance of the
   process. Using the total energy requirement of the process and available
   sources of energy, such as low pressure steam and electricity, we carry
   out an economic analysis to obtain a net operating cost for air capture
   of CO2. We identify a process with a daily throughput of similar to 1.1
   t CO2 at 88.5\% purity using standard shipping container sized air
   capture units. The total energy required (6745 MJ/t CO2) is dominated by
   the parasitic losses-sensible heat requirements of the contactor (40\%)
   and the adsorbent (28\%) and not by the mechanical energy associated
   with air flow (similar to 5\%). On the basis of our analysis of factors
   such as source of electricity, availability of low pressure steam, and
   geographic location, the net operating cost of capture is estimated to
   be similar to\$100/t CO2. These cost estimates do not include capital
   expenses necessary to construct or maintain the air capture units.
   Potential strategies for further reducing the energy and monetary cost
   of these processes are identified. Our analysis supports continued work
   to establish the technological and economic feasibility of
   adsorption-based air capture.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a nonlinear computational modeling approach for the
   behaviors of structural systems subjected to fire. The proposed modeling
   approach consists of fire dynamics analysis, nonlinear transient-heat
   transfer analysis for predicting thermal distributions, and
   thermomechanical analysis for structural behaviors. For concretes,
   transient heat formulations are written considering temperature
   dependent heat conduction and specific heat capacity and included within
   the thermomechanical analyses. Also, temperature dependent stress-strain
   behaviors including compression hardening and tension softening effects
   are implemented within the analyses. The proposed modeling technique for
   transient heat and thermomechanical analyses is first validated with
   experimental data of reinforced concrete (RC) beams subjected to high
   temperatures, and then applied to a bridge model. The bridge model is
   generated to simulate the fire incident occurred by a gas truck on April
   29, 2007 in Oakland California, USA. From the simulation, not only
   temperature distributions and deformations of the bridge can be found,
   but critical locations and time frame where collapse occurs can be
   predicted. The analytical results from the simulation are qualitatively
   compared with the real incident and show good agreements.}},

Abstract = {{Organicinorganic composite proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are of
   interest in fuel cell applications because of potential benefits in
   conductivity, mechanical, and transport properties that may be imparted
   by the inorganic component. Our previous work showed that polymeric
   membranes based on blends of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and
   cross-linked sulfonated acrylic polyelectrolytes (PE) compare favorably
   against the proton conductivity and mechanical properties of commercial
   perfluorosulfonic acid-based PEMs. One problem found in the previous
   study was that crystalline regions in homopolymers of PVDF interfered
   with the formation of proton conducting pathways by the PE component. In
   this study, we explore the ability to use proton-conductive
   zirconium-based inorganic particles to improve conductivity in such
   PVDF/PE membranes. Three different particles were considered, namely,
   zirconium oxide, zirconium hydroxide sulfate, and zirconium hydrogen
   phosphate. Dispersion of particles in the polymer matrix was limited,
   resulting in severe aggregation at particle loadings above 5 wt \%.
   Nevertheless, a general improvement in proton conductivity was evidenced
   in composite membranes with 0.5 to 1 wt \% particle loadings. This
   beneficial effect was particularly noticeable in membranes manufactured
   from highly crystalline PVDF homopolymers (7 to 14\% increase). We
   propose that the surface of zirconium particles act to provide proton
   conducting pathways between PE regions that otherwise would become
   blocked due to PVDF crystallization. In addition to conductivity,
   composite membranes exhibited enhancement of tensile properties at
   identical particle loadings, especially in membranes containing more
   flexible PVDF:HFP copolymers, where a reinforcing stiffening effect was
   evident (19 to 22\% elastic modulus increment). (C) 2012 Wiley

Title = {{Potential role of inorganic polyphosphate in the cycling of phosphorus
   within the hypoxic water column of Effingham Inlet, British Columbia}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{The upper basin of Effingham Inlet possesses permanently anoxic bottom
   waters, with a water column redox transition zone typically occurring at
   least 40 m above the sediment-water interface. During our sampling
   campaign in April and July 2007, this redox transition zone was
   associated with sharp peaks in a variety of parameters, including
   soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total particulate phosphorus
   (TPP). Based on sequential extraction results, TPP maxima exhibited
   preferential accumulation of an operationally defined class of loosely
   adsorbed organic phosphorus (P), which may contain a substantial
   fraction of polyphosphate (poly-P). This poly-P may furthermore be
   involved in the redox-dependent remobilization of SRP. For example,
   direct fluorometric analysis of poly-P content revealed that particulate
   inorganic poly-P was present at concentrations ranging from 1 to 9 nM P
   within and several meters above the TPP maximum. Below the depth of 1\%
   oxygen saturation, however, particulate inorganic poly-P was
   undetectable (<0.8 nM in situ). Assuming this concentration profile
   reflects the remineralization of inorganic poly-P to SRP across the
   redox transition, inorganic poly-P degradation accounted for as much as
   4 +/- 3\% (average +/- standard deviation) to 9 +/- 8\% of the vertical
   turbulent diffusive SRP flux. This finding is a conservative estimate
   due in part to sample storage effects associated with our analysis of
   poly-P content. By comparison, iron-linked P cycling accounted for at
   most 65 +/- 33\% of the diffusive SRP flux, leaving similar to 25\%
   unaccounted for. Thus, while redox-sensitive poly-P remineralization in
   Effingham Inlet appears modest based on our direct conservative
   estimate, it may be higher from a mass balance viewpoint. Poly-P cycling
   may therefore be an overlooked mechanism for the redox-sensitive cycling
   of P in some hypoxic/anoxic boundaries, especially iron-poor marine
   oxygen minimum zones.}},

Title = {{High performance transcription factor-DNA docking with GPU computing}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Protein-DNA docking is a very challenging problem in
   structural bioinformatics and has important implications in a number of
   applications, such as structure-based prediction of transcription factor
   binding sites and rational drug design. Protein-DNA docking is very
   computational demanding due to the high cost of energy calculation and
   the statistical nature of conformational sampling algorithms. More
   importantly, experiments show that the docking quality depends on the
   coverage of the conformational sampling space. It is therefore desirable
   to accelerate the computation of the docking algorithm, not only to
   reduce computing time, but also to improve docking quality.
   Methods: In an attempt to accelerate the sampling process and to improve
   the docking performance, we developed a graphics processing unit
   (GPU)-based protein-DNA docking algorithm. The algorithm employs a
   potential-based energy function to describe the binding affinity of a
   protein-DNA pair, and integrates Monte-Carlo simulation and a simulated
   annealing method to search through the conformational space. Algorithmic
   techniques were developed to improve the computation efficiency and
   scalability on GPU-based high performance computing systems.
   Results: The effectiveness of our approach is tested on a non-redundant
   set of 75 TF-DNA complexes and a newly developed TF-DNA docking
   benchmark. We demonstrated that the GPU-based docking algorithm can
   significantly accelerate the simulation process and thereby improving
   the chance of finding near-native TF-DNA complex structures. This study
   also suggests that further improvement in protein-DNA docking research
   would require efforts from two integral aspects: improvement in
   computation efficiency and energy function design.
   Conclusions: We present a high performance computing approach for
   improving the prediction accuracy of protein-DNA docking. The GPU-based
   docking algorithm accelerates the search of the conformational space and
   thus increases the chance of finding more near-native structures. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first ad hoc effort of applying GPU
   or GPU clusters to the protein-DNA docking problem.}},

Abstract = {{The extended photooxidation of and secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
   formation from dodecane (C12H26) under low-NOx conditions, such that RO2
   + HO2 chemistry dominates the fate of the peroxy radicals, is studied in
   the Caltech Environmental Chamber based on simultaneous gas and
   particle-phase measurements. A mechanism simulation indicates that
   greater than 67\% of the initial carbon ends up as fourth and higher
   generation products after 10 h of reaction, and simulated trends for
   seven species are supported by gas-phase measurements. A characteristic
   set of hydroperoxide gas-phase products are formed under these low-NOx
   conditions. Production of semivolatile hydroperoxide species within
   three generations of chemistry is consistent with observed initial
   aerosol growth. Continued gas-phase oxidation of these semivolatile
   species produces multifunctional low volatility compounds. This study
   elucidates the complex evolution of the gas-phase photooxidation
   chemistry and subsequent SOA formation through a novel approach
   comparing molecular level information from a chemical ionization mass
   spectrometer (CIMS) and high m/z ion fragments from an Aerodyne
   high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS).
   Combination of these techniques reveals that particle-phase chemistry
   leading to peroxyhemiacetal formation is the likely mechanism by which
   these species are incorporated in the particle phase. The current
   findings are relevant toward understanding atmospheric SOA formation and
   aging from the ``unresolved complex mixture,{''} comprising, in part,
   long-chain alkanes.}},

Title = {{Kinetics of Elementary Steps in the Reactions of Atomic Bromine with
   Isoprene and 1,3-Butadiene under Atmospheric Conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{24, SI}},
Pages = {{6341-6357}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Laser flash photolysis of CF2Br2 has been coupled with time-resolved
   detection of atomic bromine by resonance fluorescence spectroscopy to
   investigate the gas-phase kinetics of early elementary steps in the
   Br-initiated oxidations of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, Iso) and
   1,3-butadiene (Bu) under atmospheric conditions. At T >= 526 K, measured
   rate coefficients for Br + isoprene are independent of pressure,
   suggesting that hydrogen transfer (1a) is the dominant reaction pathway.
   The following Arrhenius expression adequately describes all kinetic data
   at 526 K <= T <= 673 K: k(1a)(T) = (1.22 +/- 0.57) x 10(-11)
   exp{[}(-2100 +/- 280)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (uncertainties are 2
   sigma and represent precision of the Arrhenius parameters). At 271 K <=
   T <= 357 K, kinetic evidence for the reversible addition reactions Br +
   Iso Br-Iso (k(1b), k(-1b)) and Br + Bu <-> Br-Bu (k(3b), k(-3b)) is
   observed. Analysis of the approach to equilibrium data allows the
   temperature- and pressure-dependent rate coefficients k(1b), k(3b), and
   k(-3b) to be evaluated. At atmospheric pressure, addition of Br to each
   conjugated diene occurs with a near-gas-kinetic rate coefficient.
   Equilibrium constants for the addition/dissociation reactions are
   obtained from k(1b)/k(-1b) and k(3b)/k(-3b), respectively. Combining the
   experimental equilibrium data with electronic structure calculations
   allows both second- and third-law analyses of thermochemistry to be
   carried out. The following thermochemical parameters for the addition
   reactions 1b and 3b at 0 and 298 K are obtained (units are kJ mol(-1)
   for Delta H-r and J mol(-1) K-1 for Delta S-r; uncertainties are
   accuracy estimates at the 95\% confidence level): Delta H-r(0)(1b) =
   -66.6 +/- 7.1, Delta H-r(298)(1b) =-67.5 +/- 6.6, and Delta S-r(298)(3b)
   = -93 +/- 16; Delta H-r(0)(3b) = -62.4 +/- 9.0, Delta H-r(298)(3b) =
   -64.5 +/- 8.5, and Delta S-r(298)(3b) = 94 +/- 20. Examination of the
   effect of added O-2 on Br kinetics under conditions where reversible
   adduct formation is observed allows the rate coefficients for the Br-Iso
   + O-2 (k(2)) and Br-Bu + O-2 (k(4)) reactions to be determined. At 298
   K, we find that k(2) = (3.2 +/- 1.0) x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)
   independent of pressure (uncertainty is 2 sigma, precision only;
   pressure range is 25-700 Torr) whereas k(4) increases from 3.2 to 4.7 x
   10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) as the pressure increases from 25 to
   700 Torr. Our results suggest that under atmospheric conditions, Br-Iso
   and Br-Bu react with O-2 to produce peroxy radicals considerably more
   rapidly than they undergo unimolecular decomposition. Hence, the very
   fast addition reactions appear to control the rates of Br-initiated
   formation of Br-Iso-OO and Br-Bu-OO radicals under atmospheric
   conditions.
   The peroxy radicals are relatively weakly bound, so conjugated diene
   regeneration via unimolecular decomposition reactions, though
   unimportant on the time scale of the reported experiments
   (milliseconds), is likely to compete effectively with bimolecular
   reactions of peroxy radicals under relatively warm atmospheric
   conditions as well as in 298 K competitive kinetics experiments carried
   out in large chambers.}},

Abstract = {{Multibeam interference represents an approach for producing one-, two-,
   and three-dimensional periodic optical-intensity distributions with
   submicrometer features and periodicities. Accordingly, interference
   lithography (IL) has been used in a wide variety of applications,
   typically requiring additional lithographic steps to modify the periodic
   interference pattern and create integrated functional elements. In the
   present work, pattern-integrated interference lithography (PIIL) is
   introduced. PIIL is the integration of superposed pattern imaging with
   IL. Then a pattern-integrated interference exposure system (PIIES) is
   presented that implements PIIL by incorporating a projection imaging
   capability in a novel three-beam interference configuration. The purpose
   of this system is to fabricate, in a single-exposure step, a
   two-dimensional periodic photonic-crystal lattice with nonperiodic
   functional elements integrated into the periodic pattern. The design of
   the basic system is presented along with a model that simulates the
   resulting optical-intensity distribution at the system sample plane
   where the three beams simultaneously interfere and integrate a
   superposed image of the projected mask pattern. Appropriate performance
   metrics are defined in order to quantify the characteristics of the
   resulting photonic-crystal structure. These intensity and lattice-vector
   metrics differ markedly from the metrics used to evaluate traditional
   photolithographic imaging systems. Simulation and experimental results
   are presented that demonstrate the fabrication of example
   photonic-crystal structures in a single-exposure step. Example
   well-defined photonic-crystal structures exhibiting favorable intensity
   and lattice-vector metrics demonstrate the potential of PIIL for
   fabricating dense integrated optical circuits. (C) 2012 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Changes in the local mechanical environment and tissue mechanical
   properties affect the biological activity of cells and play a key role
   in a variety of diseases, such as cancer, arthritis, nephropathy, and
   cardiovascular disease. Constitutive relations have long been used to
   predict the local mechanical environment within biological tissues and
   to investigate the relationship between biological responses and
   mechanical stimuli. Recent constitutive relations for soft tissues
   consider both material and structural properties by incorporating
   parameters that describe microstructural organization, such as fiber
   distributions, fiber angles, fiber crimping, and constituent volume
   fractions. The recently developed technique of imaging the
   microstructure of a single artery as it undergoes multiple deformations
   provides quantitative structural data that can reduce the number of
   estimated parameters by using parameters that are truly experimentally
   intractable. Here, we employed nonlinear multiphoton microscopy to
   quantify collagen fiber organization in mouse carotid arteries and
   incorporated measured fiber distribution data into structurally
   motivated constitutive relations. Microscopy results demonstrate that
   collagen fibers deform in an affine manner over physiologically relevant
   deformations. The incorporation of measured fiber angle distributions
   into constitutive relations improves the model's predictive accuracy and
   does not significantly reduce the goodness of fit. The use of measured
   structural parameters rather than estimated structural parameters
   promises to improve the predictive capabilities of the local mechanical
   environment, and to extend the utility of intravital imaging methods for
   estimating the mechanical behavior of tissues using in situ structural
   information.}},

Abstract = {{We study experimentally spontaneous pattern formation in a dry dense
   granular medium invaded by an aqueous glycerin solution in a radial
   Hele-Shaw cell. By varying the invading fluid viscosity via the weight
   concentration of glycerin, and by adjusting the normalized injection
   velocity via the injection rate and the gap size of the cell, we observe
   four distinct fluid-grain displacement regimes: (i) a simple radial flow
   regime, (ii) an infiltration-dominated regime, (iii) a grain
   displacement-dominated regime, and (iv) a viscous fingering-dominated
   regime. We argue that these displacement regimes emerge as a result of
   competition among the various energy dissipation mechanisms and can be
   classified based on the characteristic times involved in the injection
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly developing class of
   nanoporous materials with numerous applications in diverse fields such
   as chemical detection, hazardous gas detection, and carbon capture. Even
   though numerous articles have been written emphasizing the adsorption
   properties of these MOFs, their compatibility with respect to the
   sensing device has not been explored. While there are numerous types of
   sensing devices that could benefit from the use of MOF-based coatings to
   enhance sensitivity and selectivity, we are particularly interested in
   rnicrocantilevers because of the high sensitivity they can provide
   within a compact, lower-power architecture. In this paper, we address
   this need by analyzing the effect of the mechanical properties of MOFs
   on the sensor response. In particular, we are interested in the
   structural flexibility of MOFs, because this unique guest-induced
   property can be used for strain-induced sensing attribute of the
   microcantilever. In this regard we examined the effects of important MOF
   mechanical properties such as the Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   density on the sensor response for a range of values representative of
   the MOFs available in the literature. From our analysis we determined
   that increasing the Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio improve the
   response, while the density of the MOF has a negligible effect on the
   cantilever response. In addition, we also examined the influence on
   cantilever response of the intermediate layer used to bind the MOF, from
   which we observe that SiO2 provides the best sensor response for a given
   MOF layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A scalable wet chemical process has been used to convert the intricate
   silica microshells (frustules) of diatoms into gold structures that
   retained the three-dimensional (3-D) frustule shapes and fine patterned
   features. Combined use of an amine-enriching surface functionalization
   protocol and electroless deposition yielded thin (<100 nm) conformal
   nanocrystalline gold coatings that, upon selective silica dissolution,
   were converted into freestanding gold structures with frustule-derived
   3-D morphologies. By selecting a diatom frustule template with a
   quasi-regular hexagonal pore pattern (Coscinodiscus asteromphalus, CA),
   gold replica structures possessing such pore patterns were produced that
   exhibited infrared transmission maxima/reflection minima that were not
   observed for the starting silica diatom frustules or for flat nonporous
   gold films; that is, such extraordinary optical transmission (EOT)
   resulted from the combined effects of the quasi-periodic hexagonal hole
   structure (inherited from the CA diatom frustules) and the gold
   chemistry. Calculated and measured IR transmission spectra obtained from
   planar gold films with quasi-periodic hexagonal CA-derived hole
   patterns, or with short-range periodic hexagonal hole patterns,
   indicated that the enhanced IR transmission exhibited by the gold CA
   frustule replicas was enabled by the generation and transmission of
   surface plasmons. This scalable bio-enabled process provides a new and
   attractive capability for fabricating self-supporting, responsive, 3-D
   metallic structures for use as dispersible/harvestable microparticles
   tailored for EOT-based applications.}},

Title = {{Unifying the criteria of elastic stability of solids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{The elastic stability criterion formulated by Born is based on the
   convexity requirement of the equilibrium free energy F of a stress-free
   crystal under small strain fluctuation, that demands the elastic
   constant tensor C to be positive definite, vertical bar C vertical bar >
   0. For a crystal subject to an external stress, Hill specifies that for
   the crystal to be stable, the difference between its internal energy
   change delta E and the work done to the system delta W must be positive,
   i.e. delta E - delta W > 0. Polanyi, Frenkel, and Orowan proposed a
   different stability criterion based on stress increment for a loaded
   system, tau(epsilon + Delta epsilon) - tau(epsilon) > 0 until the limit
   is reached at d tau/d epsilon = 0. Although known empirically, the
   formal connection between the different criteria has not been
   established rigorously. Using finite deformation theory, we show quite
   simply that the different formulations of the stability criteria
   originate from the same necessary condition for the convexity of the
   free energy of the system subject to external loading, f = F - W.
   However, in practice caution must be taken in implementation of the
   different criteria; they may lead to quite different results, especially
   when stability bifurcation occurs.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical factors influencing iron solubility (soluble iron/total
   iron) were investigated in source emission (e.g., biomass burning, coal
   fly ash, mineral dust, and mobile exhaust) and ambient (Atlanta, GA)
   fine particles (PM2.5). Chemical properties (speciation and mixing
   state) of iron-containing particles were characterized using X-ray
   absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and micro-X-ray
   fluorescence measurements. Bulk iron solubility (soluble iron/total
   iron) of the samples was quantified by leaching experiments. Major
   differences were observed in iron solubility in source emission samples,
   ranging from low solubility (<1\%, mineral dust and coal fly ash) up to
   75\% (mobile exhaust and biomass burning emissions). Differences in iron
   solubility did not correspond to silicon content or Fe(II) content.
   However, source emission and ambient samples with high iron solubility
   corresponded to the sulfur content observed in single particles. A
   similar correspondence between bulk iron solubility and bulk sulfate
   content in a series of Atlanta PM2.5 fine particle samples (N = 358)
   further supported this trend. In addition, results of linear combination
   fitting experiments show the presence of iron sulfates in several high
   iron solubility source emission and ambient PM2.5 samples. These results
   suggest that the sulfate content (related to the presence of iron
   sulfates and/or acid-processing mechanisms by H2SO4) of iron-containing
   particles is an important proxy for iron solubility.}},

Abstract = {{This Article describes the synthesis of Ag nanobars with different
   aspect ratios using a seed-mediated method and evaluation of their use
   for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SEAS). The formation of Ag
   nanobars was found to critically depend on the introduction of a bromide
   compound into the reaction system, with ionic salts being more effective
   than covalent molecules. We examined single-crystal seeds with both
   spherical and cubic shapes and found that Ag nanobars grown from
   spherical seeds had much higher aspect ratios than those grown from
   cubic seeds. The typical product of a synthesis contained nanocrystals
   with three different morphologies: nanocubes, nanobars with a square
   cross section, and nanobars with a rectangular cross section. Their
   formation can be attributed to the difference in growth rates along the
   three orthogonal (100) directions. The SERS enhancement factor of the Ag
   nanobar was found to depend on its aspect ratio, its orientation
   relative to the laser polarization, and the wavelength of excitation.}},

Abstract = {{In the study of insect flight, adaptations to complex flight conditions
   such as wind and rain are poorly understood. Mosquitoes thrive in areas
   of high humidity and rainfall, in which raindrops can weigh more than 50
   times a mosquito. In this combined experimental and theoretical study,
   we here show that free-flying mosquitoes can survive the high-speed
   impact of falling raindrops. High-speed videography of those impacts
   reveals a mechanism for survival: A mosquito's strong exoskeleton and
   low mass renders it impervious to falling drops. The mosquito's low mass
   causes raindrops to lose little momentum upon impact and so impart
   correspondingly low forces to the mosquitoes. Our findings demonstrate
   that small fliers are robust to in-flight perturbations.}},

   mixtures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model is developed to simulate shock wave propagation in
   discrete Ni/Al powder mixtures. The model is used to investigate the
   particle-level deformation, heating, and mixing of two distinct Ni/Al
   powders, as mixing intensity dictates whether or not shock ignition is
   achieved in these reactive material systems. The main innovations of
   this work are (1) use of a rate-dependent, dislocation-based model of
   particle flow stress in the shock simulations and (2) quantitative
   analysis of the Ni/Al interfaces that are formed during wave
   propagation. An experimental powder, which is composed of micron-scale
   spherical Ni and Al particles, is simulated to validate the numerical
   model. An additional powder, composed of smaller particles, is simulated
   to investigate the effects of particle size on constituent deformation
   and mixing under shock wave loading. The simulations indicate that a
   reduction in particle size leads to increased Ni/Al interface
   temperature and dislocation density, as well as increased
   stress-sensitivity of Ni/Al interface formation. Finally, it is shown
   that accounting for the rate-dependence of particle flow stress likely
   yields improved accuracy in predicted flow morphologies, especially at
   intermediate stress wave amplitudes. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {{Impedance response and modeling of composites containing aligned
   semiconductor whiskers: Effects of dc-bias partitioning and
   percolated-cluster length, topology, and filler interfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Impedance spectroscopy and modeling were used to investigate the
   partitioning of 0-40V dc bias in composites containing alumina and
   different volume fractions of silicon carbide whiskers (SiCw), which
   formed low-connectivity percolated clusters. Differences in response
   between long (similar to 25 cm) composite rods and thin (similar to 1.7
   mm) slices thereof were interpreted in terms of the relative
   contributions to the impedance from the electrodes and SiCw-percolated
   clusters of the composite samples. Bias had minimal effect on the
   impedance of rods, because its distribution across the long percolated
   clusters within translated to low electric fields at the SiCw-SiCw
   interfaces. The impedance of thin slices was more sensitive to bias and
   was mainly due to such interfaces. The associated dc resistance and
   effective capacitance decreased significantly with increasing dc bias. A
   model for symmetrical Schottky energy barriers at interfaces fit the
   capacitance trend and outputted a parameter Phi(i)/(kappa) over bar (i):
   Different models for the non-linear current-voltage behavior were
   related to each other and indicated weak varistor-like behavior, i.e.,
   1.15 <= alpha(V) <= 2.57. With increasing SiCw content and composite dc
   conductivity, Phi(i)/(kappa) over bar (i) increased and the varistor
   non-linearity strength alpha(V) decreased. Also, the exponent t
   describing conductivity divergence at percolation was reduced at large
   dc bias. A new model of percolated clusters was proposed and correctly
   predicted the qualitative character and some quantitative aspects of
   these experimental results. The model is based on tendencies of the
   current distribution, which are expected from the topological structure
   and contrast between interface/whisker electrical behavior. Accordingly,
   it outputs the voltage-distribution tendencies. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{To increase the photoresponsive and gas sensing properties of ZnO
   nanofibers under UV illumination, Au nanoparticles were introduced to
   the ZnO nanofibers (Au/ZnO) using electrospinning technique. It is found
   that adding Au nanoparticles into the ZnO nanofibers enhances
   significantly the photoresponse and makes the nanofibers also respond to
   visible light. The gas sensing performance with the assist of UV
   irradiation at room temperature was also improved greatly, e.g., the
   sensor response (SR) for 5 ppm ethanol increases from 0.12 to 0.31 by
   introducing 0.20 mol\% of Au in ZnO nanofibers. The improvement of gas
   sensing performance is attributed to the enhanced photocatalytic
   reactions of organic gases on the Au/ZnO nanofibers surface. In
   addition, the sensitive behaviors of the nanofibers to ethanol, benzene,
   toluene and acetone under UV irradiation with different wavelengths were
   investigated and compared as well. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   crack-free LSM film include a substrate temperature of 600 degrees C and
   an argon pressure of 1.9 x 10(-2) mbar. Further, a testing cell with a
   dense LSM film, an YSZ electrolyte membrane, and a porous LSM counter
   electrode is prepared and the electrochemical properties of the dense
   LSM film on YSZ substrate are studied. It was found that the thickness,
   morphology, and microstructure of LSM films critically influence the
   electrochemical properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Codoping with Li+ has become a common method for improving optical
   efficiency in oxide-based upconversion luminescent materials, yet the
   mechanisms of enhancement have remained ambiguous. Herein, we delineate
   the major ways by which Li+ enhances visible-to-ultraviolet upconversion
   in the phosphor Y2SiO5:Pr3+ and quantify the relative contributions of
   each mechanism. Comparative photoluminescence spectroscopy, microscopy,
   and X-ray diffraction analyses show that of the total 9-fold increase in
   upconversion resulting from optimized Li+ doping similar to 5\% was due
   to crystallite enlargement, similar to 50\% due to a change in the host
   crystal polymorph, and similar to 45\% due to a reduction in activator
   ion clustering. Contrary to other studies, no significant upconversion
   enhancement arises from activator site geometry changes due to
   distortion by Li+, in the case of this material. To elucidate the role
   of Li+ doping in Y2SiO5, samples were prepared using other dopants for
   comparison, including Na+, Zn2+, Sc3+, and Zr4+.}},

   Topology}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Local network alignment is an important component of the analysis of
   protein-protein interaction networks that may lead to the identification
   of evolutionary related complexes. We present AlignNemo, a new algorithm
   that, given the networks of two organisms, uncovers subnetworks of
   proteins that relate in biological function and topology of
   interactions. The discovered conserved subnetworks have a general
   topology and need not to correspond to specific interaction patterns, so
   that they more closely fit the models of functional complexes proposed
   in the literature. The algorithm is able to handle sparse interaction
   data with an expansion process that at each step explores the local
   topology of the networks beyond the proteins directly interacting with
   the current solution. To assess the performance of AlignNemo, we ran a
   series of benchmarks using statistical measures as well as biological
   knowledge. Based on reference datasets of protein complexes, AlignNemo
   shows better performance than other methods in terms of both precision
   and recall. We show our solutions to be biologically sound using the
   concept of semantic similarity applied to Gene Ontology vocabularies.
   The binaries of AlignNemo and supplementary details about the algorithms
   and the experiments are available at: sourceforge.net/p/alignnemo.}},

Abstract = {{Water and ethanol vapor adsorption phenomena are investigated
   systematically on a series of MFI-type zeolites: silicalite-1 samples
   synthesized via both alkaline (OH-) and fluoride (F-) routes, and ZSM-5
   samples with different Si/Al ratios as well as different
   charge-balancing cations. Full isotherms (0.05-0.95 activity) over the
   range 25-55 degrees C are presented, and the lowest total water uptake
   ever reported in the literature is shown for silicalite-1 made via a
   fluoride-mediated route wherein internal silanol defects are
   significantly reduced. At a water activity level of 0.95 (35 degrees C),
   the total water uptake by silicalite-1 (F-) was found to be 0.263 mmol/g
   which was only 12.6\%, 9.8\%, and 3.3\% of the capacity for silicalite-1
   (OH-), H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al:140), and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al:15), respectively, under
   the same conditions. While water adsorption shows distinct isotherms for
   different MFI-type zeolites due to the difference in the concentration,
   distribution, and types of hydrophilic sites, the ethanol adsorption
   isotherms present relatively comparable results because of the overall
   organophilic nature of the zeolite framework. Due to the dramatic
   differences in the sorption behavior with the different sorbate sorbent
   pairs, different models are applied to correlate and analyze the
   sorption isotherms. An adsorption potential theory was used to fit the
   water adsorption isotherms on all MFI-type zeolite adsorbents studied.
   The Langmuir model and Sircar's model are applied to describe ethanol
   adsorption on silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 samples, respectively. An ideal
   ethanol/water adsorption selectivity (alpha) was estimated for the
   fluoride-mediated silicalite-1. At 35 degrees C, alpha was estimated to
   be 36 for a 5 mol \% ethanol solution in water increasing to 53 at an
   ethanol concentration of 1 mol \%. The adsorption data demonstrate that
   silicalite-1 made via the fluoride-mediated route is a promising
   candidate for ethanol extraction from dilute ethanol water solutions.}},

   of energy dissipation rate and enstrophy density (i.e. the square of
   local vorticity). Despite substantial variability in each of these
   variables, their extreme events not only scale in a similar manner but
   also progressively tend to occur spatially together as the Reynolds
   number increases. Though they possess non-Gaussian tails of enormous
   amplitudes, ratios of some characteristic properties can be closely
   linked to those of isotropic Gaussian random fields. We present results
   also on statistics of the pressure Laplacian and conditional mean
   pressure given both dissipation and enstrophy. At low Reynolds number
   intense negative pressure fluctuations are preferentially associated
   with rotation-dominated regions but at high Reynolds number both high
   dissipation and high enstrophy have similar effects.}},

Abstract = {{A novel triple-layer proton exchange membrane comprising two thin layers
   of structurally modified chitosan, as methanol barrier layers, both
   sides coated with Nafion (R) 105 is prepared and tested for
   high-performance direct methanol fuel cell applications. A tight
   adherence is detected between layers from SEM and EDX data for the
   cross-sectional area of the newly designed membrane, which are
   attributed to high affinity of opposite charged polyelectrolyte layers.
   Proton conductivity and methanol permeability measurements show improved
   transport properties for the multi-layer membrane compared to Nafion (R)
   117 with approximately the same thickness. Moreover, direct methanol
   fuel cell tests reveal higher open circuit voltage, power density
   output, and overall fuel cell efficiency for the triple-layer membrane
   than Nafion (R) 117, especially at concentrated methanol solutions. A
   power output of 68.10 mW cm(-2) at 5 M methanol feed is supplied using
   multi-layer membrane, which is found to be about 72\% more than that of
   for Nafion (R) 117. In addition, fuel cell efficiency for multi-layer
   membrane is measured about 19.55\% and 18.45\% at 1 and 5 M methanol
   concentrations, respectively. Owing to the ability to provide high power
   output, significantly reduced methanol crossover, ease of preparation
   and low cost, the triple-layer membrane under study could be considered
   as a promising polyelectrolyte for high-performance direct methanol fuel
   cell applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{302}},
Pages = {{29-38}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{There is an evolutionary advantage in having multiple components with
   overlapping functionality (i.e degeneracy) in organisms. While
   theoretical considerations of degeneracy have been well established in
   neural networks using information theory, the same concepts have not
   been developed for differential systems, which form the basis of many
   biochemical reaction network descriptions in systems biology. Here we
   establish mathematical definitions of degeneracy, complexity and
   robustness that allow for the quantification of these properties in a
   system. By exciting a dynamical system with noise, the mutual
   information associated with a selected observable output and the
   interacting subspaces of input components can be used to define both
   complexity and degeneracy. The calculation of degeneracy in a biological
   network is a useful metric for evaluating features such as the
   sensitivity of a biological network to environmental evolutionary
   pressure. Using a two-receptor signal transduction network, we find that
   redundant components will not yield high degeneracy whereas compensatory
   mechanisms established by pathway crosstalk will. This form of analysis
   permits interrogation of large-scale differential systems for
   non-identical, functionally equivalent features that have evolved to
   maintain homeostasis during disruption of individual components. (C)

Title = {{Structural characterization of alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreated
   grasses exhibiting diverse lignin phenotypes}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: For cellulosic biofuels processes, suitable characterization
   of the lignin remaining within the cell wall and correlation of
   quantified properties of lignin to cell wall polysaccharide enzymatic
   deconstruction is underrepresented in the literature. This is
   particularly true for grasses which represent a number of promising
   bioenergy feedstocks where quantification of grass lignins is
   particularly problematic due to the high fraction of
   p-hydroxycinnamates. The main focus of this work is to use grasses with
   a diverse range of lignin properties, and applying multiple lignin
   characterization platforms, attempt to correlate the differences in
   these lignin properties to the susceptibility to alkaline hydrogen
   peroxide (AHP) pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic deconstruction.
   Results: We were able to determine that the enzymatic hydrolysis of
   cellulose to to glucose (i.e. digestibility) of four grasses with
   relatively diverse lignin phenotypes could be correlated to total lignin
   content and the content of p-hydroxycinnamates, while S/G ratios did not
   appear to contribute to the enzymatic digestibility or delignification.
   The lignins of the brown midrib corn stovers tested were significantly
   more condensed than a typical commercial corn stover and a significant
   finding was that pretreatment with alkaline hydrogen peroxide increases
   the fraction of lignins involved in condensed linkages from 88-95\% to
   similar to 99\% for all the corn stovers tested, which is much more than
   has been reported in the literature for other pretreatments. This
   indicates significant scission of beta-O-4 bonds by pretreatment and/or
   induction of lignin condensation reactions. The S/G ratios in grasses
   determined by analytical pyrolysis are significantly lower than values
   obtained using either thioacidolysis or 2DHSQC NMR due to presumed
   interference by ferulates.
   Conclusions: It was found that grass cell wall polysaccharide hydrolysis
   by cellulolytic enzymes for grasses exhibiting a diversity of lignin
   structures and compositions could be linked to quantifiable changes in
   the composition of the cell wall and properties of the lignin including
   apparent content of the p-hydroxycinnamates while the limitations of S/G
   estimation in grasses is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Dendrimers comprise a category of branched materials with diverse
   functions that can be constructed with defined architectural and
   chemical structures. When decorated with bioactive ligands made of
   peptides and saccharides through peripheral chemical groups, dendrimer
   conjugates are turned into nanomaterials possessing attractive binding
   properties with the cognate receptors. At the cellular level, bioactive
   dendrimer conjugates can interact with cells with avidity and
   selectivity, and this function has particularly stimulated interests in
   investigating the targeting potential of dendrimer materials for the
   design of drug delivery systems. In addition, bioactive dendrimer
   conjugates have so far been studied for their versatile capabilities to
   enhance stability, solubility and absorption of various types of
   therapeutics. This review presents a brief discussion on three aspects
   of the recent studies to use peptide-and saccharide-conjugated
   dendrimers for drug delivery: (i) synthesis methods, (ii) cell-and
   tissue-targeting properties and (iii) applications of conjugated
   dendrimers in drug delivery nanodevices. With more studies to elucidate
   the structure-function relationship of ligand-dendrimer conjugates in
   transporting drugs, the conjugated dendrimers hold promise to facilitate
   targeted delivery and improve drug efficacy for discovery and
   development of modern pharmaceutics.}},

Abstract = {{The M-w 7.8 October 2010 Mentawai, Indonesia, earthquake was a ``tsunami
   earthquake,{''} a rare type of earthquake that generates a tsunami much
   larger than expected based on the seismic magnitude. It produced a
   locally devastating tsunami, with runup commonly in excess of 6 m. We
   examine this event using a combination of high-rate GPS data, from
   instruments located on the nearby islands, and a tsunami field survey.
   The GPS displacement time series are deficient in high-frequency energy,
   and show small coseismic displacements (<22 cm horizontal and <4 cm
   subsidence). The field survey shows that maximum tsunami runup was >16
   m. Our modeling results show that the combination of the small GPS
   displacements and large tsunami can only be explained by high fault slip
   at very shallow depths, far from the islands and close to the oceanic
   trench. Inelastic uplift of trench sediments likely contributed to the
   size of the tsunami. Recent results for the 2011 M-w 9.0 Tohoko-Oki
   earthquake have also shown shallow fault slip, but the results from our
   study, which involves a smaller earthquake, provide much stronger
   constraints on how shallow the rupture can be, with the majority of slip
   for the Mentawai earthquake occurring at depths of <6 km. This result
   challenges the conventional wisdom that the shallow tips of subduction
   megathrusts are aseismic, and therefore raises important questions both
   about the mechanical properties of the shallow fault zone and the
   potential seismic and tsunami hazard of this shallow region.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a clinical decision support system activated at the
   time of discharge to reduce potentially inappropriate discharges from
   unidentified or unaddressed abnormal laboratory values.
   Methods: We identified 106 laboratory tests for possible inclusion in
   the discharge alert filter. We selected 7 labs as widely available,
   commonly obtained, and associated with high risk for potential morbidity
   or mortality within abnormal ranges. We identified trigger thresholds at
   levels that would capture significant laboratory abnormalities while
   avoiding excessive flag generation because of laboratory results that
   minimally deviate outside the normal reference range.
   Results: We selected sodium (>155 or <125 mmol/L), potassium (<2.5 or >6
   mEq/dL) phosphorous (<1.6 mg/dL), magnesium (<1.2 mg/dL), creatinine
   greater than 1.1 with a rise of 20\% or more between the 2 most recent
   results, white blood cell count (>11,000 cells/mm(3) with a rise of 20\%
   or more between the 2 most recent results), and international normalized
   ratio greater than 4.
   Conclusions: A discharge alert filter that reliably and effectively
   identifies patients that may be discharged in unsafe situations because
   of unaddressed critical laboratory values can improve patient safety at
   discharge and potentially reduce the incidence of costly litigation.
   Further research is needed to validate whether the proposed discharge
   alert filter is effective at improving patient safety at discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Site-specific on-demand cooling of hot spots in microprocessors can
   reduce peak temperature and achieve a more uniform thermal profile on
   chip, thereby improve chip performance and increase the processor's life
   time. An array of thermoelectric coolers (TECs) integrated inside an
   electronic package has the potential to provide such efficient cooling
   of hot spots on chip. This paper analyzes the potential of using
   multiple TECs for hot spot cooling to obtain favorable thermal profile
   on chip in an energy efficient way. Our computational analysis of an
   electronic package with multiple TECs shows a strong conductive coupling
   among active TECs during steady-state operation. Transient operation of
   TECs is capable of driving cold-side temperatures below steady-state
   values. Our analysis on TEC arrays using current pulses shows that the
   effect of TEC coupling on transient cooling is weak. Various pulse
   profiles have been studied to illustrate the effect of shape of current
   pulse on the operation of TECs considering crucial parameters such as
   total energy consumed in TECs peak temperature on the chip, temperature
   overshoot at the hot spot and settling time during pulsed cooling of hot
   spots. The square root pulse profile is found to be the most effective
   with maximum cooling and at half the energy expenditure in comparison to
   a constant current pulse. We analyze the operation of multiple TECs for
   cooling spatiotemporally varying hot spots. The analysis shows that the
   transient cooling using high amplitude current pulses is beneficial for
   short term infrequent hot spots, but high amplitude current pulse cannot
   be used for very frequent or long lasting hot spots. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The next generation of thermal interface materials (TIMs) are currently
   being developed to meet the increasing demands of high-powered
   semiconductor devices. In particular, a variety of nanostructured
   materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are interesting due to their
   ability to provide low resistance heat transport from device-to-spreader
   and compliance between materials with dissimilar coefficients of thermal
   expansion (CTEs), but few application-ready configurations have been
   produced and tested. Recently, we have undertaken major efforts to
   develop functional nanothermal interface materials (nTIMs) based on
   short, vertically aligned CNTs grown on both sides of a thin interposer
   foil and interfaced with substrate materials via metallic bonding. A
   high-precision 1D steady-state test facility has been utilized to
   measure the performance of nTIM samples, and more importantly, to
   correlate performance to the controllable parameters. In this paper, we
   describe our material structures and the myriad permutations of
   parameters that have been investigated in their design. We report these
   nTIM thermal performance results, which include a best to-date thermal
   interface resistance measurement of 3.5 mm2 K/W, independent of applied
   pressure. This value is significantly better than a variety of
   commercially available, high-performance thermal pads and greases we
   tested, and compares favorably with the best results reported for
   CNT-based materials in an application-representative setting. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The neonatal rodent spinal cord maintained in vitro is a powerful model
   system to understand the central properties of spinal circuits
   generating mammalian locomotion. We describe three enabling approaches
   that incorporate afferent input and attached hindlimbs. (i) Sacral
   dorsal column stimulation recruits and strengthens ongoing
   locomotor-like activity, and implementation of a closed
   positive-feedback paradigm is shown to support its stimulation as an
   untapped therapeutic site for locomotor modulation. (ii) The spinal cord
   hindlimbs-restrained preparation allows suction electrode
   electromyographic recordings from many muscles. Inducible complex motor
   patterns resemble natural locomotion, and insights into circuit
   organization are demonstrated during spontaneous motor burst
   `deletions', or following sensory stimuli such as tail and paw pinch.
   (iii) The spinal cord hindlimbs-pendant preparation produces
   unrestrained hindlimb stepping. It incorporates mechanical limb
   perturbations, kinematic analyses, ground reaction force monitoring, and
   the use of treadmills to study spinal circuit operation with
   movement-related patterns of sensory feedback while providing for stable
   whole-cell recordings from spinal neurons. Such techniques promise to
   provide important additional insights into locomotor circuit
   organization.}},

Abstract = {{A sequence of treatments consisting of prehydrolysis-kraft-pulping and
   chlorine dioxide (D,), peroxide enriched alkaline extraction (Ep),
   chlorine dioxide (D-2), chelating (Q) and peroxide (P) bleaching
   sequences (D-1-Ep-D-2-QP) were investigated as a process for preparing
   dissolving-grade pulp for cellulose acetate production. Mao bamboo
   (Phyllostachys heterocycle cv pubescens) was used for characterizing
   chemical composition and crystallinity of the fiber in each treating
   stage. The results showed that prehydrolysis could remove more than 60\%
   pentosan. The subsequent extraction of hemicellulose mainly occurred in
   D-1-Ep bleaching stage, especially in Ep stage, while the viscosity loss
   existed in all the procedures. Whiteness gains of the pulp were
   substantial in D-2 stage on the condition of removal of most of lignin.
   As bleaching proceeded, the alpha-cellulose content increased because of
   the purification of fiber. Dissolving pulp with pentosan content 2.8\%,
   alpha-cellulose 95.4\%, viscosity 16.4 mPa.s and whiteness 91.0\% ISO
   was obtained through the above process. The fiber crystallinity
   increased from 38.4\% to 68.9\% when the bamboo material was treated by
   prehydrolysis-kraft pulping and D-1 bleaching stages; then decreased in
   Ep-D-2-QP stages to 58\%.}},

Abstract = {{Hospitals have highly impulsive sound environments and alarms are one of
   the dominant transient sound sources in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The
   maximum (Lmax) and peak (Lpeak) sound pressure levels are two noise
   indices that have been commonly used to document the impulsiveness of
   hospital sound environments. Even though these traditional noise indices
   provide a good general overview of the hospital sound environments, they
   are limited in their usefulness. A recent study used a newer noise index
   called ``occurrence rate{''} to further document the impulsiveness of
   critical care settings and suggested its effectiveness in capturing
   nurse perceptions. This paper further evaluates the effectiveness of
   this newer noise index by statistically relating occurrence rate to
   nurse perceptions in two ICUs at different times of the day and days of
   the week. Interestingly, differences between nurse annoyance and
   loudness perceptions in the two ICUs were statistically related with the
   differences between impulsive characteristics of two ICU sound
   environments captured by the occurrence rate index. Since alarms are one
   of the dominant impulsive ICU sounds, this study also assesses the
   impact of alarms by analyzing the differences between nurse perception
   of alarms versus overall noise levels caused by various non-alarm
   sources in the workplace. Surprisingly, nurses in both ICUs perceived
   alarms as nearly as disruptive as overall noise with regards to effects
   on work performance, health, anxiety, loudness and annoyance. In both
   units many of the nurses (56\% total) indicated that they sometimes tune
   out alarms. (c) 2012 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging is clinically used in
   prostate biopsy and therapy. Segmentation of the prostate on TRUS images
   has many applications. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D)
   segmentation method for TRUS images of the prostate is presented for 3D
   ultrasound-guided biopsy.
   Methods: This segmentation method utilizes a statistical shape, texture
   information, and intensity profiles. A set of wavelet support vector
   machines (W-SVMs) is applied to the images at various subregions of the
   prostate. The W-SVMs are trained to adaptively capture the features of
   the ultrasound images in order to differentiate the prostate and
   nonprostate tissue. This method consists of a set of wavelet transforms
   for extraction of prostate texture features and a kernel-based support
   vector machine to classify the textures. The voxels around the surface
   of the prostate are labeled in sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes.
   The weight functions are defined for each labeled voxel on each plane
   and on the model at each region. In the 3D segmentation procedure, the
   intensity profiles around the boundary between the tentatively labeled
   prostate and nonprostate tissue are compared to the prostate model.
   Consequently, the surfaces are modified based on the model intensity
   profiles. The segmented prostate is updated and compared to the shape
   model. These two steps are repeated until they converge. Manual
   segmentation of the prostate serves as the gold standard and a variety
   of methods are used to evaluate the performance of the segmentation
   method.
   Results: The results from 40 TRUS image volumes of 20 patients show that
   the Dice overlap ratio is 90.3\% +/- 2.3\% and that the sensitivity is
   87.7\% +/- 4.9\%.
   Conclusions: The proposed method provides a useful tool in our 3D
   ultrasound image-guided prostate biopsy and can also be applied to other
   applications in the prostate. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Soil liquefaction occurred at many sites during the 2010 Maule, Chile,
   earth-quake, often leading to ground failure and lateral spreading. Of
   particular interest are the effects of liquefaction on built

   foundation movements resulting from liquefaction. Liquefaction-induced
   ground failure also displaced and distorted waterfront structures, which
   adversely impacted the operation of some of Chile's key port facilities.
   Important case histories that document the effects of ground failure on

Abstract = {{Tectonic deformation from the 2010 Maule (Chile) M-w 8.8 earthquake
   included both uplift and subsidence along about 470 km of the central
   Chilean coast. In the south, deformation included as much as 3 m of
   uplift of the Arauco Peninsula, which produced emergent marine platforms
   and affected harbor infrastructure. In the central part of the
   deformation zone, north of Constitucion, coastal subsidence drowned
   supratidal floodplains and caused extensive shoreline modification. In
   the north, coastal areas experienced either slight uplift or no detected
   change in land level. Also, river-channel deposition and decreased
   gradients suggest tectonic subsidence may have occurred in inland areas.
   The overall north-south pattern of 2010 coastal uplift and subsidence is
   similar to the average crestal elevation of the Coast Range between
   latitudes 33 degrees S and 40 degrees S. This similarity implies that
   the topography of the Coast Range may reflect long-term permanent strain
   accrued incrementally over many earthquake cycles. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the EERI reconnaissance team findings on damage to
   the Chilean wine industry after the 27 February 2010 Offshore Maule
   Earthquake. Wine production is one of the major industries in Chile,
   with an annual production of approximately one million metric tons. It
   is estimated that the total loss to the wine industry is over 12:5
   million liters, with infrastructure damage estimated as high as US\$430.
   Most of the damage was concentrated in older wineries with collapse of
   adobe walls and timber roofs or ribbed brick vaults. Damage to steel
   fermentation tanks was widespread among all wineries visited with the
   severity of such damage depending on the type of tank anchorage. Local
   buckling of legs in legged tanks or excessive movement followed by the
   tank falling off the support pad led to toppling that ruptured piping or
   valves. Stacked barrels, stored bottles of wine, and production lines
   were also damaged. {[}DOI: 10.1193/1.4000048]}},

Abstract = {{Multi-beam interference (MBI) provides the ability to form a wide range
   of sub-micron periodic optical-intensity distributions with applications
   to a variety of areas, including photonic crystals (PCs),
   nanoelectronics, biomedical structures, optical trapping, metamaterials,
   and numerous subwavelength structures. Recently, pattern-integrated
   interference lithography (PIIL) was presented as a new lithographic
   method that integrates superposed pattern imaging with interference
   lithography in a single-exposure step. In the present work, the basic
   design and systematic implementation of a pattern-integrated
   interference exposure system (PIIES) is presented to realize PIIL by
   incorporating a projection imaging capability in a novel three-beam
   interference configuration. A fundamental optimization methodology is
   presented to model the system and predict MBI-patterning performance. To
   demonstrate the PIIL method, a prototype PIIES experimental
   configuration is presented, including detailed alignment techniques and
   experimental procedures. Examples of well-defined PC structures,
   fabricated with a PIIES prototype, are presented to demonstrate the
   potential of PIIL for fabricating dense integrated optical circuits, as
   well as numerous other subwavelength structures. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Nitrogen injection under conditions close vicinity of the liquid-gas
   critical point is studied numerically. The fluid thermodynamic and
   transport properties vary drastically and exhibit anomalies in the
   near-critical regime. These anomalies can cause distinctive effects on
   heat-transfer and fluid-flow characteristics. To focus on the influence
   of thermodynamics on the flow field, a relatively low injection Reynolds
   number of 1 750 is adopted. For comparisons, a reference case with the
   same configuration and Reynolds number is simulated in the ideal gas
   regime. The model accommodates full conservation laws, real-fluid
   thermodynamic and transport phenomena. Results reveal that the flow
   features of the near-critical fluid jet are significantly different from
   their counterpart. The near-critical fluid jet spreads faster andmixes
   more efficiently with the ambient fluid along with a more rapidly
   development of the vortex pairing process. Detailed analysis at
   different streamwise locations including both the flat shear-layer
   region and fully developed vortex region reveals the important effect of
   volume dilatation and baroclinic torque in the near-critical fluid case.
   The former disturbs the shear layer and makes it more unstable. The
   volume dilatation and baroclinic effects strengthen the vorticity and
   stimulate the vortex rolling up and pairing process.}},

Abstract = {{Increased aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) results from loss of arterial
   compliance and is associated with unfavorable outcomes. Applanation
   tonometry (AT) is the most frequently applied method to assess PWV and
   deduce aortic compliance. The goal of this study was to compare the
   reproducibility of PWV measurements obtained with: (1) cross-correlation
   analysis of phase contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) velocity data, and
   (2) applanation tonometry (AT). PWV was measured twice with each
   modality in 13 normal young volunteers (controls) and 9 older patients
   who had undergone a CT exam to evaluate coronary artery calcium. The
   coefficient of variation (CoV) between measurements was computed for
   each modality. There was no significant difference in PWV values
   obtained with AT and PCMR in controls or patients. The inter-scan
   reproducibility of PCMR was superior to AT in the controls (CoV: 3.4 +/-
   A 2.3\% vs. 6.3 +/- A 4.0\%, P = 0.03) but not in the older patients
   (7.4 +/- A 8.0\% vs. 9.9 +/- A 9.6\%, P = 0.32). PWV values were higher
   in patients than controls (5.6 +/- A 1.2 vs. 9.7 +/- A 2.8, P = 0.002).
   PCMR and AT yielded similar values for PWV in patients and volunteers.
   PCMR showed a superior reproducibility in young subjects but not in
   older patients.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the
   most important antibacterial mechanisms of engineered nanoparticles
   (NPs). To elucidate the ROS generation mechanisms, we investigated the
   ROS production kinetics of seven selected metal-oxide NPs and their bulk
   counterparts under UV irradiation (365 nm). The results show that
   different metal oxides had distinct photogenerated ROS kinetics.
   Particularly, TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles generated three
   types of ROS (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen),
   whereas other metal oxides generated only one or two types or did not
   generate any type of ROS. Moreover, NPs yielded more ROS than their bulk
   counterparts likely due to larger surface areas of NPs providing more
   absorption sites for UV irradiation. The ROS generation mechanism was
   elucidated by comparing the electronic structures (i.e., band edge
   energy levels) of the metal oxides with the redox potentials of various
   ROS generation, which correctly interpreted the ROS generation of most
   metal oxides. To develop a quantitative relationship between oxidative
   stress and antibacterial activity of NPs, we examined the viability of
   E. coli cells in aqueous suspensions of NPs under UV irradiation, and a
   linear correlation was found between the average concentration of total
   ROS and the bacterial survival rates (R-2 = 0.84). Although some NPs
   (i.e., ZnO and CuO nanoparticles) released toxic ions that partially
   contributed to their antibacterial activity, this correlation
   quantitatively linked ROS production capability of NPs to their
   antibacterial activity as well as shed light on the applications of
   metal-oxide NPs as potential antibacterial agents.}},

Abstract = {{Burrs in micromilled parts need to be removed for proper functioning of
   the parts. Abrasive assisted brushing presents a fast and effective
   method for deburring these parts. The deburring rate in abrasive
   brushing depends on the workpiece material, abrasive grit size, type and
   rotational speed of the brush. In this paper the effects of these
   variables on the rate of deburring micromilled grooves in copper and
   tool steel workpieces are studied experimentally. It is found that the
   burr removal rate is proportional to the initial burr height and
   deburring speed. An empirical model derived from the experimental data
   is used to predict the deburring time. Groove depth change after
   deburring is less than 8 mu m and surface roughness improves by about
   100 nm in all cases studied. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical analysis is performed on a multi-mode energy harvester
   design with focus on the first two vibration modes. Based on the
   analysis, a modification is proposed for designing a novel adaptive
   multi-mode energy harvester. The device comprises a simply supported
   beam with distributed mass and piezoelectric elements, and an adaptive
   damper that provides a 180 degree phase shift for the motions of two
   supports only efficiently scavenge energy at the first two vibration
   modes. The energy harvesting capability of the multi-mode energy
   harvester is also compared with that of a cantilever-based energy
   harvester for single-mode vibration. The results show that the energy
   harvesting capacity is affected by the damping ratios of different
   designs. For fixed damping ratio and design dimensions, the multi-mode
   design has higher energy harvesting capacity than the cantilever-based
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Among the physical and chemical attributes of the nanocomposite
   components and their interactions that contribute to the ultimate
   material properties, nanoparticle arrangement in the matrix is a key
   contributing factor that has been targeted through materials choices and
   processing strategies in numerous previous studies. Often, the desired
   nanocomposite morphology contains individually dispersed and distributed
   nanoparticles. In this research, a phase-segregated morphology
   containing nanoparticle networks was studied. A model nanocomposite
   system composed of calcium phosphate nanoparticles and a
   poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) matrix was produced to understand how polymer
   crystallization and crystal structure can facilitate the formation of a
   phase-segregated morphology containing nanoparticle networks. Two
   chemically similar calcium phosphate nanoparticle systems with different
   shapes, near-spherical and nanofiber, were synthesized for use in the
   nanocomposites. The different shapes were used independently in
   nanocomposites in an attempt to understand the effect of the
   nanoparticle shapes on crystallization-mediated nanoparticle network
   formation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized to establish
   the effects of component interactions on the polymer structure.
   Additionally from the viscoelastic properties, structure property
   relationships in these materials can be defined as a function of
   nanoparticle shape and concentration. The results of this research
   suggest that when the nanocomposite components are not strongly
   interacting, polymer crystallization may be used as a forced assembly
   method for nanoparticle networks. Such a methodology has applications to
   the design of functional polymer nanocomposites such as biomedical
   implant materials and organic photovoltaic materials where judicious
   choice of nanoparticle polymer pairs and control of polymer crystal
   nucleation and growth processes could be used to control the length
   scale of phase segregation.}},

Abstract = {{Effective public health responses to an influenza pandemic require an
   effective vaccine that can be manufactured and administered to large
   populations in the shortest possible time. In this study, we evaluated a
   method for vaccination against avian influenza virus that uses a DNA
   vaccine for rapid manufacturing and delivered by a microneedle skin
   patch for simplified administration and increased immunogenicity. We
   prepared patches containing 700-mu m long microneedles coated with an
   avian H5 influenza hemagglutinin DNA vaccine from A/Viet Nam/1203/04
   influenza virus. The coating DNA dose increased with DNA concentration
   in the coating solution and the number of dip-coating cycles. Coated DNA
   was released into the skin tissue by dissolution within minutes.
   Vaccination of mice using microneedles induced higher levels of antibody
   responses and hemagglutination inhibition titers, and improved
   protection against lethal infection with avian influenza as compared to
   conventional intramuscular delivery of the same dose of the DNA vaccine.
   Additional analysis showed that the microneedle coating solution
   containing carboxymethylcellulose and a surfactant may have negatively
   affected the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine. Overall, this study
   shows that DNA vaccine delivery by microneedles can be a promising
   approach for improved vaccination to mitigate an influenza pandemic. (C)

Abstract = {{The topic of multifunctional material systems using active or smart
   materials has recently gained attention in the research community.
   Multifunctional piezoelectric systems present the ability to combine
   multiple functions into a single active piezoelectric element, namely,
   combining sensing, actuation, or energy conversion ability with
   load-bearing capacity. Quantification of the bending strength of various
   piezoelectric materials is, therefore, critical in the development of
   load-bearing piezoelectric systems. Three-point bend tests are carried
   out on a variety of piezoelectric ceramics including soft monolithic
   piezoceramics (PZT-5A and PZT-5H), hard monolithic ceramics (PZT-4 and
   PZT-8), single-crystal piezoelectrics (PMN-PT and PMN-PZT), and
   commercially packaged composite devices (which contain active PZT-5A
   layers). A common 3-point bend test procedure is used throughout the
   experimental tests. The bending strengths of these materials are found
   using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to be 44.9 MPa for PMN-PZT, 60.6 MPa
   for PMN-PT, 114.8 MPa for PZT-5H, 123.2 MPa for PZT-4, 127.5 MPa for
   PZT-8, 140.4 MPa for PZT-5A, and 186.6 MPa for the commercial composite.
   The high strength of the commercial configuration is a result of the
   composite structure that allows for shear stresses on the surfaces of
   the piezoelectric layers, whereas the low strength of the single-crystal
   materials is due to their unique crystal structure, which allows for
   rapid propagation of cracks initiating at flaw sites. The experimental
   bending strength results reported, which are linear estimates without
   nonlinear ferroelastic considerations, are intended for use in the
   design of multifunctional piezoelectric systems in which the active
   device is subjected to bending loads.}},

Abstract = {{When capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) are
   monolithically integrated with custom-designed low-noise electronics,
   the output noise of the system can be dominated by the CMUT
   thermal-mechanical noise both in air and in immersion even for devices
   with low capacitance. Because the thermal-mechanical noise can be
   related to the electrical admittance of the CMUTs, this provides an
   effective means of device characterization. This approach yields a novel
   method to test the functionality and uniformity of CMUT arrays and the
   integrated electronics when a direct connection to CMUT array element
   terminals is not available. Because these measurements can be performed
   in air at the wafer level, the approach is suitable for batch
   manufacturing and testing. We demonstrate this method on the elements of
   an 800-mu m-diameter CMUT-on-CMOS array designed for intravascular
   imaging in the 10 to 20 MHz range. Noise measurements in air show the
   expected resonance behavior and spring softening effects. Noise
   measurements in immersion for the same array provide useful information
   on both the acoustic cross talk and radiation properties of the CMUT
   array elements. The good agreement between a CMUT model based on finite
   difference and boundary element methods and the noise measurements
   validates the model and indicates that the output noise is indeed
   dominated by thermal-mechanical noise. The measurement method can be
   exploited to implement CMUT-based passive sensors to measure immersion
   medium properties, or other parameters affecting the electro-mechanics
   of the CMUT structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a general reduced-rate orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme for inter-subchannel
   interference (ICI) self-cancellation over high-mobility fading channels.
   Via transmit and receive processing, we transform the original OFDM
   system into an equivalent one with fewer subcarriers. By reducing
   transmission rate, we are able to design a transmitted signal structure
   with inherent ICI self-cancellation capability without requiring the
   instantaneous channel state information. We develop a general structure
   of transmit and receive processing matrices so that all equivalent
   subchannels in the transformed OFDM system have the same average
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). For the developed structure, we
   further optimize the transmit and the receive processing coefficients to
   maximize the SIR based on channel statistics. Numerical and simulation
   results demonstrate that the developed reduced-rate OFDM transmission
   achieves an SIR gain of around 5 dB over the existing ICI
   self-cancellation schemes and significantly reduces the error floor at
   the receiver.}},

Abstract = {{The issues of frequency offset and channel estimation are considered for
   the downlink of coordinated multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing systems. Multiple carrier frequency
   offsets exist in this coordinated system. Without implementing an
   appropriate compensation for these offsets, both inter-carrier and
   inter-cell interference will degrade the system performance. Here, we
   adopt a parallel interference cancelation strategy to iteratively
   mitigate inter-cell interference, and propose a frequency offset
   estimator, approximated by a Hadamard product and a Taylor series
   expansion, to eliminate the inter-carrier interference. Our scheme is
   significantly less complex than existing methods. Furthermore, the
   proposed channel estimator is robust to frequency offsets and performs
   comparably well to these conventional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared imaging of lymphatic drainage of injected indocyanine
   green (ICG) has emerged as a new technology for clinical imaging of
   lymphatic architecture and quantification of vessel function, yet the
   imaging capabilities of this approach have yet to be quantitatively
   characterized. We seek to quantify its capabilities as a diagnostic tool
   for lymphatic disease. Imaging is performed in a tissue phantom for
   sensitivity analysis and in hairless rats for in vivo testing. To
   demonstrate the efficacy of this imaging approach to quantifying
   immediate functional changes in lymphatics, we investigate the effects
   of a topically applied nitric oxide (NO) donor glyceryl trinitrate
   ointment. Premixing ICG with albumin induces greater fluorescence
   intensity, with the ideal concentration being 150 mu g/mL ICG and 60 g/L
   albumin. ICG fluorescence can be detected at a concentration of 150 mu
   g/mL as deep as 6 mm with our system, but spatial resolution
   deteriorates below 3 mm, skewing measurements of vessel geometry. NO
   treatment slows lymphatic transport, which is reflected in increased
   transport time, reduced packet frequency, reduced packet velocity, and
   reduced effective contraction length. NIR imaging may be an alternative
   to invasive procedures measuring lymphatic function in vivo in real
   time. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{A geodatabase of tidal constituents is developed to present the regional
   assessment of tidal stream power resource in the USA. Tidal currents are
   numerically modeled with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and
   calibrated with the available measurements of tidal current speeds and

   predicting the tidal currents and water levels is assessed by an
   independent validation. The geodatabase is published on a public domain
   via a spatial database engine with interactive tools to select, query
   and download the data. Regions with the maximum average kinetic power
   density exceeding 500 W/m(2) (corresponding to a current speed of 1
   m/s), total surface area larger than 0.5 km(2) and depth greater than 5
   m are defined as hotspots and documented. The regional assessment
   indicates that the state of Alaska (AK) has the largest number of

Abstract = {{This article reports a systematic study of the seed-mediated growth of
   Au@Pd coreshell nanocrystals with a variety of controlled sizes and
   morphologies. The key to the success of this synthesis is to manipulate
   the reaction kinetics by tuning a set of reaction parameters, including
   the type and concentration of capping agent, the amount of ascorbic acid
   used as the reducing agent, and the injection rate used for the
   precursor solution. Starting from Au nanospheres of 11 nm in diameter as
   the seeds, Au@Pd coreshell nanocrystals with a number of morphologies,
   including octahedra, concave octahedra, rectangular bars, cubes, concave
   cubes, and dendrites, could all be obtained by simply altering the
   reaction rate. For the first time, it was possible to generate Au@Pd
   nanocrystals with concave structures on the surfaces while their sizes
   were kept below 20 nm. In addition, the as-prepared Au@Pd nanocubes can
   be used as seeds to generate Au@Pd@Au and Au@Pd@Au@Pd nanocrystals with
   multishelled structures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, based on the prey model in foraging theory, the
   BIO-inspired Cross-layer (BIOX) communication and coordination protocol
   is introduced for wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs). BIOX
   permits each sensor node to autonomously determine its next-hop
   selection and channel access strategy using bio-inspired next-hop
   selection and channel access profitability measures. Based on these
   profitability measures, BIOX provides optimal performance in
   energy-efficient and reliable sensor-actor communication. Furthermore,
   using task allocation profitability measure, BIOX also guarantees stable
   allocation of available tasks in a way that each task is accomplished by
   an actor node within a bounded time delay. Performance evaluations
   reveal that BIOX significantly prolongs the network lifetime while
   providing highly reliable sensor-actor communication and effective task
   allocation for actor nodes.}},

Abstract = {{The relative expression of developmentally regulated genes was analyzed
   during zygotic embryo development in Pinus taeda and somatic embryo
   development/maturation in P. taeda and Pinus oocarpa. The following four
   embryo samples were studied: zygotic pro-embryos and somatic embryogenic
   suspensor masses; round/globular, early cotyledonary, and late
   cotyledonary. The relative transcript levels of six genes of interest:
   legumin-/vicilin-like, group 4 late embryogenesis abundant,
   homeodomain-leucine zipper I, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit S2, and
   clavata-like, associated with different aspects of embryo development,
   were analyzed by real-time PCR. In both pine species, the relative
   transcript levels for legumin-/vicilin-like storage proteins and the
   late embryogenesis abundant protein accumulated gradually through
   somatic embryo maturation, in contrast to zygotic embryos, where
   transcripts increased significantly to their highest levels at the late
   cotyledonary stage. The homeodomain-leucine zipper I relative transcript
   accumulation pattern differed between somatic and zygotic embryos. This
   difference was attributed to differences in cell-type compositions
   between the embryogenic suspensor masses and pro-embryos. Additionally,
   in P. oocarpa, the transcript levels of homeodomain-leucine zipper I
   remained high after the transfer of somatic embryos to maturation
   conditions, but declined during maturation in P. taeda. The highest 26S
   proteasome regulatory subunit S2 relative transcript levels in P. taeda
   were in round/globular somatic and zygotic embryos and in embryogenic
   suspensor masses and round/globular P. oocarpa somatic embryos. Finally,
   the relative transcripts levels for the clavata-like gene were more
   predominant in round/globular, early cotyledonary, and embryogenic
   suspensor masses in P. taeda and P. oocarpa, respectively. Somatic
   embryos exhibited relative gene expression patterns similar to their
   zygotic counterparts, although some differences were noted between
   zygotic and somatic embryos, as well as between the different pine
   somatic embryo systems.}},

Title = {{Modification of multiwall carbon nanotubes with ruthenium(II)
   terpyridine complex}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, 1-3 mu M in length and 20-25 nm in
   diameter) were initially functionalized with a 2,2': 6'2
   `'-terpyridine-chelated ruthenium(II) complex by covalent amidation. The
   resulting functionalized ruthenium MWCNTs (RuMWCNTs, 1-2 mu M in length
   and 10-20 nm in diameter) were characterized by thermogravimetric
   analysis, X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). Thermogravimetric experiments of RuMWCNTs show that
   the functional group coverage of terpyridine-rutheniun-terpyridine
   (tpy-Ru-tpy) is 0.7036 mmol/ 1.0 g carbon. The XPS results show N1s and
   Ru3d(5/5) signals, confirming the presence of tpy-Ru-tpy groups on the
   surface of MWCNTs. The FTIR spectra of the RuMWCNTs display the typical
   stretching mode of the carboxyl group (amide I) and a combination of
   amide N-H and C-N stretching mode (amide II). The Raman D-and G-line
   peak intensity ratio of RuMWCNTs (ID/IG 2.21) exceeds that of pristine
   MWCNTs (ID/IG 1.93), suggesting covalent bonding of tpy-Ru-tpy to MWCNTs
   and supporting the disruption of the graphitic integrity due to the
   proposed covalent functionalization. High-resolution SEM images confirm
   that tpy-Ru-tpy moieties are interconnected or attached as aggregated
   structures (100-200-nm range) on the surfaces of the carbon nanotubes
   after functionalization. The electrical property of RuMWCNTs depicts
   higher resistance (10.10 M Omega) than that of OX-MWCNTs (15.38 k
   Omega).}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned ZnO nanowires have been synthesized by a hydrothermal
   method. After being irradiated by a short laser pulse, the tips of the
   as-synthesized ZnO nanowires can be tailored into a spherical shape.
   Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the spherical tip is a
   single-crystalline piece connected to the body of the ZnO nanowire, and
   that the center of the sphere is hollow. The growth mechanism of the
   hollow ZnO nanospheres is proposed to involve laser-induced ZnO
   evaporation immediately followed by re-nucleation in a temperature
   gradient environment. The laser-irradiated ZnO nanowire array shows
   hydrophobic properties while the original ZnO nanowire array shows
   hydrophilicity. The as-grown ZnO nanowire arrays with hollow spherical
   tips can serve as templates to grow ZnO nanowire arrays with very fine
   tips, which may be a good candidate material for use in field emission
   and scanning probe microscopy.}},

   linkage among the RCN researchers in terms of extent of co-authoring and
   of cross-citing each other's work. RCN support appears to foster more
   interdisciplinary research. Diffusion scores (a new metric) showed that
   the diversity of articles citing RCN-related articles was similar to

Abstract = {{Dimethylsulfoxide, the most commonly employed cryoprotectant for cells,
   has well documented cytotoxic effects in patients. Among the compounds
   available that may provide protection to cells and tissues during
   preservation with less cytotoxicity is trehalose. Some animals, such as
   brine shrimp and tardigrades, accumulate trehalose during periods of
   extreme environmental stress. In this study, experiments were performed
   to evaluate the effects of culturing a bovine endothelial cell line
   (ATCC \#CCL-209) in the presence of trehalose prior to preservation by
   freezing. A number of factors were shown to contribute to cell retention
   of metabolic activity and proliferative potential including cell culture
   time with trehalose and the solution conditions during cryopreservation.
   Using an optimized protocol consisting of 24 h of cell culture with 0.2
   M trehalose followed by cryopreservation with 0.2-0.4 M trehalose in
   sodium bicarbonate buffered Eagles minimum essential medium at pH 7.4
   resulted in 87 +/- 4\% post-preservation cell metabolic activity
   expressed as relative fluorescence based upon reduction of resazurin to
   resorufin. This new method provides an alternative preservation strategy
   to the more classical preservation methods employing dimethylsulfoxide
   available for cells and tissues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The AC conductivity of fluorite-structured La2Ce2O7 ceramic was measured
   under air and argon with different humidity between 250 and 550 degrees
   C. It was observed that the total conductivity in wet air and argon was
   higher than that under dry atmospheres. The effect of water vapor
   partial pressure (P<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF>) on the conductivity of
   La2Ce2O7 in air was investigated in detail. The total conductivity
   increased remarkably with the water vapor partial pressure, and this
   phenomenon became more notable at lower temperatures. The enhancement of
   the conductivity was attributed to the proton conduction behavior of
   La2Ce2O7 in wet atmospheres, and the proton conductivity reached 6.68 x
   10<SUP>5</SUP> S cm1 in wet air (3\% H2O) at 550 degrees C. The
   relationship between the proton conductivity (rho H) and
   P<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF> in wet air could be fitted to rho H
   proportional to P<SUP>1/2</SUP><INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF>. The estimated

Abstract = {{A thermo-mechanical reliability study of through-silicon vias (TSVs) is
   presented in this paper. TSVs are used to interconnect stacked dies to
   achieve 3-D packages. As the core of the TSV contains high coefficient
   of thermal expansion (CTE) copper surrounded by low-CTE SiO2 and Si
   materials, the thermo-mechanical reliability of TSVs is a concern. When
   dies with such TSVs are stacked and packaged, the presence of additional
   structures and associated materials could introduce different
   thermo-mechanical concerns compared with free-standing wafers. This
   paper presents 3-D finite-element models for studying the
   thermo-mechanical stresses in TSVs in free-standing wafers and in
   stacked dies, which are packaged. Warpage measurements have been used to
   validate the finite-element modeling approach. The results from the
   finite-element models show that the TSV stresses in a packaging
   configuration are typically lower than the TSV stresses in a
   free-standing wafer configuration. In addition, it is seen that the
   microbumps connecting adjacent dies experience high magnitude of
   inelastic strain, indicating that such locations are of reliability
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of disorders of the nervous system poses a major clinical
   challenge. Development of neuromodulation (i.e., interfacing electronics
   to nervous tissue to modulate its function) has provided patients with
   neuronal-related deficits a new tool to regain lost function. Even
   though, in principle, electrical stimulation and recording by
   interfacing technology is simple and straightforward, each presents
   different challenges. In stimulation, the challenge lies in targeting
   the effects of stimulation on precise brain regions, as each region
   specializes for particular functions on a millimeter scale. In practice,
   our experience with deep brain stimulation for treating Parkinson's
   disease reveals that stimulation of larger regions of the brain can be
   relatively well tolerated. However, the task of fabricating an ideal
   electrode that performs reliably for long periods of time has been
   daunting. The primary obstacle in successful interfacing comes from
   integration of electrodes ({''}foreign{''} material) into the nervous
   system (biological material). The second tier of complexity is added by
   the need for the electrodes to ``sense{''} signals emanating from
   individual neurons, an estimated microenvironment of 10 to 20 microns in
   diameter. Materials design and technology impact electrode design-with
   their size, shape, mechanical properties, and composition all being
   actively optimized to enable chronic, stable recordings of neural
   activity. The articles in this issue discuss designing interfacing
   technology to ``listen to the nervous system{''} from a materials
   perspective. These include identification of materials with a potential
   for in vivo development, electrodes with various material types,
   including natural nanocomposites, and optical neural interfacing.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Extracellular matrix (ECM)-based materials used for neural interfaces
   allow for prolonged effective interaction between foreign devices and
   the neural cells in vivo because they mimic the natural environment.
   This review will highlight studies that have demonstrated how ECM-based
   materials can benefit neural interfacing applications as neural
   electrode coatings, scaffolds, and nanoparticle (NP) coatings. The
   performance of neural electrodes can degrade from inflammatory response
   as indicated by the signal obstruction between neurons and electrodes
   from glial scar formation during prolonged implantation. ECM materials
   can mitigate an inflammatory response because they are naturally
   biocompatible and biodegradable. Scaffolds composed from ECM-based
   materials have the characteristic length scale and biochemical cues that
   promote directional neural cell growth. ECM-based scaffolds can also be
   utilized as drug delivery vessels to infuse the neural tissue with
   neural growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The NPs currently
   employed for drug delivery and imaging use various ECM-based coating
   materials that shield them from the neural cells because many types of
   NPs are cytotoxic. As demonstrated by these three neural interfacing
   applications, ECM-based materials are very promising candidates for the
   development of next-generation neural regeneration and therapeutic
   devices.}},

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2833-2838}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Harvesting thermoelectric energy mainly relies on the Seebeck effect
   that utilizes a temperature difference between two ends of the device
   for driving the diffusion of charge carriers. However, in an environment
   that the temperature is spatially uniform without a gradient, the
   pyroelectric effect has to be the choice, which is based on the
   spontaneous polarization in certain anisotropic solids due to a
   time-dependent temperature variation. Using this effect, we
   experimentally demonstrate the first application of pyroelectric ZnO
   nanowire arrays for converting heat energy into electricity. The
   coupling of the pyroelectric and semiconducting properties in ZnO
   creates a polarization electric field and charge separation along the
   ZnO nanowire as a result of the time-dependent change in temperature.
   The fabricated nanogenerator has a good stability, and the
   characteristic coefficient of heat flow conversion into electricity is
   estimated to be similar to 0.05-0.08 Vm(2)/W. Our study has the
   potential of using pyroelectric nanowires to convert wasted energy into
   electricity for powering nanodevices.}},

   surpassed that exhibited by the unstructured films and gave an output

   Furthermore, the as-prepared nanogenerator can be applied as a
   self-powered pressure sensor for sensing a water droplet (8 mg, similar

Abstract = {{Nanowire solar cells are promising candidates for powering nanosystems

   performance of n-CdS/p-Cu2S coaxial nanowire photovoltaic (PV) devices
   using the piezo-phototronics effect when the PV device is subjected to
   an external strain. Piezo-phototronics effect could control the electron
   hole pair generation, transport, separation, and/or recombination, thus
   enhanced the performance of the PV devices by as high as 70\%. This
   effect offers a new concept for improving solar energy conversation
   efficiency by designing the orientation of the nanowires and the strain
   to be purposely introduced in the packaging of the solar cells. This

Abstract = {{This work reports the successful design, construction, and application
   of multi-functional, self-assembling protein complex, termed
   xylanosomes. Using the architecture of cellulosomes as template, these
   structures were designed specifically for hemicellulose hydrolysis. Four
   different xylanosomes were developed, with up to three different
   hemicellulase activities combined into a single structure. Each
   xylanosome was composed of two native or chimeric hemicellulases and
   tested on wheat arabinoxylan or destarched corn bran for enzymatic
   hydrolysis. After 24-h incubation, soluble sugars released from
   arabinoxylan increased up to 30 \% with xylanosomes containing a
   xylanase and bi-functional arabinofuranosidase/xylosidase over the
   corresponding free, unstructured enzymes. Additionally, xylanosomes with
   a xylanase and a ferulic acid esterase removed between 15 and 20 \% more
   ferulic acid from wheat arabinoxylan than free enzymes. Furthermore,
   xylanosomes exhibited synergy with cellulases on destarched corn bran,
   suggesting a possible use of these nanostructures in cellulose
   hydrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{After separating from a primary tumor, metastasizing cells enter the
   circulatory system and interact with host cells before lodging in
   secondary organs. Previous studies have implicated the surface
   glycoproteins CD44 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in adhesion,
   migration, and invasion, suggesting that they may influence metastatic
   progression. To elucidate the role of these multifunctional molecules
   while avoiding the potential drawbacks of ectopic expression or
   monoclonal antibody treatments, we silenced the expression of CD44
   and/or CEA in LS174T colon carcinoma cells and analyzed their ability to
   metastasize in 2 independent mouse models. Quantitative PCR revealed
   that CD44 knockdown increased lung and liver metastasis >10-fold, while
   metastasis was decreased by >50\% following CEA knockdown. These
   findings were corroborated by in vitro experiments assessing the
   metastatic potential of LS174T cells. Cell migration was decreased as a
   result of silencing CEA but was enhanced in CD44-knockdown cells. In
   addition, CD44 silencing promoted homotypic aggregation of LS147T cells,
   a phenotype that was reversed by additional CEA knockdown. Finally,
   CD44-knockdown cells exhibited greater mechanical compliance than
   control cells, a property that correlates with increased metastatic
   potential. Collectively, these data indicate that CEA, but not CD44, is
   a viable target for therapeutics aimed at curbing colon carcinoma
   metastasis.-Dallas, M. R., Liu, G., Chen, W.-C., Thomas, S. N., Wirtz,

Abstract = {{We describe the use of computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) and figure
   of merit (FOM) analysis to identify new heat transfer fluids for direct
   immersion cooling of electronic systems. Thirty-five new fluids, with
   thermophysical properties in the range 320 K < T-b < 370 K, k > 0.09 W
   m(-1) K-1 and H-vap > 35 kJ mol(-1), were identified via a CAMD
   approach. Further analysis of these 35 fluids led to the selection of
   1,1,1-trifluoro-3-methylpentane (C6H11F3) for experimental evaluation.
   C6H11F3 was synthesized from commercially available precursors, and its
   thermophysical properties were measured to verify its FOM. Next, the
   pool boiling performance of a mixture of 7 wt.\% C6H11F3 + 93 wt.\% HFE
   7200 was determined using a 10 mm x 10 mm grooved Si thermal test chip
   coated with copper. An improvement of 7\% in the critical heat flux
   (CHF) was obtained, suggesting that C6H11F3 is worth further examination
   as a candidate for direct immersion phase change cooling applications.

Abstract = {{The cognitive challenges in the design of complex engineered systems
   include the scale and scope of decision problems, nonlinearity of the
   trade space, subjectivity of the problem formulation, and the need for
   rapid decision making. These challenges have motivated an active area of
   research in design decision-support methods and the development of
   commercial and openly available design frameworks. Although these
   frameworks are extremely capable, most are limiting as a basis for
   research relating to design decision support because they offer little
   user flexibility for incorporating and evaluating new features or
   techniques. This paper describes Rave (www.rave.gatech.edu), a
   computational framework designed specifically as a research platform for
   design decision-support methods. Rave has been structured to be flexible
   and adaptable, handle data with systematic data structures and
   descriptive metadata, facilitate a wide spectrum of visualization types,
   provide features to enable user interactivity and linking of graphics,
   and incorporate surrogate modeling and optimization as enabling
   capabilities. This framework is envisioned to provide the research and

Abstract = {{In this paper, a proactive thermal management technique called ``power
   multiplexing{''} is explored for many-core processors. Power
   multiplexing involves redistribution of the locations of active cores at
   regular time intervals to obtain uniform thermal profile with low peak
   temperature. Three different migration policies namely random, cyclic,
   and global coolest replace have been employed for power multiplexing and
   their efficacy in reducing the peak temperature and thermal gradient on
   chip is investigated. For a given migration frequency, global coolest
   replace policy is found to be the most effective among the three
   policies considered as this policy provides 10 degrees C reduction in
   peak temperature and 20 degrees C reduction in maximum spatial
   temperature difference on a 256 core chip. Power configuration on the
   chip is characterized by a parameter called ``proximity index{''} which
   emerges as an important parameter to represent the spatial power
   distribution on a chip. We also notice that the overall performance of
   the chip could be improved by 10\% using global multiplexing. {[}DOI:

   doi:10.1152/jn.01195.2011.-The relationship between synaptic or
   injecting input level and firing rate is an important metric to
   characterize neuron input-output dynamics. In this study, we examine two
   long-held, but never validated, assumptions in the ``algebraic summation
   of afterhyperpolarization{''} theory, which explains how firing rate
   varies with input (typically referred to as input current-frequency
   modulation or ``F-I gain{''}). In the theory, the
   afterhyperpolarizations themselves, along with spike threshold, were
   assumed constant. That is, whereas they were central concepts in the
   theory, they were not included in any feedback loops, wherein they could
   both affect and be affected by firing rate. We performed intracellular
   recordings from spinal motoneurons in the adult cat to determine whether
   F-I gain correlates with the afterhyperpolarization and/or spike
   threshold. We observe that the afterhyperpolarization does indeed appear
   to be out of the F-I gain mechanism loop, and thus that original
   assumption holds. However, the presented experimental evidence indicates
   that the spike threshold appears to be in the loop. That is, spike
   threshold variation associated with input correlates with F-I gain. We
   present an extension to the original theory, which explains the F-I gain
   experimental correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Hayes HB, Chang Y-H, Hochman S. Stance-phase force on the opposite limb
   dictates swing-phase afferent presynaptic inhibition during locomotion.
   J Neurophysiol 107: 3168-3180, 2012. First published March 21, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.01134.2011.-Presynaptic inhibition is a powerful
   mechanism for selectively and dynamically gating sensory inputs entering
   the spinal cord. We investigated how hindlimb mechanics influence
   presynaptic inhibition during locomotion using pioneering approaches in
   an in vitro spinal cord-hindlimb preparation. We recorded lumbar dorsal
   root potentials to measure primary afferent depolarization-mediated
   presynaptic inhibition and compared their dependence on hindlimb
   endpoint forces, motor output, and joint kinematics. We found that
   stance-phase force on the opposite limb, particularly at toe contact,
   strongly influenced the magnitude and timing of afferent presynaptic
   inhibition in the swinging limb. Presynaptic inhibition increased in
   proportion to opposite limb force, as well as locomotor frequency. This
   form of presynaptic inhibition binds the sensorimotor states of the two
   limbs, adjusting sensory inflow to the swing limb based on forces
   generated by the stance limb. Functionally, it may serve to adjust
   swing-phase sensory transmission based on locomotor task, speed, and
   step-to-step environmental perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{While metallic fuels have a long history of reactor use, their
   fundamental physical and thermodynamic properties are not well
   understood. Many metallic nuclear fuels are body-centered cubic alloys
   of uranium that swell under fission conditions, creating fission product
   gases such as helium, xenon and krypton. In this paper, helium, xenon,
   and krypton point defects are investigated in the alpha and gamma phases
   of metallic uranium using first principles calculations. A density
   functional theory (DFT) framework is utilized with projector
   augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. Formation and incorporation
   energies of He, Xe, and Kr are calculated at various defect positions
   for the prediction of fission gas behavior in uranium. In most cases,
   defect energies follow a size effect, with helium incorporation and
   formation energies being the smallest. The most likely position for the
   larger Xe and Kr atoms in uranium is the substitutional site. Helium
   atoms are likely to be found in a wide variety of defect positions due
   to the comparable formation energies of all defect configurations
   analyzed. This is the first detailed study of the stability and
   incorporation of fission gases in uranium. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{After a radiological dispersal device (RDD) event, people could become
   internally contaminated by inhaling dispersed radioactive particles. A
   rapid method to screen individuals who are internally contaminated is
   desirable. Such initial screening can help in prompt identification of
   those who are highly contaminated and in prioritising individuals for
   further and more definitive evaluation such as laboratory testing. The
   use of handheld plastic scintillators to rapidly screen those exposed to
   an RDD with gamma-emitting radionuclides was investigated in this study.
   The Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code was used to model two
   commercially available plastic scintillation detectors in conjunction
   with anthropomorphic phantom models to determine the detector response
   to inhaled radionuclides. Biokinetic models were used to simulate an
   inhaled radionuclide and its progression through the anthropomorphic
   phantoms up to 30 d after intake. The objective of the study was to see
   if internal contamination levels equivalent to 250 mSv committed
   effective dose equivalent could be detected using these instruments.
   Five radionuclides were examined: Co-60, Cs-137, Ir-192, I-131 and
   Am-241. The results demonstrate that all of the radionuclides except
   Am-241 could be detected when placing either one of the two plastic
   scintillator detector systems on the posterior right torso of the
   contaminated individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the demonstration of series tuning for lateral
   micromechanical oscillators and its application for electronic
   temperature compensation of piezoelectric lateral bulk acoustic
   resonator (LBAR) micromechanical oscillators. Two aluminum
   nitride-on-silicon (AlN-on-Si) piezoelectric LBARs, one operating at 427
   MHz (R-m approximate to 180 Omega, Q(unloaded) approximate to 1400) and
   the other operating at 541 MHz (R-m approximate to 55 Omega, Q(unloaded)
   approximate to 3000) are interfaced with a 13 mW three-stage tunable TIA
   implemented in 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process to sustain the oscillation.
   Recognizing the impact on the frequency tuning range due to the body
   capacitances appearing in parallel with the ports of the resonator, the
   TIA uses parasitic cancellation techniques to neutralize this effect and
   boost the tuning range of 427 MHz and 541 MHz oscillators, by as much as
   12x to 810 ppm and 1,530 ppm, respectively, with negligible impact on
   the phase noise performance. The shunt parasitic capacitor is either
   resonated out with an active inductor or is cancelled out by using a
   single-terminal negative capacitor of equal value. However, the
   oscillator that uses negative capacitance parasitic cancellation yields
   larger tuning. This extended tuning range is used for temperature
   compensation. A 2 mW bandgap-based temperature compensation circuit
   which uses second-order parabolic approximation is fabricated on the
   same chip. Using this temperature compensation circuit has lowered the
   overall frequency drift of a 427 MHz tunable oscillator using negative
   capacitance cancellation from +/- 390 ppm to +/- 35 ppm in the -10
   degrees C to 70 degrees C temperature range. The phase noise of this
   oscillator reaches -82 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. The total phase noise
   variation for offset frequencies below 10 kHz is under 5 dB within the
   specified tuning range, and the best phase noise floor is under -147
   dBc/Hz. Due to the higher Q and lower insertion loss of the resonating
   tank, the 541 MHz oscillator achieves -86 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset, and
   lower phase noise floor of -158 dBc/Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Phase analysis has been developed and validated to measure

   imaging. The purpose of this study is to evaluate its performance in
   regions with perfusion defects.
   A special version of the eXtended CArdiac Torso digital phantom was
   developed to track B-spline points in each temporal frame. A region of
   35 B-spline points in the inferior wall with normal and abnormal
   perfusion uptakes were simulated. Phase shifts were simulated in the
   same region, representing dyssynchronous contraction. Gated SPECT data
   were analyzed using a modified phase analysis algorithm, which tracked
   the same 35 B-spline points to calculate their phases.
   Phases and phase shifts measured in the B-spline points with perfusion
   uptake in the range of 50\%-10\% did not significantly differ from those
   measured in the same B-spline points with normal perfusion uptake.
   Phase analysis can accurately measure phases in regions with abnormal
   perfusion uptake as low as 10\% of the perfusion uptake in the normal
   regions, which corresponded to a regional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
   12.0 or greater. In 42 consecutive patients with myocardial infarction >
   20\% of the left ventricle, only two patients had a SNR within the
   perfusion defects below that threshold.}},

Abstract = {{This work develops a system dynamic simulation model for free-water
   surface constructed wetlands, as well as provides appropriate values for
   the parameters of constructed wetland management. The system dynamic
   model is calibrated and validated by using data from a 1-year study of a
   constructed wetland in Tainan of southern Taiwan. Additionally, the
   major parameters that affect the simulation output are obtained via
   sensitivity analysis by using generalized likelihood uncertainty
   estimation (GLUE). A high R (2) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of
   efficiency between the simulated and measured outflow values indicate
   that in addition to reproducing the changing trends of dissolved oxygen
   (DO), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN), total
   suspended sediment (TSS), and total phosphorous (TP) concentrations, the
   model can simulate the variations of DO, BOD5, and TSS. Taken into
   account the interactions among parameters, the GLUE method successfully
   obtained the model sensitive parameters from the Monte Carlo parameter
   sets. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that the parameters of
   microorganisms are sensitive factors that affect DO, BOD5, and TN, while
   sediment diameter largely influences TP and TSS. Further elucidating
   environmental microorganisms would increase the model accuracy and
   provide a valuable reference for constructed wetland management and

Abstract = {{Ester quaternary ammonium compounds (esterquats), which are mainly used
   as active ingredients in fabric softeners and personal care products,
   are beginning to replace traditional quaternary ammonium compounds. As a
   result of hydrophobicity and increasing use, esterquats reach anaerobic
   treatment systems. However, little is known about the fate of esterquats
   under anaerobic conditions. In the present study, the potential
   inhibitory effect and biotransformation of two alkanoylcholines -
   acetylcholine chloride (ACh-Cl) and lauroylcholine chloride (LCh-Cl) -
   which are simple esterquats, under methanogenic conditions were
   investigated. ACh-Cl up to 300 mg/L Was not inhibitory to a mixed
   methanogenic culture. In contrast, methanogenesis was inhibited by
   LCh-Cl above 50 mg/L, primarily caused by the accumulation of lauric
   acid which resulted from the abiotic hydrolysis of LCh. Below inhibitory
   concentrations, both ACh and LCh were transformed to methane by the
   mixed methanogenic culture. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that
   both alkanoylcholines were first abiotically hydrolyzed to choline and
   the corresponding alkanoic acid, which were then biotically transformed
   to methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. Thus,
   alkanoylcholine-containing waste streams can be bio-processed to form
   methane, but hydrolysis products such as long-chain alkanoic acids may
   adversely impact the anaerobic bioconversion of alkanoylcholines. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite a wealth of studies examining the toxicity of engineered
   nanomaterials, current knowledge on their cytotoxic mechanisms
   (particularly from a physical perspective) remains limited. In this
   work, we imaged and quantitatively characterized the biomechanical
   (hardness and elasticity), adhesive, and surface electrical properties
   of Escherichia coli cells with and without exposure to hematite
   nanoparticles (NPs) in an effort to advance our understanding of the
   cytotoxic impacts of nanomaterials. Both scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that E. coli cells had
   noticeable deformation with hematite treatment for 45 min with a
   statistical significance. The hematite-treated cells became
   significantly harder or stiffer than untreated ones, as evidenced by
   indentation and spring constant measurements. The average indentation of
   the hematite-treated E. coli cells was 120 nm, which is significantly
   lower (P < 0.01) than that of the untreated cells (approximately 400
   nm). The spring constant of hematite-treated E. coli cells (0.28 +/-
   0.11 nN/nm) was about 20 times higher than that of untreated ones (0.01
   0.01 nN/nm). The zeta potential of E. coli cells, measured by dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), was shown to shift from -4 +/- 2 mV to -27 +/- 8
   mV with progressive surface adsorption of hematite NPs, a finding which
   is consistent with the local surface potential measured by Kelvin probe
   force microscopy (KPFM). Overall, the reported findings quantitatively
   revealed the adverse impacts of nanomaterial exposure on physical
   properties of bacterial cells and should provide insight into the
   toxicity mechanisms of nanomaterials.}},

Title = {{Reactive Oxygen Species Regulate Osteopontin Expression in a Murine
   Model of Postischemic Neovascularization}},
Journal = {{ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1383+}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective-Previous findings from our laboratory demonstrated that
   neovascularization was impaired in osteopontin (OPN) knockout animals.
   However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of OPN expression
   in the setting of ischemia remain undefined. Therefore, we sought to
   determine whether OPN is upregulated in response to ischemia and
   hypothesized that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a critical component of
   the signaling mechanism by which OPN expression is upregulated in
   response to ischemia in vivo.
   Methods and Results-To determine whether ischemic injury upregulates
   OPN, we used a murine model of hindlimb ischemia. Femoral artery
   ligation in C57BL/6 mice significantly increased OPN expression and H2O2
   production. Infusion of C57BL/6 mice with polyethylene glycol-catalase
   (10 000 U/kg per day) or the use of transgenic mice with smooth muscle
   cell-specific catalase overexpression blunted ischemia-induced OPN,
   suggesting ischemia-induced OPN expression is H2O2-dependent. Decreased
   H2O2-mediated OPN blunted reperfusion and collateral formation in vivo.
   In contrast, the overexpression of OPN using lentivirus restored
   neovascularization.
   Conclusion-Scavenging H2O2 blocks ischemia-induced OPN expression,
   providing evidence that ischemia-induced OPN expression is H2O2
   dependent. Decreased OPN expression impaired neovascularization, whereas
   overexpression of OPN increased angiogenesis, supporting our hypothesis
   that OPN is a critical mediator of postischemic neovascularization and a
   potential novel therapeutic target for inducing new vessel growth.
