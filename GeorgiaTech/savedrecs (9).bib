Abstract = {{With the bloom of wearable electronics, it is becoming necessary to
   develop energy storage units, e.g., supercapacitors that can be
   arbitrarily tailored at the device level. Although gel electrolytes have
   been applied in supercapacitors for decades, no report has studied the
   shape-tailorable capability of a supercapacitor, for instance, where the
   device still works after being cut. Here we report a tailorable
   gel-based supercapacitor with symmetric electrodes prepared by combining
   electrochemically reduced graphene oxide deposited on a nickel nanocone
   array current collector with a unique packaging method. This
   supercapacitor with good flexibility and consistency showed excellent
   rate performance, cycling stability, and mechanical properties. As a
   demonstration, these tailorable supercapacitors connected in series can
   be used to drive small gadgets, e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED) and a
   minimotor propeller. As simple as it is (electrochemical deposition,
   stencil printing, etc.), this technique can be used in wearable
   electronics and miniaturized device applications that require
   arbitrarily shaped energy storage units.}},

Abstract = {{Highly stretchable 2D fabrics are prepared by weaving fibers for a
   fabric-structured triboelectric nanogenerator (FTENG). The fibers mainly
   consist of Al wires and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tubes with a

   nanowires. The fabrics were produced by interlacing the fibers, which
   was bonded to a waterproof fabric for all-weather use for
   fabric-structured triboelectric nanogenerator (FTENG). It showed a
   stable high-output voltage and current of 40 V and 210 mu A,
   corresponding to an instantaneous power output of 4 mW. The FTENG also
   exhibits high robustness behavior even after 25\% stretching, enough for
   use in smart clothing applications and other wearable electronics. For
   wearable applications, the nanogenerator was successfully demonstrated
   in applications of footstep-driven large-scale power mats during walking
   and power clothing attached to the elbow.}},

Abstract = {{A high-performance broad band UV/visible photodetector has been
   successfully fabricated on a fully wide bandgap ZnO/ZnS type-II
   heterojunction core/shell nanowire array. The device can detect photons
   with energies significantly smaller (2.2 eV) than the band gap of ZnO
   (3.2 eV) and ZnS (3.7 eV), which is mainly attributed to spatially
   indirect type-II transition facilitated by the abrupt interface between
   the ZnO core and ZnS shell. The performance of the device was further
   enhanced through the piezo-phototronic effect induced lowering of the
   barrier height to allow charge carrier transport across the ZnO/ZnS
   interface, resulting in three orders of relative responsivity change
   measured at three different excitation wavelengths (385, 465, and 520
   nm). This work demonstrates a prototype UV/visible photodetector based
   on the truly wide band gap semiconducting 3D core/shell nanowire array
   with enhanced performance through the piezo-phototronic effect.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a radiation-efficient D-band end-fire on-chip antenna
   utilizing a localized back-side etching (LBE) technique, as well as an
   antenna-in-package (AiP) on a low-cost organic substrate, is presented.
   Quasi-Yagi-Uda antennas are chosen for end-fire radiation because of
   their compact size. The on-chip antenna is realized in the back-end of
   the line (BEOL) process of a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology, whereas the
   in-package antenna is realized in liquid crystal polymer (LCP)
   technology for comparison. The on-chip antenna design is optimized to
   meet both process reliability specifications and radiation performance,
   and corresponding design guidelines are provided. The fabricated on-chip
   antennas show the state-of-the-art performance with a peak gain of 4.7
   dBi, simulated radiation efficiency of 82\%, and measured radiation
   efficiency of 72\%-76\% using the gain/directivity (G/D) and wheeler-cap
   methods at 143 GHz. The antenna demonstrates a 3-dB gain bandwidth of
   more than 30 GHz and 10-dB impedance bandwidth greater than 20 GHz (14\%
   impedance bandwidth). The measurements of the on-package end-fire
   antenna showed very comparable results with a peak measured gain of 6
   dBi and a simulated and measured radiation efficiency of 92\% and 86\%
   at 143 GHz. These results demonstrate that highly efficient on-chip
   end-fire antenna implementation is possible in standard commercially
   available BiCMOS process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple power delivery design for mitigating the
   coupling of power supply noise in mixed-signal electronics. Digital
   circuitry operating at high data rates generates supply noise that can
   interfere with sensitive RF components. Currently used methods, such as
   split planes and ferrite beads, have limited isolation bandwidth and can
   pose difficulties for signal integrity. Electromagnetic bandgap (EBG)
   structures have been shown to exhibit excellent noise isolation
   characteristics. In this paper, a set of parallel digital buffers and a
   low-noise amplifier are powered by a power transmission line (PTL)
   instead of a voltage plane. An embedded bandstop filter in the PTL
   significantly reduces the amount of coupled noise between the digital
   and RF supply voltage pins. In addition, a source terminating the PTL
   provides good noise isolation with even lower supply noise. The proposed
   methods are easy to design and implement and use much less space than an
   equivalent EBG structure. Test vehicles using these proposed methods, as
   well as using an EBG structure, were fabricated and tested with regard
   to power supply noise, jitter, and noise isolation. The proposed methods
   show up to 13-dB decrease in coupled power compared with the EBG. In
   addition, the measured supply noise is decreased by 75\% and the total
   jitter in the transmitted eye diagram is improved by 23\% using the
   proposed method.}},

   relying too much on decoupling capacitors. This is achieved using a
   combination of PTL that replaces the voltage planes and current steering
   techniques. The PTL scheme described in this paper can be used for
   high-speed digital signaling. The SI and PI are demonstrated for up to
   3-Gbit/s transmission between the boards.}},

Abstract = {{The secure operation of Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is crucial for
   the bulk power systems, since the failure of GIS apparatus would cause
   severe interruption of power transforming and power supply at
   substations. Therefore, the monitoring and maintenance schemes of GIS
   devices have gradually taken the reliability-based indices into account,
   of which Partial Discharge (PD) levels in online monitoring are of
   substantial significance because PD serves as a major cause of
   insulation break-down. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) method is becoming
   widely adopted as the major inspection approach for PD in GIS. This
   paper presents the experiment-based results of the frequency
   characteristics of UHF signals caused by PD in typical defects using
   entire GIS operating system platforms. Specifically, the results covered
   the propagation attenuation of the UHF signals with peak to peak value
   and cumulative energy through typical structures, including basin-type
   insulators, L-shaped branch, isolating switches, current transformers,
   etc. The results serve as substantial criteria for optimal band width
   selection for high frequency detection, and as notable concerns to
   improve the sensitivity of UHF detection and the efficiency of online
   monitoring by effectively locating the external sensors for PD UHF
   detection.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Fracture and Dissipation Behaviors of Concrete at the Mesoscale}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic compaction and fracture of concrete is simulated at the
   mesoscale. Calculations are carried out under conditions of nominally
   uniaxial stress and uniaxial strain at a strain rate of 5000 s(-1),
   allowing the effect of confinement, or stress triaxiality, on the
   response to be analyzed. A series of mesostructures, each member
   containing between 0-40\% quartz aggregate and 0-5\% pores by volume, is
   randomly generated to investigate the effect of mesostructure. The
   analysis focuses on load-carrying capacity and energy dissipation.
   Fracture within bulk phases and along interfaces in the structures is
   modeled using the cohesive finite element method. Dissipation through
   inelastic flow, fracture, and friction are separately tracked and
   quantified. Calculated results show that triaxiality has a strong
   influence on the dominant mode of energy dissipation and the volume
   fractions of aggregate and pores significantly influence the
   load-carrying capacity and energy dissipation capabilities of the
   materials. The framework and data presented can be used to support the
   design of materials with optimized trade-offs between competing
   performance metrics during dynamic loading.}},

Title = {{Building bridges across electronic health record systems through
   inferred phenotypic topics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{82-93}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Data in electronic health records (EHRs) is being
   increasingly leveraged for secondary uses, ranging from biomedical
   association studies to comparative effectiveness. To perform studies at
   scale and transfer knowledge from one institution to another in a
   meaningful way, we need to harmonize the phenotypes in such systems.
   Traditionally, this has been accomplished through expert specification
   of phenotypes via standardized terminologies, such as billing codes.
   However, this approach may be biased by the experience and expectations
   of the experts, as well as the vocabulary used to describe such
   patients. The goal of this work is to develop a data-driven strategy to
   (1) infer phenotypic topics within patient populations and (2) assess
   the degree to which such topics facilitate a mapping across populations
   in disparate healthcare systems.
   Methods: We adapt a generative topic modeling strategy, based on latent
   Dirichlet allocation, to infer phenotypic topics. We utilize a variance
   analysis to assess the projection of a patient population from one
   healthcare system onto the topics learned from another system. The
   consistency of learned phenotypic topics was evaluated using (1) the
   similarity of topics, (2) the stability of a patient population across
   topics, and (3) the transferability of a topic across sites. We
   evaluated our approaches using four months of inpatient data from two
   geographically distinct healthcare systems: (1) Northwestern Memorial
   Hospital (NMH) and (2) Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).
   Results: The method learned 25 phenotypic topics from each healthcare
   system. The average cosine similarity between matched topics across the
   two sites was 0.39, a remarkably high value given the very high
   dimensionality of the feature space. The average stability of VUMC and
   NMH patients across the topics of two sites was 0.988 and 0.812,
   respectively, as measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Also
   the VUMC and NMH topics have smaller variance of characterizing patient
   population of two sites than standard clinical terminologies (e.g.,
   ICD9), suggesting they may be more reliably transferred across hospital
   systems.
   Conclusions: Phenotypic topics learned from EHR data can be more stable
   and transferable than billing codes for characterizing the general
   status of a patient population. This suggests that EHR-based research
   may be able to leverage such phenotypic topics as variables when pooling
   patient populations in predictive models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{External scattering from a finite phononic crystal (PC) is studied using
   the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem integrated with a Bloch wave
   expansion (BWE). The BWE technique is used to describe the internal
   pressure field of a semi-infinite or layered PC subject to an incident
   monochromatic plane wave. Following the BWE solution, the
   Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral is used to determine the external scattered
   field. For cubic PCs, the scattered results are compared to numerical
   treatments in both the frequency and time domain. The presented approach
   is expected to be valid when the PC size is larger than the acoustic
   wavelength. However, very good agreement in the spatial beam pattern is
   also documented for both large and small (with respect to the
   wavelength) PCs. The result of this work is a fully-analytical,
   efficient, and verified approach for accurately predicting external
   scattering from finite, three-dimensional PCs. (C) 2015 Acoustical

Abstract = {{We propose a detection strategy for the two-dimensional magnetic

   problems, so that the existing iterative detection strategies based on
   turbo equalization may be leveraged. The performance of the proposed
   detector is compared with a previously reported detector, in which the
   ITI is suppressed linearly via a multiple-input equalizer. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed detector outperforms the linear
   detector regardless of whether or not media noise is dominant, and
   further that the proposed detector is able to recover data from more

   upper bound. Furthermore, with the analysis of performance degradation

   the effectiveness of the ergodic capacity upper bound, and show that the

Abstract = {{In this paper, joint energy-efficient resource allocation for both the
   base station and users is studied for time division duplex (TDD) systems
   with carrier aggregation (CA). We aim at balancing the energy efficiency
   (EE) between downlink and uplink, as well as the EEs among individual
   users, by joint bandwidth and power allocation on each carrier component
   (CC). We formulate the optimization problem into maximizing the weighted
   summation of EEs for the base station and different users, where the
   weights are used to reflect the levels of importance. The objective
   function of the problem is a sum of several fractional functions,
   therefore, nonlinear sum-of-ratios programming needs to be used to solve
   it, which has not been exploited in resource allocation problems yet.
   Specifically, a novel transformation is performed to formulate an
   equivalent but better tractable problem, based on which we develop an
   iterative algorithm to find the global optimum of the considered
   problem. Numerical results validate the feasibility, fast convergence,
   and flexibility of the proposed algorithm in terms of EE balancing.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical reactivity of solid surfaces underpins functionality
   of a broad spectrum of materials and devices ranging from energy storage
   and conversion, to sensors and catalytic devices. The surface
   electrochemistry is, however; a complex process, controlled by the
   interplay of charge generation, field-controlled and
   diffusion-controlled transport. Here we explore the fundamental
   mechanisms of electrochemical reactivity on nanocrystalline ceria, using
   the synergy of nanofabricated devices and time-resolved Kelvin probe
   force microscopy (tr-KPFM), an approach we refer to as energy discovery
   platform. Through tr-KPFM, the surface potential mapping in both the
   space and time domains and current variation over time are obtained,
   enabling analysis of local ionic and electronic transport and their
   dynamic behavior on the 10 ms to 10 s scale. Based on their different
   responses in the time domain, conduction mechanisms can be separated and
   identified in a variety of environmental conditions, such as humidity
   and temperature. The theoretical modeling of ion transport through
   finite element method allows for creation of a minimal model consistent
   with observed phenomena, and establishing of the dynamic characteristics
   of the process, including mobility and diffusivity of charged species.
   The future potential of the energy discovery platforms is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic nanowires usually exhibit ultrahigh strength lint low tensile
   ductility owing to their limited strain hardening capability. Here we
   study the unique strain hardening behavior of the five-fold twinned Ag
   nanowires by nanomechanical testing and atomistic modeling. In situ
   tensile tests within a scanning electron microscope revealed strong
   strain hardening behavior of the five-fold twinned Ag nanowires.
   Molecular dynamics simulations showed that such strain hardening was
   critically controlled by twin boundaries and pre-existing defects.
   Strain hardening was size dependent; thinner nanowires achieved more
   hardening and higher ductility. The size-dependent strain hardening was
   found to be caused by the obstruction of surface-nucleated dislocations
   by twin boundaries. Our work provides mechanistic insights into
   enhancing the tensile ductility of metallic nanostructures by
   engineering the internal interfaces and defects.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial taxonomists have generally been reluctant to accept the valid
   publication of names of uncultured taxa given that only pure cultures
   allow for a thorough description of the genealogy, genetics and
   phenotype of the putative taxa to be classified. The classification of
   conspicuous uncultured organisms has been considered into the Candidatus
   provisional status, but this is only possible with organisms for which
   it is possible to retrieve basic data on phylogeny, morphology, ecology
   and some metabolic traits that unequivocally identify them. The current
   developments on modern sequencing techniques, and especially
   metagenomics, allow the recognition of discrete populations of DNA
   sequences in environmental samples, which can be considered to belong to
   individual closely related populations that may be identified as members
   of yet-to-be described species. The recognition of such populations of
   (meta)genomes allow the retrieval of valuable taxonomic information,
   i.e. genealogy, genome, phenotypic coherence with other populations, and
   ecological relevant traits. Such traits may be included in the
   Candidatus proposals of environmentally occurring, yet uncultured
   species not exhibiting exceptional morphologies, phenotypes or
   ecological relevancies. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In surgical planning of the Fontan connection for single ventricle
   physiologies, there can be differences between the proposed and
   implemented options. Here, we developed a surgical planning framework
   that help determine the best performing option and ensures that the
   results will be comparable if there are slight geometrical variations.
   Eight patients with different underlying anatomies were evaluated in
   this study; surgical variations were created for each connection by
   changing either angle, offset or baffle diameter. Computational fluid
   dynamics were performed and the energy efficiency (indexed power
   loss-iPL) and hepatic flow distribution (HFD) computed. Differences with
   the original connection were evaluated: iPL was not considerably
   affected by the changes in geometry. For HFD, the single superior vena
   cava (SVC) connections presented less variability compared to the other
   anatomies. The Y-graft connection was the most robust overall, while the
   extra-cardiac connections showed dependency to offset. Bilateral SVC and
   interrupted inferior vena cava with azygous continuation showed high
   variability in HFD. We have developed a framework to assess the
   robustness of a surgical option for the TCPC; this will be useful to
   assess the most complex cases where pre-surgery planning could be most
   beneficial to ensure an efficient and robust hemodynamic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Computational modeling of arterial thrombus formation based on
   patient-specific data holds promise as a non-invasive tool for
   preventive diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesions. Platelet transport to
   the surface of a growing thrombus may be a rate limiting step in rapid
   thrombus formation, so accurate modeling of platelet transport may be
   essential for computational modeling of arterial thrombus formation. The
   presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in blood greatly affects platelet
   transport. In flowing blood, RBCs migrate away from the walls and
   platelets marginate toward the walls. We investigate the mechanics of
   platelet margination by direct simulation of cellular blood flow. We
   show that platelet margination can be explained by RBC-enhanced
   shear-induced diffusion of platelets in the RBC-filled region combined
   with platelet trapping in the RBC-free region. A simple continuum model
   is introduced based on the proposed mechanism. Using an experimental
   correlation for effective diffusivity in blood, the continuum model can
   recover experimental results from the literature over a wide range of
   tube diameters.}},

   (BE-PFM) technique to explore the first and second harmonics of the
   piezoelectric response in prototypical relaxor-ferroelectric
   0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.28PbTiO(3) (PMN-0.28PT) single crystals. Third
   order polynomial fitting of the second harmonic reveals considerable
   correlation between the cubic coefficient map and the first harmonic
   piezoresponse amplitude. These results are interpreted under a modified
   Rayleigh framework, as evidence for domain wall contributions to
   enhanced electromechanical response. These studies highlight the
   contribution of domain wall motion in the electromechanical response of
   relaxor ferroelectrics, and further show the utility of harmonic BE-PFM
   measurements in spatially mapping the mesoscopic variability inherent in
   disordered systems. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of the Study: Computers and the Internet have the potential to
   enrich the lives of seniors and aid in the performance of important
   tasks required for independent living. A prerequisite for reaping these
   benefits is having the skills needed to use these systems, which is
   highly dependent on proper training. One prerequisite for efficient and
   effective training is being able to gauge current levels of proficiency.
   We developed a new measure (the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire, or
   CPQ) to measure computer proficiency in the domains of computer basics,
   printing, communication, Internet, calendaring software, and multimedia
   use. Our aim was to develop a measure appropriate for individuals with a
   wide range of proficiencies from noncomputer users to extremely skilled
   users.
   Design and Methods: To assess the reliability and validity of the CPQ, a
   diverse sample of older adults, including 276 older adults with no or
   minimal computer experience, was recruited and asked to complete the
   CPQ.
   Results: The CPQ demonstrated excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha =
   .98), with subscale reliabilities ranging from .86 to .97. Age, computer
   use, and general technology use all predicted CPQ scores. Factor
   analysis revealed three main factors of proficiency related to Internet
   and e-mail use; communication and calendaring; and computer basics.
   Based on our findings, we also developed a short-form CPQ (CPQ-12) with
   similar properties but 21 fewer questions.
   Implications: The CPQ and CPQ-12 are useful tools to gauge computer
   proficiency for training and research purposes, even among low computer
   proficient older adults.}},

Abstract = {{As people pay more attention to environmental protection and energy
   conservation issues, energy consumption in communications have become a
   hot research field. In wireless communications networks such as wireless
   sensor networks, traditional battery-operated devices or nodes have a
   short lifetime and die after the batteries are depleted, and replacing
   the batteries may be very costly and sometimes will be impossible.
   Therefore, energy harvesting (EH) communications have become a good
   means to solve this problem. EH communications mean the nodes can
   continue working by harvesting ambient energy. EH communications are
   different from the traditional battery-operated communications, so we
   need new models and optimal transmission policies to maximize the
   throughput. In this article we review different methods of harvesting
   the ambient energy in EH communications and the models of EH
   communications. We focus on offline optimal policies, then compare
   different policies and classify them into certain types. Finally, we
   propose several open research challenges and directions for future work.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) is to
   establish an efficient wireless communication in the underground medium.
   A magnetic induction (MI)-based signal transmission scheme has been
   proposed to overcome the very harsh propagation conditions in WUSNs. Due
   to a much lower vulnerability to the environmental changes, the MI
   technique has been shown to improve the system performance in terms of
   achievable data rates and coverage compared to the traditional EM wave
   based transmission. Two different approaches are known from the
   literature: direct MI transmission and MI waveguides, where many
   resonant relay circuits are deployed in the latter between the two nodes
   to be connected. In this work, digital transmission schemes are
   investigated for MI-WUSNs employing these two approaches. The influence
   of transmission parameters like symbol duration and modulation scheme
   are studied and new methods for their optimization are proposed. In this
   context, significant gains can be achieved compared to the naive
   straightforward approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient method to model interconnections with
   through-silicon vias (TSVs) in silicon interposer for 3-D systems. The
   proposed method uses 3-D finite-difference frequency-domain nonconformal
   domain decomposition method to model the redistribution layer
   transmission lines on lossy silicon interposer. Using the nonconformal
   domain decomposition approach, the interposer can be divided into
   separate subdomains. Individual subdomains can be discretized
   independently based on its feature size. Field continuity at interfaces
   between domains is enforced by introducing Lagrange multiplier and
   vector basis functions at the interfaces. TSVs are modeled using an
   integral-equation-based solver, which uses cylindrical modal basis
   functions. The formulation on incorporating multiport network into
   nonconformal domain decomposition is presented to include the parasitic
   effects of TSV arrays into the system matrix. By comparing with 3-D
   full-wave simulations and commercial solvers, this paper validates the
   accuracy and efficiency of the proposed modeling approach.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The mass footprints associated with atmospheric blocks over the North
   Pacific are evaluated by constructing daily tendencies of total mass
   over the blocking domain from three-dimensional mass fluxes throughout
   the life cycle of a composite blocking event. The results highlight the
   major role of mass convergence driven by low-frequency (with periods >1
   week) atmospheric disturbances during both the development and decay
   stage of a block. Specifically, low-frequency eddies are responsible for
   the accelerated mass buildup 4 days prior to the peak intensity of a
   block, and they also account for the rapid mass loss afterward.
   High-frequency, subweekly scale disturbances have statistically
   significant positive contributions to the mass loss during the decay
   stage, and also show weak negative contributions to the development of
   the blocking high prior to the peak of the high. The majority of the
   mass convergence (divergence) responsible for the intensification
   (decay) of the blocking high occurs in the middle-to-lower troposphere
   and is largely attributed to mass flux driven by low-frequency
   meridional (zonal) winds. Also discussed are the implications of this
   new mass perspective of atmospheric blocks for understanding dynamics of
   blocking highs and for model bias detection and attribution.}},

Title = {{Comparing Spatial and temporal transferability of hydrological model
   parameters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{525}},
Pages = {{409-417}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Operational use of hydrological models requires the transfer of
   calibrated parameters either in time (for streamflow forecasting) or
   space (for prediction at ungauged catchments) or both. Although the
   effects of spatial and temporal parameter transfer on catchment
   streamflow predictions have been well studied individually, a direct
   comparison of these approaches is much less documented. Here, we compare
   three different schemes of parameter transfer, viz., temporal, spatial,
   and spatiotemporal, using a spatially lumped hydrological model called
   EXP-HYDRO at 294 catchments across the continental United States.
   Results show that the temporal parameter transfer scheme performs best,
   with lowest decline in prediction performance (median decline of 4.2\%)
   as measured using the Kling-Gupta efficiency metric. More interestingly,
   negligible difference in prediction performance is observed between the
   spatial and spatiotemporal parameter transfer schemes (median decline of
   12.4\% and 13.9\% respectively). We further demonstrate that the
   superiority of temporal parameter transfer scheme is preserved even
   when: (1) spatial distance between donor and receiver catchments is
   reduced, or (2) temporal lag between calibration and validation periods
   is increased. Nonetheless, increase in the temporal lag between
   calibration and validation periods reduces the overall performance gap
   between the three parameter transfer schemes. Results suggest that
   spatiotemporal transfer of hydrological model parameters has the
   potential to be a viable option for climate change related hydrological
   studies, as envisioned in the ``trading space for time{''} framework.
   However, further research is still needed to explore the relationship
   between spatial and temporal aspects of catchment hydrological
   variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Space-filling properties are important in designing computer
   experiments. The traditional maximin and minimax distance designs
   consider only space-filling in the full-dimensional space; this can
   result in poor projections onto lower-dimensional spaces, which is
   undesirable when only a few factors are active. Restricting maximin
   distance design to the class of Latin hypercubes can improve
   one-dimensional projections but cannot guarantee good space-filling
   properties in larger subspaces. We propose designs that maximize
   space-filling properties on projections to all subsets of factors. We
   call our designs maximum projection designs. Our design criterion can be
   computed at no more cost than a design criterion that ignores projection
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Machining complex thin-wall components, such as casings and compressor
   disks in aircraft engines, is a challenging task because continuous
   deformation and vibration renders poor precision and quality in final
   products. However, monitoring workpiece vibration is hindered by harsh
   working conditions like cutting fluids, not to mention investigation
   into the vibration principle during cutting. In order to establish
   criteria for designing noncontact sensors to monitor workpiece
   vibration, this study presents a plate dynamic model along with
   experimentally identified damping ratios for an annular workpiece under
   constraints emulating those of a duplex turning machine. Formulated as a
   dimensionless boundary value problem, the solutions that have been
   numerically verified with finite element analysis provide a rational
   basis for identifying key cutting process parameters and quantifying
   their effects on thin-wall component vibration sensing. With a detailed
   modal analysis, the dynamic model provides a simple yet practical method
   for vibration measurements using an eddycurrent sensing approach.
   Experiments were carried out to justify the proposed method, validate
   the stability of eddy-current sensing under the harsh cutting condition,
   and investigate the effect of sensor placement on sensing configuration
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of the interconnect between the

   technologies. State-of-the-art 32-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS and
   120-nm SiGe HBT technologies are analyzed in detail. Measured results
   indicate a significant reduction in the unity-gain frequency (f(T)) from
   the bottom to the top metal layer for advanced CMOS technology nodes,
   but only a slight reduction for SiGe HBTs. The 32-nm SOI CMOS and SiGe
   HBT technologies have a reduction in the maximum oscillation frequency
   (f(max)) from the bottom to the top metal layer of similar to 12\% and
   5\%, respectively. By analyzing technology scaling trends, it is clear
   that SiGe HBTs can now achieve a similar peak f(T) at the top metal
   layer in comparison with advanced CMOS technology nodes, and a
   significantly higher f(max). Furthermore, in CMOS technologies, the top

Abstract = {{This paper studies a redundancy allocation problem (RAP) with cold
   standby strategy in non-repairable series-parallel systems. We assume
   that the components' reliabilities are uncertain values in a budgeted
   uncertainty set, with unknown probability distributions. Because the
   system reliability is a nonlinear function of the components'
   reliabilities, classical robust optimization approaches cannot be
   directly applied to construct the robust counterpart of this problem.
   Therefore, this paper for the first time proposes linear mixed integer
   programming (MIP) and binary equivalent models for the cold standby RAP;
   and by exploiting the problem structure, robust counterparts are
   developed to deal with budgeted uncertainty in this problem. Then, two
   exact solution methods are proposed: one of them solves a MIP model
   iteratively in a Benders' decomposition framework, and the other one
   solves a single binary linear model. The validity and the performance of
   the proposed approach are tested through a Monte Carlo simulation, and
   computational results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, operation of a helicopter near a ship is statistically
   investigated to provide an estimate of the probability of successfully
   recovering manned rotorcraft on the deck of a moving ship. To this end,
   pitch, roll, and heave motion of the ship are calculated according to
   sea states. In addition, effect on dynamics of the rotorcraft from ship
   airwake is also considered in a simplified way. By assuming that a
   helicopter can land on a ship if a pilot maintains relative position and
   attitude difference within the safe boundary for a given time, the
   operational limits are probabilistically determined in terms of pilot's
   workload for a specified mission. The simulation environment consists of
   linearized helicopter dynamics, an optimal pilot model, effect of
   turbulent ship airwake, and ship motion. Control activities of the
   piloted helicopter for position holding with respect to the moving ship
   are transformed to generalized workload ratings. Simulation results show
   the proposed approach can evaluate and predict mission success rates for
   various operational combinations, allowing implementation into the
   overall effectiveness assessment of the ship and ship-helicopter
   combination.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{7, SI}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of planning under uncertainty, with
   application to mobile robotics. We propose a probabilistic framework in
   which the robot bases its decisions on the generalized belief, which is
   a probabilistic description of its own state and of external variables
   of interest. The approach naturally leads to a dual-layer architecture:
   an inner estimation layer, which performs inference to predict the
   outcome of possible decisions; and an outer decisional layer which is in
   charge of deciding the best action to undertake. Decision making is
   entrusted to a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The formulation is
   valid for general cost functions and does not discretize the state or
   control space, enabling planning in continuous domain. Moreover, it
   allows to relax the assumption of maximum likelihood observations:
   predicted measurements are treated as random variables, and binary
   random variables are used to model the event that a measurement is
   actually taken by the robot. We successfully apply our approach to the
   problem of uncertainty-constrained exploration, in which the robot has
   to perform tasks in an unknown environment, while maintaining
   localization uncertainty within given bounds. We present an extensive
   numerical analysis of the proposed approach and compare it against
   related work. In practice, our planning approach produces smooth and
   natural trajectories and is able to impose soft upper bounds on the
   uncertainty. Finally, we exploit the results of this analysis to
   identify current limitations and show that the proposed framework can
   accommodate several desirable extensions.}},

Abstract = {{An asymptotically correct, nonlinear, analytical cross-sectional
   analysis is developed for pretwisted, isotropic beams under axial load
   and torsion. A comprehensive model is presented that for the first time
   simultaneously counts for both trapeze and Poynting effects (either
   positive or negative). Several material models are used and differences
   are discussed in detail. The limitations of the uniaxial stress
   assumption and Saint-Venant/Kirchhoff materials are illustrated.
   Compared to the widely accepted results in the literature, the present
   theory demonstrates improved results without introducing assumptions
   commonly used in other works. It is concluded that the trapeze and
   Poynting phenomena are governed by the material models and warping
   functions, and nonlinearly coupled extension and torsion can be
   eliminated by properly selecting the thickness-to-width ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The microvascular strategy demonstrates unique advantages in
   shape-memory polymer applications as it can achieve both rapid thermal
   activation and deactivation during a typical shape-memory cycle. In
   addition, localized overheating can be avoided in comparison with other
   heating methods, such as the magnetic and electric heating. In this
   paper, a finite-element-based computational analysis was performed to
   study the rapid thermal response of shape-memory polymer composites with
   an embedded microvascular system. We show that the polymer shape-fixing
   speed, the shape fixity after a given cooling time, and the
   shape-recovery rate are significantly enhanced due to the rapid cooling
   and heating effect of internal microvasculature. The effect of the
   composite dimensions and microvascular channel arrangement on the
   activation and deactivation was studied. Typically, reducing the
   composite thickness and tube spacing increases the shape-recovery speed
   of the shape-memory polymer composite by effectively reducing the length
   of the thermal conduction pathways. Strategies for achieving an
   optimized tube arrangement were also discussed based on the
   considerations of the system mass and thermal boundary conditions. The
   results in this paper provide a guideline for further designs and
   applications of shape-memory polymer composites with embedded
   microvasculature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a unified framework to address the problem of
   optimal nonlinear analysis and feedback control design for finite-time
   partial stability and finite-time, partial-state stabilization.
   Finite-time partial stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system is
   guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov function that is positive definite and
   decrescent with respect to part of the system state, satisfies a
   differential inequality involving fractional powers, and can clearly be
   seen to be the solution to the steady-state form of the
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation guaranteeing both partial stability and
   optimality. The overall framework provides the foundation for extending
   optimal linear-quadratic controller synthesis to nonlinear-nonquadratic
   optimal finite-time, partial-state stabilization. In addition, we
   specialize our results to address the problem of optimal finite-time
   control for nonlinear time-varying systems. Finally, we develop optimal
   feedback controllers for affme nonlinear systems using an inverse
   optimality framework tailored to the finite-time, partial-state
   stabilization problem and use this result to address finite-time,
   partial-state stabilizing sublinear controllers that minimize a derived
   performance criterion involving subquadratic terms. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated recently that metal gratings can significantly
   improve the near-infrared absorptance of graphene from 0.023 to nearly
   0.70 because of the excitation of magnetic polaritons (MPs). In the
   present study, it is shown that the absorptance of graphene can be
   further enhanced to more than 0.80 by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)
   enabled by the grating. Meanwhile, graphene behaves as a sheet resistor
   that is able to boost the absorption when MPs or SPPs are excited
   without changing their resonance frequencies or dispersion relations.
   The effects of higher-order MPs, as well as the grating geometry on the
   enhanced absorptance, are also examined. Rigorous coupled-wave analysis
   (RCWA) is employed to calculate the radiative properties and power
   dissipation density in both the graphene and the metal grating. This
   study will facilitate the understanding of the coupling phenomena
   between graphene and nanostructures and may also benefit the design of
   next-generation graphenebased optical and optoelectronic devices. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: To date, biomarkers to predict benefit from anti-angiogenic
   therapy are still lacking. Sorafenib and metronomic oral vinorelbine
   combination was studied and changes in blood and DCE-MRI parameters were
   investigated as biomarkers for benefit.
   Material and methods: Patients with advanced NSCLC were recruited to 3
   successive cohorts. Each cohort was given a fixed metronomic (3 times a
   week) dose of oral vinorelbine at 60 mg/week, 90 mg/week, or 120 mg/week
   respectively. Within each cohort, patients received a starting dose of
   sorafenib at 200 mg bid for 4 weeks. In the absence of dose-limiting
   toxicities, each patient's dose of sorafenib was escalated to 400 mg bid
   for 4 weeks, 600 mg bid for 4 weeks and finally 800 mg bid. Biomarkers
   measured include DCE-MRI parameters, circulating endothelial cells
   (CECs), circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs), and plasma
   thrombospondin (TSP-1).
   Results: 48 evaluable patients were analyzed. There were 4 (8.9\%)
   patients with partial response (PR) and 7 (15.2\%) with cavitary
   response (CaR). Two subpopulations of CECs (CEChi, CEClo) were
   identified that trended in opposite directions during treatment, with
   CEChi demonstrating an upward trend in contrast to CEClo. Higher
   baseline CEChi and lower baseline blood flow (F) and fractional
   intravascular blood volume (V1) predicted for response. Multivariate
   analysis revealed a lower baseline V1, and dynamic changes of CEC during
   treatment (CEC increase, sum of CEChl and CEClo) predicted for improved
   survival.
   Conclusions: Sorafenib and metronomic oral vinorelbine is active in
   advanced NSCLC. Baseline levels and changes in DCE parameters and CEC
   may be useful predictive biomarkers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Structural engineers are often constrained by cost or manufacturing
   considerations to select member thicknesses from a discrete set of
   values. Conventional, gradient-free techniques to solve these discrete
   problems cannot handle large problem sizes, while discrete material
   optimization (DMO) techniques may encounter difficulties, especially for
   bending-dominated problems. To resolve these issues, we propose an
   efficient gradient-based technique to obtain engineering solutions to
   the discrete thickness selection problem. The proposed technique uses a
   series of constraints to enforce an effective stiffness-to-mass and
   strength-to-mass penalty on intermediate designs. In conjunction with
   these constraints, we apply an exact penalty function which drives the
   solution towards a discrete design. We utilize a continuation approach
   to obtain approximate solutions to the discrete thickness selection
   problem by solving a sequence of relaxed continuous problems with
   increasing penalization. We also show how this approach can be applied
   to combined discrete thickness selection and topology optimization
   design problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   technique, we present both compliance and stress-constrained results for
   in-plane and bending-dominated problems.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the repeatability of brain perfusion
   using dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging
   (DSC-MRI) with a variety of post-processing methods. METHODS: Thirty-two
   patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were recruited. On a 3-T MRI
   using a dual-echo, gradient-echo spin-echo DSC-MRI protocol, the
   patients were scanned twice 1 to 5 days apart. Perfusion maps including
   cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were generated
   using two contrast agent leakage correction methods, along with testing
   normalization to reference tissue, and application of arterial input
   function (AIF). Repeatability of CBV and CBF within tumor regions and
   healthy tissues, identified by structural images, was assessed with
   intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and repeatability
   coefficients (RCs). Coefficients of variation (CVs) were reported for
   selected methods. RESULTS: CBV and CBF were highly repeatable within
   tumor with ICC values up to 0.97. However, both CBV and CBF showed lower
   ICCs for healthy cortical tissues (up to 0.83), healthy gray matter (up
   to 0.95), and healthy white matter (WM; up to 0.93). The values of CV
   ranged from 6\% to 10\% in tumor and 3\% to 11\% in healthy tissues. The
   values of RC relative to the mean value of measurement within healthy WM
   ranged from 22\% to 42\% in tumor and 7\% to 43\% in healthy tissues.
   These percentages show how much variation in perfusion parameter,
   relative to that in healthy WM, we expect to observe to consider it
   statistically significant. We also found that normalization improved
   repeatability, but AIF deconvolution did not. CONCLUSIONS: DSC-MRI is
   highly repeatable in high-grade glioma patients.}},

Abstract = {{There is great interest in DNA nanotechnology, but its use has been
   limited to aqueous or substantially hydrated media. The first assembly
   of a DNA nanostructure in a water-free solvent, namely a low-volatility
   biocompatible deep-eutectic solvent composed of a 4:1 mixture of
   glycerol and choline chloride (glycholine), is now described. Glycholine
   allows for the folding of a two-dimensional DNA origami at 20 degrees C
   in six days, whereas in hydrated glycholine, folding is accelerated
   (3h). Moreover, a three-dimensional DNA origami and a DNA tail system
   can be folded in hydrated glycholine under isothermal conditions.
   Glycholine apparently reduces the kinetic traps encountered during
   folding in aqueous solvent. Furthermore, folded structures can be
   transferred between aqueous solvent and glycholine. It is anticipated
   that glycholine and similar solvents will allow for the creation of
   functional DNA structures of greater complexity by providing a milieu
   with tunable properties that can be optimized for a range of
   applications and nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and distributed-generation (DG)
   integration are popular strategies implemented by utilities to improve
   energy efficiency. This paper investigates the interactions between CVR
   and DG placement to minimize load consumption in distribution networks,
   while keeping the lowest voltage level within the predefined range. The
   optimal placement of DG units is formulated as a stochastic optimization
   problem considering the uncertainty of DG outputs and load consumptions.
   A sample average approximation algorithm-based technique is developed to
   solve the formulated problem effectively. A multiple replications
   procedure is developed to test the stability of the solution and
   calculate the confidence interval of the gap between the candidate
   solution and optimal solution. The proposed method has been applied to
   the IEEE 37-bus distribution test system with different scenarios. The
   numerical results indicate that the implementations of CVR and DG, if
   combined, can achieve significant energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial contamination is the main cause of loss of biomass yield in
   microalgal cultures, especially under outdoor environmental conditions.
   Little is known about the identities of microbial contaminants in
   outdoor mass algal cultures. In this study, a new genus and species of
   vampyrellid amoeba, Vernalophrys algivore, is described from cultures of
   Scenedesmus dimorphus in open raceway ponds and outdoor flat-panel
   photobioreactors. This vampyrellid amoeba was a significant grazer of
   Scenedesmus and was frequently associated with a very rapid decline in
   algal numbers. We report on the morphology, subcellular structure,
   feeding behavior, molecular phylogeny, and life cycle. The new amoeba
   resembles Leptophrys in the shape of trophozoites and pseudopodia and in
   the mechanism of feeding (mainly by engulfment). It possesses two
   distinctive regions in helix E10\_1 (nucleotides 117 to 119, CAA) and
   E23\_1 (nucleotides 522 and 523, AG) of the 18S rRNA gene. It did not
   form a monophyletic group with Leptophrys in molecular phylogenetic
   trees. We establish a new genus, Vernalophrys, with the type species
   Vernalophrys algivore. The occurrence, impact of the amoeba on mass
   culture of S. dimorphus, and means to reduce vampyrellid amoeba
   contamination in Scenedesmus cultures are addressed. The information
   obtained from this study will be useful for developing an early warning
   system and control measures for preventing or treating this contaminant
   in microalgal mass cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Both the C-H and O-H region spectra of crystalline cellulose were
   studied using the sub-wavenumber high-resolution broadband sum frequency
   generation vibrational spectroscopy (HR-BB-SFG-VS) for the first time.
   The resolution of HR-BB-SFG-VS is about 10-times better than
   conventional scanning SFG-VS and has the capability of measuring the
   intrinsic spectral lineshape and revealing many more spectral details.
   With HR-BB-SFG-VS, we found that in cellulose samples from different
   sources, including Avicel and cellulose crystals isolated from algae
   Valonia (I alpha) and tunicates (I beta), the spectral signatures in the
   O-H region were unique for the two allomorphs, i.e. I alpha and I beta,
   while the spectral signatures in the C-H regions varied in all samples
   examined. Even though the origin of the different spectral signatures of
   the crystalline cellulose in the O-H and C-H vibrational frequency
   regions are yet to be correlated to the structure of cellulose, these
   results lead to new spectroscopic methods and opportunities to classify
   and to understand the basic crystalline structures, as well as
   variations in polymorphism of the crystalline cellulose.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to trace pseudo lignin
   formation during the hydrothermal pretreatment of holocellulose and
   elaborate the structure of the isolated pseudo lignin. The results
   showed that XPS could detect the trace amounts of pseudo lignin in the
   pretreated holocellulose substrate by quantitative determination of
   carbon (C) and oxygen (O), while fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR) and solid-state cross polarisation magic angle spinning
   carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS C-13-NMR) almost had no
   responses. After extensive pretreatment, C-1 increased from 8.9 to 23.0
   \%, O/C decreased from 0.68 to 0.54 along with an increase of Klason
   lignin of the pretreated holocellulose from 1.0 to 6.2 \%. As for
   isolated pseudo lignin, both O-1 and O-2 were involved, whereas only O-1
   involved in reference lignin and O-2 in holocellulose sample. In
   comparison to reference lignin, pseudo lignin was rich in C-1 and less
   in C-2, suggesting that more cyclic structures and hydroxyl groups were
   present in the pseudo lignin. The FT-IR and NMR results identified the
   presence of more aliphatic structures in the pseudo lignin, especially
   those formed initially; while the subsequent pretreatment could modify
   the aliphatic toward to aromatic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) flower-like nanosheets coated three
   dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous Ni composite films are successfully
   prepared by the combination of hydrogen-bubble template
   electro-deposition and electrochemical polymerization methods. The novel
   3D porous NiHCF/Ni composite films demonstrate excellent electrochemical
   performance as binder-free integrated electrodes for supercapacitors in
   KNO3 neutral electrolyte. Comparing to the NiHCF coated on smooth Ni
   film, the 3D hierarchical porous NiHCF/Ni film electrodes exhibit about
   10 times larger specific capacitance in KNO3 neutral electrolyte. The 3D
   porous NiHCF/Ni film electrodes also illustrate good long-term stability
   for about 18,000 charge-discharge cycles. The improvement of
   electrochemical performance might be ascribed to the large specific
   area, highly conductive pathway and fast ion diffusion for the
   flower-like NiHCF nanosheets directly growth on the 3D hierarchical
   porous interconnected conductive scaffold current collectors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present an information-theoretic framework for sequential adaptive

   to maximize the extracted information conditioned on the previous

   Info-Greedy for a family of - sparse signals by connecting compressed
   sensing and blackbox complexity of sequential query algorithms, and
   present Info-Greedy algorithms for Gaussian and Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM) signals, as well as ways to design sparse Info-Greedy
   measurements. Numerical examples demonstrate the good performance of the
   proposed algorithms using simulated and real data: Info-Greedy Sensing
   shows significant improvement over random projection for signals with
   sparse and low-rank covariance matrices, and adaptivity brings
   robustness when there is a mismatch between the assumed and the true

Title = {{Life cycle assessment of the City of Atlanta, Georgia's centralized
   water system}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{880-891}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The main goal of this study was to conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA)
   for the City of Atlanta's (CoA) centralized water system in order to
   understand the sources of the largest environmental impacts in the
   system. The boundaries of the water system we studied included the water
   supply system, the wastewater collection and treatment system, and the
   stormwater collection system. The CoA has separate wastewater and
   stormwater collection systems; therefore, they are considered
   separately.
   We defined the functional unit (FU) of our study to be 1 m(3) of water
   distributed to the point-of-use, and our scope includes infrastructure
   construction and decommissioning in addition to system operation. We
   used the US Life Cycle Inventory (USLCI) and ecoinvent databases to
   inventory all emissions and resource use. We determined the major
   impacts of the water system and the sources that create these impacts
   using TRACI v2.1, which is the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)
   methodology developed for North America by the Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA). In addition, a method to evaluate the impact of freshwater
   consumption on ecosystem was used in this study because it is excluded
   in TRACI v2.1.
   The four major impacts of the CoA's centralized water system were
   carcinogenic effects, ecotoxicity, non-carcinogenic effects, and
   eutrophication; respectively, they contribute 62, 8, 6, and 5 \% of the
   average impacts of a US resident per year (2008) for the annual water
   use of a single-family home resident. Notably, the input which causes 68
   \% of the carcinogenic effects, which has the largest normalized impact,
   was from infrastructure construction which is often ignored in the
   literature. Freshwater consumption had a relatively low impact, with an
   evaporative water loss of 0.23 m(3) per FU and a moderate level of water
   stress on the middle Chattahoochee River Basin; however, the impact of
   freshwater consumption would rapidly increase with population growth due
   to increased water consumption and expansion of the impervious area in
   the CoA.
   This study is distinctly different from other LCA studies because it
   includes infrastructure construction, which was a major contributor to
   the water system's environmental impacts. Our results suggest that
   infrastructure construction should be considered in LCA studies for
   centralized water systems. It is worth noting, however, that European
   datasets were used to determine emissions and resource use related to
   infrastructure. Results would be more accurate if inventory datasets for
   US infrastructure were available.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical surface roughness of titanium and titanium alloy implants
   plays an important role in osseointegration. In vitro and in vivo
   studies show greater osteoblast differentiation and bone formation when
   implants have submicron-scale textured surfaces. In this study, we
   tested the potential benefit of combining a submicron-scale textured
   surface with three-dimensional (3D) structure on osteoblast
   differentiation and the involvement of an integrin-driven mechanism. 3D
   titanium scaffolds were made using orderly oriented titanium meshes and
   microroughness was added to the wire surface by acid-etching. MG63 and
   human osteoblasts were seeded on 3D scaffolds and 2D surfaces with or
   without acid etching. At confluence, increased osteocalcin, vascular
   endothelial growth factor, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP) activity were observed in MG63 and human osteoblasts
   on 3D scaffolds in comparison to 2D surfaces at the protein level,
   indicating enhanced osteoblast differentiation. To further investigate
   the mechanism of osteoblast-3D scaffold interaction, the role of
   integrin 21 was examined. The results showed 1 and 21 integrin silencing
   abolished the increase in osteoblastic differentiation markers on 3D
   scaffolds. Time course studies showed osteoblasts matured faster in the
   3D environment in the early stage of culture, while as cells
   proliferated, the maturation slowed down to a comparative level as 2D
   surfaces. After 12 days of postconfluent culture, osteoblasts on 3D
   scaffolds showed a second-phase increase in ALP activity. This study
   shows that osteoblastic differentiation is improved on 3D scaffolds with
   submicron-scale texture and is mediated by integrin 21. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Our objective is to design, implement, and phantom-test a device to
   automatically obtain point-of-care patient photographs along with
   portable radiographs. Such photographs could help with detection of
   wrong-patient errors. Our device consists of a camera controller (CC)
   and a camera that can be mounted on a portable conventional radiography
   (CR) machine. Radiation from the CR machine triggers an identification
   module (IM) embedded in the CR cassette. The IM then sends the cassette
   identifier-Plate\_ID-to the CC along with a trigger to activate the
   camera. This trigger ensures simultaneous acquisition of radiograph and
   photograph, and the Plate\_ID along with a time stamp ensures binding of
   the two images. We conducted phantom tests to determine if clinical
   portable radiography exposure settings (90 to 120 kVp and exposure time
   ranging from 0.63 to 8.0 ms) are sufficient to trigger the IM. Phantom
   experiments demonstrate acceptable sensor performance for clinical
   portable radiography exposures. Simultaneous acquisition of photographs
   is achieved by integrating a low-cost identification module containing a
   scintillator-detector into the radiographic cassette. Incident X-rays
   activate the scintillator-detector triggering photograph acquisition by
   a camera controller.}},

Abstract = {{Twinning is a fundamental deformation mode that competes against
   dislocation slip in crystalline solids. In metallic nanostructures,
   plastic deformation requires higher stresses than those needed in their
   bulk counterparts, resulting in the `smaller is stronger' phenomenon.
   Such high stresses are thought to favour twinning over dislocation slip.
   Deformation twinning has been well documented in face-centred cubic
   (FCC) nanoscale crystals. However, it remains unexplored in body-centred
   cubic (BCC) nanoscale crystals. Here, by using in situ high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations, we show that
   twinning is the dominant deformation mechanism in nanoscale crystals of
   BCC tungsten. Such deformation twinning is pseudoelastic, manifested
   through reversible detwinning during unloading. We find that the
   competition between twinning and dislocation slip can be mediated by
   loading orientation, which is attributed to the competing nucleation
   mechanism of defects in nanoscale BCC crystals. Our work provides direct
   observations of deformation twinning as well as new insights into the
   deformation mechanism in BCC nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{A new twist-gel spinning process for ultrahigh molecular weight
   polyethylene fibers is demonstrated which significantly increases the
   extraction rate of nonvolatile spin solvent while simultaneously
   reducing the consumption of extraction solvent by more than 75\%.
   Applying twist to the gel fiber enables it to be directly hot-drawn,
   allowing conventional solvent extraction to proceed significantly
   faster. While solvent extraction effectiveness is largely enhanced, the
   new process does not show reduced fiber properties. The tensile
   strength, Young's modulus, surface morphology, and geometry are
   relatively unaffected when compared to fibers produced using the
   conventional gel-spinning process. The new twist-gel spinning process is
   expected to improve the processing efficiency of gel-spun high-strength
   fibers, promoting broad expansion of these high performance fibers into
   applications that were previously prohibitive due to extremely slow

Abstract = {{Dynamic light scattering (DLS) has been used to quantify nanoscale
   heterogeneity in the industrially significant polyacrylonitrile (PAN)
   polymer solution. The heterogeneity in polymer solution, traced by the
   ratio of amplitudes of the slow to fast mode, is observed to be related
   to various parameters, such as molecular weight of the polymer, the type
   of co-monomer, processing time, concentration of the solution, and the
   choice of the solvents. It has been identified that low molecular weight
   PAN homopolymer have the least heterogeneity issues. Amongst the chosen
   co-polymers for this study, similar degree of heterogeneity was observed
   at concentration slightly above the critical concentration at which the
   polymer chains begin to overlap. Whereas, at higher concentration,
   PAN-methacrylic acid (4 wt\%) copolymer showed the least heterogeneity
   issue. The aggregate diffusion coefficient of PAN-methacrylic acid (4
   wt\%) copolymer solution in dimethylformamide (DMF) and
   N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) are respectively determined to be
   approximate to 1.6 x 10(-12) cm(2)/s and approximate to 1.6 x 10(-13)
   cm(2)/s, which results in an estimated aggregate size of 9 nm and 90 nm.

Title = {{A facile method for integrating direct-write devices into
   three-dimensional printed parts}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Integrating direct-write (DW) devices into three-dimensional (3D)
   printed parts is key to continuing innovation in engineering
   applications such as smart material systems and structural health
   monitoring. However, this integration is challenging because: (1) most
   3D printing techniques leave rough or porous surfaces if they are
   untreated; (2) the thermal sintering process required for most
   conductive inks could degrade the polymeric materials of 3D printed
   parts; and (3) the extensive pause needed for the DW process during
   layer-by-layer fabrication may cause weaker interlayer bonding and
   create structural weak points. These challenges are rather common during
   the insertion of conductive patterns inside 3D printed structures. As an
   avoidance tactic, we developed a simple `print-stick-peel' method to
   transfer the DW device from the polytetrafluoroethylene or
   perfluoroalkoxy alkanes film onto any layer of a 3D printed object. This
   transfer can be achieved using the self-adhesion of 3D printing
   materials or applying additional adhesive. We demonstrated this method
   by transferring Aerosol Jet (R) printed strain sensors into parts
   fabricated by PolyJet (TM) printing. This report provides an
   investigation and discussion on the sensitivity, reliability, and
   influence embedding the sensor has on mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Despite positive testing in animal studies, more than 80\% of novel drug
   candidates fail to proof their efficacy when tested in humans. This is
   primarily due to the use of preclinical models that are not able to
   recapitulate the physiological or pathological processes in humans.
   Hence, one of the key challenges in the field of translational medicine
   is to make the model organism mouse more human. To get answers to
   questions that would be prognostic of outcomes in human medicine, the
   mouse's genome can be altered in order to create a more permissive host
   that allows the engraftment of human cell systems. It has been shown in
   the past that these strategies can improve our understanding of tumor
   immunology. However, the translational benefits of these platforms have
   still to be proven. In the 21st century, several research groups and
   consortia around the world take up the challenge to improve our
   understanding of how to humanize the animal's genetic code, its cells
   and, based on tissue engineering principles, its extracellular
   microenvironment, its tissues, or entire organs with the ultimate goal
   to foster the translation of new therapeutic strategies from bench to
   bedside. This article provides an overview of the state of the art of
   humanized models of tumor immunology and highlights future developments
   in the field such as the application of tissue engineering and
   regenerative medicine strategies to further enhance humanized murine
   model systems. Stem Cells2015;33:1696-1704}},

Abstract = {{Congenital bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) are associated with accelerated
   disease progression, such as leaflet calcification and ascending aorta
   dilatation. Although common underlying genetic factors have been
   implicated in accelerated disease in BAV patients, several studies have
   suggested that altered hemodynamics also play a role in this disease
   process. The present study compares turbulence and wall shear stress
   (WSS) measurements between various BAV and trileaflet aortic valve (TAV)
   models to provide information for mechanobiological models of BAV
   disease. BAV and TAV models were constructed from excised porcine aortic
   valves to simulate parametric variations in BAV stenosis, hemodynamics
   and geometry. Particle image velocimetry experiments were conducted at
   physiological pressure conditions to characterize velocity fields in the
   ascending aorta. The velocity fields were post-processed to calculate
   turbulence, viscous and wall shear stresses in the ascending aorta.
   Stenosed BAV models showed the presence of eccentric systolic jets,
   causing increased WSS. Lower cardiac output resulted in a narrower jet,
   lower turbulence and lower viscous shear stress (VSS). The specific
   severe stenosis BAV model studied here showed reduced WSS due to
   reduction in non-fused leaflet mobility. Dilation of the aorta did not
   affect any turbulence or VSS, but reduced the WSS. In comparison with
   BAVs, TAVs have similar VSS values, but much smaller WSS and turbulence
   levels. These increased turbulence and WSS levels in BAVs may play a key
   role in amplifying the biological responses of the ascending aorta wall
   and valvular leaflets, and support the hemodynamic underpinnings of BAV
   disease processes.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an efficient low-overhead methodology for screening key
   layouts for ultimate typing speed. It is fast and complementary to
   existing protocols in other ways. For equal overhead, it allows testing
   over a wider range of users. It is subject to potential biases, but they
   can be quantified and adjusted. It assumes an existing standard layout
   which is used as a comparator. It eliminates bias from differing
   familiarity and finger memory by appropriately mapping both layouts. We
   illustrate it with two mobile phone keypad layouts: Samsung's variant of
   the common ABC layout, and a new user-specific layout (PM). We repeat a
   comparison previously undertaken by a training-based method, which used
   ten participants, and estimated a 54\% speedup for PM (SD = 35\%). The
   new method used 116 participants and estimated a 19.5\% speedup (SD =
   7.5\%). Differences in speedup estimates can be explained by the wide
   confidence interval of the training-based methods, differences in test
   corpuses, and the inherent conservatism of the new method. Effects of
   user characteristics could be meaningfully tested due to the larger test
   group. Gender had no detectable effect on any of the measures, but age
   and keypad experience were significantly related to ABC and PM
   performance. However, the relative speedup was unaffected by age or
   keypad experience: the method can remove comparison biases arising from
   differing experience levels.}},

Abstract = {{In their paper Kim et al. (2008), Kim, Cho and Smith presented
   predictions that exhibited significant differences in bending-shear
   coupling for the CUS box beam from their own analysis (FAMBA) vis-a-vis
   from VASS (Yu et al., 2002, 2012). The actual differences between
   results obtained from VABS (Yu et al., 2002, 2012) and FAMBA, when
   executed properly, are shown herein to be very minor. Indeed, both
   stiffness models yield very acceptable results for a static analysis.
   Specifically, VABS does not significantly deviate, qualitatively or
   quantitatively, from 3D FEM predictions, in contrast to results
   presented in Kim et al. (2008). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{High-temperature wastewaters and process waters in many industries have
   been a concern, compromising the integrity of polymeric membranes in
   filtration processes or requiring the temperature to be lowered for
   further treatments. Filtration processes employing ceramic membranes,
   however, can treat high temperature water owing to the inherent thermal
   resistance of ceramic materials, and may benefit from increases in
   permeate flux attributable to decreases in water viscosity at higher
   temperatures. In this study, the performance of a ceramic
   ultrafiltration membrane was evaluated for the filtration of feed
   solutions containing colloidal silica at temperatures between 25 and 90
   degrees C, the range encountered in various industries. Results
   indicated the net benefit of increasing permeate production at elevated
   temperatures, with a nearly 90\% increase in steady-state flux from 25
   to 90 degrees C. However, this increase was lower than that observed for
   pure water filtration, in which the flux increase with increasing
   temperature was entirely attributable to viscosity reduction.
   Resistance-in-series model analysis and cake property characterization
   suggested that total fouling resistance increased as temperature
   increased, with physically removable cake formation as the dominant
   fouling mechanism.}},

Title = {{Clear Water Abutment Scour in a Compound Channel for Extreme Hydrologic
   Events}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Peak discharges during large floods can often result in submerged
   orifice flow (also called pressure flow), or embankment and bridge
   overtopping flow, in which the embankment and abutment foundation of a
   bridge are subjected to severe scour and possible failure. In this
   study, abutment scour experiments were carried out in a wide, laboratory
   compound channel to investigate the characteristics of abutment scour
   for the three flow types of free, submerged orifice, and weir
   (overtopping) for an erodible but riprap-protected embankment and
   abutment. Detailed bed contours and three-dimensional (3D) velocities
   and turbulence quantities were measured with acoustic Doppler
   velocimeters. The results show that the contracted flow around an
   abutment (due to lateral or vertical flow contraction) and the local
   turbulent structures near the downstream face of the bridge are the main
   features of the flow field responsible for the maximum scour depth near
   the abutment. Experimental results for combined abutment and contraction
   scour depth are presented in terms of the theoretical long contraction
   scour for all three types of flow. The experimental results for maximum
   scour depth are compared with those of other investigators, and it is
   shown that the erosional strength of the embankment defines an upper and
   lower bound for maximum scour depth for a solid abutment versus a
   riprap-protected embankment and abutment.}},

Abstract = {{Epoxy composites, with boron nitride spheres (s-BN) and flakes (f-BN) as
   fillers were prepared. The effect of filler morphology, content, and
   crystallization of BN particles on the thermal conductivity,
   thermo-mechanical and dielectric properties of the composites were
   investigated. At the same loading level, s-BN with smaller size and
   larger surface area led to much more significant increase in the glass
   transition temperature (T (g) ), reduction in the coefficient of thermal
   expansion and lower storage modulus (E'), while much higher thermal
   conductivities were observed in epoxy composites containing f-BN, owing
   to the larger aspect ratio and better crystallization. In addition, the
   introduction of BN fillers only did slightly increase on the dielectric
   constant and dielectric loss of the epoxy resin. We believe, the BN
   enhanced epoxy composites, with significantly improved thermal
   conductivity and thermo-mechanical properties, yet maintaining low
   dielectric constant and dielectric loss at the same time, have great
   application potential in the microelectronic insulation industry.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the general problem of matching a subspace to a signal in RN
   that has been observed indirectly (compressed) through a random
   projection. We are interested in the case where the collection of
   K-dimensional subspaces is continuously parameterized, i.e. naturally
   indexed by an interval from the real line, or more generally a region of
   R-D. Our main results show that if the dimension of the random
   projection is on the order of K times, a geometrical constant that
   describes the complexity of the collection, then the match obtained from
   the compressed observation is nearly as good as one obtained from a full
   observation of the signal. We give multiple concrete examples of
   collections of subspaces for which this geometrical constant can be
   estimated, and discuss the relevance of the results to the general
   problems of template matching and source localization.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recently, hydrogels have been employed in a variety of engineering
   applications as promising materials, since their porous structure and
   hydrophilicity enables them to absorb a large amount of water. Atomistic
   simulations lead to a better understanding of their properties at
   nanoscale, especially mechanical properties. In this study, hydrogel is
   studied using a molecular dynamics (MD) framework, considering condensed
   phased optimized molecular potential (COMPASS) as the force field.
   Polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEDGE) and
   poly-oxy-alkylene-amines (Jeffamine) are the epoxy and curing agent used
   for hydrogels, and a novel cross-linking method is applied. Radial
   Distribution Functions (RDFs) show that the cross-links are the
   hydrophilic part of hydrogel. RDFs and mechanical properties are
   reported for different water amounts. The results show that an increase
   in water content leads to a decrease in elastic modulus of the hydrogel.}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Size induced strength increase in crystalline nanowires is related to
   crystal defects at small length scales. But how this phenomenon
   manifests in metallic glasses, an amorphous solid without obvious
   intrinsic structural defects, still remains an open issue. Here we show
   that in the amorphous nanowires free of obvious structural defects or
   cracks, reduction in wire diameter generally leads to weakening of the
   strength compared to the bulk sample. Our analysis shows that the
   surface stress as well as surface induced internal stress that scales
   inversely with the wire diameter become significant. It is the complex
   interplay between the applied stress and the internal residual stresses
   induced by the nanoscale surface that affects the mechanical behavior in
   the amorphous nanowires at the small length scale regime. The role of
   the localized shear banding played in relation to the size effect is
   also discussed in the context of the deformation mechanisms in amorphous
   wires with different sizes. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Practical multiscale materials design is contingent on the availability
   of robust and reliable reduced-order linkages (i.e., surrogate models)
   between the material internal structure and its associated macroscale
   properties of interest. Traditional approaches for establishing such
   linkages have relied largely on computationally expensive numerical
   simulation tools (e.g., the finite element models). This work
   investigates the viability of establishing low (computational) cost,
   data-driven, surrogate models for previously established numerical
   multiscale material models. This new approach comprises the following
   main steps: (1) generating a calibration (i.e., training) dataset using
   an ensemble of representative microstructures and obtaining their
   mechanical responses using established physics-based simulation tools
   (e.g., finite element models), (2) establishing objective,
   reduced-order, measures of the microstructures (e.g., using n-point
   spatial correlations and Principal Component Analysis), and (3)
   extracting and validating sufficiently accurate, computationally
   low-cost, relationships between the selected microstructure measures and
   effective (homogenized) properties (or performance metrics) of interest
   using various regression methods. In this paper, the viability of the
   data science approach in capturing such linkages (expressed as
   metamodels or surrogate models) for inelastic effective properties of
   composite materials is demonstrated for the first time. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{The intrinsically oscillating neurons in the crustacean pyloric circuit
   have membrane conductances that influence their spontaneous activity
   patterns and responses to synaptic activity. The relationship between
   the magnitudes of these membrane conductances and the response of the
   oscillating neurons to synaptic input has not yet been fully or
   systematically explored. We examined this relationship using the phase
   resetting curve (PRC), which summarizes the change in the cycle period
   of a neuronal oscillator as a function of the input's timing within the
   oscillation. We first utilized a large database of single-compartment
   model neurons to determine the effect of individual membrane
   conductances on PRC shape; we found that the effects vary across
   conductance space, but on average, the hyperpolarization-activated and
   leak conductances advance the PRC. We next investigated how membrane
   conductances affect PRCs of the isolated pacemaker kernel in the pyloric
   circuit of Cancer borealis by: (1) tabulating PRCs while using dynamic
   clamp to artificially add varying levels of specific conductances, and
   (2) tabulating PRCs before and after blocking the endogenous
   hyperpolarization-activated current. We additionally used a previously
   described four-compartment model to determine how the location of the
   hyperpolarization-activated conductance influences that current's effect
   on the PRC. We report that while dynamic-clamp-injected leak current has
   much smaller effects on the PRC than suggested by the single-compartment
   model, an increase in the hyperpolarization-activated conductance both
   advances and reduces the noisiness of the PRC in the pacemaker kernel of
   the pyloric circuit in both modeling and experimental studies.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to develop a new low-cost, highly
   selective, and stable sorbent based pre-combustion CO2 capture. A high
   surface area titanium oxide (TiO2) prepared by a template method and
   amine modified TiO2 (M-TiO2) were investigated for CO2/CH4 adsorption at
   conditions relevant to pre-combustion CO2 capture. Single-component and
   binary CO2/CH4 adsorption tests at different operating conditions were
   performed in a fixed bed adsorber. Experimental results show that the
   selectivity of TiO2 for separation of CO2 from CO2/CH4 mixture can be
   significantly improved via amine modification. The selectivity of CO2
   over CH4 for M-TiO2 is enhanced to 22.1 at 333 K and 35 bar. Pure CO2 or
   CH4 can be obtained from the adsorber packed with M-TiO2 through cyclic
   CO2/CH4 mixture gas adsorption and desorption. The study indicates that,
   as a pre-combustion sorbent, the inexpensive mesoporous M-TiO2 is not
   only capable and stable, but also easily regenerated without loss of
   capacity and selectivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to develop a new high-performance CO2
   adsorbent with a simple method. Amine hybrid
   resorcinol-formaldehyde/silsesquioxane composite aerogel (AH-RFSA) was
   developed through polymeric sal-gel process and supercritical drying
   (SCD) technique. CO2 adsorption performances of AH-RFSA in 1\% CO2 gas
   mixture (CO2 + N-2) were investigated. A rise in adsorption temperature
   negatively affects the total CO2 adsorption capacity of Al-RFSA.
   However, the useful adsorption capacity does not change with adsorption
   temperature. Water is more positive to useful CO2 adsorption capacity
   than to total CO2 adsorption capacity. The total CO2 adsorption capacity
   achieved with the new adsorbent at 30 degrees C under dry and humid 1\%
   CO2 is 3.57 and 4.43 mmol/g, respectively. The useful CO2 adsorption
   capacity for complete removal of CO2 from 1\% CO2 is as high as 3.56
   mmol/g. The adsorbent preparation method is inspiring and its resulting
   adsorbent is exceptional in capacity and regenerability. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new approach to the control design for the constraint-following of
   fuzzy mechanical system is proposed in this paper. We consider the
   mechanical system containing uncertainty, which may be nonlinear and
   fast time varying. The uncertainty is assumed to be bounded, and the
   bound of the uncertainty lies within a prescribed fuzzy set. A class of
   robust controls is proposed, and the corresponding adaptive law is
   constructed to emulate a constant parameter related to the bound of the
   uncertainty. The control scheme is deterministic and is not if-then rule
   based. Furthermore, we formulate the gain design of the adaptive law as
   a constrained optimization problem, which minimizes both the average
   fuzzy performance and the control effort. It is proved that the global
   solution to this optimization problem exists and is unique. The
   closed-form solution and the closed-form minimum cost are presented. The
   resulting adaptive robust control is able to guarantee the uniform
   boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the uncertain system
   regardless of the uncertainty, while minimizing the average fuzzy
   performance and control effort.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the far-infrared self-collimation and low-loss
   transmission of aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) films or arrays. The
   anisotropic dielectric functions of the CNT array is modeled using the
   effective medium theory considering the degree of alignment. The
   spectral regions where hyperbolic dispersion is satisfied are in the
   far-infrared. In the hyperbolic regime, energy propagates inside the CNT
   film along the optical axis for nearly all incidence angles. The
   self-collimation effect is also examined for tilted CNT thin films by
   tracing the Poynting vector trajectories. Low-loss transmission is
   explored to understand the impact of alignment on the penetration depth
   and transmission through the film. In conjunction with the surface
   radiative properties, the self-collimation and transmission
   characteristics are distinguished between the two hyperbolic bands of
   the CNT film. The insight obtained from this work may lead to the
   utilization of CNT arrays in polarization filtering and infrared

Abstract = {{This work deals with the spectral radiative properties of metamaterials
   made of a 2D metallic pattern on a dielectric thin film that separates
   the top periodic structure from a metal ground plane. Two distinct
   patterns are considered: one consists of disconnected double-rectangle
   gold pattern and the other is made of L-shape pattern. Both structures
   exhibit dual-band emission or absorption peaks in the infrared region.
   Unlike the disconnected rectangular pattern for which the normal
   emittance is independent of the polarization angle, the L-shape
   structure shows strong polarization dependent due to near-field
   coupling. The electromagnetic fields at the resonant frequencies are
   analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain technique to elucidate
   the physical mechanisms accounting for the different behaviors. For both
   structures, the resonance mechanisms can be explained by magnetic
   polaritons. Inductor-capacitor circuit models are developed to
   quantitatively predict the resonance frequencies. This work helps the
   understanding of polarization dependence in metamaterials and may
   facilitate their applications in biosensing and infrared spectroscopic
   system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{181-194}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer (CFD/HT) models have been
   employed as the dominant technique for the design and optimization of
   both new and existing data-centers. Inviscid modeling has shown great
   speed advantages over the full Navier-Stokes CFD/HT models (over 20
   times faster), but is incapable of capturing the physics in the viscous
   regions of the domain. A coupled inviscid-viscous solution method
   (CIVSM) for bounded domains has been developed in order to increase both
   the solution speed and accuracy of CFD/HT models. The methodology
   consists of an iterative solution technique that divides the full domain
   into multiple regions consisting of at least one set of viscous,
   inviscid, and interface regions. The full steady, Reynolds averaged
   Navier-Stokes equations with turbulence modeling are used to solve the
   viscous domain, while the inviscid domain is solved using the Euler
   equations. By combining the increased speed of the inviscid solver in
   the inviscid regions, along with the viscous solver's ability to capture
   the turbulent flow physics in the viscous regions, a faster and
   potentially more accurate solution can be obtained for bounded domains
   that contain large inviscid regions, such as data-centers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to prepare, characterize and evaluate
   the conversion efficiency of CO2 to fuel on a ZnO/g-C3N4 composite
   photocatalyst under simulated sunlight irradiation. The photocatalyst
   was synthesized by a simple impregnation method and was characterized by
   various techniques, including Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).
   The characterizations indicate that ZnO and g-C3N4 were uniformly
   combined. The deposition of ZnO on g-C3N4 showed nearly no effect on its
   light-absorption performance. However, the interactions between the two
   components promoted the formation of a hetero-junction structure in the
   composite, inhibited the recombination of electron-hole pairs and,
   finally, enhanced the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/g-C3N4. The
   optimal ZnO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed a CO2 conversion rate of 45.6 mu
   mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1), which was 4.9 and 6.4 times higher than those of
   g-C3N4 and P25, respectively. This work represents an important step
   toward artificial photocatalytic CO2 conversion to fuel using

Abstract = {{A series of Co3O4/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts with different Co3O4 loadings
   were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and a combination
   of IWI and subsequent combustion synthesis (CS), and tested for
   catalytic combustion of CH4. The IWI/CS-X (X=5, 10, 30 and 50,
   represented the Co3O4 loading as wt\%) samples prepared via IWI/CS
   method exhibited higher catalytic activity than the IWI-X (X 5, 10, 30
   and 50) ones via IWI method. IWI/CS-30 showed the highest catalytic
   activity with T-10 (10\% CH4 conversion) at 300 degrees C and T-100
   (complete conversion) at 550 degrees C. The structure characterization
   indicated the IWI/CS-X catalysts had a greater surface area with
   relatively lower Co3O4 crystallization and better Co3O4 dispersion
   compared with IWI-X samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   UV-vis results revealed that surface Co3+/(Co2+ + Co3+) ratios of the
   IWI/CS-X samples was relatively higher than those of IWI-X ones. The
   surface Co3+ of the IWI/CS-X catalysts was easily reduced to Co2+ at
   280-330 degrees C, whereas, only one difficult reduction process of
   Co304 to Co was observed at 400-600 C for all of the IWI-X samples
   according to hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR)
   results. Hence, the abundance of surface Co3+, easy and fast redox cycle
   between Co2+ and Co3+ at low temperatures were the underlying mechanisms
   for the excellent catalytic performance of IWI/CS-X catalysts in CH4
   combustion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deactivation of alkali metals and arsenic and regeneration methods are
   studied on commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 for the SCR reaction using
   experiments and DFT calculations. The poisoning of alkali metals is
   found to decrease the amount of Bronsted acid sites and the reducibility
   of active V5+ sites. Arsenic decreases the amount of Lewis acid sites
   and the stability of Bronsted acid sites and increases N2O formation.
   After the catalysts are poisoned by both alkali metals and arsenic, the
   activity and N-2 selectivity are significantly suppressed. Diluted H2SO4
   effectively removes alkali metals from the poisoned catalysts. Half of
   the amount of arsenic can be removed using a 4\%H2O2 solution; however,
   some V2O5 and surface sulfates are also eliminated from the catalysts.
   The activity of the regenerated catalysts is almost recovered at high
   temperatures. From the DFT results on the V2O5/TiO2 (001) plane,
   potassium and arsenic significantly alter the electronic structures of
   the V orbitals and broaden the band gap of the models. Interactions
   between potassium and arsenic are also found. Potassium covers the
   active sites of the models that are constructed by V2O5 and As2O5, which
   further decreases the number of acid sites. Potassium causes V and As
   orbitals to move to lower energies and inhibits the reactivity of the
   model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The conformal silicon deposition on carbon nanotubes as enabled by
   hydrogenated carbon coatings for synthesis of carbon/silicon core/shell
   heterostructure photodiodes}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional heterostructures, based on functionalities of dissimilar
   materials within a monolithic structure, are promising building blocks
   for different applications. Herein, utilizing surface decoration of
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with hydrogenated graphitic carbon
   layers (HGCLs), the realization of a vertically aligned
   MWCNT/amorphous-silicon (a-Si) core/shell heterostructure is reported.
   The proposed method enables the formation of conformal, continuous, and
   all-around silicon deposition on the carbon nanotube and eliminates any
   signature of line-of-sight deposition problem, even for thicknesses as
   low as a few nanometers. Precise elaboration using comparative Raman
   analysis reveals that the HGCLs play a major role in the construction of
   such structures. Evidence of direct binding between Si and C, a missing
   remarkable feature in previous reports, has been observed in
   high-resolution transmission electron microscope images and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Monitoring time evolution during the
   formation of the silicon shell declares a diffusive mechanism for the
   deposition of Si on the surface of MWCNTs. Furthermore, the
   electro-optical proficiency of the MWCNT/a-Si heterostructure was
   studied by fabrication of a photodiode. Unlike previous attempts, a
   naturally formed Schottky junction at the high-quality a-Si/nanotube
   interface is exploited for charge separation in this photodiode, which
   provides a sensitivity of >10(7)\% in the reverse saturation current for
   a wavelength of lambda = 405 nm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work reports the effect of using dimethylformamide (DMF) as the
   solvent for synthesizing MIL-53(Al). This well-known breathing MOF is
   typically prepared using hydrothermal methods. The two materials
   synthesized in DMF at 120 degrees C and 220 degrees C show significant
   deviations from the breathing behavior exhibited by the material
   synthesized hydrothermally. Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed that
   MIL-53(Al) synthesized in DMF at 120 degrees C remains in the large-pore
   form under all conditions, while the other material synthesized at 220
   degrees C undergoes a more gradual breathing transition than is observed
   for MIL-53(Al) prepared by traditional methods. Solid-state NMR was
   employed to elucidate additional structural information and gain insight
   into the role synthesis solvent plays on breathing behavior. The CO2 and
   water adsorption of these large-pore stabilized materials were studied,
   and the differences in adsorption behavior compared to MIL-53(Al)
   prepared by traditional methods was discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Challenging the emerging narrative: Critical examination of coalmining
   safety in China, and recommendations for tackling mining hazards}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{36-48}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Coal mining remains a dangerous occupation worldwide, and in China where
   this industry is strategically important for the country's economic
   development, its safety track record is particularly gruesome. Between
   1990 and 1999, thousands of small and large-scale accidents in Chinese
   underground coalmines have caused over a reported sixty thousand
   fatalities. To tackle this significant problem, several laws were passed
   in support of mining safety, and two major institutional innovations
   were adopted in the late 1990s and early 2000s: the establishment of the
   State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS) and the State
   Administration of Work Safety (SAWS), the former is subsumed under the
   latter. Since the establishment of SAWS/SACMS, a new safety narrative
   has emerged, which posits that significant safety improvements have
   occurred over the last decade in Chinese coalmines, and that these
   improvements are the result of effective government policy and safety
   regulations.
   The findings in this work, based on publically available official data,
   challenge this new safety narrative on several fronts. For example, we
   found evidence of significant under-reporting of fatality numbers in
   coal mining accidents. We also found that mining accidents are sometimes
   (mis)classified as ``natural disasters{''}, and as a result, their
   fatality numbers are not tallied in the official statistics. We assessed
   that the official fatality statistics may underestimate the actual
   fatality numbers by a factor ranging from 3 to 5. More importantly, we
   found it doubtful that safety improvements have occurred in operating
   Chinese coalmines since 2000. We inferred that the reduction in total
   fatality and accident numbers could be explained by the closure of small
   mines or the exclusion of their fatality statistics. We concluded with
   some recommendations and a list of coal mining hazards prioritized for
   targeted safety interventions and improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Pages = {{332-354}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Many constraints in design-optimization problems take the form of bounds
   on a physical quantity over a domain. These infinite-dimensional
   constraints are often addressed through aggregation methods that
   approximate the bound in a differentiable manner. However, the most
   common constraint-aggregation methods exhibit mesh dependence; as the
   mesh spacing decreases, the aggregation function diverges. In addition,
   there are no established methods to assess the impact of constraint
   aggregation on the optimized design. To address these deficiencies, we
   propose a new class of constraint-aggregation method that we call
   induced aggregates. We examine the properties of these aggregation
   methods, describe their numerical implementation, and test their
   numerical accuracy on a pressure-loaded circular cylinder test case.
   Furthermore, we propose a post-optimality estimation technique to assess
   the impact of the constraint-aggregation method on the design. We use
   this method to examine the optimized mass obtained from two
   stress-constrained mass minimization problems: a variable-thickness
   sheet problem and a wingbox design problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   address this obstacle by taking advantage of special structure that
   exists in the set of inadmissible states and enables a finite
   representation of this set through its minimal elements.}},

Abstract = {{Range extension is a promising feature offered by cooperative
   transmission (CT), also known as virtual multiple-input-single-output
   (VMISO). Many authors have considered how the diversity and array gains
   from CT may benefit a wireless multi-hop network, when the gains are
   used for increasing link reliability and reducing transmit power.
   However, relatively less attention has been given to the benefits of CT
   range extension and few testbed implementations of CT have been
   demonstrated. In this paper, we focus on how CT range extension can
   impact the lower three layers, especially medium access control (MAC)
   and routing for ad hoc and sensor multi-hop networks (AHSMNs). We assume
   cooperators decode and forward the packets. Various analytical models,
   performance analyses, and experimental results using software-defined
   radios in an indoor office environment are discussed. For wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs), we review CT range extension at the network
   layer, to eliminate the energy hole that forms around sink nodes in
   non-CT networks, and we review cooperator selection and duty cycle
   scheduling algorithms at Layer 2, to maximize the lifetime of a
   multi-hop WSN. For ad hoc networks, we emphasize a family of lightweight
   broadcasting and unicasting protocols based on a simple form of CT
   called the opportunistic large array (OLA). Experimental results,
   including OLA-based unicast routing and diversity order effects in
   two-hop CT networks, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The deactivation of catalysts by potassium and the promotion of cerium
   on MnOx/TiO2 for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3 are
   investigated by both experiments and OH calculations. Catalyst poisoning
   by K is due to the decrease of surface acidity, the loss of reducibility
   and the improvement of stable nitrite/nitrate species. When the catalyst
   is modified by CeO2, SCR activities of both fresh and poisoned catalysts
   are improved. Cerium provides new Lewis acid sites for NH3 adsorption,
   which does not seem to be influenced by K. The Ce 4f orbitals of
   poisoned surfaces are nearly unaffected, which preserve reducibility of
   catalyst for NH3 activation. Stable, inactive nitrite species do not
   build up and the reactive nitrate species are still present on the
   surface. These advantages can be attributed to the unique active sites,
   the {[}-0-Ce-O-Mn-0-](units). These active sites induce the movement of
   alkali metals to assemble together, leaving more surface active sites
   for SCR reaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantification of model form uncertainty in the calculation of solar
   diffuse irradiation on inclined surfaces for building energy simulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING PERFORMANCE SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{253-265}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Traditional uncertainty quantification (UQ) in the prediction of
   building energy consumption has been limited to the propagation of
   uncertainties in model input parameters. Models by definition ignore, at
   least to some degree, and, in almost all cases, simplify the physical
   processes that govern the reality of interest, thereby introducing
   additional uncertainty in model predictions that cannot be captured as
   input parameter uncertainty. Quantification of this type of uncertainty
   (which we will refer to as model form uncertainty) is a necessary step
   towards the complete UQ of model predictions. This paper introduces a
   general framework for model form UQ and shows its application to the
   widely used sky irradiation model developed by Perez et al. {[}1990.
   Modeling Daylight Availability and Irradiance Components from Direct and
   Global Irradiance. Solar Energy 44 (5): 271-289], which computes solar
   diffuse irradiation on inclined surfaces. We collected a data set of
   one-year measurements of solar irradiation at one location in the USA.
   The measurements were done at surfaces with different tilt angles and
   orientations, for a wide spectrum of sky conditions. A statistical
   analysis using both this data set and published studies worldwide
   suggests that the Perez model performs non-uniformly across different
   locations and produces a certain bias in its predictions. Based on the
   same data, we then use a two-phase regression model to express model
   form uncertainty in the use of the Perez model at this particular
   location. Using a holdout validation test, we demonstrate that the
   two-phase regression model considerably reduces the model bias errors
   and root mean square errors for every tilted surface. Lastly, we discuss
   the significance of including model form uncertainty in the energy
   consumption predictions obtained with whole building simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma assisted combustion is a promising technology to improve engine
   performance, increase lean burn flame stability, reduce emissions, and
   enhance low temperature fuel oxidation and processing. Over the last
   decade, significant progress has been made towards the applications of
   plasma in engines and the understanding of the fundamental chemistry and
   dynamic processes in plasma assisted combustion via the synergetic
   efforts in advanced diagnostics, combustion chemistry, flame theory, and
   kinetic modeling. New observations of plasma assisted ignition
   enhancement, ultra-lean combustion, cool flames, flameless combustion,
   and controllability of plasma discharge have been reported. Advances are
   made in the understanding of non-thermal and thermal enhancement
   effects, kinetic pathways of atomic 0 production, diagnostics of
   electronically and vibrationally excited species, plasma assisted
   combustion kinetics of sub-explosion limit ignition, plasma assisted low
   temperature combustion, flame regime transition of the classical
   ignition S-curve, dynamics of the minimum ignition energy, and the
   transport effect by non-equilibrium plasma discharge. These findings and
   advances have provided new opportunities in the development of efficient
   plasma discharges for practical applications and predictive, validated
   kinetic models and modeling tools for plasma assisted combustion at low
   temperature and high pressure conditions. This article is to provide a
   comprehensive overview of the progress and the gap in the knowledge of

Abstract = {{We study the conductometric response to H2S in the range from 0.6 to 100
   ppm using nanostructure metal oxide decorated interfaces and demonstrate
   the highly selective detection of H2S in the presence of the BTEX
   contaminants toluene, benzene, and xylene. We evaluate the response to
   H2S of a porous silicon (PS) interface and this interface decorated with
   TiO2, SnO,,NiO, and Aux() (x >> 1) nanostructured deposits. The response
   of an Aux() decorated interface dominates those of TiO2 and SnOx, which
   dominate NiO. All of the decorated interfaces show a considerable
   enhancement of response relative to PS. The observed responses are
   consistent with the recently developing IHSAB principle and the observed
   enhancements well exceed those for other analytes. Sensor rejuvenation
   and the ability to deal with highly humid environments are evaluated.
   SnOx decorated PS is found to be highly selective for H2S with
   selectivity ratios well in excess of 104:1 for toluene and benzene, and
   well in excess of 103:1 for xylene, all of which act as weak bases. The
   dominance of the response for H2S relative to the BTEX aromatics
   toluene, benzene, and xylene has important implications for the
   monitoring of significant contaminants associated with the venting and
   flaring of natural gas pits as they are present in oil and gas
   formations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) tour length estimations can be used
   when it is not necessary to know an exact tour, e.g., when using certain
   heuristics to solve location-routing problems. The best estimation
   models in the TSP literature focus on random instances where the node
   dispersion is known; those that do not require knowledge of node
   dispersion are either less accurate or slower. In this paper, we develop
   a new regression-based tour length estimation model that is
   distribution-free, accurate, and fast, with a small standard deviation
   of the estimation errors. When the distribution of the node coordinates
   is known, it provides a close estimate of the well-known asymptotic tour
   length estimation formula of Beardwood et al. (1959); more importantly,
   when the distribution is unknown or non-integrable so Beardwood et al.'s
   estimation cannot be used, our model still provides good, fast tour
   length estimates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the IEEE Robotics \& Automation Society, recently proposed a Core
   Ontology for Robotics and Automation (CORA). This ontology was developed

Abstract = {{This paper studies the inherent relationship between two widely used
   pulse width modulation (PWM) methods for multilevel converters, i.e.,
   the space vector modulation (SVM) method, also called space vector pulse
   width modulation, and the nearest level modulatio nmethod. The
   nearest-level modulation method directly controls the voltage of each
   phase, while the SVM method simultaneously deals with all phases. It is
   demonstrated in this paper that the two modulation methods are
   functionally equivalent: with proper common-mode voltage injections, the
   nearest-level modulation method is equivalent to the SVM method; by
   selecting the appropriate redundant switching sequences and the
   corresponding duty cycles, the SVM method is equivalent to the
   nearest-level modulation method. Nevertheless, the SVM method can
   conveniently provide more flexibility of optimizing the switching
   patterns, without the need of designing sophisticated common-mode
   voltages. An efficient and flexible modulation method for any multiphase
   multilevel converter is, therefore, proposed, which combines the
   advantages of the nearest-level modulation and the SVM methods, i.e.,
   both with less computational burden and high flexibility of optimizing
   the output waveforms. Simulation and experimental results validate the
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{New techniques for single-cell analysis enable new discoveries in gene
   expression and systems biology. Time-dependent measurements on
   individual cells are necessary, yet the common single-cell analysis
   techniques used today require lysing the cell, suspending the cell, or
   long incubation times for transfection, thereby interfering with the
   ability to track an individual cell over time. Here a method for
   detecting mRNA expression in live single cells using molecular beacons
   that are transfected into single cells by means of nanofountain probe
   electroporation (NFP-E) is presented. Molecular beacons are
   oligonucleotides that emit fluorescence upon binding to an mRNA target,
   rendering them useful for spatial and temporal studies of live cells.
   The NFP-E is used to transfect a DNA-based beacon that detects
   glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and an RNA-based beacon that
   detects a sequence cloned in the green fluorescence protein mRNA. It is
   shown that imaging analysis of transfection and mRNA detection can be
   performed within seconds after electroporation and without disturbing
   adhered cells. In addition, it is shown that time-dependent detection of
   mRNA expression is feasible by transfecting the same single cell at
   different time points. This technique will be particularly useful for
   studies of cell differentiation, where several measurements of mRNA
   expression are required over time.}},

Title = {{Toward a Quantitative Understanding of Symmetry Reduction Involved in
   the Seed-Mediated Growth of Pd Nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{We report a quantitative analysis of the symmetry reduction phenomenon
   involved in the seed-mediated growth of Pd nanocrystals under dropwise
   addition of a precursor solution. In addition to the elimination of
   self-nucleation, the dropwise approach allows for the formation of a
   steady state for the number of precursor ions in the growth solution,
   which only fluctuates in a narrow range defined by experimental
   parameters such as the initial concentration of precursor solution and
   the injection rate. We can deterministically control the growth mode
   (symmetric vs asymmetric) of a seed by tuning these parameters to
   quantitatively manipulate the reaction kinetics and thus the lower and
   upper limits that define the steady state. We demonstrate that there
   exists a correlation between the growth mode and the lower limit of
   precursor ions in the steady state of a seed-mediated growth process.
   For the first few drops of precursor solution, the resultant atoms will
   only be deposited on a limited number of available sites on the seed if
   the lower limit of the steady state is below a critical value.
   Afterward, the deposition of atoms will be largely confined to these
   initially activated sites to induce symmetry reduction if atom
   deposition is kept at a faster rate than surface diffusion by
   controlling the lower limit of precursor ions in the steady state.
   Otherwise, the migration of atoms to other regions through surface
   diffusion can access other sites on the surface of a seed and thus lead
   to the switch of growth mode from asymmetric to symmetric. Our study
   suggests that symmetry reduction can only be initiated and retained by
   keeping the atom deposition at a rate slow enough to limit the number of
   initial nucleation sites on a seed but fast enough to beat the surface
   diffusion process.}},

Abstract = {{Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has recently emerged as a novel
   therapeutic approach for the treatment of various pathological
   conditions including cancer. Currently, two HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) -
   Vorinostat and Romidepsin - have been approved for the treatment of
   cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, HDACi remain ineffective against
   solid tumors and are associated with adverse events including
   cardiotoxicity. Targeted delivery may enhance the therapeutic indices of
   HDACi and enable them to be efficacious against solid tumors. We showed
   herein that morphing of folic and pteroic acids into the surface
   recognition group of HDACi results in hydroxamate and benzamide HDACi
   which derived tumor homing by targeting folate receptor (FR), a receptor
   commonly overexpressed in solid tumors. We observed a correlation
   between the potency of HDAC1 inhibition and cytotoxicity as only the
   potent pteroate hydroxamates, 11d and 11e, displayed antiproliferative
   activity against two representative FR-expression cancer cells. Our
   observation further supports the previous results which suggest that for
   a drug to be successfully targeted using the FR, it must be extremely
   potent against its primary target as the FR has a low delivery
   efficiency. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional star-graft quarterpolymers
   PSn{[}P2VP-b-(PAA-g-PNIPAM)](n) with two different arm types, shorter PS
   arms and longer P2VP-b-PAA block copolymer arms with grafted PNIPAM
   chains, were studied in terms of their ability to form micellar
   structures at the air/water and air/solid interfaces. Because of the
   pH-dependent ionization of P2VP and PAA blocks, as well as
   thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAM chains, these multifunctional stars have
   multiple responsive properties to pH, temperature, and ionic strength.
   We observed that the molecular surface area of the stars is the largest
   at basic pH, when the PAA blocks are strongly charged and extended, and
   PNIPAM chains are spread at the interface. At acidic conditions, the
   molecular surface area is the smallest because the P2VP blocks submerge
   into the water subphase and the PAA blocks are contracted and form
   hydrogen bonding with grafted PNIPAM chains. The molecular surface area
   of the stars at the air/water interface gradually increases at elevated
   temperature. We suggest that the transition across lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST) results in the emerging of PNIPAM chains
   from the water subphase to the interface due to the hydrophilic to
   hydrophobic transition. Moreover, at higher surface pressure, the stars
   tend to form intermolecular micellar aggregates above LCST. The graft
   density of PNIPAM chains as well as the arm number was also found to
   have strong effects on the thermo- and pH-response. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that the star block copolymer conformation and aggregation
   are strongly dependent on the intramolecular interactions between
   different blocks and spatial distribution of the arms, which can be
   controlled by the external conditions, including pH, temperature, ionic
   strength, and surface pressure.}},

Abstract = {{With available MRI techniques, primary and metastatic liver cancers that
   are associated with high mortality rates and poor treatment responses
   are only diagnosed at late stages, due to the lack of highly sensitive
   contrast agents without Gd3+ toxicity. We have developed a protein
   contrast agent (ProCA32) that exhibits high stability for Gd3+ and a
   10(11)-fold greater selectivity for Gd3+ over Zn2+ compared with
   existing contrast agents. ProCA32, modified from parvalbumin, possesses
   high relaxivities (r(1)/r(2): 66.8 mmol(-1).s(-1)/89.2 mmol(-1).s(-1)
   per particle). Using T-1-and T-2-weighted, as well as T-2/T-1 ratio
   imaging, we have achieved, for the first time (to our knowledge),
   robustMRI detection of early liver metastases as small as similar to
   0.24 mm in diameter, much smaller than the current detection limit of
   10-20 mm. Furthermore, ProCA32 exhibits appropriate in vivo preference
   for liver sinusoidal spaces and pharmacokinetics for high-quality
   imaging. ProCA32 will be invaluable for noninvasive early detection of
   primary and metastatic liver cancers as well as for monitoring treatment
   and guiding therapeutic interventions, including drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Let S be a set of n points in d dimensions such that each point is
   assigned a color. Given a query range Q = {[}a(1), b(1)] x {[}a(2),
   b(2)] x ... x {[}a(d), b(d)] the geometric range mode query problem asks
   to report the most frequent color (i.e., a mode) of the multiset of
   colors corresponding to points in S boolean AND Q. When d =1, Chan et
   al. (2012) {[}1] gave a data structure that requires O(n +
   (n/Delta)(2)/w) words and supports range mode queries in O(Delta) time
   for any Delta >= 1, where w = Omega(logn) is the word size. Chan et al.
   also proposed a data structures for higher dimensions (i.e., d >= 2)
   with O (s(n) + (n/Delta)(2d)) words and O(Delta.t(n)) query time, where
   s(n) and t(n) denote the space and query time of a data structure that
   supports orthogonal range counting queries on the set S. In this paper
   we show that the space can be improved without any increase to the query
   time, by presenting an O(s(n) + (n/Delta)(2d)/w)-word data structure
   that supports orthogonal range mode queries on a set of n points in d
   dimensions in O(Delta.t(n)) time, for any Delta >= 1. When d =1, these
   space and query time costs match those achieved by the current best
   known one-dimensional data structure. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Effect of fluid and particle inertia on the rotation of an oblate
   spheroidal particle suspended in linear shear flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{This work describes the inertial effects on the rotational behavior of
   an oblate spheroidal particle confined between two parallel opposite
   moving walls, which generate a linear shear flow. Numerical results are
   obtained using the lattice Boltzmann method with an external boundary
   force. The rotation of the particle depends on the particle Reynolds
   number, Rep = Gd-2 nu(-1) (G is the shear rate, d is the particle
   diameter,. is the kinematic viscosity), and the Stokes number, St =
   alpha Re-p (a is the solid-to-fluid density ratio), which are
   dimensionless quantities connected to fluid and particle inertia,
   respectively. The results show that two inertial effects give rise to
   different stable rotational states. For a neutrally buoyant particle (St
   = Re-p) at low Re-p, particle inertia was found to dominate, eventually
   leading to a rotation about the particle's symmetry axis. The symmetry
   axis is in this case parallel to the vorticity direction; a rotational
   state called log-rolling. At high Re-p, fluid inertia will dominate and
   the particle will remain in a steady state, where the particle symmetry
   axis is perpendicular to the vorticity direction and has a constant
   angle phi(c) to the flow direction. The sequence of transitions between
   these dynamical states were found to be dependent on density ratio
   alpha, particle aspect ratio r(p), and domain size. More specifically,
   the present study reveals that an inclined rolling state (particle
   rotates around its symmetry axis, which is not aligned in the vorticity
   direction) appears through a pitchfork bifurcation due to the influence
   of periodic boundary conditions when simulated in a small domain.
   Furthermore, it is also found that a tumbling motion, where the particle
   symmetry axis rotates in the flow-gradient plane, can be a stable motion
   for particles with high r(p) and low alpha.}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant interest in hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor
   interfaces, little is known regarding the fate of charge carriers at
   metal oxide interfaces, particularly on ultrafast time scales. Using
   core-hole clock spectroscopy, we investigate the ultrafast charge
   carrier dynamics of conductive ZnO films at a hybrid interface with an
   organic semiconductor. The adsorption of C-60 on the ZnO surface
   strongly suppresses the ultrafast carrier delocalization and increases
   the charge carrier residence time from 400 attoseconds to nearly 30 fs.
   Here, we show that a new hybridized interfacial density of states with
   substantial molecular character is formed, fundamentally altering the
   observed carrier dynamics. The remarkable change in the dynamics sheds
   light on the fate of carriers at hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor
   interfaces relevant to organic optoelectronics and provides for the
   first time an atomistic picture of the electronically perturbed
   near-interface region of a metal oxide.}},

   particles, which interact through axial and torsional elastic forces as
   well as magnetic forces. The propagation of in-plane waves is predicted
   by applying Bloch theorem to lattice unit cells with linearized
   interactions. Elastic wave dispersion in these lattices before and after

Abstract = {{A functional tactile sensing device is essential for next-generation
   robotics and human-machine interfaces technologies, since the emulation
   of touching requires large-scale pressure sensor arrays with
   distinguishable spatial-resolution, high sensitivity, and fast response.
   Here, a flexible LED array composed of PEDOT:PSS and patterned ZnO NWs
   with a spatial resolution of 7 mu m for mapping of spatial pressure
   distributions is designed and fabricated. The emission intensity of the
   LED array sensor matrix is dominated by locally applied strains as
   indicated by the piezo-phototronic effect. Therefore, spatial pressure
   distributions are immediately obtained by parallel-reading the
   illumination intensities of the LED arrays based on an
   electroluminescence working mechanism. A wide range of pressure
   measurements from 40 to 100 MPa are achieved through controlling the
   growth conditions of the ZnO nanowire array. These devices may find
   prospective applications as electronic skins by taking advantage of
   their high spatial-resolution, flexibility, and wide pressure mapping
   range.}},

Abstract = {{The use of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) is a highly effective
   technology for harvesting ambient mechanical energy to produce
   electricity. In this work, a theoretical model of rotary freestanding
   TENG with grating structure is constructed, including the
   conductor-to-dielectric and dielectric-to-dielectric categories. The
   finite element simulations are performed to capture the fundamental
   physics of rotary freestanding TENG. Based on the simulations and
   derivations of approximate analytical equations, the real-time output
   characteristics of TENG with arbitrary load resistance are calculated.
   Furthermore, the influences of structural parameters of TENG and
   rotation rate on the output performance are investigated. The theory
   presented here facilitates a deep understanding of the working mechanism
   of rotary freestanding TENG and provides useful guidance for designing
   high performance TENG for energy harvesting applications.}},

Title = {{Evaluation by Expert Dancers of a Robot That Performs Partnered Stepping
   via Haptic Interaction}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Our long-term goal is to enable a robot to engage in partner dance for
   use in rehabilitation therapy, assessment, diagnosis, and scientific
   investigations of two-person whole-body motor coordination. Partner
   dance has been shown to improve balance and gait in people with
   Parkinson's disease and in older adults, which motivates our work.
   During partner dance, dance couples rely heavily on haptic interaction
   to convey motor intent such as speed and direction. In this paper, we
   investigate the potential for a wheeled mobile robot with a human-like
   upper-body to perform partnered stepping with people based on the forces
   applied to its end effectors. Blindfolded expert dancers (N=10)
   performed a forward/backward walking step to a recorded drum beat while
   holding the robot's end effectors. We varied the admittance gain of the
   robot's mobile base controller and the stiffness of the robot's arms.
   The robot followed the participants with low lag (M=224, SD=194 ms)
   across all trials. High admittance gain and high arm stiffness
   conditions resulted in significantly improved performance with respect
   to subjective and objective measures. Biomechanical measures such as the
   human hand to human sternum distance, center-of-mass of leader to
   center-of-mass of follower (CoM-CoM) distance, and interaction forces
   correlated with the expert dancers' subjective ratings of their
   interactions with the robot, which were internally consistent
   (Cronbach's alpha=0.92). In response to a final questionnaire, 1/10
   expert dancers strongly agreed, 5/10 agreed, and 1/10 disagreed with the
   statement ``The robot was a good follower.{''} 2/10 strongly agreed,
   3/10 agreed, and 2/10 disagreed with the statement ``The robot was fun
   to dance with.{''} The remaining participants were neutral with respect
   to these two questions.}},

Title = {{Isobaric Molecular Formulae of C, H, and O: A View from the Negative

Journal = {{ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{When compositions of an isobaric series of molecular formulae consisting
   of C, H, and O are displayed in a van Krevelen plot, a remarkable number
   of nonparallel lines of compositions can be observed. Each group of
   related lines converge at a point in a negative quadrant of van Krevelen
   space (e.g., H/C = 4, O/C = -1). These points of convergence have H/C
   and O/C ratios that correspond to molecular formulae in which the
   stoichiometric coefficients of some of the isotopes are negative. In
   this manner, a group of related low-mass moieties have been identified
   (CH4O-1, C4O-3, C2H-8O-1, CH-12, etc.). Each of these moieties has a
   nominal mass of zero and a very small exact mass. Furthermore, all of
   these low-mass moieties have compositions that fall on the line H/C =
   -12 -16(O/C), which lies entirely in the negative quadrants of van
   Krevelen space. This paper demonstrates that all low-mass moieties
   consisting of C, H, and O can be expressed formally as linear
   combinations of any two moieties. Likewise, all molecular formulae that
   fall on a line that passes through a given low-mass moiety must differ
   compositionally by a multiple of the composition of that moiety, and
   their exact masses must differ by a multiple of the exact mass of the
   moiety. This latter relationship has been invoked for very rapid
   assignment of a molecular formula to an exact mass. Finally, a more
   comprehensive and theoretically based understanding of family scores has
   been developed around the concept of low-mass moieties.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the deterministic task of assigning molecular
   formulae to exact masses that are generated by ultrahigh resolution mass
   spectrometry. A new algorithm based on low-mass moieties (LMMs) such as
   CH4O-1 and C4O-3 completely replaces conventional computational loops
   that explore a user-defined range of C, H, and O when searching for
   molecular formulae that have a given exact mass. The LMM-based algorithm
   has been coupled with a combinatorial algorithm that uses nested loops
   for N, P, S, and C-13 to assign molecular formulae. The resulting
   program is more than 1700 times faster than its brute-force counterpart
   that uses nested loops for all elements, and both programs yield
   identical output files. The new LMM-based program is 1050 times faster
   than the open-source program HR2, 60 times faster than Molecular Formula
   Calculator, and 3.6 times faster than MassCalc/FormCalc.}},

Abstract = {{Many past studies have focused on the aqueous photochemical properties
   of colloidal suspensions of C-60 and various {[}C-60] fullerene
   derivatives, yet few have investigated the photochemistry of other
   larger cage fullerene species (e.g., C-70, C-74, C-84, etc.) in water.
   This is a critical knowledge gap because these larger fullerenes may
   exhibit different properties compared to C-60, including increased
   visible light absorption, altered energy level structures, and variable
   cage geometries, which may greatly affect aggregate properties and
   resulting aqueous photoactivity. Herein, we take the first steps toward
   a detailed investigation of the aqueous photochemistry of larger cage
   fullerene species, by focusing on {[}C-70] fullerene. We find that
   aqueous suspensions of C-60 and C-70, nC(60) and nC(70), respectively,
   exhibit many similar physicochemical properties, yet nC(70) appears to
   be significantly more photoactive than nC(60). Studies are conducted to
   elucidate the mechanism behind nC(70)'s superior O-1(2) generation,
   including the measurement of O-1(2) production as a function of incident
   excitation wavelength, analysis of X-ray diffraction data to determine
   crystal packing arrangements, and the excited state dynamics of
   aggregate fullerene species via transient absorption spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue crack propagation behavior of microstructurally small cracks
   growing under extreme stress gradients was investigated in Ni microbeams
   under fully reversed cyclic loading. A technique to calculate the crack
   growth rates in microbeams with two different normalized stress
   gradients (17\% and 50\% mu m(-1)) is developed and validated.
   Decreasing crack propagation rates are observed over the first 2 mu m,
   and the rates are more than 1 order of magnitude slower for the devices
   with 50\% mu m(-1) stress gradients. This fundamental knowledge is
   critical to predict the fatigue reliability of advanced metallic
   microcomponents under bending such as in microelectromechanical systems
   or flexible/stretchable electronics. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the phenomenon of caffeine antiplasticization of
   amorphous poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). Oxygen and carbon dioxide
   permeation measurements at 35 degrees C reveal significant barrier
   improvement (e.g., >3x for PET mixed with similar to 10.7 wt\% caffeine)
   for all PET/caffeine samples studied. Penetrant solubility and
   diffusivity estimates are used to deconvolute the relative transport
   contributions to the overall barrier reduction determined via permeation
   testing. Density values provide a direct measure of the reduced free
   volume for the antiplasticized samples vs. neat PET, and provide a basis
   for understanding the barrier improvement. Further investigation via
   dynamic mechanical analysis of the sub-ambient beta relaxation reveals
   that the diffusion reductions for the antiplasticized samples originate
   from caffeine suppressing the phenyl ring flipping mechanism known to
   occur in glassy PET. The data reported in this paper suggest that
   antiplasticization of PET occurs via a combination of both ``hole
   filling{''} and chain mobility restriction mechanisms, and that the
   relative mechanistic contributions to transport reduction depend largely
   on the penetrant solubility and diffusivity within the polymer matrix.

Abstract = {{Primary marine aerosol (PMA)-cloud interactions off the coast of
   California were investigated using observations of marine aerosol, cloud
   condensation nuclei (CCN), and stratocumulus clouds during the Eastern
   Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (E-PEACE) and the Stratocumulus
   Observations of Los-Angeles Emissions Derived Aerosol-Droplets (SOLEDAD)
   studies. Based on recently reported measurements of PMA size
   distributions, a constrained lognormal-mode-fitting procedure was
   devised to isolate PMA number size distributions from total aerosol size
   distributions and applied to E-PEACE measurements. During the 12 day
   E-PEACE cruise on the R/V Point Sur, PMA typically contributed less than
   15\% of total particle concentrations. PMA number concentrations
   averaged 12 cm(-3) during a relatively calmer period (average wind speed
   12m/s(1)) lasting 8 days, and 71cm(-3) during a period of higher wind
   speeds (average 16m/s(1)) lasting 5 days. On average, PMA contributed
   less than 10\% of total CCN at supersaturations up to 0.9\% during the
   calmer period; however, during the higher wind speed period, PMA
   comprised 5-63\% of CCN (average 16-28\%) at supersaturations less than
   0.3\%. Sea salt was measured directly in the dried residuals of cloud
   droplets during the SOLEDAD study. The mass fractions of sea salt in the
   residuals averaged 12 to 24\% during three cloud events. Comparing the
   marine stratocumulus clouds sampled in the two campaigns, measured peak
   supersaturations were 0.20.04\% during E-PEACE and 0.05-0.1\% during
   SOLEDAD. The available measurements show that cloud droplet number
   concentrations increased with >100 nm particles in E-PEACE but decreased
   in the three SOLEDAD cloud events.}},

Abstract = {{The job shop problem is an important part of scheduling in the
   manufacturing industry. A new intelligent algorithm named Shuffled
   Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm is proposed in this paper with the aim
   of getting the minimized makespan. The sequence mapping mechanism is
   used to change the variables in the continuous domain to discrete
   variables in the combinational optimization problem; the sequence, which
   is based on job permutation, is adopted for encoding mechanism and
   sequence insertion mechanism for decoding. While considering that the
   basic SCE algorithm has the drawbacks of poor solution and lower rate of
   convergence, a new strategy is used to change the individual's evolution
   in the basic SCE algorithm. The strategy makes the new individual closer
   to best individual in the current population. The improved SCE algorithm
   (ISCE) was used to solve the typical job shop problems and the results
   show that the improved algorithm is effective to the job shop
   scheduling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Catastrophic ascending aorta aneurysm (AsAA) dissection and rupture can
   be prevented by elective surgical repair, but identifying individuals at
   risk remains a challenge. Typically the decision to operate is based
   primarily on the overall aneurysm size, which may not be a reliable
   indicator of risk. In this study, AsAA inflation and rupture was
   simulated in 27 patient-specific finite element models constructed from
   clinical CT imaging data and tissue mechanical testing data from
   matching patients. These patients included n = 8 with concomitant
   bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), n = 10 with bovine aortic arch (BAA), and n
   = 10 with neither BAV nor BAA. AsAA rupture risk was found to increase
   with elevated systolic wall stress and tissue stiffness. The aortic size
   index was sufficient for identifying the patients with the lowest risk
   of rupture, but unsuitable for delineating between patients at moderate
   and high risk. There was no correlation between BAV or BAA and AsAA
   rupture risk; however, the AsAA morphology was different among these
   patients. These results support the use of mechanical parameters such as
   vessel wall stress and tissue stiffness for AsAA presurgical evaluation.}},

   Through full wave electromagnetic simulation, we demonstrated our
   proposed antenna to radiate and receive signal at all optical
   communication windows (e.g., lambda = 850, 1310, and 1550 nm) with
   similar to 86\% bandwidth within the operational domain. Moreover,
   numerical results demonstrate that the proposed nanoantenna has
   directional radiation pattern with satisfactory gain over all three
   communication bands. In addition, we evaluated the antenna performances
   with two different array arrangements (e.g., 1-D and square array). The
   proposed broadband antenna can be used for prominent nanophotonic
   applications, such as optical wireless communication in interchip and
   intrachip devices, optical sensing, and optical energy harvesting.}},

   using spherical nanoindentation}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we develop and demonstrate novel protocols based on
   spherical nanoindentation and orientation image mapping (OIM) for
   quantifying the local increases in slip resistances in the individual
   grains of a deformed (or strain hardened) polycrystalline sample. These
   new protocols utilize the recently developed data analyses methods for
   extracting indentation stress-strain (ISS) curves in conjunction with
   the measurements of the local crystal orientations at the indentation
   sites using the OIM technique. The proposed protocols involve two main
   steps. In the first step, spherical nanoindentation measurements are
   conducted on fully annealed samples of the material of interest to map
   out the functional dependence of the indentation yield strength (Y-ind)
   on the crystal lattice orientation in the annealed condition. In the
   second step, spherical nanoindentation and OIM measurements are
   conducted on the deformed samples of the same material and are analyzed
   rigorously to reliably estimate the increase in the local slip
   resistance at the indentation sites. The function established in the
   first step is utilized in the second step to properly account for the
   influence of the local crystal orientation on the measured Y-ind in the
   deformed sample. This novel measurement and data analysis protocol is
   demonstrated in this paper on polycrystalline samples of high purity
   aluminum. From this study, it was noted that the influence of the
   crystal lattice orientation on the measured Y-ind in Al crystals can be
   as high as 40\%, with the lowest values corresponding to the {[}100]
   (cube) orientation and highest values corresponding to the {[}111]
   orientation. The measurements on the deformed samples showed a
   significant variation in the strain hardening rates in the individual
   grains of the polycrystalline sample. A positive correlation was
   observed between the percentage increase in the local slip resistance
   and the value of the Taylor factor computed for the local crystal
   orientation at the indentation site subjected to the macroscale imposed
   deformation. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A multicontrast approach for comprehensive imaging of substantia nigra}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{7-13}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{We characterize the contrast behavior of substantia nigra (SN) in both
   magnetization transfer (MT) imaging, which is believed to be sensitive
   to neuromelanin (NM), and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). Images
   were acquired with a MT prepared dual echo gradient echo sequence. The
   first echo was taken as the MT contrast image and the second was used to
   generate the SWI image. SN volumes were segmented from these two types
   of images using a thresholding method. The spatial and signal
   characteristics of the extracted SWI and MT volumes were compared. Both
   images showed the presence of SN but the volumes of the SN identified in
   the two are spatially incongruent. The MT volume was more caudal than
   the SWI volume and with only a 12\% overlap between the two volumes.
   Considering the SN volumes in each hemisphere separately, the average
   distances between the centers of mass of the volumes from the two types
   images are 5.1 +/- 1.1 mm and 4.1 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively. The
   frequency offsets (homodyne filtered phase/echo time) for the volumes
   derived from MT (NM) images and SWI images are 0.09 +/- 0.32 radians/s
   and -1.12 +/- 0.57 radians/s (p < 0.0001), respectively. The MT
   contrasts for the two volumes are 0.16 +/- 0.02 and 0.10 +/- 0.03 (p <
   0.001), respectively. Our results indicate that the two contrasts are
   sensitive to different portions of the SN, with MT seeing the more
   caudal portion of the SN than SWI, likely due to variations of NM and
   iron content in the SN. Despite the small overlap, these regions are
   complementary. Our results provide a new understanding of the contrast
   behavior of the SN in the two imaging approaches commonly used to image
   it and indicate that using both may yield a more comprehensive
   visualization of the SN. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trends in the Group IIA metal oxides and hydroxides of magnesium,
   calcium, and barium are unique in the periodic table. In this study we
   find that they display novel trends as decorating nanostructures for
   extrinsic semiconductor interfaces. The Group IIA metal ions are strong
   Lewis acids. We form these M2+ ions in aqueous solution and bring these
   solutions in contact with a porous silicon interface to form interfaces
   for conductometric measurements. Observed responses are consistent with
   the formation of MgO whereas the heavier elements display behaviors
   which suggest the effect of their more basic nature. Mg(OH)(2), when
   formed, represents a weak base whereas the heavier metal hydroxides of
   Ca, Sr, and Ba are strong bases. However, the hydroxides tend to give up
   hydrogen and act as Bronsted acids. For the latter elements, the
   reversible interaction response of nanostructures deposited to the
   porous silicon (PS) interface is modified, as the formation of more
   basic sites appears to compete with M2+ Lewis acidity and hydroxide
   Bronsted acidity. Mg2+ forms an interface whose response to the analytes
   NH3 and NO is consistent with MgO and well explained by the recently
   developing Inverse Hard/Soft Acid/Base model. The behavior of the Ca2+
   and Ba2+ decorated interfaces as they interact with the hard base NH3
   follows a reversal of the model, indicating a decrease in acidic
   character as the observed conductometric response suggests the
   interaction with hydroxyl groups. A change from oxide-like to
   hydroxide-like constituents is supported by XPS studies. The changes in
   conductometric response is easily monitored in contrast to changes
   associated with the Group IIA oxides and hydroxides observed in XPS,
   EDAX, IR, and NMR measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   generation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{482}},

Abstract = {{Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technique that can capture electrical
   potential from mixing two water streams of different salt concentrations
   through permselective ion exchange membranes. Effective design of ion
   exchange membranes through structure optimization is critical to
   increase the feasibility of salinity gradient power production by RED.
   In this work, we present the preparation of organic-inorganic
   nanocomposite cation exchange membranes (CEMs) containing sulfonated
   polymer, poly (2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide), and sullonated silica
   (SiO2-SO3H). The effect of silica filler size at various loading
   concentrations on membrane structures, electrochemical properties, and
   the RED power performance is investigated. The membranes containing
   larger fillers (70 nm) at 0.5 wt\% SiO2-SO3H exhibited a relatively
   favorable electrochemical characteristic for power performance: an area
   resistance of 0.85 Omega cm(2), which is around 9.3\% lower than the
   resistance of the membranes with smaller particle fillers (15 nm). The
   power performance of this nanocomposite CEM in a RED stack showed the
   highest gross power density of 1.3 W m(-2): 10\% higher power output
   compared with the membranes containing small particle size and 21\%
   higher than that of commercially available FKS membrane. The goal of the
   present work is to develop an effective design for tailor-made CEMs for
   RED applications. Thus, a further optimized combination of material
   properties and membrane structure appears to be a viable option for the
   development of nanocomposite ion exchange materials that could provide
   greater power production by RED. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of the molecular orientation distribution of the first
   monolayer of donor, molecules at the hole harvesting contact in an
   organic photovoltaic (OPV) on device efficiency-was investigated. Two
   zinc phthalocyanine(ZnPc) phosphonic acids (PA) deposited on indium tin
   oxide (ITO) electrodes are compared: ZnPC(PA)(4) contains PA linkers in
   all four quadrants, and ZnPcPA contains a PA linker in one quadrant.
   ZnPcPA. monolayers exhibited a broad distribution of molecular
   orientations Whereas ZnPc(PA)(4) adsorption produced a monolayer with a
   narrower orientation distribution with the molecular plane more parallel
   to the ITO surface, We used potential-modulated attenuated total
   reflectance spectroelectrochemistry (PM-ATR) to characterize the
   charge-transfer kinetics of these films and show that the highest rate
   constants correspond: to ZnPc subpopulations that are oriented more
   parallel to the ITO surface plane. For ZnPc(PA)(4), rate constants
   exceeded 10(4) s(-1) and are among the highest ever reported for a
   surfaceconfined, redox couple, which is attributable to both its
   Orientation and the small ZnPc-electrode separation distance. The
   performance of OPVs with ITO hole-harvesting contacts modified with
   ZnPc(PA)(4) was comparable to that achieved with highly activated bare
   ITO contacts, whereas for ZnPcPA-modified contacts, the OPV performance
   was similar to that-observed with (hole-blocking) alkyl-PA modifiers.
   These results demonstrate the synergism between molecular structure,
   energetics, and dynamics at interfaces in OPVs.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator (PNG) constructed
   using a hybrid (or composite) film composed of highly crystalline
   BaTi(1-x)ZrxO3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) nanocubes (abbreviated
   as BTZO) synthesized using a molten-salt process embedded into a
   poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix solution via ultrasonication.
   The potential of a BTZO/PVDF hybrid film is realized in fabricating
   eco-friendly devices, active sensors, and flexible nanogenerators to
   interpret its functionality. Our strategy is based on the incorporation
   of various Zr4+ doping ratios into the Ti4+ site of BaTiO3 nanocubes to
   enhance the performance of the PNG. The flexible nanogenerator
   (BTZO/PVDF) exhibits a high electrical output up to similar to 11.9 V
   and similar to 1.35 mu A compared to the nanogenerator (BTO/PVDF) output
   of 7.99 V and 1.01 mu A upon the application of cyclic pushing-releasing
   frequencies with a constant load (11 N). We also demonstrate another
   exciting application of the PNG as a self-powered sensor to measure
   different water velocities at an outlet pipe. The average maximum peak
   power of the PNG varies from 0.2 to 15.8 nW for water velocities ranging
   from 31.43 to 125.7 m/s during the water ON condition. This study shows
   the compositional dependence approach, fabrication of nanostructures for
   energy harvesting, and self-powered devices in the field of monitoring

Abstract = {{We explore the effect of fluorine doping on hydrophobicity of nanoporous
   silicon carbide-derived carbon (SiCDC), and investigate the underlying
   barriers for adsorption and diffusion Of water vapor and CO2 in the
   fluorinated and nonfluorinated structures: We develop atomistic models
   of fluorine-doped SiCDC at three different levels of fluorination, based
   on a hybrid reverse Monte Carlo constructed model of SiCDC, and develop
   a novel fir-principles force field for the simulation of adsorption and
   transport of water and CO2 in the fluorine-doped carbon materials. We
   demonstrate an apparent dual effect of fluorination, showing that while
   fluorination generates more hydrophilic carbon surfaces, they actually
   act as more hydrophobic structures due to enhanced energy barriers in
   the disordered network of micropoous carbon. While an increase in
   adsorption energy and in water uptake is seen for fluorine-doped carbon,
   large internal free energy barriers as well as the results of MD
   Simulations demonstrate that the increased adsorption is kinetically
   limited and not experimentally observable on practical time scales. We
   show that an increase in apparent hydrophobicity due to fluorination is
   mediated by larger free energy barriers arising from stronger binding of
   fluid molecules inside the pore network, as opposed to repulsion or
   steric hindrance to the diffusion of molecules through narrow pore
   entries. For carbon dioxide, adsorption enthalpies and activation energy
   barriers are both decreased on fluorination, indicating weakened solid
   fluid binding energies in the fluorinated systems.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxides are active as positive electrodes for
   lithium-ion energy storage based on the surface redox reactions between
   oxygen functional groups and Li ions. For effective Li-ion energy
   storage within a confined mass and volume, free-standing, high-packing
   density, and redox-active graphene films were fabricated by a simple
   two-step compression and vacuum-drying process from a hydrothermally
   reduced gtaphene hydrogel. The assembled graphene films showed a folded
   microstructure with high packing densities up to similar to 0.64 g/cms.
   Redox-active oxygen functional groups on the graphene oxide were
   activated and controlled by the hydrothermal reduction temperature.
   Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the carbonyl
   and epoxide groups among various oxygen functional groups on graphene
   were the main contributors for the high potential redox reactions with
   Li ions. The folded graphene film electrodes delivered both a high
   gravimetric energy of similar to 419 Wh/kg and a high volumetric energy
   of similar to 239 Wh/L. In addition, the folded graphene film electrodes
   exhibited an exceptional cycling stability, retaining a gravimetric
   capacity of similar to 160 mAh/g after 50 000 cycles. These results
   provide significant insights on the effective utilization of surface
   redox reactions to design graphene-based electrodes for high-performance
   Li-ion energy storage devices.}},

Title = {{A gene-expression-based neural code for food abundance that modulates
   lifespan}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{How the nervous system internally represents environmental food
   availability is poorly understood. Here, we show that quantitative
   information about food abundance is encoded by combinatorial
   neuron-specific gene-expression of conserved TGF beta and serotonin
   pathway components in Caenorhabditis elegans. Crosstalk and
   auto-regulation between these pathways alters the shape, dynamic range,
   and population variance of the gene-expression responses of daf-7 (TGF
   beta) and tph-1 (tryptophan hydroxylase) to food availability. These
   intricate regulatory features provide distinct mechanisms for TGF beta
   and serotonin signaling to tune the accuracy of this multineuron code:
   daf-7 primarily regulates gene-expression variability, while tph-1
   primarily regulates the dynamic range of gene-expression responses. This
   code is functional because daf-7 and tph-1 mutations bidirectionally
   attenuate food level-dependent changes in lifespan. Our results reveal a
   neural code for food abundance and demonstrate that gene expression
   serves as an additional layer of information processing in the nervous
   system to control long-term physiology.}},

Title = {{Osteogenic Embryoid Body-Derived Material Induces Bone Formation In Vivo}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{The progressive loss of endogenous regenerative capacity that
   accompanies mammalian aging has been attributed at least in part to
   alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of adult
   tissues. Thus, creation of a more regenerative microenvironment,
   analogous to embryonic morphogenesis, may be achieved via pluripotent
   embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and derivation of devitalized
   materials as an alternative to decellularized adult tissues, such as
   demineralized bone matrix (DBM). Transplantation of devitalized ESC
   materials represents a novel approach to promote functional tissue
   regeneration and reduce the inherent batch-to-batch variability of
   allograft-derived materials. In this study, the osteoinductivity of
   embryoid body-derived material (EBM) was compared to DBM in a standard
   in vivo ectopic osteoinduction assay in nude mice. EBM derived from EBs
   differentiated for 10 days with osteogenic media
   (+beta-glycerophosphate) exhibited similar osteoinductivity to active
   DBM (osteoinduction score = 2.50 +/- 0.27 vs. 2.75 +/- 0.16) based on
   histological scoring, and exceeded inactive DBM (1.13 +/- 0.13, p <
   0.005). Moreover, EBM stimulated formation of new bone, ossicles, and
   marrow spaces, similar to active DBM. The potent osteoinductivity of EBM
   demonstrates that morphogenic factors expressed by ESCs undergoing
   osteogenic differentiation yield a novel devitalized material capable of
   stimulating de novo bone formation in vivo.}},

Title = {{GENERAL RELATIVISTIC HYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATION OF ACCRETION FLOW FROM A
   STELLAR TIDAL DISRUPTION}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{804}},

Abstract = {{We study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive black hole tidally
   disrupts a star joins an accretion flow. Combining a relativistic
   hydrodynamic simulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic
   hydrodynamics simulation of the subsequent debris motion, we track the
   evolution of such a system until similar or equal to 80\% of the stellar
   mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks
   near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most
   tightly bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make
   its characteristic radius comparable to the semimajor axis of the most.
   bound material, not the tidal radius as previously envisioned. The outer
   shocks are caused by post-Newtonian relativistic effects, both on the
   stellar orbit during its disruption and on the tidal forces.
   Accumulation of mass into the accretion flow is both non-monotonic and
   slow, requiring several to 10 times the orbital period of the most
   tightly bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass
   may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time.
   Deflection by shocks does, however, cause some mass to lose both angular
   momentum and energy, permitting it to move inward even before most of
   the mass is accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the accretion
   rate still rises sharply and then decays roughly as a power. law, its
   maximum is similar or equal to 0.1x the previous expectation, and the
   timescale of the peak is similar or equal to 5x longer than previously
   predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass
   inferred from a measured event timescale is therefore similar or equal
   to 0.2x the value given by classical theory.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{The possibility of using spin waves for information transmission and
   processing has been an area of active research due to the unique ability
   to manipulate the amplitude and phase of the spin waves for building
   complex logic circuits with less physical resources and low power
   consumption. Previous proposals on spin wave logic circuits have
   suggested the idea of utilizing the magneto-electric effect for spin
   wave amplification and amplitude-or phase-dependent switching of
   magneto-electric cells. Here, we propose a comprehensive scheme for
   building a clocked non-volatile spin wave device by introducing a
   charge-to-spin converter that translates information from electrical
   domain to spin domain, magneto-electric spin wave repeaters that operate
   in three different regimes - spin wave transmitter, non-volatile memory
   and spin wave detector, and a novel clocking scheme that ensures
   sequential transmission of information and non-reciprocity. The proposed
   device satisfies the five essential requirements for logic application:
   nonlinearity, amplification, concatenability, feedback prevention, and
   complete set of Boolean operations.}},

Abstract = {{The development of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity,
   large surface area, and good electrical properties would offer
   opportunities for producing functionalized porous materials suitable for
   energy storage, conversion, and utilization. Realizing these
   applications remains challenging because of the limited numbers of
   electrically conductive porous MOFs that are known. We apply density
   functional theory (DFT) to assess a large number of potentially
   electrically conductive MOFs generated by infiltrating known materials
   with conjugated and redox-active 7,7,8,8-tetracyanquinododimethane
   (TCNQ) molecules. DFT results demonstrate that TCNQ coordinating with
   dimeric Cu paddlewheels can create molecular chains in a variety of
   MOFs. Several of these materials feature the formation of multiple
   dimensional conducting chains, making the materials promising for
   electrical conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of optogenetics has created an increased demand
   for advancing engineering tools for optical modulation of neural
   circuitry. This paper details the design, fabrication, integration, and
   packaging procedures of a wirelessly-powered, light emitting diode (LED)

   LED-coupled optrode array employs microscale LED (mu LED) chips and
   polymer-based microwaveguides to deliver light into multi-level cortical
   networks, coupled with microelectrodes to record spontaneous changes in
   neural activity. An integrated, implantable, switched capacitor based
   stimulator (SCS) system provides high instantaneous power to the mu LEDs
   through an inductive link to emit sufficient light and evoke neural
   activities. The presented system is mechanically flexible,
   biocompatible, miniaturized, and lightweight, suitable for chronic
   implantation in small freely behaving animals. The design of this system
   is scalable and its manufacturing is cost effective through batch
   fabrication using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. It
   can be adopted by other groups and customized for specific needs of

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to quantify connective tissue fibre
   orientation and alignment in young, old and glaucomatous human optic
   nerve heads (ONH) to understand ONH microstructure and predisposition to
   glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Transverse (seven healthy, three
   glaucomatous) and longitudinal (14 healthy) human ONH cryosections were
   imaged by both second harmonic generation microscopy and small angle
   light scattering (SALS) in order to quantify preferred fibre orientation
   (PFO) and degree of fibre alignment (DOFA). DOFA was highest within the
   peripapillary sclera (ppsclera), with relatively low values in the
   lamina cribrosa (LC). Elderly ppsclera DOFA was higher than that in
   young ppsclera (p < 0.00007), and generally higher than in glaucoma
   ppsclera. In all LCs, a majority of fibres had preferential orientation
   horizontally across the nasal-temporal axis. In all glaucomatous LCs,
   PFO was significantly different from controls in a minimum of seven out
   of 12 LC regions (p < 0.05). Additionally, higher fibre alignment was
   observed in the glaucomatous inferior-temporal LC (p < 0.017). The
   differences between young and elderly ONH fibre alignment within regions
   suggest that age-related microstructural changes occur within the
   structure. The additional differences in fibre alignment observed within
   the glaucomatous LC may reflect an inherent susceptibility to
   glaucomatous optic neuropathy, or may be a consequence of ONH
   remodelling and/or collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic Fe3O4@poly(m-phenylenediamine) particles (Fe3O4@PmPDs) with
   well-defined core-shell structure were first designed for high
   performance Cr(VI) removal by taking advantages of the easy separation
   property of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and the satisfactory
   adsorption property of polymers. Through controlling the polymerization
   on MNPs, directly coating was realized without the complicated
   premodification procedures. The particle property and adsorption
   mechanism were analyzed in details. Fe3O4@PmPD5 exhibited tunable PmPD
   shell thickness from 10 to 100 nm, high magnetic (similar to 150 to
   similar to 73 emu g(-1)) and facile separation property by magnet. The
   coating of PmPD significantly enhanced Cr(VI) adsorption capacity from
   46.79 (bare MNPs) to 246.09 mg g(-1) (71.55\% PmPD loading proportion),
   much higher than many reported composite adsorbents. The high Cr(VI)
   removal performance was attributed to the adsorption of Cr(VI) on
   protonated imino groups and the efficient reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
   by amine, followed by Cr(III) chelated on imino groups, which are
   spontaneous and endothermic. The Fe3O4@PmPDs have great potential in
   treating Cr(VI)-contaminated water.}},

Abstract = {{We review a number of theories of motivation, and typologies of
   motivations, in psychological theory and in application to a variety of
   specific contexts, including shopping, eating, leisure, tourism, and
   travel. A recurring theme is the distinction between extrinsic
   (instrumental, utilitarian, functional) and intrinsic (autotelic,
   hedonic, experiential) motivations. We suggest that travel is a behavior
   to which intrinsic motivations apply, and that focusing exclusively on
   the extrinsic motivations to travel runs the risk of substantially
   underestimating the demand for travel, and the resistance to policies
   attempting to reduce it or to technologies (notably, information and
   communication technologies) expected to (partly) replace it. We offer a
   number of suggestions for improving standard travel surveys to help
   obtain the data needed to explore intrinsic motivations more fully. As
   better data become available, travel behavior models can be refined to
   partly account for such motivations. We believe that the resulting
   insights will be extremely valuable to policy-makers, planners, and
   behavioral scholars.}},

Abstract = {{When monitoring complex engineering systems, sensors often measure
   mixtures of signals that are unique to individual components (component
   signals). However, isolating component signals directly from sensor
   signals can be a challenge. As an example, in vibration monitoring of a
   rotating machine, if different components generate vibration signals at
   similar frequencies, they cannot be distinguished using traditional
   spectrum analysis (non-inseparable). However, developing degradation
   signals from component signals is important to monitor the deterioration
   of crucial components and to predict their residual lifetimes. This
   article proposes a simultaneous signal separation and prognostics
   framework for multi-component systems with non-inseparable component
   signals. In the signal separation stage, an Independent Component
   Analysis (ICA) algorithm is used to isolate component signals from mixed
   sensor signals, and an online amplitude recovery procedure is used to
   recover amplitude information that is lost after applying the ICA. In
   the prognostics stage, an adaptive prognostics method to model component
   degradation signals as continuous stochastic processes is used to
   predict the residual lifetimes of individual components. A case study is
   presented that investigates the performance of the signal separation
   stage and that of the final residual-life prediction under different
   conditions. The simulation results show a reasonable robustness of the
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{When a nematic liquid crystal is confined to a capillary tube with
   strong homeotropic anchoring conditions, unstable +1 disclinations lines
   can branch into a pair of +1/2 lines forming loops attached to the +1
   axial line through branch points. The shape of the +1/2 disclination
   lines is a function of the confinement and the Frank elasticity. Our
   previous work shows that nematic liquid crystals under cylindrical
   confinement display aradial-to-planar polar defect texture transition
   through the nucleation and uniform motion of a disclination branch point
   that separates a high charge disclination from two lower charge ones.
   Here, we present the existence of a branch point for a nematic LC
   confined to different conical geometries with homeotropic anchoring.
   Determination of the defect geometry in conjunction with our model
   provides a means of characterizing the elasticity of LCs. Our results
   show that a larger conical angle reduces the length at which
   disclination curvature relaxes to zero and it also leads to less bending
   energy. These new findings are useful to assess the Frank elasticity of
   the nematic LCs and predict novel defect structures under confinement.}},

   encapsulation of ``red{''} and ``green{''} cells in microscopic silk
   nest arrays with the preservation of their function allowed for facile
   confinement of cells into microscopic silk nests, where cells retained
   dual red-green response to mixed analyte environment. Whole-cell dual

Abstract = {{Shock initiation and detonation are often attributed to wave
   interactions in the micro-structure of condensed materials, which
   involve complex thermo-chemical, fluid and structural processes. Due to
   their broad range of scales, the simulation of hot spot formation,
   reaction growth, and transition to detonation is therefore rendered
   challenging. The extension of these complex couplings to simulate
   full-scale tests is prohibitively costly. This paper introduces a hot
   spot formation model to account for heterogeneous effects based on
   physical and chemical properties. The formulation is first evaluated in
   a HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) sample where hot spots are
   known to form due to void collapses. Transition to detonation is
   achieved with impact pressures that match those found in experiments.
   Parametric studies are performed to determine the effects of the void
   size and population on the sensitivity of the material. Then, the same
   hot spot model is used to study detonation in nanocrystalline PETN
   (pentaerythritol-tetranitrate) where heating is primarily the result of
   grain boundary effects such as friction, plasticity, and deformation.
   The inclusion of the hot spot model increases the sensitivity of the
   material and predicts shock pressures, again similar to experimental
   values. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the results is performed to
   assess the uncertainty in the input variables of the model and to
   identify the critical parameters with implications on the accuracy of
   the results. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the home cloud environment, the storage performance of home cloud
   servers, which govern connected devices and provide resources with
   virtualization features, is critical to improve the end-user experience.
   To improve the storage performance of virtualized home cloud servers in
   a cost-effective manner, caching schemes using flash-based solid state
   drives (SSD) have been widely studied. Although previous studies
   successfully narrow the speed gap between memory and hard disk drives,
   they only focused on how to manage the cache space, but were less
   interested in how to use the cache space efficiently taking into account
   the characteristics of flash-based SSD. Moreover, SSD caching is used as
   a read-only cache due to two well-known limitations of SSD: slow write
   and limited lifespan. Since storage access in virtual machines is
   performed in a more complex and costly manner, the limitations of SSD
   affect more significantly the storage performance. This paper proposes a
   novel SSD caching scheme and virtual disk image format, named sequential
   virtual disk (SVD), for achieving high-performance home cloud
   environments. The proposed techniques are based on the workload
   characteristics, in which synchronous random writes dominate, while
   taking into consideration the characteristics of flash memory and
   storage stack of the virtualized systems. Unlike previous studies, SSD
   is used as a read-write cache in the proposed caching scheme to
   effectively mitigate the performance degradation of synchronous random
   writes. The prototype was evaluated with some realistic workloads,
   through which the developed scheme was shown to allow improvement of the
   storage access performance by 21\% to 112\%, with reduction in the
   number of erasures on SSD by about 56\% on average.(1)}},

Title = {{Assessment of reservoir system variable forecasts}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3437-3458}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Forecast ensembles are a convenient means to model water resources
   uncertainties and to inform planning and management processes. For
   multipurpose reservoir systems, forecast types include (i) forecasts of
   upcoming inflows and (ii) forecasts of system variables and outputs such
   as reservoir levels, releases, flood damage risks, hydropower
   production, water supply withdrawals, water quality conditions,
   navigation opportunities, and environmental flows, among others.
   Forecasts of system variables and outputs are conditional on forecasted
   inflows as well as on specific management policies and can provide
   useful information for decision-making processes. Unlike inflow
   forecasts (in ensemble or other forms), which have been the subject of
   many previous studies, reservoir system variable and output forecasts
   are not formally assessed in water resources management theory or
   practice. This article addresses this gap and develops methods to
   rectify potential reservoir system forecast inconsistencies and improve
   the quality of management-relevant information provided to stakeholders
   and managers. The overarching conclusion is that system variable and
   output forecast consistency is critical for robust reservoir management
   and needs to be routinely assessed for any management model used to
   inform planning and management processes. The above are demonstrated
   through an application from the Sacramento-American-San Joaquin
   reservoir system in northern California.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the three-dimensional compressible isentropic
   radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) equations. The existence of unique local
   strong solutions is firstly proved when the initial data are arbitrarily
   large, contain vacuum and satisfy some initial layer compatibility
   condition. The initial mass density does not need to be bounded away
   from zero and may vanish in some open set. We also prove that if the
   initial vacuum is not so irregular, then the initial layer compatibility
   condition is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the existence of a
   unique strong solution. Finally, we establish a blow-up criterion for
   the strong solution that we obtained. The similar results also hold for
   the barotropic flow with general pressure law p(m) = p(m)(rho) is an
   element of C-1((R) over bar (+)).}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{77-86}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A self-charging power cell (SCPC) is a structure that hybridizes the
   mechanisms for energy conversion and storage into one process through
   which mechanical energy can be directly converted into electrochemical
   energy. A key structure of an SCPC is the use of a polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) piezo-separator. Herein, we have fabricated a
   piezoelectric beta-form PVDF separator with a highly porous architecture
   by introducing ZnO particles. The electrochemical charge/discharge
   performance of this SCPC was greatly enhanced at lower discharge rates
   compared to highly stretched (high-beta-content) or less porous PVDF
   membranes. The lower charge-transfer resistance of this well-developed
   porous piezo-separator is the main factor that facilitated the transport
   of Li+ ions without sacrificing piezoelectric performance. This study
   reveals a novel approach for improving the performance of SCPCs. (C)

Abstract = {{Air pollution is one of the major challenges faced by the human kind,
   but cleaning of air is a horrendous task and hugely expensive, because
   of its large scope and the cost of energy. Up to now, all of the air
   cleaning systems are generally driven by external power, making it
   rather expensive and infeasible. Here, we introduce the first
   self-powered air cleaning system focusing on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
   dust removal as driven by the electricity generated by natural wind,
   with the use of rotating triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG).
   Distinguished from traditional approach of electrostatic precipitation
   by applying a voltage of thousand volt, our technology takes the
   advantages of high output voltage of R-TENG, typically in the order of a
   few hundreds volt. This self-powered air cleaning system not only
   adsorbs dust particles in air, but also oxidizes SO2 without producing
   byproducts. Therefore, it could be potential for easing the haze-fog
   situation, which is one of the most important directions in self-powered
   electrochemistry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wurtzite structured mateirals such as ZnO, GaN, InN and CdS
   simultaneously exhibit piezoelectric, semiconducting and photoexcitation
   properties. The piezotronic effect is to use the inner crystal potential
   generated by piezoelectric polarization charges for controlling/tuning
   the charge carrier transport characteristics in these materials. The
   piezo-phototronic effect is about the use of piezoelectric charges to
   tube the generation, transport, separation and/or recombination of
   charge carriers at p-n junction. This article reviews the fundamental
   theories of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics, forming their basis for
   electromechancial devices, sensors and energy sciences. Starting from
   the basic equations for piezoelectricity, semiconductor and
   photoexcitation, analytical equations for describing the strain-tuned
   device current were derived. Through analytical calculations and
   numerical simulations, it was confirmed that the piezoelectric
   polarization charges can act in the form of inner-crystal charges in the
   depletion region, resulting in a change in Schottky barrier height,
   depletion region shift and/or formation of a charge channel, which can
   be used effectively to enhance the efficiency of LED, solar cell and
   photon detectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of piezoelectric and semiconducting properties gives rise
   to the effect of piezotronics, which regulates charge carrier transport
   through the modulation of energy barriers at contact interfaces. With

Title = {{METEOROLOGY, AIR QUALITY, AND HEALTH IN LONDON The ClearfLo Project}},

Abstract = {{Air quality and heat are strong health drivers, and their accurate
   assessment and forecast are important in densely populated urban areas.
   However, the sources and processes leading to high concentrations of
   main pollutants, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and fine and coarse
   particulate matter, in complex urban areas are not fully understood,
   limiting our ability to forecast air quality accurately. This paper
   introduces the Clean Air for London (ClearfLo; www.clearflo.ac.uk)
   project's interdisciplinary approach to investigate the processes
   leading to poor air quality and elevated temperatures.Within ClearfLo, a
   large multi-institutional project funded by the U.K. Natural Environment
   Research Council (NERC), integrated measurements of meteorology and
   gaseous, and particulate composition/loading within the atmosphere of
   London, United Kingdom, were undertaken to understand the processes
   underlying poor air quality. Long-term measurement infrastructure
   installed at multiple levels (street and elevated), and at urban
   background, curbside, and rural locations were complemented with
   high-resolution numerical atmospheric simulations. Combining these
   (measurement-modeling) enhances understanding of seasonal variations in
   meteorology and composition together with the controlling processes. Two
   intensive observation periods (winter 2012 and the Summer Olympics of
   2012) focus upon the vertical structure and evolution of the urban
   boundary layer; chemical controls on nitrogen dioxide and ozone
   productionin particular, the role of volatile organic compounds; and
   processes controlling the evolution, size, distribution, and composition
   of particulate matter. The paper shows that mixing heights are deeper
   over London than in the rural surroundings and that the seasonality of
   the urban boundary layer evolution controls when concentrations peak.
   The composition also reflects the seasonality of sources such as
   domestic burning and biogenic emissions.}},

Title = {{Distal Spike Initiation Zone Location Estimation by Morphological
   Simulation of Ionic Current Filtering Demonstrated in a Novel Model of
   an Identified Drosophila Motoneuron}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Studying ion channel currents generated distally from the recording site
   is difficult because of artifacts caused by poor space clamp and
   membrane filtering. A computational model can quantify artifact
   parameters for correction by simulating the currents only if their exact
   anatomical location is known. We propose that the same artifacts that
   confound current recordings can help pinpoint the source of those
   currents by providing a signature of the neuron's morphology. This
   method can improve the recording quality of currents initiated at the
   spike initiation zone (SIZ) that are often distal to the soma in
   invertebrate neurons. Drosophila being a valuable tool for
   characterizing ion currents, we estimated the SIZ location and
   quantified artifacts in an identified motoneuron, aCC/MN1-Ib, by
   constructing a novel multi-compartmental model. Initial simulation of
   the measured biophysical channel properties in an isopotential
   Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model partially replicated firing
   characteristics. Adding a second distal compartment, which contained
   spike-generating Na+ and K+ currents, was sufficient to simulate aCC's
   in vivo activity signature. Matching this signature using a
   reconstructed morphology predicted that the SIZ is on aCC's primary
   axon, 70 mu m after the most distal dendritic branching point. From SIZ
   to soma, we observed and quantified selective morphological filtering of
   fast activating currents. Non-inactivating K+ currents are filtered
   similar to 3 times less and despite their large magnitude at the soma
   they could be as distal as Na+ currents. The peak of transient component
   (NaT) of the voltage-activated Na+ current is also filtered more than
   the magnitude of slower persistent component (NaP), which can contribute
   to seizures. The corrected NaP/NaT ratio explains the previously
   observed discrepancy when the same channel is expressed in different
   cells. In summary, we used an in vivo signature to estimate ion channel
   location and recording artifacts, which can be applied to other neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical insecticide loggers have long been used to control mosquito
   populations and reduce the spread of malaria, West Nile virus, and
   dengue fever. In this study, we show that simple fogs of water droplets,
   devoid of chemicals, are effective at obstructing the flight of
   Anopheles freeborni mosquitoes. Using high-speed video, we film the
   flight of mosquitoes in denser-than-air fluids such as fogs produced by
   household humidifiers and heavy gas. In gases with more than twice the
   density of air, mosquitoes cannot maintain flight stability, but pitch
   and roll uncontrollably until they fall to the ground. We here show that
   the increased drag of denser-than-air flight environments is sufficient
   to render a mosquito's gyroscopic sensors and wingbeat controllers,
   their halteres, ineffective. Anomalous drag forces are estimated with
   steady and unsteady drag analyses. We glue masses of 10 ng to each
   haltere, equivalent to 0.0005\% the mass of the mosquito. Mosquitoes
   with such a minor treatment executed flight patterns, similar to
   mosquitoes in fog, indicating a mosquito's haltere are highly tuned to
   aerodynamic properties of normal air, making them sensitive to
   contaminants. The failure of mosquito flight in fog reveals potential
   new methods for mosquito control that do not require insecticide-laced
   particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the diversity and dynamic nature of cloud services, it is usually
   hard for potential cloud consumers to select the most suitable cloud
   service. This paper proposes CCCloud: a context-aware and credible cloud
   service selection model based on the comparison and aggregation of
   subjective assessments extracted from ordinary cloud consumers and
   objective assessments from quantitative performance testing parties. We
   propose a novel approach to evaluate cloud users' credibility, which not
   only can accurately evaluate how truthfully they assess cloud services,
   but also resist user collusion. In addition, in our model, objective
   assessments are used as benchmarks to filter out potentially biased
   subjective assessments, and then objective assessments and subjective
   assessments are aggregated to evaluate the overall performance of a
   cloud service. Furthermore, our model takes the contexts of objective
   assessments and subjective assessments into account. By calculating the
   similarity between different contexts, the benchmark level of objective
   assessments is dynamically adjusted according to context similarity, and
   the aggregated final scores of alternative cloud services are weighted
   by the similarity between the contexts of a potential cloud consumer and
   every testing party. This makes our cloud service selection model
   reflect potential cloud consumers' customized requirements more
   effectively. Finally, our proposed model is evaluated through the
   experiments conducted under different conditions. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the
   existing work, especially in the resistance of user collusion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper prices insurance contracts by employing law invariant,
   coherent risk measures from mathematical finance. We demonstrate that
   the corresponding premium principle enjoys a minimal representation.
   Uniqueness - in a sense specified in the paper - of this premium
   principle is derived from this initial result. The representations are
   derived from a result by Kusuoka, which is usually given for nonatomic
   probability spaces. We extend this setting to premium principles for
   spaces with atoms, as this is of particular importance for insurance.
   Further, stochastic order relations are employed to identify the minimal
   representation. It is shown that the premium principles in the minimal
   representation are extremal with respect to the order relations. The
   tools are finally employed to explicitly provide the minimal
   representation for premium principles, which are important in actuarial
   practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The dynamical states of a prolate spheroidal particle suspended in shear
   flow as a consequence of particle and fluid inertia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{771}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The rotational motion of a prolate spheroidal particle suspended in
   shear flow is studied by a lattice Boltzmann method with external
   boundary forcing (LB-EBF). It has previously been shown that the case of
   a single neutrally buoyant particle is a surprisingly rich dynamical
   system that exhibits several bifurcations between rotational states due
   to inertial effects. It was observed that the rotational states were
   associated with either fluid inertia effects or particle inertia
   effects, which are always in competition. The effects of fluid inertia
   are characterized by the particle Reynolds number Re-p = 4Ga(2)/nu,
   where G is the shear rate, a is the length of the particle major
   semi-axis and nu is the kinematic viscosity. Particle inertia is
   associated with the Stokes number St = alpha Re-p, where alpha is the
   solid-to-fluid density ratio. Previously, the neutrally buoyant case
   (S-t = Re-p) was studied extensively. However, little is known about how
   these results are affected when St not equal Re-p, and how the aspect
   ratio r(p) (major axis/minor axis) influences the competition between
   fluid and particle inertia in the absence of gravity. This work gives a
   full description of how prolate spheroidal particles in the range 2 <=
   r(p) <= 6 behave depending on the chosen St and Re-p. Furthermore,
   consequences for the rheology of a dilute suspension containing such
   particles are discussed. Finally, grid resolution close to the particle
   is shown to affect the quantitative results considerably. It is
   suggested that this resolution is a major cause of quantitative
   discrepancies between different studies. Thus, the results of this work
   and previous direct numerical simulations of this problem should be
   regarded as qualitative descriptions of the physics involved, and more
   refined methods must be used to quantitatively pinpoint the transitions
   between rotational states.}},

Title = {{Fractional calculus model of articular cartilage based on experimental

Abstract = {{Articular cartilage is a unique substance that protects joints from
   damage and wear. Many decades of research have led to detailed biphasic
   and triphasic models for the intricate structure and behavior of
   cartilage. However, the models contain many assumptions on boundary
   conditions, permeability, viscosity, model size, loading, etc., that
   complicate the description of cartilage. For impact studies or
   biomimetic applications, cartilage can be studied phenomenologically to
   reduce modeling complexity. This work reports experimental results on
   the stress-relaxation of equine articular cartilage in unconfined
   loading. The response is described by a fractional calculus viscoelastic
   model, which gives storage and loss moduli as functions of frequency,
   rendering multiple advantages: (1) the fractional calculus model is
   robust, meaning that fewer constants are needed to accurately capture a
   wide spectrum of viscoelastic behavior compared to other viscoelastic
   models (e.g., Prony series), (2) in the special case where the
   fractional derivative is 1/2, it is shown that there is a
   straightforward time-domain representation, (3) the eigenvalue problem
   is simplified in subsequent dynamic studies, and (4) cartilage
   stress-relaxation can be described with as few as three constants,
   giving an advantage for large-scale dynamic studies that account for
   joint motion or impact. Moreover, the resulting storage and loss moduli
   can quantify healthy, damaged, or cultured cartilage, as well as
   artificial joints. The proposed characterization is suited for
   high-level analysis of multiphase materials, where the separate
   contribution of each phase is not desired. Potential uses of this
   analysis include biomimetic dampers and bearings, or artificial joints
   where the effective stiffness and damping are fundamental parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The self-powered system is a promising concept for wireless networks due
   to its independent and sustainable operations without an external power
   source. To realize this idea, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was
   recently invented, which can effectively convert ambient mechanical
   energy into electricity to power up portable electronics. In this work,
   a self-powered smart window system was realized through integrating an
   electrochromic device (ECD) with a transparent TENG driven by blowing
   wind and raindrops. Driven by the sustainable output of the TENG, the
   optical properties, especially the transmittance of the ECD, display
   reversible variations due to electrochemical redox reactions. The
   maximum transmittance change at 695 nm can be reached up to 32.4\%,
   which is comparable to that operated by a conventional electrochemical
   potentiostat (32.6\%). This research is a substantial advancement toward
   the practical application of nanogenerators and self-powered systems.}},

   several orders of magnitude higher than the best that can be achieved

Abstract = {{Nanowires of the same composition, and even fabricated within the same
   batch, often exhibit electrical conductivities that can vary by orders
   of magnitude. Unfortunately, existing electrical characterization
   methods are time-consuming, making the statistical survey of highly
   variable samples essentially impractical. Here, we demonstrate a
   contactless, solution-based method to efficiently measure the electrical
   conductivity of 1D nanomaterials based on their transient alignment
   behavior in ac electric fields of different frequencies. Comparison with
   direct transport measurements by probe-based scanning tunneling
   microscopy shows that electro-orientation spectroscopy can
   quantitatively measure nanowire conductivity over a 5-order-of-magnitude
   range, 10(-5)-1 Omega(-1) m(-1) (corresponding to resistivities in the
   range 10(2)-10(7) Omega.cm). With this method, we statistically
   characterize the conductivity of a variety of nanowires and find
   significant variability in silicon nanowires grown by metal-assisted
   chemical etching from the same wafer. We also find that the active
   carrier concentration of n-type silicon nanowires is greatly reduced by
   surface traps and that surface passivation increases the effective
   conductivity by an order of magnitude. This simple method makes
   electrical characterization of insulating and semiconducting 1D
   nanomaterials far more efficient and accessible to more researchers than
   current approaches. Electro-orientation spectroscopy also has the
   potential to be integrated with other solution-based methods for the
   high-throughput sorting and manipulation of 1D nanomaterials for
   postgrowth device assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting ambient mechanical energy is a green route in obtaining clean
   and sustainable electric energy. Here, we report an ultrarobust
   high-performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) on the basis of
   charge replenishment by creatively introducing a rod rolling friction in
   the structure design. With a grating number of 30 and a free-standing
   gap of 0.5 mm, the fabricated TENG can deliver an output power of 250
   mW/m(2) at a rotating rate of 1000 r/min. And it is capable of charging
   a 200 mu F commercial capacitor to 120 V in 170 s, lighting up a 616
   globe light as well as 16 spot lights connected in parallel. Moreover,
   the reported TENG holds an unprecedented robustness in harvesting
   rotational kinetic energy. After a continuous rotation of more than 14.4
   million cycles, there is no observable electric output degradation.
   Given the superior output performance together with the unprecedented
   device robustness resulting from distinctive mechanism and novel
   structure design, the reported TENG renders an effective and sustainable
   technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting. This work is a
   solid step in the development toward TENG-based self-sustained
   electronics and systems.}},

Title = {{Near-field radiation between graphene-covered carbon nanotube arrays}},
Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{It has been shown that at small separation distances, thermal radiation
   between hyperbolic metamaterials is enhanced over blackbodies. This
   theoretical study considers near-field radiation when graphene is
   covered on the surfaces of two semi-infinite vertically aligned carbon
   nanotube (VACNT) arrays separated by a sub-micron vacuum gap. Doped
   graphene is found to improve photon tunneling in a broad hyperbolic
   frequency range, due to the interaction with graphene-graphene surface
   plasmon polaritons (SPP). In order to elucidate the SPP resonance
   between graphene on hyperbolic substrates, vacuum-suspended graphene
   sheets separated by similar gap distances are compared. Increasing the
   Fermi energy through doping shifts the spectral heat flux peak toward
   higher frequencies. Although the presence of graphene on VACNT does not
   offer huge near-field heat flux enhancement over uncovered VACNT, this
   study identifies conditions (i.e., gap distance and doping level) that
   best utilize graphene to augment near-field radiation. Through the
   investigation of spatial Poynting vectors, heavily doped graphene is
   found to increase penetration depths in hyperbolic modes and the result
   is sensitive to the frequency regime. This study may have an impact on
   designing carbon-based vacuum thermophotovoltaics and thermal switches.

Abstract = {{Lacking observation data for calibration constrains applications of
   hydrological models to estimate daily time series of streamflow. Recent
   improvements in remote sensing enable detection of river water-surface
   width from satellite observations, making possible the tracking of
   streamflow from space. In this study, a method calibrating hydrological
   models using river width derived from remote sensing is demonstrated
   through application to the ungauged Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar.
   Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) is selected as a
   tool for automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis. Of 50,000
   randomly generated parameter sets, 997 are identified as behavioral,
   based on comparing model simulation with satellite observations. The
   uncertainty band of streamflow simulation can span most of 10-year
   average monthly observed streamflow for moderate and high flow
   conditions. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency is 95.7\% for the simulated
   streamflow at the 50\% quantile. These results indicate that application
   to the target basin is generally successful. Beyond evaluating the
   method in a basin lacking streamflow data, difficulties and possible
   solutions for applications in the real world are addressed to promote
   future use of the proposed method in more ungauged basins. (C) 2015 The

   used to predict spatiotemporal temperature variations from a known power
   pattern, even for locations without temperature sensors. The accuracy of
   the proposed approach is verified through a thermal emulator designed in
   130-nm CMOS technology with on-chip digitally controllable power (heat)
   generators and temperature sensors. Using the proposed MIMO thermal
   filter, spatiotemporal temperature variations are accurately estimated
   with small error bound even at locations with no temperature sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical energy-storage devices have the potential to be clean
   and efficient, but their current cost and performance limit their use in
   numerous transportation and stationary applications. Many organic
   molecules are abundant, economical and electrochemically active; if
   selected correctly and rationally designed, these organic molecules
   offer a promising route to expand the applications of these
   energy-storage devices. In this study, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   are introduced within a functionalized few-walled carbon nanotube matrix
   to develop high-energy, high-power positive electrodes for
   pseudocapacitor applications. The reduction potential and capacity of
   various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are correlated with their
   interaction with the functionalized few-walled carbon nanotube matrix,
   chemical configuration and electronic structure. These findings provide
   rational design criteria for nanostructured organic electrodes. When
   combined with lithium negative electrodes, these nanostructured organic
   electrodes exhibit energy densities of similar to 350 Wh
   kg(electrode)(-1) at power densities of similar to 10 kW

Abstract = {{Pipeline natural gas is typically ``odorized{''} with similar to 10 ppm
   of sulfur-containing components, such as mercaptans, for ease Of
   detection. Such odorants can be removed before being burned in
   electricity generation gas turbines to prevent or limit turbine
   corrosion and increase turbine lifetime. Selective adsorption of these
   odorants onto solid materials is an attractive approach to address this
   problem because Of the ability to remove these trace levels of sulfur
   and to be operated at low temperatures, meaning that it is less
   energy-intensive than other traditional sulfur removal methods.
   Adsorbent material selection is important for this approach, and a
   material with high sulfur capacity, selectivity, and regenerability is
   desired for a practical implementation of such an adsorption system. In
   this study, several adsorbent materials are gravimetrically screened for
   t-butyl mercaptan (TBM) adsorption capacity and the best candidates,
   Cu-BTC, MIL-53(Al), and UiO-66(Zr), are compared to a benchmark
   material, zeolite NaY. These selected materials are evaluated with
   regard to their cyclic regenerability/stability and selectivity toward
   TBM over methane and other impurities. From the results Of this study,
   UiO-66(Zr) emerges as a promising candidate material for this
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Landing heavier payloads with pinpoint precision on the surface of Mars
   is a known challenge for future missions to Mars. Supersonic
   retropropulsion has been proposed as a means to deliver higher-mass
   payloads to the surface, traditionally with the sole intent of
   deceleration. By adding range control capability during the supersonic
   retropropulsion maneuver by means of thrust vectoring, it has been found
   that a substantial amount of propellant can be saved in a precision
   landing scenario when compared with traditional architectures.
   Decreasing the propellant mass necessary for the mission increases the
   amount of payload mass that can be brought to the surface. Propellant
   mass savings greater than 30\% are possible if thrust vectoring is
   unconstrained during the supersonic phase of flight. Propellant mass
   fraction is found to be sensitive to the divert direction and also the
   altitude and flight-path angle at ignition, favoring low altitudes and
   shallow flight-path angles. Decreased nozzle cant angles and aerodynamic
   drag preservation have also been found to reduce propellant usage.}},

Abstract = {{CuO microspheres are obtained from thermal oxidation of Cu2O
   microspheres. A facile approach directed by electrostatic self-assembly
   is used to fabricate graphene oxide wrapped CuO (CuO@GO). GO nanosheets
   directly used in batteries could reduce the preparation cost and
   pollution relative to reduced graphene oxide. As coating layers, GO
   could be electrochemically reduced to graphene insitu to obtain an
   additional 3D conductive network. The CuO@GO core-shell
   micro/nanocomposites exhibit significantly improved lithium storage
   capacity and cycling performance as compared to CuO microspheres or the
   physical mixture of CuO microspheres and GO nanosheets (CuO-GO-PM).
   Under a current density of 100mAg(-1), CuO@GO retains a high discharge
   capacity of approximately 590mAhg(-1) for up to 50cycles. After

Abstract = {{Increases in system loads and in levels of penetration of renewable
   energy, together with limited investment in transmission infrastructure,
   are fostering the need for a smarter and more dynamically controllable
   grid. Flexible ac transmission systems devices can be used to
   dynamically control the grid and more efficiently route power and thus
   mitigate these stresses, but such devices are either too complicated and
   expensive for implementation or incapable of independently controlling
   active and reactive powers. A controllable network transformer (CNT) has
   a fractionally rated direct ac/ac converter and was introduced as a
   simpler and more cost-effective solution to realize dynamic power
   control between two areas. The CNT utilizes the dual virtual quadrature
   source (DVQS) technique to change both the line voltage amplitude and
   phase angle, thus enabling a dynamic power control; however, the control
   variables defined in this technique have a cross-coupling effect between
   active and reactive powers. In this paper, the CNT operating ranges with
   and without considering line resistance are analyzed; then, a decoupled
   closed-loop controller is designed to achieve independent active and
   reactive power control based on a reference power control command. To
   address the possibility of power overshoot in a CNT with DVQS, a hybrid
   open-loop/closed-loop proportional-integral controller is also proposed.
   Simulations and experimental results are given to verify the controller
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the design, implementation, and phase-noise
   optimization of low-power interface IC for dual-frequency oscillators
   that utilize two high quality factor (Q) width-extensional bulk acoustic
   modes of the same AlN-on-silicon resonator. Two 0.5-mu m CMOS
   transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) have been designed, characterized, and
   interfaced with two dual-mode resonators operating at 35.5/105.7 MHz
   (first/third order modes) and 35.5/174.9 MHz (first/fifth order modes).
   One TIA uses open-loop regulated cascode (RGC) topology in the first
   stage to enable low power operation, whereas the second one uses an
   inverter with shunt-shunt feedback to deliver higher gain with lower
   phase noise. An on-chip switching network is incorporated into each TIA
   to change the oscillation frequency based on the different phase shift.
   The effect of TIA on the phase-noise performance of oscillators is
   studied and compared for both topologies. The measured phase noise of
   low-and high-frequency modes at 1 kHz offset from carrier are -114 and
   -108 dBc/Hz for the 35/105 MHz oscillator, and -108 and -105 dBc/Hz for

Abstract = {{Terahertz (0.06-10 THz) Band communication is envisioned as a key
   technology for satisfying the increasing demand for ultra-high-speed
   wireless links. In this paper, first, a unified multi-ray channel model
   in the THz Band is developed based on ray tracing techniques, which
   incorporates the propagation models for the line-of-sight, reflected,
   scattered, and diffracted paths. The developed theoretical model is
   validated with the experimental measurements (0.06-1 THz) from the
   literature. Then, using the developed propagation models, an in-depth
   analysis on the THz channel characteristics is carried out. In
   particular, the distance-varying and frequency-selective nature of the
   Terahertz channel is analyzed. Moreover, the coherence bandwidth and the
   significance of the delay spread are studied. Furthermore, the wideband
   channel capacity using flat and water-filling power allocation
   strategies is characterized. Additionally, the temporal broadening
   effects of the Terahertz channel are studied. Finally, distance-adaptive
   and multi-carrier transmissions are suggested to best benefit from the
   unique relationship between distance and bandwidth. The provided

Abstract = {{One of the main approaches for modeling fracture and crack propagation
   in solid materials is adaptive insertion of cohesive elements, in which
   line-like (2D) or surface-like (3D) elements are inserted into the
   finite element mesh to model the nucleation and propagation of failure
   surfaces. In this approach, however, cracks are forced to propagate
   along element boundaries, following paths that in general require more
   energy per unit crack extension (greater driving forces) than those
   followed in the original continuum. This, in turn, leads to erroneous
   solutions. We illustrate how the introduction of a discretization
   produces mesh-induced anisotropy and mesh-induced toughness for problems
   involving brittle fracture. Subsequently, we quantify those effects
   through polar plots of the path deviation ratio for commonly adopted
   meshes. Finally, we propose to reduce those effects through a new type
   of mesh, which we term conjugate-directions mesh.}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Future air transportation demand forecasts suggest that environmental
   concerns such as noise will be exacerbated beyond their current level.
   Although detailed airport noise modeling with tools such as the
   integrated noise model and the Federal Aviation Administration's
   Aviation Environmental Design Tool are available, these software require
   relatively long setup and run times due to the number of inputs
   available to the user and the general fidelity level of the models. A
   rapid, flexible, and more simplified method that reduces the input
   variables to a critical few and can provide results in minutes is
   desired to evaluate fleet-level metrics with respect to new technologies
   or forecasted changes in demand. Current lower-fidelity methods only
   calculate a change in contour area due to changes within the overall
   fleet composition. These methods cannot account for the shape of the
   contour. This paper presents a rapid airport noise computation model
   that leverages the fidelity of detailed models. By performing generic
   aircraft operations upfront, events can be rapidly recombined later to
   perform trades of various noise mitigating strategies. By moving the
   detailed noise modeling ``offline{''} through simplifying assumptions,
   the fidelity of detailed models can be channeled upstream in the
   decision-making process. The increased speed of the model enables
   multiple fleet-level analyses. Verification and validation results show
   agreement benchmarked against integrated noise model equivalents when
   model assumptions are obeyed. Comparison to detailed integrated noise
   model equivalents when model assumptions are violated introduces certain
   errors, but the model retains contour area accuracy, through the basic
   capture of contour shape.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{15-25}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This comprehensive review examines the efforts of previous researchers
   to develop concepts for propellant-collecting spacecraft, estimate the
   performance of these systems, and understand the physics involved.
   Rocket propulsion requires the spacecraft to expend two fundamental
   quantities: energy and propellant mass. A growing number of spacecraft
   collect the energy they need to execute propulsive maneuvers in-situ
   with solar panels. In contrast, every spacecraft using rocket propulsion
   has carried all of the propellant mass needed for the mission from the
   ground, which limits the range and mission capabilities. Numerous
   researchers have explored the concept of collecting propellant mass
   while in space. These concepts have varied in scale and complexity from
   chemical ramjets to fusion-driven interstellar vessels. Research into
   propellant-collecting concepts occurred in distinct eras. During the
   Cold War, concepts tended to be large, complex, and nuclear powered.
   After the Cold War, concepts transitioned to solar power sources and
   more effort has been devoted to detailed analysis of specific components
   of the propellant-collecting architecture. By detailing the major
   contributions and limitations of previous work, this review concisely
   presents the state-of-the-art and outlines five areas for continued
   research. These areas include air-compatible cathode technology,
   techniques to improve propellant utilization on atmospheric species,
   in-space compressor and liquefaction technology, improved hypersonic and
   hyperthermal free molecular flow inlet designs, and improved
   understanding of how design parameters affect system performance. (C)

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{It has been well demonstrated over the past few years that vibration
   energy harvesters with intentionally designed nonlinear stiffness
   components can be used for frequency bandwidth enhancement under
   harmonic excitation for sufficiently high vibration amplitudes. In order
   to overcome the need for high excitation intensities that are required
   to exploit nonlinear dynamic phenomena, we have developed an M-shaped
   piezoelectric energy harvester configuration that can exhibit a
   nonlinear frequency response under very low vibration levels. This
   configuration is made from a continuous bent spring steel with
   piezoelectric laminates and a proof mass but no magnetic components.
   Careful design of this nonlinear architecture that minimizes
   piezoelectric softening further enables the possibility of achieving the
   jump phenomenon in hardening at few milli-g base acceleration levels. In
   the present work, such a design is explored for both primary and
   secondary resonance excitations at different vibration levels and load
   resistance values. Following the primary resonance excitation case that
   offers a 660\% increase in the half-power bandwidth as compared to the
   linear system at a root-mean-square excitation level as low as 0.04g,
   secondary resonance behavior is investigated with a focus on 1:2 and 1:3
   superharmonic resonance neighborhoods. A multi-term harmonic balance
   formulation is employed for a computationally effective yet
   high-fidelity analysis of this high-quality-factor system with quadratic
   and cubic nonlinearities. In addition to primary resonance and secondary
   (superharmonic) resonance cases, multi-harmonic excitation is modeled
   and experimentally validated.}},

   is within 0.3\%. This paper then shows that a similar elongated
   non-cyclic hexagon shape, with proper orientation, is actually optimal
   for service regions on a rectilinear metric plane. Numerical experiments
   are conducted to verify the analytical findings and to draw further
   insights. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the interference on the molecular communication (MC)
   between a transmitter and receiver pair which are connected through a
   microfluidic channel containing fluid flow is investigated. The
   interference modeling and the capacity analysis is performed based on
   the microfluidic channel geometry, the flow velocity, and the distance.
   During the analysis, time-scale of biological oscillators is
   specifically targeted, which is in the range of several minutes to a few
   hours. The signal-to-interference and noise ratio is shown to be
   constant with respect to the location of the interfering transmitter.
   The capacity of the MC link between the designated transmitter and the
   corresponding receiver is shown to be upper bounded by 1 bit/per channel
   use when exposed to a single interfering transmitter. For the multiple,
   i.e., N, transmitters, the decay of pairwise MC capacity is also studied
   as a factor of N. Finally, placement of the two transmitter and receiver
   pairs on the opposite sides of the microfluidic channel is studied.
   Three different microfluidic interference channel configurations, i.e.,
   both-sided interference (microfluidic X channel), one-sided interference
   (microfluidic Z channel), and interference-free, are proposed based on
   the distance of the receiver from the interfering transmitter,
   microfluidic channel cross section, and the fluid flow velocity. For
   large-scale integration of chemical analysis systems on a microfluidic
   chip, the provided information-theoretic analysis and the capacity
   expressions for the MIC can be utilized to analyze the throughput of the
   chip, which can lead to improvement in efficiency and optimization of
   the design.}},

Abstract = {{Passive, heat actuated ejector pumps offer simple and energy-efficient
   options for a variety of end uses with no electrical input or moving
   parts. In an effort to obtain insights into ejector flow phenomena and
   to evaluate the effectiveness of commonly used computational and
   analytical tools in predicting these conditions, this study presents a
   set of shadowgraph images of flow inside a large-scale air ejector and
   compares them to both computational and first-principles-based
   analytical models of the same flow. The computational simulations used
   for comparison apply k-epsilon renormalization group (RNG) and k-omega
   shear stress transport (SST) turbulence models to two-dimensional (2D),
   locally refined rectangular meshes for ideal gas air flow. A
   complementary analytical model is constructed from first principles to
   approximate the ejector flow field. Results show that on-design ejector
   operation is predicted with reasonable accuracy, but accuracy with the
   same models is not adequate at off-design conditions. Exploration of
   local flow features shows that the k-omega SST model predicts the
   location of flow features, as well as global inlet mass flow rates, with
   greater accuracy. The first-principles model demonstrates a method for
   resolving the ejector flow field from relatively little visual data and
   shows the evolving importance of mixing, momentum, and heat exchange
   with the suction flow with distance from the motive nozzle exit. Such
   detailed global and local exploration of ejector flow helps guide the
   selection of appropriate turbulence models for future ejector design
   purposes, predicts locations of important flow phenomena, and allows for
   more efficient ejector design and operation.}},

Abstract = {{We report a three-step method to grow high-quality AlN heteroepitaxial
   layers on sapphire substrates at relatively low temperatures by
   metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) without the use of
   epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) or pulse atomic layer epitaxy (PALE)
   method. The three-layer AlN structure comprises a 15-nm thick buffer
   layer, a 50-nm thick intermediate layer, and a 3.4-mu m thick template
   layer grown at 930, 1130, and 1100 degrees C sequentially on the c-plane
   sapphire substrate. The resulting AlN layer had smooth surface with
   well-defined terraces and low root-mean square (RMS) roughnesses of 0.50
   and 0.07 nm for 20 x 20 and 1 x 1 mu m(2) atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   scans. Band-edge emission was observed at 208 nm by room temperature
   (RT) photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The total threading
   dislocation density was 2.5 x 10(9)/cm(2) as determined by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), which is comparable to those of some AlN
   layers recently grown at significantly higher temperatures. Growth
   evolution was studied and correlated to the TEM results. The residual
   impurity concentrations were comparable to those of AlN layers grown at
   higher temperatures, i.e., 1200-1600 degrees C. This study demonstrates
   the high quality AlN layers on sapphire substrates can be grown at
   achievable temperatures for most of the modern MOCVD systems. (C) 2015

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The rapid spreading of RGB-D cameras has led to wide applications of 3D
   videos in both academia and industry, such as 3D entertainment and 3D
   visual understanding. Under these circumstances, extensive research
   efforts have been dedicated to RGB-D camera-oriented topics. In these
   topics, quality promotion of depth videos with the temporal
   characteristic is emerging and important. Due to the limited exposure
   time of RGB-D cameras, object movement can easily lead to motion blurs
   in intensive images, which can further result in obvious artifacts
   (holes or fake boundaries) in the corresponding depth frames. With
   regard to this problem, we propose a depth error elimination method
   based on time series analysis to remove the artifacts in depth images.
   In this method, we first locate the regions with erroneous depths in
   intensive images by using motion blur detection based on a time series
   analysis model. This is based on the fact that the depth image is
   calculated by intensive color images that are captured synchronously by
   RGB-D cameras. Then, the artifacts, such as holes or fake boundaries,
   are fixed by a depth error elimination method. To evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on 250
   images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   locate the error regions correctly and eliminate these artifacts
   effectively. The quality of depth video can be improved significantly by
   using the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Many tools are being developed to assist designers in retrieving
   analogies. One critical question these designers face is how these
   analogues should be represented in order to minimize design fixation and
   maximize idea generation. To address this question, an experiment is
   presented that compares various representations' influence on creativity
   and design fixation. This experiment presents an effective example
   (analogue) as computer-aided design (CAD), sketch, or photograph
   representations. We found that all representations induced fixation, and
   the degree of fixation did not vary significantly. We also found that
   CAD representations encourage engineering designers to identify and copy
   the key effective features of the example. CAD and photo representations
   also produced a higher quality of design concepts. Results from this
   experiment offer insights into how these various representations may be
   used in examples during idea generation; CAD representations appear to
   offer the greatest advantages during the idea generation process. The
   results from this experiment also indicate that analogical databases of
   effective design examples should include CAD and photolike images of the
   analogue rather than sketches.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early 2000s, building information modeling (BIM) has been used
   through the entire project life cycle to facilitate effective project
   collaboration and integration of data to support project activities.
   Despite the successful applications of BIM in the design and
   construction stages, the use of BIM for preconstruction planning has not
   gained wide acceptance as in other project phases. The integration of
   BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the
   planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However,
   this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the
   geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web technology is used in this
   study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction
   project participants as well as BIM and geographic information systems
   (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we
   first translate building's elements and GIS data into a semantic web
   data format Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for
   construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial
   and temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and
   acquire the data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples,
   the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a digital polar Doherty power amplifier (PA) fully
   integrated in a 65 nm bulk CMOS process. It achieves + 27.3 dBm peak
   output power and 32.5\% peak PA drain efficiency at 3.82 GHz and 3.60
   GHz, respectively. The proposed digital Doherty PA architecture
   optimizes the cooperation of the main and auxiliary amplifiers and
   achieves superior back-off efficiency enhancement (a maximum 47.9\%
   improvement versus the corresponding Class-B operation). This digital
   intensive architecture also allows in-field PA reconfigurability which
   both provides robust PA operation against antenna mismatches and allows
   flexible trade-off optimization on PA efficiency and linearity.
   Transformer-based passives are employed as the Doherty input and output
   networks. The input 90 signal splitter is realized by a 6-port folded
   differential transformer structure. The active Doherty load modulation
   and power combining at the PA output are achieved by two transformers in
   a parallel configuration. These transformer-based passives ensure an
   ultra-compact PA design (2.1 mm) and broad bandwidth (24.9\% for 1 dB P
   bandwidth). Measurement with 1 MSym/s QPSK signal shows 3.5\% rms EVM
   with + 23.5 dBm average output power and 26.8\% PA drain efficiency.
   Measurement with 16-QAM signal exhibits the PA's flexibility on
   optimizing efficiency and linearity.}},

Abstract = {{Helicon plasma sources are capable of efficiently ionizing propellants
   and have been considered for application in electric propulsion. The
   literature suggests that the ion acceleration mechanism is a
   current-free double layer. Previous work shows that single-stage helicon
   thrusters can produce thrust in the range of 1-6 mN, but it is unknown
   whether the thrust contribution is due to direct ion acceleration versus
   thermal expansion. The ion energy and current density profiles in the
   plume of a helicon plasma source are measured across a range of
   operating conditions: 343-600 W RF power at 13.56 MHz, 50-350 G, and
   1.5-mg/s Ar at a pressure of 1.6 x 10(-5) torr-Ar. The plasma potential,
   electron temperature, and ion number density are also measured inside
   the discharge chamber and in the plume up to 60 cm downstream of the
   exit plane and 45-cm radially outward from the device axis. Ions are
   found to have energies in the range of 20-40 V, with total beam currents
   in the range of 7-47 mA. The plume has an average divergence half angle
   of 82 degrees, either evenly distributed across all angles or focused at
   large angles to the centerline. From these measurements, it is found
   that the estimated thrust due to ion acceleration is far less than what
   has been directly measured on the same device in previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary definitions of leadership advance a view of the phenomenon
   as relational, situated in specific social contexts, involving patterned
   emergent processes, and encompassing both formal and informal influence.
   Paralleling these views is a growing interest in leveraging social
   network approaches to study leadership. Social network approaches
   provide a set of theories and methods with which to articulate and
   investigate, with greater precision and rigor, the wide variety of
   relational perspectives implied by contemporary leadership theories. Our
   goal is to advance this domain through an integrative conceptual review.
   We begin by answering the question of why-Why adopt a network approach
   to study leadership? Then, we offer a framework for organizing prior
   research. Our review reveals 3 areas of research, which we term: (a)
   leadership in networks, (b) leadership as networks, and (c) leadership
   in and as networks. By clarifying the conceptual underpinnings, key
   findings, and themes within each area, this review serves as a
   foundation for future inquiry that capitalizes on, and programmatically
   builds upon, the insights of prior work. Our final contribution is to
   advance an agenda for future research that harnesses the confluent ideas
   at the intersection of leadership in and as networks. Leadership in and
   as networks represents a paradigm shift in leadership research-from an
   emphasis on the static traits and behaviors of formal leaders whose
   actions are contingent upon situational constraints, toward an emphasis
   on the complex and patterned relational processes that interact with the
   embedding social context to jointly constitute leadership emergence and
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the pretreatment conditions and fouling behavior is a
   prerequisite to the effective implementation of the coagulation-ceramic
   membrane hybrid processes for surface water treatment. Little is known
   about the performance of the hybrid processes; previous studies have
   dealt mainly with polymeric membranes. A coagulation-ceramic
   microfiltration system performed better in the treatment of select U.S.
   surface waters than a polymeric counterpart in terms of relative
   pressure in a constant-flux mode and normalized flux in a
   constant-pressure mode. The operating pressure for the filtration of
   river waters with the ceramic membrane system was 2.1-2.8 times the
   pressure for pure water, while it was 3.7-5.6 times with the polymeric
   membrane system, and the normalized flux in a constant pressure mode was
   higher with the ceramic membrane system (0.54 and 0.44 for ceramic and
   polymeric systems, respectively). Less severe fouling and higher
   cleaning efficiency observed in the ceramic hybrid system suggest that
   the coagulation would be a robust pretreatment option for the
   application of ceramic filtration for the surface water treatment.}},

Title = {{Critical Assessment of an Enhanced Traffic Sign Detection Method Using
   Mobile LiDAR and INS Technologies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Traffic signs are important roadway assets that provide critical
   guidance, including regulations and safety-related information, to road
   users. Traffic signs need to be inventoried by transportation agencies.
   However, the traditional manual methods carried out in the field are
   dangerous, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. There is a need to
   develop alternative methods to cost-effectively inventory traffic signs.
   The research reported in this paper, sponsored by the U.S. DOT Research
   and Innovative Technology Administration Program, is to critically
   assess an alternative traffic sign inventory method using mobile light
   detection and ranging (LiDAR), and inertial navigation system (INS),
   technologies. The contribution of this paper is three-fold, as follows:
   (1)an alternative traffic sign inventory method is proposed using mobile
   LiDAR and INS technologies, (2)a key LiDAR parameter calibration
   procedure (including a sensitivity study of the key parameters) is
   proposed to achieve a desirable traffic sign detection rate, and (3)the
   reliability and productivity of the proposed method is critically
   assessed (by quantitatively measuring the detection rate and processing
   time of the proposed method). Actual data, collected on an interstate
   highway (I-95) and a local urban road (37th Street in Savannah,
   Georgia), were used to critically assess the performance. Results show
   that the proposed method can correctly detect 94.0 and 91.4\% of the
   traffic signs on interstate highways and local urban roads with less
   than seven false-positive cases. Results also show that when compared to
   the in-field manual survey test conducted by Georgia DOT, the proposed
   method can potentially reduce the processing time for sign inventory by
   approximately 76\%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is
   promising for establishing a cost-effective traffic sign inventory
   method for transportation agencies. Future research directions are also
   recommended.}},

Title = {{Spherical nanoindentation stress-strain curves}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING R-REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{1-36}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Although indentation experiments have long been used to measure the
   hardness and Young's modulus, the utility of this technique in analyzing
   the complete elastic-plastic response of materials under contact loading
   has only been realized in the past few years - mostly due to recent
   advances in testing equipment and analysis protocols. This paper
   provides a timely review of the recent progress made in this respect in
   extracting meaningful indentation stress-strain curves from the raw
   datasets measured in instrumented spherical nanoindentation experiments.
   These indentation stress-strain curves have produced highly reliable
   estimates of the indentation modulus and the indentation yield strength
   in the sample, as well as certain aspects of their post-yield behavior,
   and have been critically validated through numerical simulations using
   finite element models as well as direct in situ scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) measurements on micro-pillars. Much of this recent
   progress was made possible through the introduction of a new measure of
   indentation strain and the development of new protocols to locate the
   effective zero-point of initial contact between the indenter and the
   sample in the measured datasets. This has led to an important key
   advance in this field where it is now possible to reliably identify and
   analyze the initial loading segment in the indentation experiments.
   Major advances have also been made in correlating the local mechanical
   response measured in nanoindentation with the local measurements of
   structure at the indentation site using complementary techniques. For
   example, it has been shown that the combined use of Orientation Imaging
   Microscopy (OIM, using Electron BackScattered Diffraction (EBSD)) and
   nanoindentation on polycrystalline metallic samples can yield important
   information on the orientation dependence of indentation yield stress,
   which can in turn be used to estimate percentage increase in the local
   slip resistance in deformed samples. The same methods have been used
   successfully to probe the intrinsic role of grain boundaries in the
   overall mechanical deformation of the sample. More recently, these
   protocols have been extended to characterize local mechanical property
   changes in the damaged layers in ion-irradiated metals. Similarly, the
   combined use of Raman spectroscopy and nanoindentation on samples of
   mouse bone has revealed tissue-level correlations between the mineral
   content at the indentation site and the associated local mechanical
   properties. The new protocols have also provided several new insights
   into the buckling response in dense carbon nanotube (CNT) brushes. These
   and other recent successful applications of nanoindentation are expected
   to provide the critically needed information for the maturation of
   physics-based multiscale models for the mechanical behavior of most
   advanced materials. In this paper, we review these latest developments
   and identify the future challenges that lie ahead. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel technique to simultaneously compensate dispersion-induced power
   fading for multi-service radio-overfiber (RoF) links is proposed. At the
   central office (CO), a phase-coherent orthogonal lightwave generator
   (POLG) consisting of a polarization rotator (PR) and a single-driver
   Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is used. By adjusting a polarization
   controller (PC) in the base station (BS), the phase difference between
   the orthogonal polarization carrier and two sidebands can be controlled,
   and the frequency response can be flexibly shifted for individual radio
   frequency (RF) service. We experimentally shift the destructive
   interference to the constructive interference at various frequencies for
   25 km and 30 km fiber links. The performances of two services carrying 1
   Gb/s on-off keying (OOK) data at 9 GHz and 16.6 GHz over a 30 km fiber
   in the proposed system show receiver sensitivity improvement of similar
   to 12 dB at the bit error rate (BER) of 10(-3) compared with the
   conventional double sideband (DSB) modulation case. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{T cells genetically modified to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen
   receptor (CAR) for the investigational treatment of B-cell malignancies
   comprise a heterogeneous population, and their ability to persist and
   participate in serial killing of tumor cells is a predictor of
   therapeutic success. We implemented Timelapse Imaging Microscopy in
   Nanowell Grids (TIMING) to provide direct evidence that CD4(+)CAR(+) T
   cells (CAR4 cells) can engage in multikilling via simultaneous
   conjugation to multiple tumor cells. Comparisons of the CAR4 cells and
   CD8(+)CAR(+) T cells (CAR8 cells) demonstrate that, although CAR4 cells
   can participate in killing and multikilling, they do so at slower rates,
   likely due to the lower granzyme B content. Significantly, in both sets
   of T cells, a minor subpopulation of individual T cells identified by
   their highmotility demonstrated efficient killing of single tumor cells.
   A comparison of the multikiller and single-killer CAR(+) T cells
   revealed that the propensity and kinetics of T-cell apoptosis were
   modulated by the number of functional conjugations. T cells underwent
   rapid apoptosis, and at higher frequencies, when conjugated to single
   tumor cells in isolation, and this effect was more pronounced on CAR8
   cells. Our results suggest that the ability of CAR(+) T cells to
   participate in multikilling should be evaluated in the context of their
   ability to resist activation-induced cell death. We anticipate that
   TIMING may be used to rapidly determine the potency of T-cell
   populations and may facilitate the design and manufacture of
   next-generation CAR(+) T cells with improved efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Progress of development is commonly reconstructed from imaging snapshots
   of chemical or mechanical processes in fixed tissues. As a first step in
   these reconstructions, snapshots must be spatially registered and
   ordered in time. Currently, image registration and ordering are often
   done manually, requiring a significant amount of expertise with a
   specific system. However, as the sizes of imaging data sets grow, these
   tasks become increasingly difficult, especially when the images are
   noisy and the developmental changes being examined are subtle. To
   address these challenges, we present an automated approach to
   simultaneously register and temporally order imaging data sets. The
   approach is based on vector diffusion maps, a manifold learning
   technique that does not require a priori knowledge of image features or
   a parametric model of the developmental dynamics. We illustrate this
   approach by registering and ordering data from imaging studies of
   pattern formation and morphogenesis in three model systems. We also
   provide software to aid in the application of our methodology to other
   experimental data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Power router technology is maturing to the point of becoming a
   cost-effective enabler of increased transmission asset utilization.
   Power routers can enable a desirable increase in control of power
   systems, especially as infrastructure ages and degrades. This paper
   presents a formal extension to the traditional security-constrained
   optimal power flow (SCOPF) algorithm, named flexible
   security-constrained optimal power flow (FSCOPF), which utilizes power
   router control in the post-contingency timeframe. The operational
   improvement is enabled by the fast-response capability of FACTS-based
   power routers to change setpoints in response to power system
   contingencies. The FSCOPF algorithm, developed in this paper, allows for
   power routers to be used as a real-time dispatchable resource. We show
   that further power system savings are achieved when compared to the
   traditional SCOPF.}},

   current transmission systems. One of the main challenges in the control
   of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents while the
   capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a
   control strategy for the MMC using finite control set model predictive
   control (FCS-MPC). A bilinear mathematical model of the MMC is derived
   and discretized to predict the states of the MMC one step ahead. Within
   each switching cycle, the best switching state of the MMC is selected
   based on evaluation and minimization of a defined cost function. The
   defined cost function is aimed at the elimination of the MMC circulating
   currents, regulating the arm voltages, and controlling the ac-side
   currents. To reduce the calculation burden of the MPC, the submodule
   (SM) capacitor voltage balancing controller based on the conventional
   sorting method is combined with the proposed FCS-MPC strategy. The
   proposed FCS-MPC strategy determines the number of inserted/bypassed SMs
   within each arm of the MMC while the sorting algorithm is used to keep
   the SM capacitor voltages balanced. Using this strategy, only the
   summation of SM capacitor voltages of each arm is required for control
   purposes, which simplifies the communication among the SMs and the
   central controller. This paper also introduces a modified switching
   strategy, which not only reduces the calculation burden of the FCS-MPC
   strategy even more, but also simplifies the SM capacitor voltage
   balancing algorithm. In addition, this strategy reduces the SM switching
   frequency and power losses by avoiding the unnecessary switching
   transitions. The performance of the proposed strategies for a 20-level
   MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Weak acids are known to enhance the activity of amines in aldol
   condensation reactions on silica-based catalysts. The effects of acid
   strength and arrangement of the promoting site with respect to a
   secondary amine have been investigated in the aldol condensation of
   4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone. Changing the substituent of this
   secondary amine from a methyl to an ethyl group decreases the activity.
   An intramolecular OH function provided by a primary alcohol incorporated
   on the beta-carbon of the amine substituent exhibits a similar
   cooperativity as an intermolecular OH function provided by neighboring
   surface silanols. A maximum activity was achieved when the secondary
   amine with the same primary alcohol-containing substituent was
   surrounded by surface silanols, indicating the potential advantage of
   simultaneously activating both reactants by the formation of a hydrogen
   bond in contrast to the consecutive activation when there is only one
   promoting site in the vicinity of the amine. Changing the alcohol to
   stronger acids resulted in a reduced cooperativity with increasing acid
   strength. After removing the silanols from the surface, the activity of
   the catalysts which exhibit an intramolecular cooperativity retained
   about 68-83\% of their activities while the activity of the conventional
   secondary amine was reduced by a factor of four compared to its
   intermolecularly cooperative counterpart. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Water is a requirement for life as we know it(1). Indirect evidence of
   transient liquid water has been observed from orbiter on equatorial
   Mars(2), in contrast with expectations from large-scale climate models.
   The presence of perchlorate salts, which have been detected at Gale
   crater on equatorial Mars by the Curiosity rover(3,4), lowers the
   freezing temperature of water(5). Moreover, perchlorates can form stable
   hydrated compounds and liquid solutions by absorbing atmospheric water
   vapour through deliquescence(6,7). Here we analyse relative humidity,
   air temperature and ground temperature data from the Curiosity rover at
   Gale crater and find that the observations support the formation of
   night-time transient liquid brines in the uppermost 5 cm of the
   subsurface that then evaporate after sunrise. We also find that changes
   in the hydration state of salts within the uppermost 15 cm of the
   subsurface, as measured by Curiosity, are consistent with an active
   exchange of water at the atmosphere-soil interface. However, the water
   activity and temperature are probably too low to support terrestrial
   organisms(8). Perchlorates are widespread on the surface of Mars(9) and
   we expect that liquid brines are abundant beyond equatorial regions
   where atmospheric humidity is higher and temperatures are lower.}},

   detected primarily in foci in the small bowel, select lymphoid areas and
   the male reproductive tract, as confirmed by quantitative reverse

Abstract = {{Objective-Focal adhesions (FAs) link the cytoskeleton to the
   extracellular matrix and as such play important roles in growth,
   migration, and contractile properties of vascular smooth muscle cells.
   Recently, it has been shown that downregulation of Nox4, a transforming
   growth factor (TGF) beta-inducible, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-producing
   enzyme, affects the number of FAs. However, the effectors downstream of
   Nox4 that mediate FA regulation are unknown. The FA resident protein
   H2O2 -inducible clone (Hic)-5 is H2O2 and TGF beta inducible, and a
   binding partner of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 27. The objective of
   this study was to elucidate the mechanism, by which Hic-5 and Hsp27
   participate in TGF beta-induced, Nox4-mediated vascular smooth muscle
   cell adhesion and migration.
   Approach and Results-Through a combination of molecular biology and
   biochemistry techniques, we found that TGF beta, by a Nox4-dependent
   mechanism, induces the expression and interaction of Hic-5 and Hsp27,
   which is essential for Hic-5 localization to FAs. Importantly, we found
   that Hic-5 expression is required for the TGF beta-mediated increase in
   FA number, adhesive forces and migration. Mechanistically, Nox4
   downregulation impedes Smad (small body size and mothers against
   decapentaplegic) signaling by TGF beta, and Hsp27 and Hic-5 upregulation
   by TGF beta is blocked in small body size and mothers against
   decapentaplegic 4-deficient cells.
   Conclusions-Hic-5 and Hsp27 are effectors of Nox4 required for TGF
   beta-stimulated FA formation, adhesion strength and migration in
   vascular smooth muscle cell.}},

   receptor model using organic tracers was used to estimate source
   contributions to PM2.5. Concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols were on
   average 23 +/- 16 mu g/m(3) in Agra and 33 +/- 21 mu g/m(3) in Kanpur
   during the winter and summer periods, and had a strong seasonal trend
   with highest levels in winter (December-February) and then decreasing to
   summer (March-May). Five primary sources were identified. In Agra,
   biomass burning was the major source of OC in the winter months with
   decreasing relative and absolute concentrations in summer. In Kanpur,
   biomass burning was also the most important primary source of OC, but
   was about half the concentration found in Agra. Mobile source
   contributions to OC were on average 25 +/- 9\% and 25 +/- 22\% in Agra
   and Kanpur, respectively, with similar absolute concentrations of 2.5
   +/- 1.9 mu g/m(3) in most months. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was
   estimated from non-biomass burning WSOC and the unapportioned OC, with
   each method indicating SOA as a major source of OC in the winter in both
   cities, apportioning 25\% of OC in Agra and 65\% in Kanpur. SOA in
   Kanpur in December was four times higher than in Agra. Overall, results
   suggest differences in aerosol chemical composition and sources at these
   two sites across the Indo-Gangetic plain with biomass burning making up
   a larger fraction of the particulate OC in Agra, and SOA being a more
   important contributor to OC mass in Kanpur.}},

Abstract = {{The Udwadia-Kalaba equation is a simple, aesthetic, and
   thought-provoking description of the world at a very fundamental level.
   It is about the way systems move. In this paper, we creatively apply the
   Udwadia-Kalaba approach to study heavenly bodies' movements (especially
   on Kepler's law and the inverse square law of gravitation). In an
   alternative way, we show that a heavenly body's motion orbit can be an
   ellipse, a circle, a hyperbola, or a parabola and show the conservation
   of angular momentum. Furthermore, by applying the Udwadia-Kalaba
   approach, we use the constraint of motion orbit (ellipse, circle,
   hyperbola, or parabola) and the conservation of angular momentum
   constraint (or energy conservation constraint) and easily verify that
   any heavenly body's motion complies with the inverse square law of
   gravitation. That is, we study Kepler's law and Newton's inverse square
   law in an analytical way, which makes the dynamicist more clear about
   the way heavenly bodies move and also makes the celestial mechanician
   more clear about the analytical mechanics (the Udwadia-Kalaba approach).
   Furthermore, for the students of dynamics and celestial physics, a
   different unique perspective is provided for them to study. At the end,
   we present the detailed process of applying the Udwadia-Kalaba approach
   to two imaginary cases to show its simplicity and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The food environment has been shown to be a factor affecting the obesity
   rate. We studied the association of density of food retailer type with
   obesity rate in U.S. adults in local regions controlling for

   results of this association to estimate the impact of the addition of a
   new Food retailer type in a geographic region. Obesity rate increased in
   supercenters (0.25-028\%) and convenience stores (0.05\%) and decreased
   in grocery stores (0.08\%) and specialized food stores (0.27-0.36\%).
   The marginal measures estimated in this work could be useful in

Abstract = {{Recent advances have led to renewed interest in ballistocardiography
   (BCG), a noninvasive measure of the small movements of the body due to
   cardiovascular events. A broad range of platforms have been developed
   and verified for BCG measurement including beds, chairs, and weighing
   scales: while the body is coupled to such a platform, the cardiogenic
   movements are measured. Wearable BCG, measured with an accelerometer
   affixed to the body, may enable continuous, or more regular, monitoring
   during the day; however, the signals from such wearable BCGs represent
   local or distal accelerations of skin and tissue rather than the whole
   body. In this paper, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the BCG
   measured with a weighing scale (WS BCG) from a wearable sensor via a
   training step to remove these local effects. Preliminary validation of
   this method was performed with 15 subjects: the wearable sensor was
   placed at three locations on the surface of the body while WS BCG
   measurements were recorded simultaneously. A regularized system
   identification approach was used to reconstruct the WS BCG from the
   wearable BCG. Preliminary results suggest that the relationship between
   local and central disturbances is highly dependent on both the
   individual and the location where the accelerometer is placed on the
   body and that these differences can be resolved via calibration to
   accurately measure changes in cardiac output and contractility from a
   wearable sensor. Such measurements could be highly effective, for
   example, for improved monitoring of heart failure patients at home.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor recurrence following surgery is a common and unresolved medical
   problem of great importance since surgery is the most widely used
   treatment for solid-mass tumors worldwide. A contributing factor to
   tumor recurrence is the presence of residual tumor remaining at or near
   the surgical site following surgery. Goal: The primary objective of this
   study was to develop and evaluate an image-guided surgery system based
   on a near-infrared, handheld excitation source and spectrograph in
   combination with a widefield video imaging system. Methods: This system
   was designed to detect the fluorescence of near-infrared contrast agents
   and, in particular, indocyanine green (ICG). The imaging system was
   evaluated for its optical performance and ability to detect the presence
   of ICG in tumors in an ectopic murine tumor model as well as in
   spontaneous tumors arising in canines. Results: In both settings, an
   intravenous ICG infusion provided tumor contrast. In both the murine
   models and surgical specimens from canines, ICG preferentially
   accumulated in tumor tissue compared to surrounding normal tissue. The
   resulting contrast was sufficient to distinguish neoplasia from normal
   tissue; in the canine surgical specimens, the contrast was sufficient to
   permit identification of neoplasia on the marginal surface of the
   specimen. Conclusion: These results demonstrate a unique concept in
   image-guided surgery by combining local excitation and spectroscopy with
   widefield imaging. Significance: The ability to readily detect ICG in
   canines with spontaneous tumors in a clinical setting exemplifies the
   potential for further clinical translation; the promising results of
   detecting neoplasia on the marginal specimen surface underscore the
   clinical utility.}},

   simulations are used to provide further insight into the differences
   between RF and dc operation and stress conditions. The ability to swing
   the terminals of a SiGe HBT beyond the static I-V conditions coincident
   with catastrophic breakdown is explained. Furthermore, hot-carrier
   effects are also compared from multiple perspectives, with supporting
   data taken from fully realized X-band and C-band cascode driver
   amplifiers. This analysis provides microwave circuit designers with the
   framework necessary to better understand the full-voltage-swing

Abstract = {{Based on realistic circuit-and system-level simulations, graphene
   interconnects are analyzed in terms of multiple material properties,
   such as the mean free path (MFP), the contact resistance, and the edge
   roughness. The bench-marking results indicate that the advantage of
   using graphene interconnects occurs only under certain circumstances.
   The device-level parameters, including the supply and threshold
   voltages, and the circuit-level parameters, including the wire length
   and width, have large impacts on both the delay and energy-delay product
   (EDP). At the circuit level, one representative circuit, a 32-bit adder,
   is investigated, where up to 40\% and 70\% improvements in delay and EDP
   are observed. At the system-level analysis, an ARM Cortex-M0 processor
   is synthesized, and placement and routing are performed. After replacing
   copper interconnects with multilayer graphene interconnects, up to 15\%
   and 22\% performance improvements in clock frequency and EDP have been
   observed. It is also demonstrated that the benefits of using graphene
   for the ARM core processor are strongly dependent on the quality of the
   graphene, such as the MFP and the edge roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification and respiratory ammonification are two competing,
   energy-conserving NO3-/NO2- reduction pathways that have major
   biogeochemical consequences for N retention, plant growth and climate.
   Batch and continuous culture experiments using Shewanella loihica strain
   PV-4, a bacterium possessing both the denitrification and respiratory
   ammonification pathways, revealed factors that determine NO3-/NO2- fate.
   Denitrification dominated at low carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios (that
   is, electron donor-limiting growth conditions), whereas ammonium was the
   predominant product at high C/N ratios (that is, electron
   acceptor-limiting growth conditions). pH and temperature also affected
   NO3-/NO2- fate, and incubation above pH 7.0 and temperatures of 30
   degrees C favored ammonium formation. Reverse-transcriptase real-time
   quantitative PCR analyses correlated the phenotypic observations with
   nirK and nosZ transcript abundances that decreased up to 1600-fold and
   27-fold, respectively, under conditions favoring respiratory
   ammonification. Of the two nrfA genes encoded on the strain PV-4 genome,
   nrfA(0844) transcription decreased only when the chemostat reactor
   received medium with the lowest C/N ratio of 1.5, whereas nrfA(0505)
   transcription occurred at low levels (<= 3.4 x 10(-2) transcripts per
   cell) under all growth conditions. At intermediate C/N ratios,
   denitrification and respiratory ammonification occurred concomitantly,
   and both nrfA(0844) (5.5 transcripts per cell) and nirK (0.88
   transcripts per cell) were transcribed. Recent findings suggest that
   organisms with both the denitrification and respiratory ammonification
   pathways are not uncommon in soil and sediment ecosystems, and strain
   PV-4 offers a tractable experimental system to explore regulation of
   dissimilatory NO3-/NO2- reduction pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli spans a genetic continuum from enteric strains to
   several phylogenetically distinct, atypical lineages that are rare in
   humans, but more common in extra-intestinal environments. To investigate
   the link between gene regulation, phylogeny and diversification in this
   species, we analyzed global gene expression profiles of four strains
   representing distinct evolutionary lineages, including a well-studied
   laboratory strain, a typical commensal (enteric) strain and two
   environmental strains. RNA-Seq was employed to compare the whole
   transcriptomes of strains grown under batch, chemostat and starvation
   conditions. Highly differentially expressed genes showed a significantly
   lower nucleotide sequence identity compared with other genes, indicating
   that gene regulation and coding sequence conservation are directly
   connected. Overall, distances between the strains based on gene
   expression profiles were largely dependent on the culture condition and
   did not reflect phylogenetic relatedness. Expression differences of
   commonly shared genes (all four strains) and Escherichia coli core genes
   were consistently smaller between strains characterized by more similar
   primary habitats. For instance, environmental strains exhibited
   increased expression of stress defense genes under carbon-limited growth
   and entered a more pronounced survival-like phenotype during starvation
   compared with other strains, which stayed more alert for substrate
   scavenging and catabolism during no-growth conditions. Since those
   environmental strains show similar genetic distance to each other and to
   the other two strains, these findings cannot be simply attributed to
   genetic relatedness but suggest physiological adaptations. Our study
   provides new insights into ecologically relevant gene-expression and
   underscores the role of (differential) gene regulation for the
   diversification of the model bacterial species.}},

Abstract = {{Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) is a highly migratory,
   commercially valuable species potentially vulnerable to acoustic noise
   generated from human activities which could impact behavior and fitness.
   Although significant efforts have been made to understand hearing
   abilities of fishes, the large size and need to continuously swim for
   respiration have hindered investigations with tuna and other large
   pelagic species. In this study, Pacific bluefin tuna were trained to
   respond to a pure tone sound stimulus ranging 325-800 Hz and their
   hearing abilities quantified using a staircase psychophysical technique.
   Hearing was most sensitive from 400 to 500 Hz in terms of particle
   motion (radial acceleration -88 dB re 1 m s(-2); vertical acceleration
   -86 dB re 1 m s(-2)) and sound pressure (83 dB re 1 mu Pa). Compared to
   yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis),
   Pacific bluefin tuna has a similar bandwidth of hearing and best
   frequency, but greater sensitivity overall. Careful calibration of the
   sound stimulus and experimental tank environment, as well as the
   adoption of behavioral methodology, demonstrates an experimental
   approach highly effective for the study of large fish species in the
   laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an experimental investigation of the application of
   a periodic array of shunted piezoelectric patches with negative
   capacitance for the broadband control of waves propagating on a flexible
   plate. A 15 x 5 array of piezoelectric patches is bonded onto the top
   surface of a freely supported rectangular plate. The patch array is
   intended to serve as an active interface between two regions of the
   plate, where one region has an input disturbance force and the other
   does not. Each patch is shunted through a single circuit, reproducing a
   resistance in series with a negative capacitance. The magnitude of the
   reactive part of the negative shunting impedance is tuned close to the
   intrinsic capacitance of the piezoelectric patch. The real part is
   adjusted for either light damping so as to induce a reactive
   (reflective) response, or with heavy damping to induce greater
   absorption. The experimental responses of the system equipped with this
   active interface display a strong attenuation or reflection of
   vibrations, depending on the shunt resistance, over a large frequency
   range, including the mid-frequency regime. In an effort to control
   vibroacoustic phenomena, this study represents the first attempt to
   implement an integrated smart metacomposite active interface on a plate

Title = {{Improving Students' Functional Modeling Skills: A Modeling Approach and
   a Scoring Rubric}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An engineering design curriculum that introduces functional modeling
   methods is believed to enhance the ability to abstract complex systems,
   assist during the concept generation phase of design, and reduce design
   fixation. To that end, a variety of techniques for considering function
   during design have been proposed in the literature, yet there are a lack
   of validated approaches for teaching students to generate functional
   models and no reliable method for the assessment of functional models.
   This paper presents a study investigating students' ability to generate
   functional models during a homework assignment; the study includes three
   different treatment conditions: (1) students who receive only a lecture
   on functional modeling, (2) students who receive a lecture on functional
   modeling as well as a step-by-step example, and (3) students who receive
   a lecture, a step-by-step example, and an algorithmic approach with
   grammar rules. The experiment was conducted in a cornerstone,
   undergraduate engineering design course, and consequently, was the
   students' first exposure to functional modeling. To assess student
   generated functional models across all three conditions, an 18 question
   functional model scoring rubric was developed based on flow-based
   functional modeling standards. Use of the rubric to assess the student
   generated functional models resulted in high inter-rater agreement for
   total score. Results show that students receiving the step-by-step
   example perform as well as students receiving the step-by-step example
   and an algorithmic approach with grammar rules; both groups perform
   better than the lecture-only group.}},

Abstract = {{The continued and expanded use of composite materials in aerospace
   applications necessitates structural health monitoring and/or
   nondestructive evaluation techniques that can provide quantitative and
   detailed damage information for layered plate-like components (such as
   composite laminates). Guided wavefield methods are at the basis of a
   number of promising techniques for the detection and the
   characterization of damage in plate-like structures. Among the
   processing techniques that have been proposed for guided wavefield
   analysis, the estimation of instantaneous and local wavenumbers can lead
   to effective metrics that quantify the size and the depth of
   delaminations in composite laminates. This article reports the
   application of both instantaneous and local wavenumber damage
   quantification techniques to guided wavefield data for delaminated
   composite laminates. The techniques are applied to experimental data for
   a simple single delamination case and to simulated data for a more
   complex multi-ply delamination case. The two techniques are compared in
   terms of accuracy in damage characterization and computational demand.
   The proposed methodologies can be considered as steps toward a hybrid
   structural health monitoring/nondestructive evaluation approach for
   damage assessment in composites.}},

Abstract = {{The transient blast response of a sandwich panel that consists of a
   compressible core with in-plane rigidity using the extended high-order
   sandwich panel theory is presented and compared with elasticity
   closed-form solutions. The mathematical formulation of the extended
   high-order sandwich panel theory for the transient dynamic response of
   sandwich plates is described along with a numerical investigation. The
   extended high-order sandwich panel theory formulation takes into account
   the shear resistance of the core and its compressibility, which is
   envisaged through nonidentical displacements of the upper and the lower
   facesheets and its in-plane rigidity. The equations of motion and the
   appropriate boundary conditions are derived using the Hamilton's
   principle. A numerical investigation is conducted on a simply supported
   sandwich panel, and its results are compared with a benchmark elasticity
   closed-form solution. The results include deformed shapes at the first
   millisecond at various time steps; displacements of the various
   constituents, as well as various stress resultants in the facesheets;
   and stress distributions within the core and at its interfaces with the
   facesheets. The extended high-order sandwich panel theory and the
   elasticity benchmark results correlate very well. Finally, a summary is
   presented and conclusions are drawn.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible strain-gauge sensors are an essential component in electronic
   devices, and pressure sensing is also an important function. Here, we
   report an ultrastable and highly sensitive sensor based on covalently
   bonded nitrogen-doped carbon-nanotube-supported Ag (N-CNT/Ag) hybrid
   sponges with hierarchical binary-network architectures via a
   unidirectional freezing technique. The covalent bonding utilizing
   hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) as bridges endows the sponges with
   structural stability under compression, oscillation, and bending modes.
   Moreover, a large number of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) decorated using HPG
   as templates could also enable the N-CNTs/Ag sponges to possess linear
   current-voltage behavior. Furthermore, the Ag NPs on the compartmental
   films can be considered as interlocked nanodomes, which not only enhance
   compression stress but also generate huge variation of resistance
   through variation of contact area under mechanical deformation. These
   novel designs featuring interlocked geometry and covalent bonding allow
   the hybrid sponges to act as strain-gauge sensors with high gauge factor
   (1.4) and excellent stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: We attempted to understand the latent structure underlying
   the systems pilots use to operate in situations involving
   human-automation interaction (HAI).
   Background: HAI is an important characteristic of many modern work
   situations. Of course, the cognitive subsystems are not immediately
   apparent by observing a functioning system, but correlations between
   variables may reveal important relations.
   Method: The current report examined pilot judgments of 11 HAI dimensions
   (e.g., Workload, Task Management, Stress/Nervousness, Monitoring
   Automation, and Cross-Checking Automation) across 48 scenarios that
   required airline pilots to interact with automation on the flight deck.
   Results: We found three major clusters of the dimensions identifying
   subsystems on the flight deck: a workload subsystem, a management
   subsystem, and an awareness subsystem.
   Discussion: Relationships characterized by simple correlations cohered
   in ways that suggested underlying subsystems consistent with those that
   had previously been theorized.
   Application: Understanding the relationship among dimensions affecting
   HAI is an important aspect in determining how a new piece of automation
   designed to affect one dimension will affect other dimensions as well.}},

   characterization of the electronic structure of all the complexes shows
   that the Co(III) complexes ligated by the DPP ligands (tetradentate X3L
   type) do not have sufficient Lewis acidity to activate the epoxide,
   whereas the Co(III) porphyrin and salen (tetradentate X2L2 type)
   incorporate a counter-ion that draws electron density away from the
   metal center, creating a more Lewis acidic Co species that is
   catalytically active for alcohol ring-opening of epoxides. The work thus

Abstract = {{As part of the More Electric Initiative, there is a significant interest
   in designing energy-optimized More Electric Aircraft, where electric
   power meets all non-propulsive power requirements. To achieve this goal,
   the aircraft subsystems must be analyzed much earlier than in the
   traditional design process. This means that the designer must be able to
   compare competing subsystem solutions with only limited knowledge
   regarding aircraft geometry and other design characteristics. The
   methodology presented in this work allows such tradeoffs to be performed
   and is driven by subsystem requirements definition, component modeling
   and simulation, identification of critical or constraining flight
   conditions, and evaluation of competing architectures at the vehicle and
   mission level. The methodology is applied to the flight control
   actuation system, where electric control surface actuators are likely to
   replace conventional centralized hydraulics in future More Electric
   Aircraft. While the potential benefits of electric actuation are
   generally accepted, there is considerable debate regarding the most
   suitable electric actuator - electrohydrostatic or electromechanical.
   These two actuator types form the basis of the competing solutions
   analyzed in this work, which focuses on a small narrowbody aircraft such
   as the Boeing 737-800. The competing architectures are compared at both
   the vehicle and mission levels, using as metrics subsystem weight and
   mission fuel burn, respectively. As shown in this work, the use of this
   methodology aids the decision-making process by allowing the designer to
   rapidly evaluate the significance of any performance advantage between
   the competing solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Concurrent in situ Raman spectroscopic studies and drain current
   measurements were performed during drop-cast poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) film formation. Together, these techniques allow interrogation
   and elucidation of the evolution of P3HT structural changes and
   associated electrical characteristics as the solvent evaporates. Two
   observations are especially significant: i) solvent continued to be
   present in the developing thin-film at the point where the drain current
   exhibited a sharp increase and ii) continued to be observed after
   crystallization of the polymer. The in situ studies provide vital
   insights into the polymer organization and chain alignment processes at
   the molecular and macroscopic scales. The results suggest that final
   conjugated polymer thin-film morphology can be tailored for enhanced
   performance and desired electronic properties through quenching of the

Abstract = {{Motility is a basic feature of living microorganisms, and how it works
   is often determined by environmental cues. Recent efforts have focused
   on developing artificial systems that can mimic microorganisms, in
   particular their self-propulsion. We report on the design and
   characterization of synthetic self-propelled particles that migrate
   upstream, known as positive rheotaxis. This phenomenon results from a
   purely physical mechanism involving the interplay between the polarity
   of the particles and their alignment by a viscous torque. We show
   quantitative agreement between experimental data and a simple model of
   an overdamped Brownian pendulum. The model notably predicts the
   existence of a stagnation point in a diverging flow. We take advantage
   of this property to demonstrate that our active particles can sense and
   predictably organize in an imposed flow. Our colloidal system represents
   an important step toward the realization of biomimetic microsystems with
   the ability to sense and respond to environmental changes.}},

Title = {{Using sensitivity analysis to improve the efficiency of a Net-Zero
   Energy vaccine warehouse design}},

Abstract = {{A critical step in the design of a Net-Zero Energy building is the
   reduction of energy consumption, so that consumption can be
   cost-effectively offset by renewable energy production. In this paper,
   we present a method to inform the design of Net-Zero Energy buildings
   through the identification of influential energy efficiency measures. A
   regression-based global sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the
   relative importance of both individual design parameters and bilinear
   interactions between parameters. This allows for the identification of
   the specific two-way interactions between parameter pairs, rather than
   an evaluation of the influence of interactions for each parameter in a
   lumped manner as is commonly used in building performance simulation.
   The relative importance of both building control and architectural
   design parameters are assessed, and are used to help evaluate the
   importance of utilizing an integrated design method for reducing
   building energy consumption. The case-study building investigated is a
   primary vaccine warehouse, a vital part of the vaccine cold chain in the
   developing world. As this building type has not received adequate
   attention in the field of building performance simulation, this paper
   makes a significant contribution towards an improved understanding of
   the energy efficient design of these warehouses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{One of the most attractive recent approaches to processing
   well-structured large-scale convex optimization problems is based on
   smooth convex-concave saddle point reformulation of the problem of
   interest and solving the resulting problem by a fast first order saddle
   point method utilizing smoothness of the saddle point cost function. In
   this paper, we demonstrate that when the saddle point cost function is
   polynomial, the precise gradients of the cost function required by
   deterministic first order saddle point algorithms and becoming
   prohibitively computationally expensive in the extremely large-scale
   case, can be replaced with incomparably cheaper computationally unbiased
   random estimates of the gradients. We show that for large-scale problems
   with favorable geometry, this randomization accelerates, progressively
   as the sizes of the problem grow, the solution process. This extends
   significantly previous results on acceleration by randomization, which,
   to the best of our knowledge, dealt solely with bilinear saddle point
   problems. We illustrate our theoretical findings by instructive and
   encouraging numerical experiments.}},

Title = {{Molecular interference of fibrin's divalent polymerization mechanism
   enables modulation of multiscale material properties}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Protein based polymers provide an exciting and complex landscape for
   tunable natural biomaterials through modulation of molecular level
   interactions. Here we demonstrate the ability to modify protein polymer
   structural and mechanical properties at multiple length scales by
   molecular `interference' of fibrin's native polymerization mechanism. We
   have previously reported that engagement of fibrin's polymerization
   `hole b', also known as `b-pockets', through PEGylated complementary
   `knob B' mimics can increase fibrin network porosity but also, somewhat
   paradoxically, increase network stiffness. Here, we explore the possible
   mechanistic underpinning of this phenomenon through characterization of
   the effects of knob B-fibrin interaction at multiple length scales from
   molecular to bulk polymer. Despite its weak monovalent binding affinity
   for fibrin, addition of both knob B and PEGylated knob B at
   concentrations near the binding coefficient, Kd, increased fibrin
   network porosity, consistent with the reported role of knob B-hole b
   interactions in promoting lateral growth of fibrin fibers. Addition of
   PEGylated knob B decreases the extensibility of single fibrin fibers at
   concentrations near its Kd but increases extensibility of fibers at
   concentrations above its Kd. The data suggest this bimodal behavior is
   due to the individual contributions knob B, which decreases fiber
   extensibility, and PEG, which increase fiber extensibility. Taken
   together with laser trap-based microrheological and bulk rheological
   analyses of fibrin polymers, our data strongly suggests that hole b
   engagement increases in single fiber stiffness that translates to higher
   storage moduli of fibrin polymers despite their increased porosity.
   These data point to possible strategies for tuning fibrin polymer
   mechanical properties through modulation of single fiber mechanics. (C)

   using direct numerical simulations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{74-82}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of saturated deformable porous media is investigated under
   compressive loading using direct numerical simulations. A parallel
   hybrid lattice Boltzmann and Finite Element method is employed to
   perform the numerical simulations. The efficiency and inherently
   parallel nature of LBM coupled with the robust FEM lends itself as a
   powerful tool to carry out the complex and computationally demanding
   direct numerical simulations of saturated deformable porous media.
   Model porous media made up of spheres in a simple cubic arrangement are
   used in this work. The deformational response of such model geometries
   is compared to an existing analytical solution. For the comparison, the
   bulk properties of the macroscopic porous medium are obtained through
   the single phase properties of the constituents. The deformational
   behavior is seen to match the analytical solution closely. Thus it is
   found that the macroscopic behavior of a generic porous medium can be
   recovered through model porous medium constructed with simplified
   geometries. As a result, it is also seen that the LBM-FEM method is an
   accurate and suitable method for further investigations on porous media,
   particularly in nonhomogeneous and anisotropic deformable porous media.

Abstract = {{Osteoblasts are sensitive to surface microtopography and chemistry.
   Osteoblast differentiation and maturation are higher in vitro and bone
   formation and osseointegration enhanced in vivo on microstructured
   titanium (Ti) compared to smooth surfaces. Cells increased BMP2
   expression on microtextured Ti alloy, suggesting a paracrine role in
   regulating osteoblast maturation. However, recent studies show that
   exogenous BMP2 inhibits osteoblast production of anti-inflammatory
   cytokines and osteocalcin, indicating that control of BMP-signaling may
   be involved. This study examined whether cells modulate BMP ligands,
   receptors, and inhibitors during osteoblast maturation on Ti,
   specifically focusing on the roles of BMP2 and Noggin (NOG). mRNA and
   protein for BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 and receptors BMPR1A, BMPR1B, and
   BMPR2, and BMP inhibitors were upregulated on microtextured surfaces in
   comparison to smooth surfaces. Maturation on microstructured Ti was
   slightly enhanced with exogenous BMP2 while NOG addition inhibited
   osteoblast maturation. Cells with NOG knocked down significantly
   increased osteoblast maturation. These results demonstrate that
   BMP-related molecules are controlled during osteoblast maturation on
   microstructured Ti surfaces and that endogenous NOG is an important
   regulator of the process. Modifying paracrine BMP signaling may yield
   more robust bone formation than application of exogenous BMPs. (c) 2014

Title = {{Role of integrin subunits in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and

   surfaces}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{69-79}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Surface roughness, topography, chemistry, and energy promote osteoblast
   differentiation and increase osteogenic local factor production in vitro
   and bone-to-implant contact in vivo, but the mechanisms involved are not
   well understood. Knockdown of integrin heterodimer alpha2beta1 (alpha 2
   beta 1) blocks the osteogenic effects of the surface, suggesting
   signaling by this integrin homodimer is required. The purpose of the
   present study was to separate effects of surface chemistry and surface
   structure on integrin expression by coating smooth or rough titanium
   (Ti) substrates with graphitic carbon, retaining surface morphology but
   altering surface chemistry. Ti surfaces (smooth {[}R-a < 0.4 mu m],
   rough {[}R-a >= 3.4 mu m]) were sputter-coated using a magnetron
   sputtering system with an ultrapure graphite target, producing a
   graphitic carbon thin film. Human mesenchymal stem cells and MG63
   osteoblast-like cells had higher mRNA for integrin subunits alpha 1,
   alpha 2, alpha v, and beta 1 on rough surfaces in comparison to smooth,
   and integrin alpha v on graphitic-carbon-coated rough surfaces in
   comparison to Ti. Osteogenic differentiation was greater on rough
   surfaces in comparison to smooth, regardless of chemistry. Silencing
   integrins beta 1, alpha 1, or alpha 2 decreased osteoblast maturation on
   rough surfaces independent of surface chemistry. Silencing integrin
   alpha v decreased maturation only on graphitic carbon-coated surfaces,
   not on Ti. These results suggest a major role of the integrin beta 1
   subunit in roughness recognition, and that integrin alpha subunits play
   a major role in surface chemistry recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) provide a
   potential source of cells to repair injured ventricular myocardium. CM
   differentiation cultures contain non-cardiac cells and CMs of both nodal
   and working subtypes. Direct application of such cultures in clinical
   studies could induce arrhythmias; thus, further purification of
   working-type CMs from heterogeneous cultures is desirable. Here, we
   designed 10 molecular beacons (MBs) targeting NPPA mRNA, a marker
   associated with workingtype CMs and highly up-regulated during
   differentiation. We examined these MBs by solution assays and
   established their specificity using NPPA-overexpressing CHO cells as
   well as hPSC-CMs. We selected one MB for subsequent CM subtype isolation
   using fluorescence-activated cell sorting because the
   signal-tobackground ratio was the highest for this MB in solution assays
   and a linear correlation was observed between MB signals and the CM
   purity in differentiation cultures. Compared with cells with low MB
   signals, cells positively selected based on MB signal had higher
   expression levels of genes associated with working-type CMs and lower
   expression levels of genes associated with nodal-type CMs. Therefore,
   the MB-based method is capable of separating working-type CMs from
   nodal-type CMs with high specificity and throughput, potentially
   providing working-type CMs for biomedical applications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Hierarchically porous organosilica microspheres have been facilely
   synthesized by improved self-assembly of flexible-bridged organosilica
   precursor without templates and harsh conditions. Subsequently,
   monodispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are in situ grown on the
   porous microspheres via silver mirror reaction. The as-prepared hybrid
   composites of Ag supported on porous microspheres are characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric
   analysis and nitrogen adsorption and desorption, respectively. These
   results indicate that not only Ag NPs (20-40 nm) are grown on the
   organosilica uniformly but also the content of Ag NPs immobilized in the
   hybrid materials can be well controlled by simply tuning the amount of
   the Ag(NH3)(2)OH. The resultant hybrid microspheres exhibit remarkable
   and durable performances for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to
   4-aminophenol by NaBH4 in aqueous solution. Moreover, the catalytic
   kinetic mode can be tuned by adjusting the parameter in catalytic
   reaction, and it can be recycled for seven successive cycles with
   excellent conversion of 100 \% within 8 min. Therefore, the present
   structure design and scalable route for the synthesis of hierarchical
   catalyst can provide a highly efficient solution for the reduction of
   nitro-aromatic compounds in the view of environmentally friendly

Title = {{Software in military aviation and drone mishaps: Analysis and
   recommendations for the investigation process}},

Abstract = {{Software plays a central role in military systems. It is also an
   important factor in many recent incidents and accidents. A safety gap is
   growing between our software-intensive technological capabilities and
   our understanding of the ways they can fail or lead to accidents.
   Traditional forms of accident investigation are poorly equipped to trace
   the sources of software failure, for instance software does not age in
   the same way that hardware components fail over time. As such, it can be
   hard to trace the causes of software failure or mechanisms by which it
   contributed to accidents back into the development and procurement chain
   to address the deeper, systemic causes of potential accidents. To
   identify some of these failure mechanisms, we examined the database of
   the Air Force Accident Investigation Board (AIB) and analyzed mishaps in
   which software was involved. Although we have chosen to focus on
   military aviation, many of the insights also apply to civil aviation.
   Our analysis led to several results and recommendations. Some were
   specific and related for example to specific shortcomings in the testing
   and validation of particular avionic subsystems. Others were broader in
   scope: for instance, we challenged both the investigation process
   (aspects of) and the findings in several cases, and we provided
   recommendations, technical and organizational, for improvements. We also
   identified important safety blind spots in the investigations with
   respect to software, whose contribution to the escalation of the adverse
   events was often neglected in the accident reports. These blind spots,
   we argued, constitute an important missed learning opportunity for
   improving accident prevention, and it is especially unfortunate at a
   time when Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) are being integrated into
   the National Airspace. Our findings support the growing recognition that
   the traditional notion of software failure as non-compliance with
   requirements is too limited to capture the diversity of roles that
   software plays in military and civil aviation accidents. The
   identification of several specific mechanisms by which software
   contributes to accidents can help populate a library of patterns and
   triggers of software contributions to adverse events, a library which in
   turn can be used to help guide better software development, better
   coding, and better testing to avoid or eliminate these particular
   patterns and triggers. Finally, we strongly argue for the examination of
   software's causal role in accident investigations, the inclusion of a
   section on the subject in the accident reports, and the participation of
   software experts in accident investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Exploiting graphs for recommender systems has great potential to
   flexibly incorporate heterogeneous information for producing better
   recommendation results. As our baseline approach, we first introduce a
   naive graph-based recommendation method, which operates with a
   heterogeneous log-metadata graph constructed from user log and content
   metadata databases. Although the naive graph-based recommendation method
   is simple, it allows us to take advantages of heterogeneous information
   and shows promising flexibility and recommendation accuracy. However, it
   often leads to extensive processing time due to the sheer size of the
   graphs constructed from entire user log and content metadata databases.
   In this paper, we propose node and edge aggregation approaches to
   constructing compact and effective graphs called `Factor-Item bipartite
   graphs' by aggregating nodes and edges of a log-metadata graph.
   Experimental results using real world datasets indicate that our
   approach can significantly reduce the size of graphs exploited for
   recommender systems without sacrificing the recommendation quality. (C)

Abstract = {{The goals of this paper are: (i) to review the mechanisms of cyclic
   deformation, damage accumulation and crack propagation in three types of
   materials widely used in power generation industries, i.e. Cr-Mo steels,
   austenitic stainless steels and superalloys used in jet engine turbines
   (both Ni base and Fe-Ni base) when they are tested at elevated
   temperature; (ii) to relate these mechanisms to engineering
   applications; (iii) to review life prediction methodologies including
   thermomechanical fatigue (TMF); and (iv) to point out current and likely
   future trends in the development of more fatigue resistant materials and
   life prediction methods. The emphasis is laid on the
   creep-fatigue-oxidation behaviour of the two first classes of materials,
   i.e. 9-12\% martensitic Cr steels and austenitic stainless steels. As
   the major issue for the design of components used in power generation
   industries is the extrapolation of short term laboratory data to much
   longer times, only physically based models for life prediction are
   examined. In Ni base superalloys, the emphasis is laid on the effect of
   oxidation on fatigue crack growth rate at elevated temperature and on

Title = {{Engineering a mobile health tool for resource-poor settings to assess
   and manage cardiovascular disease risk: SMARThealth study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of chronic diseases in low- and middle-income
   countries is rapidly increasing both in urban and rural regions. A major
   challenge for health systems globally is to develop innovative solutions
   for the prevention and control of these diseases. This paper discusses
   the development and pilot testing of SMARTHealth, a mobile-based,
   point-of-care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool to assess and manage
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in resource-constrained settings.
   Through pilot testing, the preliminary acceptability, utility, and
   efficiency of the CDS tool was obtained.
   Methods: The CDS tool was part of an mHealth system comprising a mobile
   application that consisted of an evidence-based risk prediction and
   management algorithm, and a server-side electronic medical record
   system. Through an agile development process and user-centred design
   approach, key features of the mobile application that fitted the
   requirements of the end users and environment were obtained. A
   comprehensive analytics framework facilitated a data-driven approach to
   investigate four areas, namely, system efficiency, end-user variability,
   manual data entry errors, and usefulness of point-of-care management
   recommendations to the healthcare worker. A four-point Likert scale was
   used at the end of every risk assessment to gauge ease-of-use of the
   system.
   Results: The system was field-tested with eleven village healthcare
   workers and three Primary Health Centre doctors, who screened a total of
   292 adults aged 40 years and above. 34\% of participants screened by
   health workers were identified by the CDS tool to be high CVD risk and
   referred to a doctor. In-depth analysis of user interactions found the
   CDS tool feasible for use and easily integrable into the workflow of
   healthcare workers. Following completion of the pilot, further technical
   enhancements were implemented to improve uptake of the mHealth platform.
   It will then be evaluated for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in a
   cluster randomized controlled trial involving 54 southern Indian
   villages and over 16000 individuals at high CVD risk.
   Conclusions: An evidence-based CVD risk prediction and management tool
   was used to develop an mHealth platform in rural India for CVD screening
   and management with proper engagement of health care providers and local
   communities. With over a third of screened participants being high risk,
   there is a need to demonstrate the clinical impact of the mHealth
   platform so that it could contribute to improved CVD detection in high
   risk low resource settings.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of aziridine-functionalized mesoporous silica membranes On
   polymeric hollow fibers is described, and their single-component CO2 and
   N-2 permeation properties are investigated under both dry and humid
   conditions to elucidate the unusual permeation mechanisms observed in
   these membranes. Hollow fiber-supported mesoporous silica membranes are
   amine-functionalized with aziridine to yield hyperbranched aminopolymers
   within the membrane pores. The effects of the hyperbranched polymers in
   the mesopores on gas transport properties are investigated by
   single-component gas permeation measurements. The hyperbranched
   aminosilica membrane shows counterintuitive N-2-selective (over CO2)
   permeation during operation under dry conditions. Further
   characterization of the permeation behavior reveals the effects of
   strong adsorption of CO, under dry permeation conditions, leading to
   reduced CO2 diffusivity because of CO2-induced amine cross-linking in
   the mesopores. On the other hand, the hyperbranched aminosilica membrane
   shows CO2-selective properties under humid conditions. Water molecules
   cause a lower degree of amine cross-linking and thus allow facilitated
   transport of CO2. This first study of hollow fiber-supported
   hyperbranched aminosilica membranes indicates that they can be tuned to
   have N,- or CO2-selective permeation properties under the conditions
   employed.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring temperature changes of the deep oceans, important for
   determining the oceanic heat content and its impact on the Earth's
   climate evolution, is typically done using free-drifting profiling
   oceanographic floats with limited global coverage. Acoustic thermometry
   provides an alternative and complementary remote sensing methodology for
   monitoring fine temperature variations of the deep ocean over long
   distances between a few underwater sources and receivers. We demonstrate
   a simpler, totally passive (i.e., without deploying any active sources)
   modality for acoustic thermometry of the deep oceans (for depths of
   500-1500m), using only ambient noise recorded by two existing
   hydroacoustic stations of the International Monitoring System. We
   suggest that passive acoustic thermometry could improve global
   monitoring of deep-ocean temperature variations through implementation
   using a global network of hydrophone arrays.}},

Abstract = {{The electron deficiency and trans-planar conformation of bithiazole is
   potentially beneficial for the electron-transport performance of organic
   semiconductors. However, the incorporation of bithiatole into polymers
   through a facile synthetic strategy remains a challenge. Herein,
   2,2'-bithiazole was synthesized in one step and copolymerized with
   dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole to afford
   poly(dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole-bithiazole), PDBTz. PDBTz exhibited
   electron mobility reaching 0.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in organic field-effect
   transistor (OFET) configuration; this contrasts with a recently
   discussed isoelectronic conjugated polymer comprising an electron-rich
   bithiophene and dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole, which displays merely
   hole-transport chatacteristics. This inversion of charge-carrier
   transport chatacteristics confirms the significant potential for
   bithiazole in the development of electron-transport semiconducting
   materials. Branched 5-decylheptacyl side chains were incorporated into
   PDBTz to enhance polymer solubility, particularly in nonhalogenated,
   more environmentally compatible solvents. PDBTz cast from a range of
   nonhalogenated solvents exhibited film morphologies and field-effect
   electron mobility similar to those cast from halogenated solvents.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy have shown elevated incidence of
   dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most
   studies, however, focus on cohorts from developed countries, with less
   data available for these co-morbidities in Ethiopia and sub-Saharan
   Africa.
   Methods
   Adult HIV-negative (n = 36), treatment naive (n = 51), efavirenz
   (EFV)-treated (n = 91), nevi-rapine (NVP)-treated (n = 95), or
   ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-treated (n= 44) subjects were
   recruited from Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Aortic
   pressure, augmentation pressure, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were
   measured via applanation tonometry and carotid intima-media thickness
   (cIMT) and carotid arterial stiffness, and brachial artery flow-mediated
   dilation (FMD) were measured via non-invasive ultrasound. Body mass
   index, waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR), skinfold thickness, and
   self-reported fat redistribution were used to quantify lipodystrophy.
   CD4+ cell count, plasma HIV RNA levels, fasting glucose, total-, HDL-,
   and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, hsCRP, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, leptin and
   complete blood count were measured.
   Results
   PWV and normalized cIMT were elevate and FMD impaired in EFV- and
   LPV/r-treated subjects compared to NVP-treated subjects; normalized cIMT
   was also elevated and FMD impaired in the EFV- and LPV/r-treated
   subjects compared to treatment-naive subjects. cIMT was not
   statistically different across groups. Treated subjects exhibited
   elevated markers of dyslipidemia, inflammation, and lipodystrophy. PWV
   was associated with age, current EFV and LPV/r used, heart rate, blood
   pressure, triglycerides, LDL, and hsCRP, FMD with age, HIV duration,
   WHR, and glucose, and cIMT with age, current EFV use, skin-fold
   thickness, and blood pressure.
   Conclusions
   Current EFV- or LPV/r-treatment, but not NVP-treatment, correlated with
   elevated markers of atherosclerosis, which may involve mechanisms
   distinct from traditional risk factors.}},

Title = {{Platelet Mechanosensing of Collagen Matrices}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{During vascular injury, platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial
   proteins, such as collagen, on the blood vessel walls to trigger clot
   formation. Although the biochemical signalings of platelet-collagen
   interactions have been well characterized, little is known about the
   role microenvironmental biomechanical properties, such as vascular wall
   stiffness, may have on clot formation. To that end, we investigated how
   substrates of varying stiffness conjugated with the same concentration
   of Type I collagen affect platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation.
   Using collagen-conjugated polyacrylamide (PA) gels of different
   stiffnesses, we observed that platelets do in fact mechanotransduce the
   stiffness cues of collagen substrates, manifesting in increased platelet
   spreading on stiffer substrates. In addition, increasing substrate
   stiffness also increases phosphatidylserine exposure, a key aspect of
   platelet activation that initiates coagulation on the platelet surface.
   Mechanistically, these collagen substrate stiffness effects are mediated
   by extracellular calcium levels and actomyosin pathways driven by myosin
   light chain kinase but not Rho-associated protein kinase. Overall, our
   results improve our understanding of how the mechanics of different
   tissues and stroma affect clot formation, what role the increased vessel
   wall stiffness in atherosclerosis may directly have on thrombosis
   leading to heart attacks and strokes, and how age-related increased
   vessel wall stiffness affects hemostasis and thrombosis.}},

Abstract = {{Computational models for the heart's mitral valve (MV) exhibit several
   uncertainties that may be reduced by further developing these models
   using ground-truth data-sets. This study generated a ground-truth
   data-set by quantifying the effects of isolated mitral annular
   flattening, symmetric annular dilatation, symmetric papillary muscle
   (PM) displacement and asymmetric PM displacement on leaflet coaptation,
   mitral regurgitation (MR) and anterior leaflet strain. MVs were mounted
   in an in vitro left heart simulator and tested under pulsatile
   haemodynamics. Mitral leaflet coaptation length, coaptation depth,
   tenting area, MR volume, MR jet direction and anterior leaflet strain in
   the radial and circumferential directions were successfully quantified
   at increasing levels of geometric distortion. From these data, increase
   in the levels of isolated PM displacement resulted in the greatest mean
   change in coaptation depth (70\% increase), tenting area (150\%
   increase) and radial leaflet strain (37\% increase) while annular
   dilatation resulted in the largest mean change in coaptation length
   (50\% decrease) and regurgitation volume (134\% increase). Regurgitant
   jets were centrally located for symmetric annular dilatation and
   symmetric PM displacement. Asymmetric PM displacement resulted in
   asymmetrically directed jets. Peak changes in anterior leaflet strain in
   the circumferential direction were smaller and exhibited non-significant
   differences across the tested conditions. When used together, this
   ground-truth data-set may be used to parametrically evaluate and develop
   modelling assumptions for both the MV leaflets and subvalvular
   apparatus. This novel data may improve MV computational models and
   provide a platform for the development of future surgical planning
   tools.}},

Title = {{Triboelectric sensor as self-powered signal reader for scanning probe
   surface topography imaging}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{We report a self-powered signal reading mechanism for imaging surface
   topography using a triboelectric sensor (TES) without supplying an
   external power or light source. A membrane-structured triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) is designed at the root of a whisker (probe); the
   deflection of the whisker causes the two contacting surfaces of the TENG
   to give an electric output current/voltage that responds to the bending
   degree of the whisker when it scans over a rough surface. A series of
   studies were carried out to characterize the performance of the TES,
   such as high sensitivity of 0.45 V mm(-1), favorable repeating of
   standard deviation 8 mV, high Z-direction resolution of 18 mu m, as well
   as lateral resolution of 250 mu m by using a probe of size 11 mm in the
   length and 120 mu m in radius. It not only can recognize the surface
   feature and size but also can perform a surface topography imaging in
   scanning mode. This work shows the potential of a TES as a self-powered
   tactile sensor for applications at relatively low spatial resolution.}},

   Kinetics in Monoclinic LiMnBO3}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{In materials containing 1D lithium diffusion channels, cation disorder
   can strongly affect lithium intercalation processes. This work presents
   a model to explain the unusual transport properties of monoclinic
   LiMnBO3, a material determined by scanning electron microscopy and
   synchrotron X-ray diffraction to contain a wide particle size
   distribution and Mn/Li antisite disorder. First-principles calculations
   indicate that Mn occupying Li sites obstruct the 1D lithium diffusion
   channel along the {[}001] direction. While channel blockage by the
   antisites significantly lowers Li mobility in large particles, Li
   kinetics in small particles and particle surfaces are found to be less
   sensitive to the presence of antisite disorder. Thus, in an electrode
   containing a large particle size distribution, smaller particles have
   higher Li mobility, and the measured Li diffusivity as determined by
   potentiostatic intermittent titration test varies as a function of
   particle size. The Li capacity in monoclinic LiMnBO3 is kinetically
   controlled by the fraction of large particles with antisite disorder,
   but is not intrinsically limited. These results strongly suggest that
   particle nanosizing will significantly enhance the electrochemical
   performance of LiMnBO3}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of emissions changes from four potential U.S. CO2 emission
   reduction policies on 2050 air quality are analyzed using the community
   multiscale air quality model (CMAQ). Future meteorology was downscaled
   from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE General
   Circulation Model (GCM) to the regional scale using the Weather Research
   Forecasting (WRF) model. We use emissions growth factors from the
   EPAUS9r MARKAL model to project emissions inventories for two climate
   tax scenarios, a combined transportation and energy scenario, a biomass
   energy scenario and a reference case. Implementation of a relatively
   aggressive carbon tax leads to improved PM2.5 air quality compared to
   the reference case as incentives increase for facilities to install
   flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) and carbon capture and sequestration
   (CCS) technologies. However, less capital is available to install NO
   reduction technologies, resulting in an O-3 increase. A policy aimed at
   reducing CO2 from the transportation sector and electricity production
   sectors leads to reduced emissions of mobile source NOX, thus reducing
   O-3. Over most of the U.S., this scenario leads to reduced PM2.5
   concentrations. However, increased primary PM2.5 emissions associated
   with fuel switching in the residential and industrial sectors leads to
   increased organic matter (OM) and PM2.5 in some cities.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{5170-5177}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the projected impact of six climate mitigation scenarios
   on U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and
   nitrogen oxides (NOX) associated with energy use in major sectors of the
   U.S. economy (commercial, residential, industrial, electricity
   generation, and transportation). We use the EPA U.S. 9-region national
   database with the MARKet Allocation energy system Model to project
   emissions changes over the 2005 to 2050 time frank. The modeled
   scenarios are two carbon tax, two low carbon transportation, and two
   biomass fuel choice scenarios. In the lower carbon tax and both biomass
   fuel choke scenarios, SO2 and NOX achieve reductions largely through
   pre-existing rules and policies, with only relatively modest additional
   changes occurring from the climate;mitigation measures. The higher
   carbon tax scenario projects greater declines in CO2 and SO2 relative to
   the 2050 reference case, but electricity sector NOX increases. This is a
   result of reduced investments in power plant NOX controls in earlier
   years in anticipation of accelerated coal power plant retirements,
   energy penalties associated with carbon capture systems, and shifting of
   NOX emissions in later years from power plants subject to a regional NOX
   cap to those in regions not subject to the cap.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that the commonly used quadrature schemes
   for polygonal and polyhedral finite elements lead to consistency errors
   that persist under mesh refinement and subsequently render the
   approximations non-convergent. In this work, we consider minimal
   perturbations to the gradient field at the element level in order to
   restore polynomial consistency and recover optimal convergence rates
   when the weak form integrals are evaluated using quadrature. For finite
   elements of arbitrary order, we state the accuracy requirements on the
   underlying volumetric and boundary quadrature rules and discuss the
   properties of the resulting corrected gradient operator. We compare the
   proposed approach with the pseudo-derivative method developed by
   Belytschko and co-workers and, for linear elliptic problems, with our
   previous remedy that involves splitting of polynomial and non-polynomial
   of elemental energy bilinear form. We present several numerical results
   for linear and nonlinear elliptic problems in two and three dimensions
   that not only confirm the recovery of optimal convergence rates but also
   suggest that the global error levels are close to those of
   approximations obtained from exact evaluation of the weak form
   integrals. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Alterations in Ovarian Cancer Cell Adhesion Drive Taxol Resistance by
   Increasing Microtubule Dynamics in a FAK-dependent Manner}},

Abstract = {{Chemorefractory ovarian cancer patients show extremely poor prognosis.
   Microtubule-stabilizing Taxol (paclitaxel) is a first-line treatment
   against ovarian cancer. Despite the close interplay between microtubules
   and cell adhesion, it remains unknown if chemoresistance alters the way
   cells adhere to their extracellular environment, a process critical for
   cancer metastasis. To investigate this, we isolated Taxol-resistant
   populations of OVCAR3 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Though
   Taxol-resistant cells neither effluxed more drug nor gained resistance
   to other chemotherapeutics, they did display increased microtubule
   dynamics. These changes in microtubule dynamics coincided with faster
   attachment rates and decreased adhesion strength, which correlated with
   increased surface b1-integrin expression and decreased focal adhesion
   formation, respectively. Adhesion strength correlated best with
   Taxol-sensitivity, and was found to be independent of microtubule
   polymerization but dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which was
   up-regulated in Taxol-resistant cells. FAK inhibition also decreased
   microtubule dynamics to equal levels in both populations, indicating
   alterations in adhesive signaling are up-stream of microtubule dynamics.
   Taken together, this work demonstrates that Taxol-resistance
   dramatically alters how ovarian cancer cells adhere to their
   extracellular environment causing down-stream increases in microtubule
   dynamics, providing a therapeutic target that may improve prognosis by
   not only recovering drug sensitivity, but also decreasing metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{We present the adjoint of a cirrus formation parameterization that
   computes the sensitivity of ice crystal number concentration to updraft
   velocity, aerosol, and ice deposition coefficient. The adjoint is driven
   by simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research
   Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 CAM 5.1 to understand the
   sensitivity of formed ice crystal number concentration to 13 variables
   and quantify which contribute to its variability. Sensitivities of
   formed ice crystal number concentration to updraft velocity, sulfate
   number, and is sufficient but sulfate number concentration is low,
   indicating a sulfate-limited regime. Outside of the tropics, competition
   between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation may shift annually
   averaged sensitivities to higher magnitudes, when infrequent strong
   updrafts shift crystal production away from purely heterogeneous
   nucleation. Outside the tropics, updraft velocity is responsible for
   approximately 52.70\% of the ice crystal number variability. In the
   tropics, sulfate number concentration and updraft jointly control
   variability in formed crystal number concentration. Insoluble aerosol
   species play a secondary, but still important, role in influencing the
   variability in crystal concentrations, with coarse-mode dust being the
   largest contributor at nearly 50\% in certain regions. On a global
   scale, more than 95\% of the temporal variability in crystal number
   concentration can be described by temperature, updraft velocity, sulfate
   number, and coarse-mode dust number concentration.

Abstract = {{Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
   activities of LiCoO2 nanorods with sizes in the range from 9 to 40 nm

   terminated with low-index surfaces such as (003), while the tips were
   terminated largely with high-index surfaces such as (104), as revealed
   by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Electron energy
   loss spectroscopy demonstrated that low-spin Co3+ prevailed on the
   sides, while the tips exhibited predominantly high- or intermediate-spin
   Co3+. We correlated the electronic and atomic structure to higher
   specific ORR and OER activities at the tips as compared to the sides,
   which was accompanied by more facile redox of Co2+/3+ and higher charge
   transferred per unit area. These findings highlight the critical role of
   surface terminations and electronic structures of transition-metal
   oxides on the ORR and OER activity.}},

Pages = {{207-240}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to fill an apparent scarcity of benchmarks based on high
   temperature gas-cooled reactors. Within is a description of a whole
   prismatic VHTR core in its full heterogeneity and modeling using
   continuous energy nuclear data at a representative hot operating
   temperature. Also included is a core which has been simplified for ease
   in modeling while attempting to preserve as faithfully as possible the
   neutron physics of the core. Fuel and absorber pins have been
   homogenized from the particle level, however, the blocks which construct
   the core remain strongly heterogeneous. A six group multigroup (discrete
   energy) cross section set has been developed via Monte Carlo using the
   original heterogeneous core as a basis.
   Several configurations of the core have been solved using these two
   cross section sets; eigenvalue results, block-averaged power results,
   and some selected pin fission density results are presented in this
   paper, along with the six-group cross section data, so that method
   developers may use these problems as a standard reference point. (C)

   appropriate, the dopants, were always taken into account, as the elastic
   constants predicted from spin-polarized and non-spin-polarized
   calculations were significantly different. The results were successfully
   correlated to the electronic structure through the electronic density
   using Miedema's established model (Miedema et al., 1973). The

Pages = {{2687-2694}},

Abstract = {{Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in trichlorobenzene solution
   self-assembles and exhibits liquid crystal ordering when confined to
   rectangular capillaries. The relative proportion of polymer assemblies
   increases with time, as determined by UV-vis spectroscopic analysis.
   Polarized optical microscopy (POM) reveals development of birefringence
   and monodomainlike long-range ordering. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was
   used to calculate the orientational order parameters, < P-2 > and < P-4
   >, of the liquid-crystalline P3HT solutions. The order parameter < P-2 >
   increased with time up to 0.35, indicating increased anisotropy. The
   calculated depolarization ratio (p(v)) from depolarized dynamic light
   scattering measurements points to the time-dependent formation of highly
   ordered P3HT nanostructures, whereas cryogenic transmission electron
   microscopy was employed for the direct visualization of the rodlike
   assemblies. POM shows that the observed anisotropy can be preserved in
   P3HT films drawn from aged solutions. These results suggest that P3HT
   self-assembly leads to a liquid-crystalline solution of conjugated
   polymer aggregates, which may lead to a viable approach for optimization
   of processes for organic electronic device applications. Such ordered
   and oriented conjugated polymer assemblies have many desirable
   attributes for high-performance device applications, where the ability
   to control nano- through macroscale molecular ordering is required.}},

Abstract = {{Transport properties of carbon dioxide in amorphous poly(ethylene
   furanoate) (PEF) were investigated using complementary pressure-decay
   sorption and permeation techniques. Detailed measurements for PEF at 35
   degrees C indicate a significant, surprisingly large reduction in carbon
   dioxide permeability of 19x at 1 atm compared to poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET), despite both an increase in free volume and carbon
   dioxide solubility of 1.6x for PEF vs PET. The solubility increase for
   PEF, which originates from greater interaction between carbon dioxide
   and the polar furan moiety, is offset by a substantial reduction in
   diffusivity of 31x compared to PET. Such diffusion reduction for PEF,
   which is 3x greater than the 9.7x reduction in oxygen diffusivity
   compared to PET, is thought to originate from a hindrance of polymer
   ring-flipping motions compared to PET. A possible mechanism for the
   surprising barrier improvement for carbon dioxide in PEF vs PET is
   explained herein along with a detailed comparison to oxygen and water
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-mechanical behavior of a low carbon, high-strength (980 MPa grade)
   dual-phase (DP) steel of current technological interest that contains
   high volume fraction of martensite is simulated and uniaxial
   stress-strain curve is computed. Polygon-based vectorized
   microstructural images obtained via a new image analysis procedure are
   used for simulations of the micro-mechanical behavior. Simulations are
   performed using physics-based constitutive relationships for martensite
   and ferrite constituents and generalized plane-strain mesh elements. It
   is shown that there are significant variations in the computed
   stress-strain curve from one microstructural field of view to another
   for microstructural windows of 110 mu m x 110 mu m size or less. A
   random statistical sample of 10 microstructural windows of 110 mu m x
   110 mu m size or larger constitutes a RVE of this class of
   microstructures such that the simulated stress-strain curves of such
   RVEs are in close agreement with one another, and therefore, represent
   the global stress-strain response of the simulated material. For the
   constitutive equations, boundary conditions, and type of mesh elements
   used in the present work, such average simulated stress-strain curves
   are also in close agreement with the experimentally measured uniaxial
   stress-strain curve of the DP980 steel. It is also shown that in this
   dual-phase mictostructure, martensite carries most of the stress whereas
   most of the strain is contained in ferrite. Consequently, the strain
   localization and failure is predicted to go preferentially through
   ferrite compared to martensite, which is in agreement with experimental
   quantitative fractographic observations reported elsewhere. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Monodisperse Cu2O of different microstructures, such as cubes,
   flower-like, and microspheres, have been extensively synthesized by a
   simple polyol reduction method using different copper salts, i.e.
   (Cu(acac)(2), Cu (OH)(2), and Cu(Ac)(2)center dot H2O). The effects of
   copper salts on the morphology of Cu2O were investigated in details
   through various characterization methods, including X-ray diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and
   UV-Vis absorption spectra. The effects of morphology on the
   electrochemical properties were further studied. Among the different
   structures, Cu2O with the microspheric morphology shows the highest
   specific capacitance and the best cycling stability compared with those
   of the other two structures, thus bear larger volume charge during the
   electrochemical reaction due to the microspheres of small nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Porous molecular solids are garnering increasing attention with examples
   of high surface areas and applications in molecular separations.
   Recently, amorphous networks of molecular cages have shown increased
   porosity with respect to their crystalline counterparts. However, the
   structures of amorphous materials cannot be precisely elucidated by
   X-ray diffraction techniques, thus molecular simulations are vital to
   understanding their pore structures and the origin of porosity. Here, we
   use GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations as an efficient
   methodology to construct representative amorphous network structures. We
   employ Voronoi network analysis of amorphous networks of seven
   previously reported cage molecules to provide insight into
   structure-property relationships. Accordingly, we apply this
   understanding to delineate synthetic design features that give rise to
   highly porous analogues of chemically robust cages constructed from
   carbon-carbon bonds.}},

Abstract = {{To select useful surface coatings for high H-2 permeability metal
   membranes, the hydrogen transport properties in composite membranes of
   V, Nb, and Ta coated with different transition-metal carbides (TMCs) (TM
   = Ti, Hf, Zr) have been systematically investigated using
   first-principles calculations together with statistical mechanics
   methods. These calculations were used to predict the hydrogen flux and
   characterize the diffusion resistances in these composite materials. Our
   results indicate that the coating material on the permeate side controls
   the net H-2 flux at low temperature, where the H-2 desorption energies
   on the surfaces of the membrane coating are important. At sufficiently
   high temperature, H diffusion through the membranes controls the net
   flux. Overall, our results predict that TiC is the best coating and
   TiC/V/TiC is the best composite membranes among the materials studied.}},

Abstract = {{A self-powered, sliding electrification based quasi-static triboelectric
   sensor (QS-TES) for detecting angle from rotating motion is reported.
   This innovative, cost-effective, simply-designed QS-TES has a
   two-dimensional planar structure, which consists of a rotator coated
   with four channel coded Cu foil material and a stator with a fluorinated
   ethylenepropylene film. On the basis of coupling effect between
   triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, the sensor generates
   electric output signals in response to mechanical rotating motion of an
   object mounted with the sensor. The sensor can read and remember the
   absolute angular position, angular velocity, and acceleration regardless
   being continuously monitored or segmented monitored. Under the rotation
   speed of 100 r min(-1), the output voltage of the sensor reaches as high
   as 60 V. Given a relatively low threshold voltage of +/- 0.5 V for data
   processing, the robustness of the device is guaranteed. The resolution
   of the sensor is 22.5 degrees and can be further improved by increasing
   the number of channels. Triggered by the output voltage signal, the
   rotating characteristics of the steering wheel can be real-time
   monitored and mapped by being mounted to QS-TES. This work not only
   demonstrates a new principle in the field of angular measurement but
   also greatly expands the applicability of triboelectric nanogenerator as
   self-powered sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromechanical principles define the properties and problems that shape
   neural solutions for movement. Although the theoretical and experimental
   evidence is debated, we present arguments for consistent structures in
   motor patterns, i.e., motor modules, that are neuromechanical solutions
   for movement particular to an individual and shaped by evolutionary,
   developmental, and learning processes. As a consequence, motor modules
   may be useful in assessing sensorimotor deficits specific to an
   individual and define targets for the rational development of novel
   rehabilitation therapies that enhance neural plasticity and sculpt motor
   recovery. We propose that motor module organization is disrupted and may
   be improved by therapy in spinal cord injury, stroke, and Parkinson's
   disease. Recent studies provide insights into the yet-unknown underlying
   neural mechanisms of motor modules, motor impairment, and motor learning
   and may lead to better understanding of the causal nature of modularity
   and its underlying neural substrates.}},

Title = {{Stage-independent, single lead EEG sleep spindle detection using the
   continuous wavelet transform and local weighted smoothing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Sleep spindles are critical in characterizing sleep and have been
   associated with cognitive function and pathophysiological assessment.
   Typically, their detection relies on the subjective and time-consuming
   visual examination of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal(s) by experts,
   and has led to large inter-rater variability as a result of poor
   definition of sleep spindle characteristics. Hitherto, many algorithmic
   spindle detectors inherently make signal stationarity assumptions (e.g.,
   Fourier transform-based approaches) which are inappropriate for EEG
   signals, and frequently rely on additional information which may not be
   readily available in many practical settings (e.g., more than one EEG
   channels, or prior hypnogram assessment). This study proposes a novel
   signal processing methodology relying solely on a single EEG channel,
   and provides objective, accurate means toward probabilistically
   assessing the presence of sleep spindles in EEG signals. We use the
   intuitively appealing continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with a Morlet
   basis function, identifying regions of interest where the power of the
   CVVT coefficients corresponding to the frequencies of spindles (11-16
   Hz) is large. The potential for assessing the signal segment as a
   spindle is refined using local weighted smoothing techniques. We
   evaluate our findings on two databases: the MASS database comprising 19
   healthy controls and the DREAMS sleep spindle database comprising eight
   participants diagnosed with various sleep pathologies. We demonstrate
   that we can replicate the experts' sleep spindles assessment accurately
   in both databases (MASS database: sensitivity: 84\%, specificity: 90\%,
   false discovery rate 83\%, DREAMS database: sensitivity: 76\%,
   specificity: 92\%, false discovery rate: 67\%), outperforming six
   competing automatic sleep spindle detection algorithms in terms of
   correctly replicating the experts' assessment of detected spindles.}},

Title = {{Cu(II)-Catalyzed Transformation of Benzylpenicillin Revisited: The
   Overlooked Oxidation}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{4218-4225}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{Penicillins, a class of widely used beta-lactam antibiotics, are known
   to be susceptible to catalyzed hydrolysis by metal ions such as Cu-II.
   However, new results in this study strongly indicate that the role of
   Cu-II is not merely a hydrolysis catalyst but also an oxidant. When
   benzylpenicillin (i.e., penicillin G (PG)) was exposed to Cu(II) ion at
   an equal molar ratio and pH 7, degradation of PG occurred rapidly in the
   oxygen-rich solution but gradually slowed down to a halt in the
   oxygen-limited solution. In-depth studies revealed that Cu-II catalyzed
   hydrolysis of PG to benzylpenicilloic acid (PA) and oxidized PA to yield
   phenylacetamide and other products. The availability of oxygen played
   the role in reoxidizing Cu-I back to Cu-II, which sustained fast
   degradation of PG over time. The overall reaction was also influenced by
   pH, with Cu-II-catalyzed hydrolysis of PG occurring throughout pH 5, 7
   and 9, while Cu-II oxidation of PA occurring at pH 7 and 9. Note that
   the potential of Cu-II to oxidize penicillins was largely overlooked in
   the previous literature, and catalyzed hydrolysis was frequently assumed
   as the only reaction. This study is among the first to identify the dual
   roles of Cu-II in the entire degradation process of PG and
   systematically investigate the overlooked oxidation reaction to
   elucidate the mechanism. The new mechanistic knowledge has important
   implications for many other beta-lactam antibiotics for their
   interactions with Cu-II, and significantly improves the ability to
   predict the environmental fate and transformation products of PG and
   related penicillins in systems where Cu-II species are also present.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Recent assessments have analyzed the health impacts of PM2.5 from
   emissions from different locations and sectors using simplified or
   reduced-form air quality models. Here we present an alternative approach
   using the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model,
   which provides sourcereceptor relationships at highly resolved sectoral,
   spatial, and temporal scales. While damage resulting from anthropogenic
   emissions of BC is strongly correlated with population and premature
   death, we found little correlation between damage and emission
   magnitude, suggesting that controls on the largest emissions may not be
   the most efficient means of reducing damage resulting from anthropogenic
   BC emissions. Rather, the best proxy for locations with damaging BC
   emissions is locations where premature deaths occur. Onroad diesel and
   nonroad vehicle emissions are the largest contributors to premature
   deaths attributed to exposure to BC, while onroad gasoline emissions
   cause the highest deaths per amount emitted. Emissions in fall and
   winter contribute to more premature deaths (and more per amount emitted)
   than emissions in spring and summer. Overall, these results show the
   value of the high-resolution source attribution for determining the
   locations, seasons, and sectors for which BC emission controls have the
   most effective health benefits.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the relative toxicity of various organic aerosol (OA)
   components identified by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) based on
   their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ambient fine
   aerosols were collected from urban (three in Atlanta, GA and one in
   Birmingham, AL) and rural (Yorkville, GA and Centerville, AL) sites in
   the Southeastern United States. The ROS generating capability of the
   water-soluble fraction of the particles was measured by the
   dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Water-soluble PM extracts were further
   separated into the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions using a C-18
   column, and both fractions were analyzed for DTT activity and
   water-soluble metals. Organic aerosol composition was measured at
   selected sites using a high-resolution time-of-flight AMS. Positive
   matrix factorization of the AMS spectra resolved the organic aerosol
   into isoprene-derived OA (Isop\_OA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA),
   less-oxidized oxygenated OA, (LO-OOA), more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA),
   cooking OA (COA), and biomass burning OA (BBOA). The association of the
   DTT activity of water-soluble PM2.5 (WS\_DTT) with these factors was
   investigated by linear regression techniques. BBOA and MO-OOA were most
   consistently linked with WS\_DTT, with intrinsic water-soluble
   activities of 151 +/- 20 and 36 +/- 22 pmol/min/mu g, respectively.
   Although less toxic, MO-OOA was most widespread, contributing to WS\_DTT
   activity at all sites and during all seasons. WS\_DTT activity was least
   associated with biogenic secondary organic aerosol. The OA components
   contributing to WS\_DTT were humic-like substances (HULIS), which are
   abundantly emitted in biomass burning (BBOA) and include highly oxidized
   OA from multiple sources (MO-OOA). Overall, OA contributed approximately
   60\% to the WS\_DTT activity, with the remaining probably from
   water-soluble metals, which were mostly associated with the hydrophilic
   WS\_DTT fraction.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an unconventional route to produce uniform and intimately
   contacted semiconducting organic-inorganic nanocomposites for potential
   applications in thermoelectrics. By utilizing amphiphilic star-like
   PAA-b-PEDOT diblock copolymer as template, monodisperse
   PEDOT-functionalized lead telluride (PbTe) nanoparticles were crafted
   via the strong coordination interaction between PAA blocks of star-like
   PAA-b-PEDOT and the metal moieties of precursors (i.e., forming
   PEDOT-PbTe nanocomposites). As the inner PAA blocks are covalently
   connected to the outer PEDOT blocks, the PEDOT chains are intimately and
   permanently tethered on the PbTe nanoparticle surface, thereby affording
   a well-defined PEDOT/PbTe interface, which prevents the PbTe
   nanoparticles from aggregation, and more importantly promotes the
   long-term stability of PEDOT-PbTe nanocomposites. We envision that the
   template strategy is general and robust, and offers easy access to other
   conjugated polymer-inorganic semiconductor nanocomposites for use in a
   variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of flow disturbances on platelet adhesion is complex and
   incompletely understood. At the molecular scale, platelet glycoprotein
   Ib alpha (GPIb alpha) must associate with the von Willebrand factor A1
   domain (VWF-A1) with a rapid on-rate under high hemodynamic forces, as
   occurs in arterial thrombosis, where various transport mechanisms are at
   work. Here, we theoretically modeled the coupled transport-reaction
   process of the two-dimensional (2D) receptor-ligand association kinetics
   in a biomembrane force probe to explicitly account for the effects of
   molecular length, confinement stiffness, medium viscosity, surface
   curvature, and separation distance. We experimentally verified the
   theoretical approach by visualizing association and dissociation of
   individual VWF-A1-GPIb alpha bonds in a real-time thermal fluctuation
   assay. The apparent on-rate, reciprocal of the average time intervals
   between sequential bonds, decreased with the increasing gap distance
   between A1- and GPIb alpha-bearing surfaces with an 80-nm threshold
   (beyond which bond formation became prohibitive) identified as the
   combined contour length of the receptor and ligand molecules. The
   biomembrane force probe spring constant and diffusivity of the
   protein-bearing beads also significantly influenced the apparent
   on-rate, in accordance with the proposed transport mechanisms. The
   global agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions
   supports the hypothesis that receptor-ligand association behaves
   distinctly in the transport-and reaction-limited scenarios. To our
   knowledge, our results represent the first detailed quantification of
   physical regulation of the 2D on-rate that allows platelets to sense and
   respond to local changes in their hemodynamic environment. In addition,
   they provide an approach for determining the intrinsic kinetic
   parameters that employs simultaneous experimental measurements and
   theoretical modeling of bond association in a single assay. The 2D
   intrinsic forwardrate for VWF-A1-GPIb alpha association was determined
   from the measurements to be (3.5 +/- 0.67) x 10(-4) mu m(2) s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) investigation on the Mars Science
   Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover has detected oxidized nitrogen-bearing
   compounds during pyrolysis of scooped aeolian sediments and drilled
   sedimentary deposits within Gale crater. Total N concentrations ranged
   from 20 to 250 nmol N per sample. After subtraction of known N sources
   in SAM, our results support the equivalent of 110-300 ppm of nitrate in
   the Rocknest (RN) aeolian samples, and 70-260 and 330-1,100 ppm nitrate
   in John Klein (JK) and Cumberland (CB) mudstone deposits, respectively.
   Discovery of indigenous martian nitrogen in Mars surface materials has
   important implications for habitability and, specifically, for the
   potential evolution of a nitrogen cycle at some point in martian
   history. The detection of nitrate in both wind-drifted fines (RN) and in
   mudstone (JK, CB) is likely a result of N-2 fixation to nitrate
   generated by thermal shock from impact or volcanic plume lightning on
   ancient Mars. Fixed nitrogen could have facilitated the development of a
   primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars, potentially
   providing a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen.}},

Title = {{Axonal transport cargo motor count versus average transport velocity: Is
   fast versus slow transport really single versus multiple motor
   transport?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{370}},

Abstract = {{Cargos have been observed exhibiting a ``stop-and-go{''} behavior (i.e.
   cargo ``pause{''}), and it has generally been assumed that these
   multi-second pauses can be attributed to equally long pauses of
   cargo-bound motors during motor procession. We contend that a careful
   examination of the isolated microtubule experimental record does not
   support motor pauses. Rather, we believe that the data suggests that
   motor cargo complexes encounter an obstruction that prevents procession,
   eventually detach and reattach, with this obstructed-detach-reattach
   sequence being observed in axon as a ``pause.{''} Based on this, along
   with our quantitative evidence-based contention that slow and fast
   axonal transport are actually single and multi-motor transport, we have
   developed a cargo level motor model capable of exhibiting the full range
   of slow to fast transport solely by changing the number of motors
   involved. This computational model derived using first-order kinetics is
   suitable for both kinesin and dynein and includes load-dependence as
   well as provision for motors encountering obstacles to procession. The
   model makes the following specific predictions: average distance from
   binding to obstruction is about 10 mu m; average motor maximum velocity
   is at least 6 mu m/s in axon; a minimum of 10 motors is required for the
   fastest fast transport while only one motor is required for slow
   transport; individual in-vivo cargo-attached motors may spend as little
   as 5\% of their time processing along a microtubule with the remainder
   being spent either obstructed or unbound to a microtubule; and at least
   in the case of neurofilament transport, kinesin and dynein are largely
   not being in a ``tug-of-war{''} competition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Eyelashes are ubiquitous, although their function has long remained a
   mystery. In this study, we elucidate the aerodynamic benefits of
   eyelashes. Through anatomical measurements, we find that 22 species of
   mammals possess eyelashes of a length one-third the eye width. Wind
   tunnel experiments confirm that this optimal eyelash length reduces both
   deposition of airborne particles and evaporation of the tear film by a
   factor of two. Using scaling theory, we find this optimum arises because
   of the incoming flow's interactions with both the eye and eyelashes.
   Short eyelashes create a stagnation zone above the ocular surface that
   thickens the boundary layer, causing shear stress to decrease with
   increasing eyelash length. Long eyelashes channel flow towards the
   ocular surface, causing shear stress to increase with increasing eyelash
   length. These competing effects result in a minimum shear stress for
   intermediate eyelash lengths. This design may be employed in creating
   eyelash-inspired protection for optical sensors.}},

Title = {{Residual deformations in ocular tissues}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{105}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Residual deformations strongly influence the local biomechanical
   environment in a number of connective tissues. The sclera is known to be
   biomechanically important in healthy and diseased eyes, such as in
   glaucoma. Here, we study the residual deformations of the sclera, as
   well as the adjacent choroid and retina. Using freshly harvested porcine
   eyes, we developed two approaches of quantifying residual deformations
   in the spherically shaped tissues of interest. The first consisted of
   punching discs from the posterior wall of the eye and quantifying the
   changes in the area and eccentricity of these samples. The second
   consisted of cutting a ring from the equatorial sclera and making
   stress-relieving cuts in it. Measurements of curvature were made before
   and after the stress-relieving cuts. Using the first approach, we
   observed a 42\% areal contraction of the choroid, but only modest
   contractions of the sclera and retina. The observed contractions were
   asymmetric. In the second approach, we observed an opening of the
   scleral rings (approx. 10\% decrease in curvature). We conclude that
   residual bending deformations are present in the sclera, which we
   speculate may be due to radially heterogeneous growth and remodelling of
   the tissue during normal development. Further, residual areal
   deformations present in the choroid may be due to the network of elastic
   fibres in this tissue and residual deformations in the constituent
   vascular bed. Future studies of ocular biomechanics should attempt to
   include effects of these residual deformations into mechanical models in
   order to gain a better understanding of the biomechanics of the ocular
   wall.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium and zinc salts of epoxidized linolenic acid were synthesized and
   used as multifunctional additives, to minimize or prevent the reaction
   of epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) with liberated hydrochloric acid (HCl)
   during the thermal degradation of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) in
   particular. These metal epoxy salts were incorporated as thermal
   stabilizers for both diisodecyl phthalate and ESO-plasticized PVC blends
   that underwent thermal degradation studies at 170 degrees C. The overall
   performance of these metal epoxy salts was examined by thermal
   gravimetric analysis and visual color retention of the PVC blends. The
   weight loss profiles of the metal salt stabilized PVC were comparable to
   those of blends containing metal stearates. There were, however, vast
   improvements in color retention of the plasticized PVC using these novel
   additives. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015,

Abstract = {{One of the most commonly used methods for modeling multivariate time
   series is the vector autoregressive model (VAR). VAR is generally used
   to identify lead, lag, and contemporaneous relationships describing
   Granger causality within and between time series. In this article, we
   investigate the VAR methodology for analyzing data consisting of
   multilayer time series that are spatially interdependent. When modeling
   VAR relationships for such data, the dependence between time series is
   both a curse and a blessing. The former because it requires modeling the
   between time-series correlation or the contemporaneous relationships
   which may be challenging when using likelihood-based methods. The latter
   because the spatial correlation structure can be used to specify the
   lead-lag relationships within and between time series, within and
   between layers. To address these challenges, we propose an
   L-1\textbackslash{}L-2 regularized likelihood estimation method. The
   lead, lag, and contemporaneous relationships are estimated using an
   efficient algorithm that exploits sparsity in the VAR structure,
   accounts for the spatial dependence, and models the error dependence. We
   consider a case study to illustrate the applicability of our method. In
   the supplementary materials available online, we assess the performance
   of the proposed VAR model and compare it with existing methods within a
   simulation study.}},

Abstract = {{Any materials at temperatures higher than absolute zero emit
   electromagnetic waves due to the thermal fluctuations of free charges or
   ions. When two or more bodies at different temperatures are brought
   sufficiently close to each other with vacuum gap spacing smaller than
   the characteristic thermal wavelength, near-field radiative heat flux
   can exceed the far-field blackbody limit, governed by the well-known
   Stefan-Boltzmann law, by orders of magnitude. This article reviews the
   recent progress on both theoretical and experimental studies of
   near-field thermal radiation with an emphasis on its potential
   applications. Recent theoretical developments are presented, such as
   near-field radiation of general anisotropic materials and 2D materials,
   application condition of effective medium theory, and exact numerical
   methods for dealing with arbitrary particles or periodic nanostructures.
   Recent experimental achievements are also discussed, focusing on
   tip-plane and plane-plane configurations with various materials. The
   wide applications of near-field radiation are summarized in terms of
   thermal imaging, energy harvesting, and contactless thermal management
   such as modulation, rectification, and amplification. An outlook is
   provided on the promise of near-field thermal radiation in energy
   harvesting, novel thermal sources, and sensing, as well as the
   development of related fields such as reducing Casimir stiction,
   minimizing noise current, and increasing spontaneous emission rate.
   Challenges are also discussed, such as developing exact and fast
   computational techniques for complex metamaterials, understanding
   near-field radiation at extreme gap spacing, overcoming weak mode
   coupling in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems, measuring large-area
   plane-plane configuration at small gap spacing, and realizing devices
   based on near-field radiation.}},

Abstract = {{We present analysis, scaling and modelling based on a previously
   presented nonlinear nonlocal nematic elastica equation of disclination
   loop growth in nematic liquid crystals confined to conical geometries
   with homeotropic anchoring conditions. The +1/2 disclination loops arise
   during the well-known planar radial to planar polar texture
   transformation and are attached to +1 singular core disclination at two
   branch points. The shape of the +1/2 loops is controlled by the axial
   speed of the branch points and the bending stiffness of the disclination
   both of which being affected by the confinement gradients (reduction in
   cross-sectional area) of a conical geometry. Motion towards the cone
   apex results in faster branch point motions and weaker curvature
   changes, but motion away from the apex results in slower branch point
   motion and stronger curvature changes. The simultaneous action of these
   effects results in novel ovoidal disclination loops. The numerical
   results are condensed into useful power laws and integrated into a
   shape/energy analysis that reveals the effects of confinement and its
   gradient on ovoidal disclination loops. These new findings are useful to
   characterise the Frank elasticity of new nematic mesophases and to
   predict novel defect structures under complex confinement.}},

Abstract = {{The surface roughness represents the quality of ground surface since
   irregularities on the surface may form nucleation for cracks or
   corrosion and thus degrade the mechanical properties of the component.
   The surface generation mechanism in grinding of ceramic materials could
   behave as a mixture of plastic flow and brittle fracture, while the
   extent of the mixture hinges upon certain process parameters and
   material properties. The resulting surface profile can be distinctively
   different from these two mechanisms. In this article, a physics-based
   model is proposed to predict the surface roughness in grinding of
   ceramic materials considering the combined effect of brittle and ductile
   material removal. The random distribution of cutting edges is first
   described by a Rayleigh probability function. Afterwards, surface
   profile generated by brittle mode grinding is characterized via
   indentation mechanics approach. Last, the surface roughness is modeled
   through a probabilistic analysis of ductile and brittle generated
   surface profile. The model expresses the surface finish as a function of
   the wheel microstructure, the process conditions, and the material
   properties. The predictions are compared with experimental results from
   grinding of silicon carbide and silicon nitride workpieces (SiC and
   Si3N4, respectively) using a diamond wheel.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOMETRICS}},

Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Engineering model development involves several simplifying assumptions
   for the purpose of mathematical tractability, which are often not
   realistic in practice. This leads to discrepancies in the model
   predictions. A commonly used statistical approach to overcome this
   problem is to build a statistical model for the discrepancies between
   the engineering model and observed data. In contrast, an engineering
   approach would be to find the causes of discrepancy and fix the
   engineering model using first principles. However, the engineering
   approach is time consuming, whereas the statistical approach is fast.
   The drawback of the statistical approach is that it treats the
   engineering model as a black box and therefore, the statistically
   adjusted models lack physical interpretability. This article proposes a
   new framework for model calibration and statistical adjustment. It tries
   to open up the black box using simple main effects analysis and
   graphical plots and introduces statistical models inside the engineering
   model. This approach leads to simpler adjustment models that are
   physically more interpretable. The approach is illustrated using a model
   for predicting the cutting forces in a laser-assisted mechanical
   micro-machining process. This article has supplementary material online.}},

Abstract = {{Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an emerging Non Volatile Memory (NVM)
   technology that has the potential to provide scalable high-density
   memory systems. While the non volatility of PCM is a desirable property
   in order to save leakage power, it also has the undesirable effect of
   making PCM main memories susceptible to newer modes of security
   vulnerabilities, for example, accessibility to sensitive data if a PCM
   DIMM gets stolen. PCM memories can be made secure by encrypting the
   data. Unfortunately, such encryption comes with a significant overhead
   in terms of bits written to PCM memory, causing half of the bits in the
   line to change on every write, even if the actual number of bits being
   written to memory is small. Our studies show that a typical wrileback
   modifies, on average, only 12\% of the bits in the cachcline. Thus,
   encryption causes almost a 4x increase in the number of bits written to
   PCM memories. Such extraneous bit writes cause significant increase in
   write power, reduction in write endurance, and reduction in write
   bandwidth. To provide the benefit of secure memory in a write efficient
   manner this paper proposes Dual Counter Encryption (DEUCE). DEUCE is
   based on the observation that a typical writeback only changes a few
   words, so DEUCE re encrypts only the words that have changed. We show
   that DEUCE reduces the number of modified bits per writeback for a
   secure memory from 50\% to 24\%, which improves performance by 27\% and
   increases lifetime by 2x.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the adsorption of Na on graphene and graphene oxide,
   which are used as anode materials in sodium ion batteries, using density
   functional theory. The adsorption energy for Na on graphene was -0.507
   eV at the hollow sites, implying that adsorption was favorable. In the
   case of graphene oxide, Na atoms were separately adsorbed on the epoxide
   and hydroxyl functional groups. The adsorption of Na on graphene
   oxide-epoxide (adsorption energy of -1.024 eV) was found to be stronger
   than the adsorption of Na on pristine graphene. However, the adsorption
   of Na on graphene oxide-hydroxyl resulted in the generation of NaOH as a
   by-product. Using density of states (DOS) calculations, we found that
   the DOS of the Na-adsorbed graphene was shifted down more than that of
   the Na-adsorbed graphene oxide-epoxide. In addition, the intensity of
   the DOS around the Fermi level for the Na-adsorbed graphene was higher

Title = {{A Bacterial Gene, mms6, as a New Reporter Gene for Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging of Mammalian Cells}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for noninvasive, deep tissue
   imaging with high spatial resolution, making it an attractive modality
   for in vivo cellular imaging. Since reporter genes can generate magnetic
   resonance (MR) contrast based on molecular activity, they offer a
   potentially powerful tool for cellular imaging. The mms6 gene was
   originally identified in magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), which is known to
   play a key role in magnetic crystal formation. The purpose of the
   present work was to investigate the possibility of using mms6 as an MR
   reporter gene. We established a transgenic mammalian cell line that
   stably expresses mms6. In vitro experiments show that mms6-expressing
   cells form clusters of nanoparticles within and outside
   membrane-enclosed structures and produce changes in MR contrast, most
   likely by increasing iron uptake of intracellular iron. Additionally, in
   vivo MRI experiments demonstrate that mms6-expressing tumors can be
   distinguished from parental tumors not expressing mms6, even in the
   absence of exogenous iron supplementation. Our results demonstrate that
   mms6 can function as an MR reporter gene with the potential to monitor
   gene expression and to visualize the proliferation, migration, and
   metastasis of tumor cells expressing it.}},

   in Normal and Diseased States}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fibrin is an extracellular matrix protein that is responsible for
   maintaining the structural integrity of blood clots. Much research has
   been done on fibrin in the past years to include the investigation of
   synthesis, structure-function, and lysis of clots. However, there is
   still much unknown about the morphological and structural features of
   clots that ensue from patients with disease. In this research study,
   experimental techniques are presented that allow for the examination of
   morphological differences of abnormal clot structures due to diseased
   states such as diabetes and sickle cell anemia. Our study focuses on the
   preparation and evaluation of fibrin clots in order to assess
   morphological differences using various experimental assays and confocal
   microscopy. In addition, a method is also described that allows for
   continuous, real-time calculation of lysis rates in fibrin clots. The
   techniques described herein are important for researchers and clinicians
   seeking to elucidate comorbid thrombotic pathologies such as myocardial
   infarctions, ischemic heart disease, and strokes in patients with
   diabetes or sickle cell disease.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a nonlinear adaptive position and attitude-tracking
   controller for satellite proximity operations between a target and a
   chaser satellite. The controller requires no information about the mass
   and inertia matrix of the chaser satellite and takes into account the
   gravitational acceleration, the gravity-gradient torque, the perturbing
   acceleration due to Earth's oblateness, and constant (but otherwise
   unknown) disturbance forces and torques. Sufficient conditions to
   identify the mass and inertia matrix of the chaser satellite are also
   given. The controller is shown to ensure almost global asymptotical
   stability of the translational and rotational position and velocity
   tracking errors. Unit dual quaternions are used to simultaneously
   represent the absolute and relative attitude and position of the target
   and chaser satellites. The analogies between quaternions and dual

Title = {{Analysis of Friction Induced Thermo-Mechanical Stresses on a Heat

Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In most analytical and numerical models of heat exchanger piles, strain
   incompatibilities between the soil and the pile are neglected, and axial
   stresses imposed by temperature changes within the pile are attributed
   to the thermal elongation and shortening of the pile. These models
   incorporate thermo-hydro-mechanical couplings in the soil and within the
   pile foundation, but usually neglect thermo-mechanical couplings between
   the two media. Previous studies assume that the stress changes imposed
   by temperature variations in a heat exchanger pile are mainly due to the
   constrained thermal elongation and shortening of the pile. Also, several
   recent approaches utilize spring models that focus only on the soil-pile
   interface in modeling temperature-induced stresses in a heat exchanger
   pile and implicitly ignore the effect of the full displacement field on
   soil-pile interaction. By contrast, in this paper, interface elements
   are introduced in a numerical model of a heat exchanger pile, analyzed
   in axisymmetric and stationary conditions. The pile is subjected to a
   uniform temperature increase, with free top and fixed top conditions in
   elastic and elasto-plastic soil profiles. Simulation results show that
   the constrained vertical elongation is the most detrimental factor for
   pile foundation performance. However it is worth noticing that while
   mechanical constraints (e.g., fixed top and/or fixed bottom) impose
   maximum stress increases at the ends of the pile, interface effects
   result in maximum stresses around the mid-length of the pile. This
   preliminary study indicates that soil-pile friction does not increase
   pile internal stresses to the point where it would be necessary to
   over-dimension the foundation pile for heat exchanger use. Furthermore,
   one cannot expect a significant gain in foundation performance due to
   the improvement of soil-pile frictional resistance as a result of
   increased lateral stresses at soil-pile contact. Additional numerical
   analyses are ongoing, in order to investigate the role of the degree of
   fixity induced by the building on the heat exchanger pile, and to extend
   these preliminary analyses to transient operational modes and cyclic
   thermo-mechanical loading of the heat exchanger pile.}},

Abstract = {{Creep processes in halite (salt rock) include glide, cross-slip,
   diffusion and dynamic recrystallization. Diffusive mass transfer (DMT)
   can result in crack rebonding, and mechanical stiffness recovery. Crack
   rebonding driven by DMT occurs within a few days at room temperature and
   low pressure. DMT is enhanced at higher temperatures, which could be
   beneficial for the sustainabilty of geological storage facilities in
   salt mines. On the one hand, visco-plastic laws relating creep
   microscopic processes to microstructure changes are empirical. On the
   other hand, theoretical models of damage and healing disconnect
   thermodynamic variables from their physical meaning. The proposed model
   enriches the framework of continuum damage mechanics with fabric
   descriptors. In order to infer the form of fabric tensors from
   microstructure observation, creep tests were carried out on granular
   salt under constant stress and humidity conditions. The evolution of net
   damage is governed by a diffusion equation, in which the characteristic
   time scales with the typical size of halite crystals, and the diffusion
   coefficient is a function of temperature. A stress path comprising a
   tensile loading, a compressive unloading, a creep-healing stage and a
   reloading was simulated. Macroscopic and microscopic model predictions
   highlight the increased efficiency of healing with time and temperature.
   The model presented in this paper is expected to improve the fundamental
   understanding of damage and healing in rocks at both macroscopic and
   microscopic levels, and the long-term assessment of geological storage
   facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Scavenging biomechanical energy from human motions as a mobile power
   source has potential applications for driving some personal electronics,
   especially in the remote areas. A critical issue is how to obtain high
   efficient electric energy from one mechanical motion. Here, we report a
   rotating-disk-based hybridized nanogenerator that consists of an
   electromagnetic generator (EMG) and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   for simultaneously scavenging biomechanical energy from one rotating
   motion. Operated at a rotating rate of 200 r/min, the EMG and TENG can
   produce an output powers of about 8.4 mW (in correspondence of power per
   unit mass/volume: 24 mu W/g and 56 W/m(3)) at a loading resistance of 12
   Omega and 8.6 mW (in correspondence of power per unit mass/volume: 119
   mu W/g and 261 W/m(3)) at a loading resistance of 0.2 M Omega,
   respectively. The generated electrical energy of the hybridized
   nanogenerator is about two times larger than that of individual energy
   harvesting unit (EMG or TENG) under the same working time. The
   hybridized nanogenerator can be utilized to effectively harness the
   biomechanical energy from a human hand induced rotating motions for
   sustainably driving a commercial globe light with an intensity of
   illumination up to 1700 lx. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The 2009 multiwavelength campaign on Mrk 421: Variability and
   correlation studies}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{576}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aims. We perform an extensive characterization of the broadband emission
   of Mrk 421, as well as its temporal evolution, during the non-flaring
   (low) state. The high brightness and nearby location (z = 0.031) of Mrk
   421 make it an excellent laboratory to study blazar emission. The goal
   is to learn about the physical processes responsible for the typical
   emission of Mrk 421, which might also be extended to other blazars that
   are located farther away and hence are more difficult to study.
   Methods. We performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign on Mrk 421
   between January 2009 and June 2009, which included VLBA, F-GAMMA,
   GASP-WEBT, Swift, RXTE, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and Whipple, among other
   instruments and collaborations. This extensive radio to very-high-energy
   (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray dataset provides excellent temporal and
   energy coverage, which allows detailed studies of the evolution of the
   broadband spectral energy distribution.
   Results. Mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring) activity state,
   with a VHE flux of about half that of the Crab Nebula, yet the light
   curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highest
   variability being in the X-rays. We determined the power spectral
   densities (PSD) at most wavelengths and found that all PSDs can be
   described by power-laws without a break, and with indices consistent
   with pink/red-noise behavior. We observed a harder-when-brighter
   behavior in the X-ray spectra and measured a positive correlation
   between VHE and X-ray fluxes with zero time lag. Such characteristics
   have been reported many times during flaring activity, but here they are
   reported for the first time in the non-flaring state. We also observed
   an overall anti-correlation between optical /UV and X-rays extending
   over the duration of the campaign.
   Conclusions. The harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and
   the measured positive X-ray/VHE correlation during the 2009
   multiwavelength campaign suggests that the physical processes dominating
   the emission during non-flaring states have similarities with those
   occurring during flaring activity. In particular, this observation
   supports leptonic scenarios as being responsible for the emission of Mrk
   421 during non-flaring activity. Such a temporally extended X-ray /VHE
   correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, and hence is
   difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. The highest
   variability is observed in the X-ray band, which, within the one-zone
   synchrotron self-Compton scenario, indicates that the electron energy
   distribution is most variable at the highest energies.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive surgical resection is the primary therapy for glioma.
   However, aggressive resection may compromise functional healthy brain
   tissue. Currently, there are no objective cues for surgeons to
   distinguish healthy tissue from tumor and determine tumor borders;
   surgeons skillfully rely on subjective means such as tactile feedback.
   This often results in incomplete resection and recurrence. The objective
   of the present study was to design, develop, and evaluate, in vitro and
   in vivo, a nanoencapsulated visible dye for intraoperative, visual
   delineation of tumor margins in an invasive tumor model. Liposomal
   nanocarriers containing Evans blue dye (nano-EB) were developed,
   characterized, and tested for safety in vitro and in vivo. 3RT1RT2A
   glioma cells were implanted into brains of Fischer 344 rats. Nano-EB or
   EB solution was injected via tail vein into tumor-bearing animals. To
   assess tumor staining, tissue samples were analyzed visibly and using
   fluorescence microscopy. Area, perimeter ratios, and Manders overlap
   coefficients were calculated to quantify extent of staining. Nano-EB
   clearly marked tumor margins in the invasive tumor model. Area ratio of
   nano-EB staining to tumor was 0.89 +/- 0.05, perimeter ratio was 0.94
   +/- 0.04, Manders R was 0.51 +/- 0.08, and M1 was 0.97 +/- 0.06.
   Microscopic tumor border inspection under high magnification verified
   that nano-EB did not stain healthy tissue. Nano-EB clearly aids in
   distinguishing tumor tissue from healthy tissue in an invasive tumor
   model, while injection of unencapsulated EB results in false
   identification of healthy tissue as tumor due to diffusion of dye from
   the tumor into healthy tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Biofunctionalized polyethylene glycol maleimide (PEG-MAL) hydrogels were
   engineered as a platform to deliver pancreatic islets to the small bowel
   mesentery and promote graft vascularization. VEGF, a potent stimulator
   of angiogenesis, was incorporated into the hydrogel to be released in an
   on-demand manner through enzymatic degradation. PEG-MAL hydrogel enabled
   extended in vivo release of VEGF. Isolated rat islets encapsulated in
   PEG-MAL hydrogels remained viable in culture and secreted insulin.
   Islets encapsulated in PEG-MAL matrix and transplanted to the small
   bowel mesentery of healthy rats grafted to the host tissue and
   revascularized by 4 weeks. Addition of VEGF release to the PEG-MAL
   matrix greatly augmented the vascularization response. These results
   establish PEG-MAL engineered matrices as a vascular-inductive cell
   delivery vehicle and warrant their further investigation as islet
   transplantation vehicles in diabetic animal models.}},

Abstract = {{The geometric shape of an element plays a key role in computational
   methods. Triangular and quadrilateral shaped elements are utilized by
   standard finite element methods. The pioneering work of Wachspress laid
   the foundation for polygonal interpolants which introduced polygonal
   elements. Tessellations may be considered as the next stage of element
   shape evolution. In this work, we investigate the topology optimization
   of tessellations as a means to coalesce art and engineering. We mainly
   focus on M.C. Escher's tessellations using recognizable figures. To
   solve the state equation, we utilize a Mimetic Finite Difference
   inspired approach, known as the Virtual Element Method. In this
   approach, the stiffness matrix is constructed in such a way that the
   displacement patch test is passed exactly in order to ensure optimum
   numerical convergence rates. Prior to exploring the artistic aspects of
   topology optimization designs, numerical verification studies such as
   the displacement patch test and shear loaded cantilever beam bending
   problem are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the present
   approach in two-dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve ambitious cuts in energy consumptions of the building sector,
   recent efforts have focused on devising methods that can provide
   accurate representation of the as-is conditions for existing buildings
   and in turn increase the quality and effectiveness of building
   retrofits. Today, 3D geometrical models produced by computer vision and
   laser scanning methods can be used as the basis of energy modeling
   purposes. Several methods are also introduced to facilitate the
   diagnostics and measurement of the thermal and other environmental
   conditions. To this end, this paper extensively reviews the
   state-of-the-art techniques that can semi-automatically or automatically
   create as-is geometrical and thermal models for building energy modeling
   and retrofit assessment purposes. It also provides an overview on the
   main algorithms used by these methods for representing spatio-thermal
   point clouds, automatically converting these point clouds into semantic
   Building Information Models (BIM) in gbXML format for as-is energy
   modeling purposes, and also contrasting them with expected energy
   performance models. The underlying formulations and methods for
   measuring actual thermal resistance of the building assemblies and
   mapping them into gbXML-based representations are also presented. The
   most recent works in the IT-driven building automation system (BAS) for
   energy conservation purposes are also reviewed. Finally, the technology
   gaps that need to be addressed in future research are identified and
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Timely and accurate monitoring of onsite construction operations can
   bring an immediate awareness on project specific issues. It provides
   practitioners with the information they need to easily and quickly make
   project control decisions. Despite their importance, the current
   practices are still time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors. To
   facilitate the process of collecting and analyzing performance data,
   researchers have focused on devising methods that can semi-automatically
   or automatically assess ongoing operations both at project level and
   operation level. A major line of work has particularly focused on
   developing computer vision techniques that can leverage still images,
   time-lapse photos and video streams for documenting the work in
   progress. To this end, this paper extensively reviews these
   state-of-the-art vision-based construction performance monitoring
   methods. Based on the level of information perceived and the types of
   output, these methods are mainly divided into two categories (namely
   project level: visual monitoring of civil infrastructure or building
   elements vs. operation level: visual monitoring of construction
   equipment and workers). The underlying formulations and assumptions used
   in these methods are discussed in detail. Finally the gaps in knowledge
   that need to be addressed in future research are identified. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Quantitative imaging has become a vital technique in biological
   discovery and clinical diagnostics; a plethora of tools have recently
   been developed to enable new and accelerated forms of biological
   investigation. Increasingly, the capacity for high-throughput
   experimentation provided by new imaging modalities, contrast techniques,
   microscopy tools, microfluidics and computer controlled systems shifts
   the experimental bottleneck from the level of physical manipulation and
   raw data collection to automated recognition and data processing. Yet,
   despite their broad importance, image analysis solutions to address
   these needs have been narrowly tailored. Here, we present a
   generalizable formulation for autonomous identification of specific
   biological structures that is applicable for many problems. The process
   flow architecture we present here utilizes standard image processing
   techniques and the multi-tiered application of classification models
   such as support vector machines (SVM). These low-level functions are
   readily available in a large array of image processing software packages
   and programming languages. Our framework is thus both easy to implement
   at the modular level and provides specific high-level architecture to
   guide the solution of more complicated image-processing problems. We
   demonstrate the utility of the classification routine by developing two
   specific classifiers as a toolset for automation and cell identification
   in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. To serve a common need for
   automated high-resolution imaging and behavior applications in the C.
   elegans research community, we contribute a ready-to-use classifier for
   the identification of the head of the animal under bright field imaging.
   Furthermore, we extend our framework to address the pervasive problem of
   cell-specific identification under fluorescent imaging, which is
   critical for biological investigation in multicellular organisms or
   tissues. Using these examples as a guide, we envision the broad utility
   of the framework for diverse problems across different length scales and
   imaging methods.}},

Abstract = {{We report a comparative study of the device performance of III-nitride
   (III-N) heterojunction field-effect transistors (HFETs) and
   metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MISFETs). The
   influence of a remote-oxygen-plasma treatment was investigated. The
   plasma-treated recessed-gate HFETs and MISFETs show normally-off
   characteristics with higher peak transconductance, lower sub-threshold
   slope, smaller hysteresis. An on-off ratio greater than 2.2E11 with a
   significant suppression of gate leakage can be achieved in
   plasma-treated III-N MISFETs. A drain current transient measurement was
   performed to analyze the traps in these devices and possible origins of
   these traps are studied. Six traps with characteristic time constants
   (tau) ranging from 180 s to 3 ms are identified in both HFETs and
   MISFETs, in addition to a trap which is associated with the ALD-grown
   gate dielectrics for the MISFETs. The results suggest that improved
   device performance in these plasma-treated III-N FETs is attributed to
   the reduced trap states with tau < 400 ms, which are located on III-N
   surfaces. The slower traps (tau > 2 s) cannot be reduced by the plasma
   treatment and are related to the oxygen and carbon impurities and the
   buffer traps in the bulk semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is a developing field of surgical and
   oncologic research. Practically, FGS has shown useful applications in
   urologic surgery, benign biliary surgery, colorectal cancer liver
   metastasis resection, and ovarian cancer debulking. Most notably in in
   cancer surgery, FGS allows for the clear delineation of cancerous tissue
   from benign tissue. FGS requires the utilization of a fluorescent
   contrast agent and an intraoperative fluorescence imaging device (IFID).
   Currently available IFIDs are expensive, unable to work with multiple
   fluorophores, and can be cumbersome. This study aims to describe the
   development and utility of a small, cost-efficient, and interchangeable
   IFID made from commercially available components. Extensive research was
   done to design and construct a light-weight, portable, and
   cost-effective IFID. We researched the capabilities, size, and cost of
   several camera types and eventually decided on a near-infrared (NIR)
   charged couple device (CCD) camera for its overall profile. The small
   portable interchangeable imager of fluorescence (SPIIF) is a ``scout{''}
   IFID system for FGS. The main components of the SPIIF are a NIR CCD
   camera with an articulating light filter. These components and a LED
   light source with an attached heat sink are mounted on a small metal
   platform. The system is connected to a laptop by a USB 2.0 cable.
   Pixielink (c) software on the laptop runs the system by controlling
   exposure time, gain, and image capture. After developing the system, we
   evaluated its utility as an IFID. The system weighs less than two pounds
   and can cover a large area. Due to its small size, it is easily made
   sterile by covering it with any sterile plastic sheet. To determine the
   system's ability to detect fluorescent signal, we used the SPIIF to
   detect indocyanine green under ex and in-vivo conditions and fluorescein
   under ex-vivo conditions. We found the SPIIF was able to detect both ICG
   and fluorescein under different depths of a semi-opaque colloid. Second,
   we found that a concentration as low as 0.5 g/ml of indocyanine green
   dissolved in plasma was detectable. Lastly, in a murine and human cancer
   model, the SPIIF was able to detect indocyanine green signal within
   tumors and generate a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 3.75. This
   study shows that a low-cost IFID can be made from commercially available
   parts. Second, this IFID is capable of in and ex-vivo detection of
   multiple fluorophores without sacrificing its small size or favorable
   ergonomics.}},

Abstract = {{We report a hybridized electromagnetic triboelectric nanogenerator for
   highly efficient scavenging of biomechanical energy to sustainably power
   wearable electronics by human walking. Based on the effective
   conjunction of triboelectrification and electromagnetic induction, the
   hybridized nanogenerator, with dimensions of 5 cm x 5 cm x 2.5 cm and a
   light weight of 60 g, integrates a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   that can deliver a peak output power of 4.9 mW under a loading
   resistance of 6 M Omega and an electromagnetic generator (EMG) that can
   deliver a peak output power of 3.5 mW under a loading resistance of 2 k
   Omega. The hybridized nanogenerator exhibits a good stability for the
   output performance and a much better charging performance than that of
   an individual energy-harvesting unit (TENG or EMG). Furthermore, the
   hybridized nanogenerator integrated in a commercial shoe has been
   utilized to harvest biomechanical energy induced by human walking to
   directly light up tens of light-emitting diodes in the shoe and
   sustainably power a smart pedometer for reading the data of a walking
   step, distance, and energy consumption. A wireless pedometer driven by
   the hybrid nanogenerator can work well to send the walking data to an
   iPhone under the distance of 25 m. This work pushes forward a
   significant step toward energy harvesting from human walking and its

Abstract = {{A 125 mu m thickness, rollable, paper-based triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG) has been developed for harvesting sound wave energy, which is
   capable of delivering a maximum power density of 121 mW/m(2) and 968
   W/m(3) under a sound pressure of 117 dB(SPL). The TENG is designed in
   the contact-separation mode using membranes that have rationally
   designed holes at one side. The TENG can be implemented onto a
   commercial cell phone for acoustic energy harvesting from human talking;
   the electricity generated can be used to charge a capacitor at a rate of
   0.144 V/s. Additionally, owing to the superior advantages of a broad
   working bandwidth, thin structure, and flexibility, a self-powered
   microphone for sound recording with rolled structure is demonstrated for
   all-sound recording without an angular dependence. The concept and
   design presented in this work can be extensively applied to a variety of
   other circumstances for either energy-harvesting or sensing purposes,
   for example, wearable and flexible electronics, military surveillance,
   jet engine noise reduction, low-cost implantable human ear, and wireless

Abstract = {{We report a hybridized nanogenerator with dimensions of 6.7 cm x 4.5 cm
   x 2 cm and a weight of 42.3 g that consists of two triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs) and two electromagnetic generators (EMGs) for
   scavenging air-flow energy. Under an air-flow speed of about 18 m/s, the
   hybridized nanogenerator can deliver largest output powers of 3.5 mW for
   one TENG (in correspondence of power per unit mass/volume: 8.8 mW/g and
   14.6 kW/m(3)) at a loading resistance of 3 MQ and 1.8 tinW for one EMG
   (in correspondence of power per unit mass/volume: 0.3 mW/g and 0.4
   kW/m(3)) at a loading resistance of 2 K2, respectively. The hybridized
   nanogenerator can be utilized to charge a capacitor of 3300 mu F to
   sustainably power four temperature sensors for realizing self-powered
   temperature sensor networks. Moreover, a wireless temperature sensor
   driven by a hybridized nanogenerator charged Li-ion battery can work
   well to send the temperature data to a receiver/computer at a distance
   of 1.5 m. This work takes a significant step toward air-flow energy
   harvesting and its potential applications in self-powered wireless

Abstract = {{A growing body of evidence suggests that the developmental process of
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is co-opted by cancer cells
   to metasta-size to distant sites. This transition is associated with
   morphologic elongation and loss of cell-cell adhesions, though little is
   known about how it alters cell biophysical properties critical for
   migration. Here, we use multiple-particle tracking (MPT) microrheology
   and traction force cytometry to probe how genetic induction of EMT in
   epithelial MCF7 breast cancer cells changes their intracellular
   stiffness and extracellular force exertion, respectively, relative to an
   empty vector control. This analysis demonstrated that EMT alone was
   sufficient to produce dramatic cytoskeletal softening coupled with
   increases in cell-exerted traction forces. Microarray analysis revealed
   that these changes corresponded with down-regulation of genes associated
   with actin cross-linking and up-regulation of genes associated with
   actomyosin contraction. Finally, we show that this loss of structural
   integrity to expedite migration could inhibit mesenchymal cell
   proliferation in a secondary tumor as it accumulates solid stress. This
   work demonstrates that not only does EMT enable escape from the primary
   tumor through loss of cell adhesions but it also induces a concerted
   series of biophysical changes enabling enhanced migration of cancer
   cells after detachment from the primary tumor.}},

Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Although requiring prior knowledge makes the ideal binary mask an
   impractical algorithm, substantial increases in measured intelligibility
   make it a desirable benchmark. While this benchmark has been studied
   extensively, many questions remain about the factors that influence the
   intelligibility of binary-masked speech with non-ideal masks. To date,
   researchers have used primarily uniformly random, uncorrelated mask
   errors and independently presented error types (i.e., false positives
   and negatives) to characterize the influence of estimation errors on
   intelligibility. However, practical estimation algorithms produce masks
   that contain errors of both types and with non-trivial amounts of
   structure. This paper introduces an investigation framework for binary
   masks and presents listener studies that use this framework to
   illustrate how interactions between error types and structure affect
   intelligibility. First, this study demonstrates that clustering (i.e., a
   form of structure) of mask errors reduces intelligibility. Furthermore,
   while previous research has suggested that false positives are more
   detrimental to intelligibility than false negatives, this study
   indicates that false negatives can be equally detrimental to
   intelligibility when they contain structure or when both error types are
   present. Finally, this study shows that listeners tolerate fewer mask
   errors when both types of errors are present, especially when the errors
   contain structure. (c) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.}},

   conductivity measurements}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Error and uncertainty in Raman thermal conductivity measurements are
   investigated via finite element based numerical simulation of two
   geometries often employed-Joule-heating of a wire and laser-heating of a
   suspended wafer. Using this methodology, the accuracy and precision of
   the Raman-derived thermal conductivity are shown to depend on (1)
   assumptions within the analytical model used in the deduction of thermal
   conductivity, (2) uncertainty in the quantification of heat flux and
   temperature, and (3) the evolution of thermomechanical stress during
   testing. Apart from the influence of stress, errors of 5\% coupled with
   uncertainties of +/- 15\% are achievable for most materials under
   conditions typical of Raman thermometry experiments. Error can increase
   to >20\%, however, for materials having highly temperature dependent
   thermal conductivities or, in some materials, when thermomechanical
   stress develops concurrent with the heating. A dimensionless
   parameter-termed the Raman stress factor-is derived to identify when
   stress effects will induce large levels of error. Taken together, the
   results compare the utility of Raman based conductivity measurements
   relative to more established techniques while at the same time
   identifying situations where its use is most efficacious. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Many applications of ultrasound for sensing, actuation and imaging
   require miniaturized and low power transducers and transducer arrays
   integrated with electronic systems. Piezoelectric micromachined
   ultrasound transducers (PMUTs), diaphragm-like thin film flexural
   transducers typically formed on silicon substrates, are a potential
   solution for integrated transducer arrays. This paper presents an
   overview of the current development status of PMUTs and a discussion of
   their suitability for miniaturized and integrated devices. The thin film
   piezoelectric materials required to functionalize these devices are
   discussed, followed by the microfabrication techniques used to create
   PMUT elements and the constraints the fabrication imposes on device
   design. Approaches for electrical interconnection and integration with
   on-chip electronics are discussed. Electrical and acoustic measurements
   from fabricated PMUT arrays with up to 320 diaphragm elements are
   presented. The PMUTs are shown to be broadband devices with an operating
   frequency which is tunable by tailoring the lateral dimensions of the
   flexural membrane or the thicknesses of the constituent layers. Finally,
   the outlook for future development of PMUT technology and the potential
   applications made feasible by integrated PMUT devices are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiologic studies utilizing source apportionment (SA) of fine
   particulate matter have shown that particles from certain sources might
   bemore detrimental to health than others; however, it is difficult to
   quantify the uncertainty associated with a given SA approach. In the
   present study, we examined associations between source contributions of
   fine particulate matter and emergency department visits for pediatric
   asthma in Atlanta, Georgia (20022010) using a novel ensemble-based SA
   technique. Six daily source contributions from 4 SA approaches were
   combined into an ensemble source contribution. To better account for
   exposure uncertainty, 10 source profiles were sampled from their
   posterior distributions, resulting in 10 time series with daily SA
   concentrations. For each of these time series, Poisson generalized
   linear models with varying lag structures were used to estimate the
   health associations for the 6 sources. The rate ratios for the
   source-specific health associations from the 10 imputed source
   contribution time series were combined, resulting in health associations
   with inflated confidence intervals to better account for exposure
   uncertainty. Adverse associations with pediatric asthma were observed
   for 8-day exposure to particles generated from diesel-fueled vehicles
   (rate ratio = 1.06, 95\% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.10) and
   gasoline-fueled vehicles (rate ratio = 1.10, 95\% confidence interval:
   1.04, 1.17).}},

Abstract = {{Many physical devices used in VLC systems exhibit nonlinear effects,
   which can significantly degrade the overall system performance. For
   example, the LED is the major source of nonlinearity. The forward
   current is zero unless the forward voltage exceeds a turn-on value. The
   forward current is also limited with a maximum permissible value. In
   addition, the electrical-to-optical conversion is also nonlinear. In
   this article, we provide an overview of techniques related to modeling
   and distortion mitigation techniques of the nonlinearity in VLC systems.
   Appropriate models and robust nonlinearity mitigation techniques are

Abstract = {{A novel ferruginous active absorbent, prepared by fly ash, industrial
   lime and the additive Fe(VI), was introduced for synchronous abatement
   of binary mixtures of SO2-NOx from simulated coal-fired flue gas. The
   synergistic action of various factors on the absorption of SO2 and NOx
   was investigated. The results show that a strong synergistic effect
   exists between Fe(VI) dose and reaction temperature for the
   desulfurization. It was observed that in the denitration process, the
   synergy of Fe(VI) dose and Ca/(S + N) had the most significant impact on
   the removal of NO, followed by the synergy of Fe(VI) and reaction
   temperature, and then the synergy of reaction temperature and flue gas
   humidity. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an accessory X-ray
   energy spectrometer (EDS) were used to observe the surface
   characteristics of the raw and spent absorbent as well as fly ash. A
   reaction mechanism was proposed based on chemical analysis of sulfur and
   nitrogen species concentrations in the spent absorbent. The Gibbs free
   energy, equilibrium constants and partial pressures of the SO2-NOx
   binary system were determined by thermodynamics. (C) 2015 The Research

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the throughput and delay scaling laws for
   cognitive radio network with static primary users and heterogeneous
   mobile secondary users coexist in the unit planar region for both
   without base-station case and with base-station case. The primary
   network consists of n randomly and uniformly distributed static primary
   users with higher priority to access the spectrum. The secondary network
   consists of m = (h + 1)n(1+epsilon) heterogeneous mobile secondary users
   with h = O(log n)(1) and epsilon > 0, which should access the spectrum
   opportunistically. Each secondary user moves within a circular region,
   centered at its home-point with a restricted speed. The moving region of
   each mobile SU is n(-alpha), where alpha is a random variable following
   the discrete uniform distribution with h + 1 different values, ranging
   from 0 to alpha(0)(alpha(0) > 0). We propose a scheme which consists of
   routing and scheduling schemes and show that the primary network and
   secondary network can achieve near-optimal throughput and delay scalings
   if we increase the heterogeneity of secondary users. In this
   near-optimal condition, both the primary network and part of the
   secondary network can achieve constant throughput and delay scalings
   except for poly-logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we study the case that
   there are n(beta) uniformly distributed static base-stations (BSs) where
   beta > 0 and propose the corresponding scheme for PUs, SUs and BSs.
   Finally, the theoretical results indicate that if beta is large enough,
   BSs can improve the throughput and delay performance by relaying packets
   through cable backhaul.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular Communication (MC) is a nano-scale communication paradigm
   where the information is carried by molecular signals. To establish
   information transmission using molecules, biological nanomachines can be
   utilized as transmitters and receivers. A bacteria can be programmed as
   a biotransceiver by modifying their genetic code to implement biological
   circuits. In this paper, genetically engineered bacteria-based
   biotransceivers are investigated for MC, where bacteria can generate and
   respond to the molecular signals. A biochemical model of biological
   circuits is presented, and both analog and digital signaling are
   studied. The challenges in connecting basic biological circuits to build
   these blocks are revealed. A biotransceiver architecture is introduced
   that combines sensing, transmitting, receiving and processing blocks.
   Furthermore, biological circuit design framework is proposed for
   transmission of signals with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation. The
   biological circuits designed for biotransceiver are elaborated via
   numerical results based on biochemical parameters of the genetically
   engineered bacteria. The provided results show that using biological
   circuits, bacteria can function as a transmitter and receiver node for
   MC. Our work stands as a basis for future biotransceiver design for MC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a full-wave transient domain decomposition method is
   proposed for solving multiscale electromagnetic problems. The proposed
   scheme is based on the unconditionally stable Laguerre finite-difference
   time-domain (Laguerre-FDTD) method. The entire computational domain is
   partitioned into several subdomains with independent meshing according
   to the physical sizes of each subdomain. Standard Laguerre-FDTD method
   is used to form the interior field equations of each subdomain, whereas
   interface field equations are formed by applying the equivalency between
   finite-element method and FDTD method. In addition, field continuity is
   enforced through the use of two sets of Lagrange multipliers at the
   domain interface. Schur complement is implemented for extracting the
   interface problem and each domain can be evaluated independently.
   Numerical results for multiscale structures are presented to demonstrate
   the capability, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Proton radiation damage and short-term annealing are investigated for
   lithium niobite (LiNbO2) mixed electronic-ionic memristors. Radiation
   damage and short-term annealing were characterized using Electrochemical
   Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to determine changes in the device
   resistance and the lithium ion mobility. The radiation damage resulted
   in a 0.48\% change in the resistance at a fluence of 10(14) cm(-2).
   In-situ short-term annealing at room temperature reduced the net
   detrimental effect of the damage with a time constant of about 9
   minutes. The radiation damage mechanism is attributed predominantly to
   displacement damage at the niobium and oxygen sites trapping lithium
   ions that are responsible for induced polarization within the material.
   Short term annealing is attributed to room temperature thermal annealing
   of these defects, freeing the highly mobile lithium ions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for removing motion blur from images
   captured by a fast-moving robot eye. Existing image techniques focused
   on recovering blurry images due to camera shake with long exposure time.
   In addition, previous studies relied solely on properties of the images
   or used external sensors to estimate a blur kernel, or point spread
   function (PSF). This paper focuses on estimating a latent image from the
   blur images taken by the robotic camera orientation system. A
   PZT-driven, compliant camera orientation system was employed to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Discrete switching
   commands were given to the robotic system to create a rapid
   point-to-point motion while suppressing the vibration with a faster
   response. The blurry images were obtained when the robotic system
   created a rapid point-to-point motion, like human saccadic motion. This
   paper proposes a method for estimating the PSF in knowledge of system
   dynamics and input commands, resulting in a faster estimation. The
   proposed method was investigated under various motion conditions using
   the single-degree-of-freedom camera orientation system to verify the
   effectiveness and was compared with other approaches quantitatively and
   qualitatively. The experiment results show that overall the performance
   metric of the proposed method was 27.77\% better than conventional
   methods. The computation time of the proposed method was 50 times faster
   than that of conventional methods.}},

   flow-modulate epitaxy. BAlN single layers with clearly defined X-ray
   diffraction peaks were achieved on AlN templates which are appropriate
   substrates for deep UV devices, as well as on GaN templates to
   facilitate distinguishing of the XRD peak of BAlN from the substrate
   peak. The layer demonstrated columnar crystalline features and inherited
   wurtzite structure from substrates. Cross-section STEM image (bright

Abstract = {{This study explores the relationship between historical exposure to the
   built environment and current vehicle ownership patterns. The influence
   of past exposure to the built environment on current vehicle ownership
   decisions may be causal, but there are alternative explanations.
   Households may primarily select to live in neighborhoods that facilitate
   their vehicle ownership preferences, or they may retain preferences that
   they have developed in the past, irrespective of their current
   situations. This study seeks to control for these alternative
   explanations by including the built environment attributes of
   households' past residences as an influence on vehicle ownership
   choices. We use a dataset from a credit reporting firm that contains up
   to nine previous residential ZIP codes for households currently living
   in the 13-county Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Results show that
   past location is significant, but of marginal influence relative to the
   attributes of the current location. From a practical perspective, our
   results suggest that models that include current but not past
   neighborhood attributes (also controlling for standard socioeconomic
   variables) can forecast vehicle ownership decisions reasonably well.
   However, models that include both current and past neighborhood
   attributes can provide a more nuanced understanding of the built
   environment's potentially causal influences on vehicle ownership
   decisions. This better understanding may provide more realistic
   forecasts of responses to densification or other travel demand
   management strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallization chaperones are attracting increasing interest as a route
   to crystal growth and structure elucidation of difficult targets such as
   membrane proteins. While strategies to date have typically employed
   protein-specific chaperones, a peptide-specific chaperone to crystallize
   multiple cognate peptide epitope-containing client proteins is
   envisioned. This would eliminate the target-specific
   chaperone-production step and streamline the co-crystallization process.
   Previously, protein engineering and directed evolution were used to
   generate a single-chain variable (scFv) antibody fragment with affinity
   for the peptide sequence EYMPME (scFv/EE). This report details the
   conversion of scFv/EE to an anti-EE Fab format (Fab/EE) followed by its
   biophysical characterization. The addition of constant chains increased
   the overall stability and had a negligible impact on the antigen
   affinity. The 2.0 angstrom resolution crystal structure of Fab/EE
   reveals contacts with larger surface areas than those of scFv/EE.
   Surface plasmon resonance, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and
   size-exclusion chromatography were used to assess Fab/EE binding to
   EE-tagged soluble and membrane test proteins: namely, the beta-barrel
   outer membrane protein intimin and beta-helical A2a G protein-coupled
   receptor (A(2)aR). Molecular-dynamics simulation of the intimin
   constructs with and without Fab/EE provides insight into the energetic
   complexities of the co-crystallization approach.}},

   centers were produced by chemical reduction of silver ions in boiling
   water, with sodium citrate and sodium hydroxide as additives in
   solution. These nucleation centers, with a twinned crystallographic
   orientation, ultimately merge into fully grown silver nanowires. This is
   a completely different mechanism from the seed-mediated growth approach,
   which has also been used to produce silver nanowires. Companion
   molecular dynamics performed with the embedded atom method are in

Abstract = {{Cloud based machine-to-machine (M2M) communications have emerged to
   achieve ubiquitous and autonomous data transportation for future daily
   life in the cyber-physical world. In light of the need of network
   characterizations, we analyze the connected M2M network in the machine
   swarm of geometric random graph topology, including degree distribution,
   network diameter, and average distance (i.e., hops). Without the need of
   end-to-end information to escape catastrophic complexity, information
   dissemination appears an effective way in machine swarm. To fully
   understand practical data transportation, G/G/1 queuing network model is
   exploited to obtain average end-to-end delay and maximum achievable
   system throughput. Furthermore, as real applications may require
   dependable networking performance across the swarm, quality of service
   (QoS) along with large network diameter creates a new intellectual
   challenge. We extend the concept of small-world network to form
   shortcuts among data aggregators as infrastructure-swarm two-tier
   heterogeneous network architecture, then leverage the statistical
   concept of network control instead of precise network optimization, to
   innovatively achieve QoS guarantees. Simulation results further confirm
   the proposed heterogeneous network architecture to effectively control
   delay guarantees in a statistical way and to facilitate a new design
   paradigm in reliable M2M communications.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to develop a framework for dynamically
   downscaling spaceborne precipitation products using the Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF) Model with four-dimensional variational data
   assimilation (4D-Var). Numerical experiments have been conducted to 1)
   understand the sensitivity of precipitation downscaling through
   point-scale precipitation data assimilation and 2) investigate the
   impact of seasonality and associated changes in precipitation-generating
   mechanisms on the quality of spatiotemporal downscaling of
   precipitation. The point-scale experiment suggests that assimilating
   precipitation can significantly affect the precipitation analysis,
   forecast, and downscaling. Because of occasional overestimation or
   underestimation of small-scale summertime precipitation extremes, the
   numerical experiments presented here demonstrate that the wintertime
   assimilation produces downscaled precipitation estimates that are in
   closer agreement with the reference National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction stage IV dataset than similar summertime experiments. This
   study concludes that the WRF 4D-Var system is able to effectively
   downscale a 6-h precipitation product with a spatial resolution of 20 km
   to hourly precipitation with a spatial resolution of less than 10 km in
   grid spacingrelevant to finescale hydrologic applications for the era of
   the Global Precipitation Measurement mission.}},

Title = {{Modeling Regional Crop Yield and Irrigation Demand Using SMAP Type of

Abstract = {{Agricultural models, such as the Decision Support System for
   Agrotechnology Transfer cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), have been
   developed for predicting crop yield at field and regional scales and to
   provide useful information for water resources management. A potentially
   valuable input to agricultural models is soil moisture. Presently, no
   observations of soil moisture exist covering the entire United States at
   adequate time (daily) and space (similar to 10 km or less) resolutions
   desired for crop yield assessments. Data products from NASA's upcoming
   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will fill the gap. The
   objective of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of the SMAP
   soil moisture data in modeling and forecasting crop yields and
   irrigation amount. A simple, efficient data assimilation algorithm is
   presented in which the agricultural crop model DSSAT-CSM is constrained
   to produce modeled crop yield and irrigation amounts that are consistent
   with SMAP-type data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
   incorporating the SMAP data into the agricultural model provides an
   added benefit of reducing the uncertainty of modeled crop yields when
   the weather input data to the crop model are subject to large
   uncertainty.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity Analysis in Quantified Interval Constraint Satisfaction
   Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Interval is an alternative to probability distribution in quantifying
   uncertainty for sensitivity analysis (SA) when there is a lack of data
   to fit a distribution with good confidence. It only requires the
   information of lower and upper bounds. Analytical relations among design
   parameters, design variables, and target performances under uncertainty
   can be modeled as interval-valued constraints. By incorporating logic
   quantifiers, quantified constraint satisfaction problems (QCSPs) can
   integrate semantics and engineering intent in mathematical relations for
   engineering design. In this paper, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
   method is developed for feasible design space searching problems that
   are formulated as QCSPs, where the effects of value variations and
   quantifier changes for design parameters on target performances are
   analyzed based on several proposed metrics, including the indeterminacy
   of target performances, information gain of parameter variations, and
   infeasibility of constraints. Three examples are used to demonstrate the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoporous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) form structural
   topologies equivalent to zeolites. ZIFs containing only one type of
   imidazole linker show separation capability for limited molecular pairs.
   We show that the effective pore size, hydrophilicity, and
   organophilicity of ZIFs can be continuously and drastically tuned using
   mixed-linker ZIFs containing two types of linkers, allowing their use as
   a more general molecular separation platform. We illustrate this
   remarkable behavior by adsorption and diffusion measurements of
   hydrocarbons, alcohols, and water in mixed-linker ZIF-8(x)-90(100-x)
   materials with a large range of crystal sizes (338 nm to 120 mu m),
   using volumetric, gravimetric, and PFG-NMR methods. NMR, powder
   FT-Raman, and micro-Raman spectroscopy unambiguously confirm the
   mixed-linker nature of individual ZIF crystals. Variation of the
   mixed-linker composition parameter (x) allows continuous control of
   n-butane, i-butane, butanol, and isobutanol diffusivities over 2-3
   orders of magnitude and control of water and alcohol adsorption
   especially at low activities.}},

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An electric field built inside a crystal was proposed to enhance
   photoinduced carrier separation for improving photocatalytic property of
   semiconductor photocatalysts. However, a static built-in electric field
   can easily be saturated by the free carriers due to electrostatic
   screening, and the enhancement of photocatalysis, thus, is halted. To
   overcome this problem, here, we propose sonophotocatalysis based on a
   new hybrid photocatalyst, which combines ferroelectric nanocrystals
   (BaTiO3) and semiconductor nanoparticles (Ag2O) to form an Ag2O-BaTiO3
   hybrid photocatalyst. Under periodic ultrasonic excitation, a
   spontaneous polarization potential of BaTiO3 nanocrystals in responding
   to ultrasonic wave can act as alternating built-in electric field to
   separate photoinduced carriers incessantly, which can significantly
   enhance the photocatalytic activity and cyclic performance of the
   Ag2O-BaTiO3 hybrid structure. The piezoelectric effect combined with
   photoelectric conversion realizes an ultrasonic-wave-driven
   piezophototronic process in the hybrid photocatalyst, which is the
   fundamental of sonophotocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{We report a remotely mediated and fast responsive plasmonic-magnetic
   nanorod array with extremely large variability in optical appearance (up

   wavelengths in a broad range from UV-vis to near-infrared (at 450, 550,
   and 670 nm) with an external magnetic field with variable direction. The
   observed phenomenon demonstrates a rapid, wide-range response controlled
   via a noninvasive remote stimulus. The remotely controlled system
   suggested here is a magnetic field-directed assembly of an ordered
   monolayer array of unipolar oriented magnetic-plasmonic nickel-gold
   nanorods flexibly hinged to a sticky substrate. The unique geometry of
   the mobile nanorod array allows for the instant alteration of the
   surface plasmon polariton modes in the gold segment of the controllably
   tilting nanorods. This design demonstrates the utility of hybrid

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{59-75}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the past few years, numerous mobile applications have made it
   possible for public transit passengers to find routes and/or learn about
   the expected arrival time of their transit vehicles. Though these
   services are widely used, their impact on overall transit ridership
   remains unclear. The objective of this research is to assess the effect
   of real-time information provided via web-enabled and mobile devices on
   public transit ridership. An empirical evaluation is conducted for New
   York City, which is the setting of a natural experiment in which a
   real-time bus tracking system was gradually launched on a
   borough-by-borough basis beginning in 2011. Panel regression techniques
   are used to evaluate bus ridership over a three year period, while
   controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socioeconomic
   conditions, weather, and other factors. A fixed effects model of average
   weekday unlinked bus trips per month reveals an increase of
   approximately 118 trips per route per weekday (median increase of 1.7\%
   of weekday route-level ridership) attributable to providing real-time
   information. Further refinement of the fixed effects model suggests that
   this ridership increase may only be occurring on larger routes;
   specifically, the largest quartile of routes defined by revenue miles of
   service realized approximately 340 additional trips per route per
   weekday (median increase of 2.3\% per route). Although the increase in
   weekday route-level ridership may appear modest, on aggregate these
   increases exert a substantial positive effect on farebox revenue. The
   implications of this research are critical to decision-makers at the
   country's transit operators who face pressure to increase ridership
   under limited budgets, particularly as they seek to prioritize
   investments in infrastructure, service offerings, and new technologies.

   Incorporation of 2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno{[}3,2-b]thiophene
   (BTTT) into poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) thin films leads to
   approximately a 5-fold increase in charge carrier mobility, a 10-fold

   atomic force microscopy and optical absorption measurements
   respectively, as a function of blend composition. The dependence of
   thin-film morphology on the blend composition is illustrated for the

Abstract = {{Coassemble diverse functional nanomaterials with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   to form three-dimensional (3D) porous CNTs hybrid architectures (CHAs)
   are potentially desirable for applications in energy storage, flexible
   conductors, and catalysis, because of diverse functionalities and
   synergistic effects in the CHAs. Herein, we report a scalable strategy
   to incorporate various functional nanomaterials with N-doped CNTs
   (N-CNTs) into such 3D porous CHAs on the polyurethane (PU) sponge
   skeletons via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. To investigate their
   properties and applications, the specific CHAs based on N-CNTs and Ag
   nanoparticles (NPs), denoted as PU-(N-CNTs/Ag NPs)n, are developed. The
   unique binary structure enables these specific CHAs conductors to
   possess reliable mechanical and electrical performance under various
   elastic deformations as well as excellent hydrophilicity. Moreover, they
   are employed as strain-gauge sensor and heterogeneous catalyst,
   respectively. The sensor could detect continuous signal, static signal,
   and pulse signal with superior sustainability and reversibility,
   indicating an important branch of electromechanical devices.
   Furthermore, the synergistic effects among N-CNTs, Ag NPs, and porous
   structure endow the CHAs with excellent performance in catalysis. We
   have a great expectation that LbL assembly can afford a universal route
   for incorporating diverse functional materials into one structure.}},

Abstract = {{Using Kissinger analysis and temperature field simulation we analyze the
   crystallization of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) during
   laser welding. We obtain the continuous heating transformation curve,
   the distribution of temperature field, and thermal cycle curves from
   which the thermal analysis is performed. We find that the material in
   the welding fusion zone is fully penetrated and the temperature in the
   base material zone is far below the crystallization temperature. Laser
   welding experiments are conducted to validate the Kissinger analysis and
   the simulation results. The welded joints are examined and the results
   are consistent with the simulation prediction. Therefore, the Kissinger
   analysis and temperature field simulation provide a convenient and
   reliable way to predict the crystallization of BMG during laser welding,
   which is beneficial to optimize the welding process and guide the laser
   welding of BMG.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the unique phenotypes and complex signaling pathways of
   leukemia stem cells (LSCs) will provide insights and druggable targets
   that can be used to eradicate acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Current work
   on AML LSCs is limited by the number of parameters that conventional
   flow cytometry (FCM) can analyze because of cell autofluorescence and
   fluorescent dye spectral overlap. Single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF)
   substitutes rare earth elements for fluorophores to label antibodies,
   which allows measurements of up to 120 parameters in single cells
   without correction for spectral overlap. The aim of this study was the
   evaluation of intracellular signaling in antigen-defined stem/progenitor
   cell subsets in primary AML. CyTOF and conventional FCM yielded
   comparable results on LSC phenotypes defined by CD45, CD34, CD38, CD123,
   and CD99. Intracellular phosphoprotein responses to ex vivo cell
   signaling inhibitors and cytokine stimulation were assessed in myeloid
   leukemia cell lines and one primary AML sample. CyTOF and conventional
   FCM results were confirmed by western blotting. In the primary AML
   sample, we investigated the cell responses to ex vivo stimulation with
   stem cell factor and BEZ235-induced inhibition of PI3K and identified
   activation patterns in multiple PI3K downstream signaling pathways
   including p-4EBP1, p-AKT, and p-S6, particularly in CD34(+) subsets. We
   evaluated multiple signaling pathways in antigen-defined subpopulations
   in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD mutations. The data demonstrated the
   heterogeneity of cell phenotype distribution and distinct patterns of
   signaling activation across AML samples and between AML and normal
   samples. The mTOR targets p-4EBP1 and p-S6 were exclusively found in
   FLT3-ITD stem/progenitor cells, but not in their normal counterparts,
   suggesting both as novel targets in FLT3 mutated AML. Our data suggest
   that CyTOF can identify functional signaling pathways in antigen-defined
   subpopulations in primary AML, which may provide a rationale for
   designing therapeutics targeting LSC-enriched cell populations. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{It is commonly thought that human genetic diversity in non-African
   populations was shaped primarily by an out-of-Africa dispersal 50-100
   thousand yr ago (kya). Here, we present a study of 456 geographically
   diverse high-coverage Y chromosome sequences, including 299 newly
   reported samples. Applying ancient DNA calibration, we date the
   Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in Africa at 254 (95\%
   CI 192-307) kya and detect a cluster of major non-African founder
   haplogroups in a narrow time interval at 47-52 kya, consistent with a
   rapid initial colonization model of Eurasia and Oceania after the
   out-of-Africa bottleneck. In contrast to demographic reconstructions
   based on mtDNA, we infer a second strong bottleneck in Y-chromosome
   lineages dating to the last 10 ky. We hypothesize that this bottleneck
   is caused by cultural changes affecting variance of reproductive success
   among males.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a systematic method for soliton formation in
   whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonators through input phase modulation.
   Our numerical simulations of a variant of the Lugiato-Lefever equation
   (LLE) suggest that modulating the input phase at a frequency equal to
   the resonator free spectral range and at modest modulation depths
   provides a deterministic route toward soliton formation in WGM
   resonators without undergoing a chaotic phase. We show that the
   generated solitonic state is sustained when the modulation is turned off
   adiabatically. Our results support parametric seeding as a powerful
   means of control, in addition to input pump power and pump-resonance
   detuning, over frequency comb generation in WGM resonators. Our findings
   also help pave the way toward ultrashort pulse formation on a chip.}},

Title = {{A Universal Feedback Controller for Discontinuous Dynamical Systems
   Using Nonsmooth Control Lyapunov Functions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The consideration of nonsmooth Lyapunov functions for proving stability
   of feedback discontinuous systems is an important extension to classical
   stability theory since there exist nonsmooth dynamical systems whose
   equilibria cannot be proved to be stable using standard continuously
   differentiable Lyapunov function theory. For dynamical systems with
   continuously differentiable flows, the concept of smooth control
   Lyapunov functions was developed by Artstein to show the existence of a
   feedback stabilizing controller. A constructive feedback control law
   based on a universal construction of smooth control Lyapunov functions
   was given by Sontag. Even though a stabilizing continuous feedback
   controller guarantees the existence of a smooth control Lyapunov
   function, many systems that possess smooth control Lyapunov functions do
   not necessarily admit a continuous stabilizing feedback controller.
   However, the existence of a control Lyapunov function allows for the
   design of a stabilizing feedback controller that admits Filippov and
   Krasovskii closed-loop system solutions. In this paper, we develop a
   constructive feedback control law for discontinuous dynamical systems
   based on the existence of a nonsmooth control Lyapunov function defined
   in the sense of generalized Clarke gradients and set-valued Lie
   derivatives.}},

Title = {{Correlation of the Volumetric Tool Wear Rate of Carbide Milling Inserts

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to assess the correlation of volumetric
   tool wear (VTW) and wear rate of carbide tools on the material removal
   rate (MRR) of titanium alloys. A previously developed methodology for
   assessing the worn tool material volume is utilized for quantifying the
   VTW of carbide tools when machining Ti-6Al-4V. To capture the tool
   response, controlled milling experiments are conducted at suitable
   corner points of the recommended feed-speed design space, for constant
   stock material removal volumes. For each case, the tool material volume
   worn away, as well as the corresponding volumetric wear profile
   evolution in terms of a set of geometric coefficients, is
   quantified-these are then related to the MRR. Further, the volumetric
   wear rate and the M-ratio (volume of stock removed to VTW) which is a
   measure of the cutting tool efficiency, are related to the MRR-these
   provide a tool-life based optimal MRR for profitability. This work not
   only elevates tool wear from a 1D to 3D concept, but helps in assessing
   machining economics from a stock material-removal-efficiency perspective
   as well.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelastic dissipation (TED) is a fundamental energy loss process,
   which bears concern in all microelectro-mechanical resonators. High
   aspect ratio (R/h) 3-D micro-hemispherical shell resonators (mu HSRs)
   have exceptionally low stiffness and are sensitive to dissipation forces
   both internally and at their surfaces. TED in mu HSRs originating in the
   bulk of the shell and near its surfaces due to asperities (roughness) is
   investigated. Rayleigh's inextensional solutions for the lowest
   frequency vibration modes of mu HSRs in the isothermal quasi-static
   limit result in zero contributions to energy loss from bulk TED since no
   volumetric strain is generated in this approximation. After relaxing
   Rayleigh's inextensional assumption, perturbational undulations of the
   shell's neutral surface are found to cause non-zero bulk TED. The
   resulting quasi-inextensional vibration modes force the shell into an
   approximately anti-biaxial strain state, which stretch surface
   asperities along one axis and compress them along the other, generating
   thermal flux around the base of each asperity. Closed-form approximate
   analytical models are developed from the geometrical and material
   dependencies to predict the quality factor associated with bulk and
   surface TED, enabling examination of these effects across scale.
   Fully-coupled thermoelastic finite element models verify the above
   results. Finally, experimental results from fabricated mu HSRs are
   compared with the developed models.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advances in computing, imaging, and genomics have created
   new opportunities for exploring relationships between histology,
   molecular events, and clinical outcomes using quantitative methods.
   Slide scanning devices are now capable of rapidly producing massive
   digital image archives that capture histological details in high
   resolution. Commensurate advances in computing and image analysis
   algorithms enable mining of archives to extract descriptions of
   histology, ranging from basic human annotations to automatic and
   precisely quantitative morphometric characterization of hundreds of
   millions of cells. These imaging capabilities represent a new dimension
   in tissue-based studies, and when combined with genomic and clinical
   endpoints, can be used to explore biologic characteristics of the tumor
   microenvironment and to discover new morphologic biomarkers of genetic
   alterations and patient outcomes. In this paper, we review developments
   in quantitative imaging technology and illustrate how image features can
   be integrated with clinical and genomic data to investigate fundamental
   problems in cancer. Using motivating examples from the study of
   glioblastomas (GBMs), we demonstrate how public data from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) can serve as an open platform to conduct in silico
   tissue-based studies that integrate existing data resources. We show how
   these approaches can be used to explore the relation of the tumor
   microenvironment to genomic alterations and gene expression patterns and
   to define nuclear morphometric features that are predictive of genetic
   alterations and clinical outcomes. Challenges, limitations, and emerging
   opportunities in the area of quantitative imaging and integrative
   analyses are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial production of propionic acid (PA), an important chemical
   building block used as a preservative and chemical intermediate, has
   gained increasing attention for its environmental friendliness over
   traditional petrochemical processes. In previous studies, we constructed
   a shuttle vector as a useful tool for engineering Propionibacterium
   jensenii, a potential candidate for efficient PA synthesis. In this
   study, we identified the key metabolites for PA synthesis in P. jensenii
   by examining the influence of metabolic intermediate addition on PA
   synthesis with glycerol as a carbon source under anaerobic conditions.
   We also further improved PA production via the overexpression of the
   identified corresponding enzymes, namely, glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH),
   malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and fumarate hydratase (FUM). Compared to
   those in wild-type P. jensenii, the activities of these enzymes in the
   engineered strains were 2.91- +/- 0.17- to 8.12- +/- 0.37-fold higher.
   The transcription levels of the corresponding enzymes in the engineered
   strains were 2.85- +/- 0.19- to 8.07- +/- 0.63-fold higher than those in
   the wild type. The coexpression of GDH and MDH increased the PA titer
   from 26.95 +/- 1.21 g/liter in wild-type P. jensenii to 39.43 +/- 1.90
   g/liter in the engineered strains. This study identified the key
   metabolic nodes limiting PA overproduction in P. jensenii and further
   improved PA titers via the coexpression of GDH and MDH, making the
   engineered P. jensenii strain a potential industrial producer of PA.}},

Title = {{Structure of hydrogen-rich transverse jets in a vitiated turbulent flow}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1234-1248}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a joint experimental and numerical
   study of the flow characteristics and flame structure of a hydrogen rich
   jet injected normal to a turbulent, vitiated crossflow of lean methane
   combustion products. Simultaneous high-speed stereoscopic Ply and OH
   PLIF measurements were obtained and analyzed alongside three-dimensional
   direct numerical simulations of inert and reacting JICF with detailed
   H-2/CO chemistry. Both the experiment and the simulation reveal that,
   contrary to most previous studies of reacting JICF stabilized in
   low-to-moderate temperature air crossflow, the present conditions lead
   to a burner-attached flame that initiates uniformly around the burner
   edge. Significant asymmetry is observed, however, between the reaction
   zones located on the windward and leeward sides of the jet, due to the
   substantially different scalar dissipation rates. The windward reaction
   zone is much thinner in the near field, while also exhibiting
   significantly higher local and global heat release than the much broader
   reaction zone found on the leeward side of the jet. The unsteady
   dynamics of the windward shear layer, which largely control the
   important jet/crossflow mixing processes in that region, are explored in
   order to elucidate the important flow stability implications arising in
   the inert and reacting JICF. The paper concludes with an analysis of the
   ignition, flame characteristics, and global structure of the
   burner-attached flame. Chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) shows
   that the entire windward shear layer, and a large region on the leeward
   side of the jet, are highly explosive prior to ignition and are
   dominated by non-premixed flame structures after ignition. The
   predominantly mixing limited nature of the flow after ignition is
   examined by computing the Takeno flame index, which shows that similar
   to 70\% of the heat release occurs in non-premixed regions. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Monolithic 3D (M3D) is an emerging technology that enables integration
   density which is orders of magnitude higher than that offered by
   through-silicon-vias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a modified 2D
   placement technique coupled with a post-placement partitioning step is
   sufficient to produce high-quality M3D placement solutions. We also
   present a commercial router-based monolithic intertier via insertion
   methodology that improves the routability of M3D ICs. We demonstrate
   that, unlike in 2D ICs, the routing supply and demand in M3D ICs are not
   completely independent of each other. We develop a routing demand model
   for M3D ICs, and use it to develop an O(N) min-overflow partitioner that
   enhances routability by off-loading demand from one tier to another.
   This technique reduces the routed wirelength and the power delay product
   by up to 7.44\% and 4.31\%, respectively. This allows a two-tier M3D IC
   to achieve, on average, 19.9\% and 11.8\% improvement in routed
   wirelength and power delay product over 2D, even with reduced metal

Abstract = {{Large-signal (P-1 dB) and small-signal (OIP3) radio frequency (RF)
   linearities of silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar
   transistors (HBTs) fabricated in a new fourth-generation 90-nm SiGe
   BiCMOS technology operating at cryogenic temperatures are investigated.
   The SiGe BiCMOS process technology has an f(T)/f(max) of 300/350 GHz.
   SiGe HBTs with two different layout configurations,
   collector-baseemitter (CBE) and CBE-base-collector (CBEBC), were
   characterized over temperature. Both dc and ac figures-of-merit are
   presented to aid in understanding the linearity, and to provide an
   overall performance comparison between the two layout configurations.
   The extracted peak f(T)/f(max) for CBE and CBEBC at 78 K are 387/350 and
   420/410 GHz, respectively. The P-1 dB and OIP3 linearity metrics for
   both configurations are comparable. Source-and load-pull measurements
   were performed at each temperature at 8 and 18 GHz, with the devices
   biased at a JC of 18 mA/mu m(2). Two-tone measurements over bias were
   also performed at 300 and 78 K with 50-Omega terminations for the source
   and load impedances. The 50 Omega results follow a similar response to
   the source-and load-pull measurements at 300 and 78 K, and demonstrate
   that the small-signal linearity of the SiGe HBTs is not adversely
   impacted by operation at cryogenic temperatures. The CBEBC configuration
   demonstrated the most consistent RF linearity performance at cryogenic
   temperature out of the two layout options.}},

Title = {{A Zero-Sequence Voltage Injection-Based Control Strategy for a Parallel

Abstract = {{A parallel hybrid modular multilevel converter (PHMMC) belongs to the
   class of modular multilevel converters, which have become potential
   candidates for high-voltage direct- current (HVDC) transmission systems.
   Due to the circuit topology of a PHMMC, the dc bus voltage contains
   low-order harmonics and cannot be fully regulated at a constant dc
   voltage. The dc bus voltage, if not properly controlled, leads to
   improper power transfer and increases the magnitude of dc current ripple
   on the dc transmission line. This paper proposes a zero-sequence voltage
   injection (ZSVI)-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy to
   control the dc current/power flow and simultaneously minimize the dc
   current ripple. The proposed strategy takes advantage of a cost function
   minimization technique to determine and inject the optimal zero-sequence
   voltage components into the dc-bus voltage of a PHMMC system. This paper
   derives a discrete-time dynamic model of the dc transmission-line
   current and, correspondingly, develops a predictive model. The
   predictive model is used to inject the appropriate amount of
   zero-sequence voltage components to the dc bus reference voltage
   waveform. Compared with the existing triplen harmonics injection method,
   the proposed ZSVI-MPC strategy improves the performance of a PHMMC
   system in terms of minimization of the dc current/voltage ripple.
   Performance of the proposed strategy for a 21-level PHMMC-based HVDC
   station system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in
   the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported results demonstrate
   superior performance of the PHMMC-HVDC station operating based on the
   proposed ZSVI-MPC strategy, under various operating conditions, as
   opposed to the existing triplen harmonics injection method.}},

Abstract = {{Higher alcohol synthesis from syngas is studied over K/MoS2 domains
   supported on mesoporous carbon (C), mixed MgAl oxide (MMO), or mixtures
   thereof. While the carbon support offers high ethanol productivity, the
   MMO support yields enhanced C3+OH selectivity. MoKMMO-C, whereby Mo is
   initially contained on MMO then ground with carbon, behaves similar to
   the parent MoKMMO catalyst, as Mo on MMO has limited mobility during
   reaction. In contrast, on MoKC-MMO, significant Mo migrates from C to
   MMO during reaction, giving reactivity associated with Mo species on
   both supports (high C3+OH selectivity and productivity). MoS2 domain
   structures are correlated with the selectivity of the catalysts (C3+OH
   selectivity double MoS2 layers, total hydrocarbon selectivity single
   MoS2 layers). This study advances the understanding of the support's
   effect on structure reactivity relationships for this family of
   catalysts and introduces a new catalyst composition with desirable
   reactivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-form constitutive equations that explicitly correlate kinematic
   variables such as the strain rate tensor to the stress tensor are highly
   desired in modeling of polymeric flow of practical relevance. However,
   conventional fluid models of the Reiner-Rivlin type encounter a
   difficulty in differentiating flow types and predicting realistic
   elastic effects. In this paper, a constitutive model of type tau =
   tau((L) over bar) where (L) over bar is an objective velocity gradient
   is presented to treat the objective rotation of a fluid-like material
   containing a conformational structure. Specifically, this model contains
   two different relaxation processes to separately tackle rotation and
   straining. The base model with three parameters is able to
   simultaneously model shear thinning and extensional thickening as well
   as normal stress differences in simple shear. Additional model accuracy
   is achieved by incorporating finite stretch and disentanglement effects.

Title = {{Fast Solvent Removal by Mechanical Twisting for Gel Spinning of

Journal = {{POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{A new method for fast solvent removal in gel spinning was investigated.
   Instead of solvent evaporation or coagulation as conventionally used,
   the new method involves mechanically twisting the gel-fiber along the
   fiber axis. By removing the majority of solvent in the gel-fiber by
   mechanical twisting not only the emission of solvent vapor and the
   production of waste solvent mixture or coagulation byproducts are
   minimized but also the fiber production rate is significantly increased.
   The new solvent removal method was demonstrated through gel spinning of
   high-strength ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene fibers using both
   volatile and nonvolatile spin solvents. Approximately 90\% of the spin
   solvent was removed by a single-step twisting process and the resulting
   fiber retained the high mechanical properties conventionally obtained. A
   mechanistic model was developed for estimating the solvent removal as a
   function of twisting. With respect to the gel spinning industry, the new
   solvent removal method holds a promise of simplifying the solvent
   removal and recovery steps and improving the production rate, leading to
   more efficient and effective gel spinning processes. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Abstract = {{Melt electrospinning is an emerging fiber-based manufacturing technique
   that can be used to design and build scaffolds suitable for many tissue
   engineering (TE) applications. Contrary to the widely used solution
   electrospinning, the melt process is solvent-free and therefore
   volatility and toxicity issues associated with solvents can be avoided.
   Furthermore, molten polymers are often viscous and nonconductive, making
   them candidates for generating electrospinning jets without electrical
   instabilities. This in turn permits a precise and predictable fiber
   deposition in the combination with moving collectors, termed melt
   electrospinning writing (MEW), allows the layer-by-layer fabrication of
   small to large volume scaffolds with specific designs, shapes and
   thicknesses. In vitro studies have demonstrated that scaffolds designed
   and fabricated via MEW can support cell attachment, proliferation and
   extracellular matrix formation, as well as cell infiltration throughout
   the thickness of the scaffold facilitated by the large pores and pore
   interconnectivity. Moreover, in vivo studies show that scaffolds
   designed for specific tissue regeneration strategies performed superbly.
   This review describes the state-of-the-art and unique perspectives of
   melt electrospinning and its writing applied to scaffold-based TE.}},

Abstract = {{Wifi tethering enables Wifi-only devices to access the Internet by
   sharing the WWAN (e.g., 3G and LTE) connection of a smartphone where
   there is no available Wifi access point. However, the current tethering
   schemes have a limitation as they consume a significant portion of the
   battery power for providing Wifi clients with the Internet connection.
   In this paper, we propose a new tethering scheme that reduces the energy
   consumption of a mobile AP (MAP) without substantial throughput and
   delay degradation. To improve energy efficiency, the proposed scheme
   adaptively adjusts the sleep and wake-up periods based on the bandwidth
   asymmetric feature of the MAP. Further, it provides a longer idle time
   enough to put the clients into a sleep mode by combining idle periods
   between subsequent packets, and conserves their energy as well. Our
   evaluation based on the prototype implementation on commercial
   smartphones shows that the proposed scheme reduces the energy
   consumption of the MAP and the client smartphones by up to 56.0 and 8.3

Abstract = {{The cost of dimensionality reduction in aerodynamic design applications
   involving high-dimensional design spaces and computational fluid
   dynamics is often prohibitive. In an attempt to overcome this challenge,
   a new method for dimensionality reduction is presented that scales as
   plog(p), where p is the number of design variables. It works by taking
   advantage of adjoint design methods to compute the covariance matrix of
   the gradient. This information is then used with principal component
   analysis to develop a linear transformation that allows an aerodynamic
   optimization problem to be reformulated in an equivalent coordinate
   system of lower dimensionality. To demonstrate its feasibility, the
   method is tested on a two-dimensional staggered airfoil problem,
   intentionally chosen as an abstraction of a more realistic overwing
   nacelle integration problem, and shown to exhibit similarities with the
   latter. Results show that the method rivals typical screening methods
   used in aerospace engineering in terms of effectiveness but outperforms
   them either in terms of cost or the ability to capture nonlinear
   effects. Furthermore, the method is found to show good agreement with
   optimization results obtained without using the method. Overall, results
   offer strong evidence in support of the proposed approach, setting the
   stage for larger analytical efforts such as design space exploration,
   where dimensionality reduction is unavoidable to cope with the necessity
   of gradient-free approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The modular auxiliary activity (AA) family of proteins is believed to
   cause amorphogenesis in addition to oxidative cleavage of crystalline
   cellulose although the supporting evidence is limited. HcAA10-2 is a
   modular AA10 family protein (58 kDa) composed of a AA10 module and a
   family two carbohydrate binding module (CBM2), joined by a long stretch
   of 222 amino acids of unknown function. The protein was expressed in
   Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Scanning electron
   microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of Avicel treated with
   HcAA10-2 provided evidence for the disruption of the cellulose
   microfibrils ({''}amorphogenesis{''}) and reduction of the crystallinity
   index, resulting in a twofold increase of cellulase adsorption on the
   polysaccharide surface. HcAA10-2 exhibited weak endoglucanase-like
   activity toward soluble cellulose and cello-oligosaccharides with an
   optimum at pH 6.5 and 45 A degrees C. HcAA10-2 catalyzed oxidative
   cleavage of crystalline cellulose released native and oxidized
   cello-oligosaccharides in the presence of copper and an electron donor
   such as ascorbic acid. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that His1,
   His109, and Phe197 in the AA10 module formed the conserved
   copper-binding site. The reducing sugar released from Avicel by the
   endoglucanase Cel5 and Celluclast accompanying HcAA10-2 was increased by
   four- and sixfold, respectively. Moreover, HcAA10-2 and Celluclast acted
   synergistically on pretreated wheat straw biomass resulting in a
   threefold increase in reducing sugar than Celluclast alone. Taken
   together, these results suggest that HcAA10-2 is a novel multifunctional
   modular AA10 protein possessing amorphogenesis, weak endoglucanase, and
   oxidative cleavage activities useful for efficient degradation of
   crystalline cellulose.}},

Abstract = {{The wastewater usually contains low-concentration organic pollutants and
   some inorganic salts after biological treatment. In the present work,
   the possibility of simultaneous removal of them by combining
   electrochemical oxidation and electrosorption was investigated. Phenol
   and sodium chloride were chosen as representative of organic pollutants
   and inorganic salts and a pair of activated carbon plate electrodes were
   used as anode and cathode. Some important working conditions such as
   oxygen concentration, applied potential and temperature were evaluated
   to reach both efficient phenol removal and desalination. Under optimized
   2.0 V of applied potential, 38 degrees C of temperature, and 500 mL
   min(-1) of oxygen flow, over 90\% of phenol, 60\% of TOC and 20\% of
   salinity were removed during 300 min of electrolysis time. Phenol was
   removed by both adsorption and electrochemical oxidation, which may
   proceed directly or indirectly by chlorine and hypochlorite oxidation.
   Chlorophenols were detected as degradation intermediates, but they were
   finally transformed to carboxylic acids. Desalination was possibly
   attributed to electrosorption of ions in the pores of activated carbon
   electrodes. The charging/regeneration cycling experiment showed good
   stability of the electrodes. This provides a new strategy for wastewater
   treatment and recycling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI)
   scheme for a rudder servo system (RSS) that manages ship navigation.
   Inherent nonlinearities and unknown external disturbances present great
   challenges in applying FDI technologies to RSS in practice. This paper
   presents the derivation of the state equations and commonly encountered
   fault types of RSS from physical laws, and the design of five nonlinear
   unknown input observers (NUIOs) capable of eliminating the influences of
   unknown disturbance while detecting and isolating faults. In the NUIOs,
   no boundary assumption is made on the disturbance, and their parameter
   matrices are obtained using a linear-matrix-inequality method. Along
   with an algorithm that programs the logic rules for FDI, the model-based
   FDI scheme has been implemented on an actual RSS test rig for validating
   the RSS model and experimentally evaluating it in a real-world
   environment; both actuator and sensor faults are considered. Based on
   experimental tests, an adaptive threshold method is introduced to
   improve decision making and hence effectively eliminate false alarms.
   Experimental results show that the model-based scheme is efficient and
   can be used for online FDI.}},

   specific sub-surface electrochemical failure mode referred to as
   conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation. The test vehicle variations
   included a control with no exposure, test vehicle with electrical
   insulation failure (resistance change to 1 Ma{''}broken vertical bar
   during the test) and test vehicle with initiation of CAF to compare the
   impedance characteristics at different stages of electrochemical
   migration failure. AC impedance measurements were carried out on the
   test vehicle variations at ambient and in an in situ humidity chamber as
   a function of RH at 14-85 \%. The prior exposure condition of the test

Abstract = {{The minimum concave cost network flow problem (MCCNFP) is NP-hard, but
   efficient polynomial-time algorithms exist for some special cases such
   as the uncapacitated lot-sizing problem and many of its variants. We
   study the MCCNFP over a grid network with a general nonnegative
   separable concave cost function. We show that this problem is
   polynomially solvable when all sources are in the first echelon and all
   sinks are in two echelons, and when there is a single source but many
   sinks in multiple echelons. The polynomiality argument relies on a
   combination of a particular dynamic programming formulation and an
   investigation of the extreme points of the underlying flow polyhedron.
   We derive an analytical formula for the inflow into any node in an
   extreme point solution, which generalizes a result of Zangwill (Manag

Abstract = {{An optically controlled reconfigurable antenna with operability in both
   wide and narrow bands is investigated for cognitive radio systems. The
   proposed antenna consists of a U-shaped patch for the spectrum sensing
   over a wide band and two open annuli for communication in narrow
   sub-bands within the frequency range of 3.1-10.6 GHz. The integration of
   narrow and wide bands devices makes the whole antenna structure compact
   with a dimension of 40 x 38.5 mm(2). With an inherent property of being
   electromagnetically transparency, four appropriately placed
   laser-controlled photoconductive silicon switches are adopted to achieve
   reconfigurable frequency characteristics in the four bands of 5.8-6.8,
   6.7-7.3, 7.0-8.4, and 7.9-9.2 GHz with the reflection coefficient below
   -10 dB. The wide-narrowband antenna is fed by two coplanar waveguides
   with the isolation of S-21<-15 dB, effectively allowing the spectrum
   sensing and the communication to operate simultaneously. An antenna
   prototype has been fabricated, and close agreement is observed between
   the measured and simulated results. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Ocean currents represent an alternative source of clean energy given
   their inherent reliability, persistence and sustainability. The general
   ocean circulation is characterized by large rotating ocean gyres
   resulting in rapid ocean currents along the western boundaries because
   of the Coriolis Effect. The Gulf Stream system is formed by the western
   boundary current of the North Atlantic Ocean flowing along the east
   coast of the United States, and is of particular interest as a potential
   energy resource for the United States. This study presents a national
   database of ocean current kinetic energy resource derived from seven
   years of numerical model simulations to help advance awareness and
   market penetration for ocean current energy. A web based GIS interface
   is provided for dissemination of the national energy resource data:
   http://www.oceancurrentpower.gatech.edu/. The website includes GIS
   layers of computed monthly and yearly mean ocean current speed and
   associated power density along the coastlines of the United States, as
   well as joint and marginal probability histograms for current velocities
   at a variable horizontal resolution of 4-7 km. Various tools are
   provided for viewing, identifying, filtering and downloading the data
   from this website. The Gulf Stream system, especially the Florida
   Current, concentrates the highest kinetic power density (> 2000 W/m(2)).
   The majority of the kinetic power and its variability are only present
   in relatively shallow water given the strong correlation with the
   surface wind stress. The kinetic energy flux in the Florida Current is
   estimated over 30 years to provide temporal variability of the
   undisturbed kinetic energy with high statistical significance. Available
   power of approximately 5 GW associated with the undisturbed natural flow
   condition from the Gulf Stream system is predicted based on hypothetical
   turbine parameters. Successful development of renewable energy
   generation requires further studies to account for more precise
   technical, economic and environmental constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Progress in the classical field of EHL has for decades been paralyzed by
   the assumption that shear thinning should be indistinguishable from the
   shear dependence of the viscosity of a liquid heated by viscous
   dissipation and that the parameters of this simple shear dependence can
   be obtained from the shape of a friction curve. In the last few years,
   by abandoning this assumption and employing real viscosity measured with
   viscometers, there has been revolutionary progress in predicting film
   thickness and friction. Now, Spikes and Jie conclude that the previous
   assumption has as much merit as the use of viscosity measured in
   viscometers. This suggestion may be popular among those who wish to
   ignore viscometer measurements in favor of extracting properties from
   friction curves. However, within the subject article, there are numerous
   misstatements of fact and misrepresentations by omission, and the recent
   progress using real viscosity is not acknowledged. The debate has
   degenerated into a friction curve fitting competition which is not
   helpful. The great progress of the last few years would not have been
   possible using the concepts and methods espoused in this article.}},

   Rough Surfaces}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a numerical method is developed to study the
   liquid-mediated adhesion between 3D rough surfaces. The presence of a
   wetting liquid between two rough surfaces generates a negative pressure
   inside the liquid film, which in turn induces tensile stresses in the
   contact region. Opposing these tensile stresses are the compressive
   stresses generated at solid-solid contact spots. An iterative
   deterministic contact model based on influence coefficients is employed
   to solve the equations of elasticity and capillarity simultaneously.
   Results for tensile (adhesive) force, wetted radius, average gap, and
   contact area between the rough surfaces are obtained. The results show
   that sudden changes in tensile force, average gap, and contact area
   occur with an increase in certain parameters, suggesting an
   elasto-capillary instability and surface collapse.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{177-190}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In building retrofit projects, retrofit savings can be estimated by
   comparing building energy use before and after installing Energy
   Conservation Measures (ECMs). A complicating factor is that there is no
   direct measurement of the reduced energy use that is solely attributable
   to the retrofit. Indeed, simple comparisons by subtracting the
   post-retrofit energy use from the pre-retrofit would ignore the impact
   of other factors, such as weather and occupancy with constantly changing
   patterns, on the total building energy use. Data-driven models (i.e.,
   derived by inverse modeling approaches) that are trained with monitored
   pre-retrofit building data can be used as the baseline models in a
   retrofit project. However, to be effective, the baseline energy models
   must be capable of singling out the impact of ECMs and ignoring the
   influence of other factors. A commonly used method to achieve this goal
   is to develop a statistical model that correlates energy use with
   weather and other independent variables. This paper first reviews four
   mainstream baseline data-driven energy models used to characterize
   building energy performance: change-point regression model, Gaussian
   process regression model, Gaussian Mixture Regression Model, and
   Artificial Neural Network model, These models are then applied to an
   office building to predict the Heating, Ventilation, and
   Air-Conditioning (HVAC) hot water energy consumption. Several model
   accuracy measures such as R-2, RMSE, CV-RMSE, and sensitivity to sample
   frequency, and reliability, are evaluated and compared. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a very-high-throughput
   coherent ultradense wavelength division multiplexing passive optical
   network (UDWDM-PON) with its bandwidth efficiency enhanced using
   Nyquist-independent-sideband (N-ISB) modulation. The proposed optical
   line terminal (OLT) suggests 75 downlink optical subcarriers. For each
   optical subcarrier, there are as many as 16, 10-Gb/s N-ISB digital
   channels modulated on it, which can be efficiently generated using only
   one set of optical transmitter hardware. Experimental results show that
   the proposed UDWDM-PON is capable of accommodating 1200 10G users within
   an optical distribution network loss budget of 35.5 dB, and achieve a
   total throughput of 12 Tb/s and a spectral efficiency of 5.628-b/s/Hz.
   More importantly, the proposed system with spectral-and
   bandwidth-efficient N-ISB requires 16 times less downlink optical
   transmitters at the OLT, which can be translated into savings in cost,
   power consumption, and footprint. In addition, key techniques, such as
   N-ISB modulation in a PON system, frequency-locked optical multicarrier
   generation, and digital pre-equalization, are also studied.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Genome sequencing has revealed that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a
   major evolutionary process in bacteria. Although it is generally assumed
   that closely related organisms engage in genetic exchange more
   frequently than distantly related ones, the frequency of HGT among
   distantly related organisms and the effect of ecological relatedness on
   the frequency has not been rigorously assessed. Here, we devised a novel
   bioinformatic pipeline, which minimized the effect of
   over-representation of specific taxa in the available databases and
   other limitations of homology-based approaches by analyzing genomes in
   standardized triplets, to quantify gene exchange between bacterial
   genomes representing different phyla. Our analysis revealed the
   existence of networks of genetic exchange between organisms with
   overlapping ecological niches, with mesophilic anaerobic organisms
   showing the highest frequency of exchange and engaging in HGT twice as
   frequently as their aerobic counterparts. Examination of individual
   cases suggested that interphylum HGT is more pronounced than previously
   thought, affecting up to similar to 16\% of the total genes and similar
   to 35\% of the metabolic genes in some genomes (conservative
   estimation). In contrast, ribosomal and other universal protein-coding
   genes were subjected to HGT at least 150 times less frequently than
   genes encoding the most promiscuous metabolic functions (for example,
   various dehydrogenases and ABC transport systems), suggesting that the
   species tree based on the former genes may be reliable. These results
   indicated that the metabolic diversity of microbial communities within
   most habitats has been largely assembled from preexisting genetic
   diversity through HGT and that HGT accounts for the functional
   redundancy among phyla.}},

Abstract = {{Due to expensive nature of clinical trials, implantable cardiac devices
   should first be extensively characterized in vitro. Prosthetic heart
   valves (PHVs), an important class of these devices, have been shown to
   be associated with thromboembolic complications. Although various in
   vitro systems have been designed to quantify blood-cell damage and
   platelet activation caused by nonphysiological hemodynamic shear
   stresses in these PHVs, very few systems attempt to characterize both
   blood damage and fluid dynamics aspects of PHVs in the same test system.
   Various numerical modeling methodologies are also evolving to simulate
   the structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, and blood damage aspects of
   these devices. This article presents a completely hemocompatible
   small-volume test-platform that can be used for thrombogenicity studies
   and experimental fluid mechanics characterization. Using a programmable
   piston pump to drive freshly drawn human blood inside a cylindrical
   column, the presented system can simulate various physiological and
   pathophysiological conditions in testing PHVs. The system includes a
   modular device-mounting chamber, and in this presented case, a 23mm St.
   Jude Medical (SJM) Regents (R) mechanical heart valve (MHV) in aortic
   position was used as the test device. The system was validated for its
   capability to quantify blood damage by measuring blood damage induced by
   the tester itself (using freshly drawn whole human blood). Blood damage
   levels were ascertained through clinically relevant assays on human
   blood while fluid dynamics were characterized using time-resolved
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) using a blood-mimicking fluid. Blood
   damage induced by the tester itself, assessed through
   Thrombin-anti-Thrombin (TAT), Prothrombin factor 1.2 (PF1.2), and
   hemolysis (Drabkins assay), was within clinically accepted levels. The
   hydrodynamic performance of the tester showed consistent, repeatable
   physiological pressure and flow conditions. In addition, the system
   contains proximity sensors to accurately capture leaflet motion during
   the entire cardiac cycle. The PIV results showed skewing of the leakage
   jet, caused by the asymmetric closing of the two leaflets. All these
   results are critical to characterizing the blood damage and fluid
   dynamics characteristics of the SJM Regents (R) MHV, proving the utility
   of this tester as a precise system for assessing the hemodynamics and
   thrombogenicity for various PHVs.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to measure the collagen fiber structure
   and estimate the material properties of 7 human donor scleras, from age
   53 to 91. The specimens were subjected to inflation testing, and the
   full-field displacement maps were measured by digital image correlation.
   After testing, the collagen fiber structure was mapped using wide-angle
   X-ray scattering. A specimen-specific inverse finite element method was
   applied to calculate the material properties of the collagen fibers and
   interfiber matrix by minimizing the difference between the experimental
   displacements and model predictions. Age effects on the fiber structure
   and material properties were estimated using multivariate models
   accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Older age was associated with a
   larger matrix stiffness (p = 0.001), a lower degree of fiber alignment
   in the peripapillary sclera (p = 0.01), and a lower mechanical
   anisotropy in the peripapillary sclera (p = 0.03).}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial intima
   is a critical step in the initiation and progression of atheromatous
   lesions. In this study we examine subject-specific LDL transport into
   the intima of carotid bifurcations in three human subjects using a
   three-pore model for LDL mass transfer. Subject-specific carotid artery
   computational models were derived using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   to obtain the geometry and phase-contract MRI (PC-MRI) to acquire
   pulsatile inflow and outflow boundary conditions for each subject. The
   subjects were selected to represent a wide range of anatomical
   configurations and different stages of atherosclerotic development from
   mild to moderate intimal thickening. A fluid-solid interaction (FSI)
   model was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach
   in order to consider the effects of a compliant vessel on wall shear
   stress (WSS). The WSS-dependent response of the endothelium to LDL mass
   transfer was modeled by multiple pathways to include the contributions
   of leaky junctions, normal junctions, and transcytosis to LDL solute and
   plasma volume flux from the lumen into the intima. Time averaged WSS
   (TAWSS) over the cardiac cycle was computed to represent the spatial WSS
   distribution, and wall thickness (WTH) was determined from black blood
   MRI (BBMRI) so as to visualize intimal thickening patterns in the
   bifurcations. The regions which are exposed to low TAWSS correspond to
   elevated WTH and higher mass and volume flux via the leaky junctions. In
   all subjects, the maximum LDL solute flux was observed to be immediately
   downstream of the stenosis, supporting observations that existing
   atherosclerotic lesions tend to progress in the downstream direction of
   the stenosis.}},

   a continuum. The relation between this complex and the de Rham complex
   allows one to readily derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for
   the compatibility of displacement gradient and the existence of stress
   functions on non-contractible bodies. We also derive the local

Journal = {{BONE}},

Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into osteoblasts on
   microstructured titanium (Ti) surfaces without addition of medium
   supplements, suggesting that surface-dependent endogenous mechanisms are
   involved. They produce bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which
   regulate MSC differentiation and bone formation via autocrine/paracrine
   mechanisms that are modulated by changes in BMP mRNA and protein,
   receptors, and inhibitors (Noggin, Cerberus, Gremlin 1, and Chordin). We
   examined expression of BMPs, their receptors and their inhibitors over
   time and used BMP2-silenced cells to determine how modulating endogenous
   BMP signaling can affect the process. MSCs were cultured on tissue
   culture polystyrene or Ti {[}PT (Ra < 0.4 mu m); sandblasted/acid-etched
   Ti (SLA, Ra = 3.2 mu m); or hydrophilic-SLA (modSLA)]. BMP mRNAs and
   proteins increased by day 4 of culture. Exogenous BMP2 increased
   differentiation whereas differentiation was decreased in BMP2-silenced
   cells. Noggin was regulated by day 2 whereas Gremlin 1 and Cerberus were
   regulated after 6 days. Osteoblastic differentiation increased in cells
   cultured with blocking antibodies against Noggin, Gremlin 1, and
   Cerberus. Endogenous BMPs enhance an osteogenic microenvironment whereas
   exogenous BMPs are inhibitory. Antibody blocking of the BMP2 inhibitor
   Cerberus resulted in IL-6 and IL-8 levels that were similar to those
   observed when treating cells with exogenous BMP2, while antibodies
   targeting the inhibitors Gremlin or Noggin did not. These results
   suggest that microstructured titanium implants supporting therapeutic
   stem cells may be treated with appropriately selected agents
   antagonistic to extracellular BMP inhibitors in order to enhance BMP2
   mediated bone repair while avoiding undesirable inflammatory side
   effects observed with exogenous BMP2 treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Visible-to-UVC upconversion (UC) by Pr3+-doped materials is a promising
   candidate for application to sustainable disinfection technologies,
   including light-activated antimicrobial surfaces and solar water
   treatment. In this work, we studied Pr3+ upconversion in an oxyfluoride
   host system for the first time, employing Lu7O6F9:Pr3+ ceramics.
   Compared to the previously studied Y2SiO5:Pr3+ reference material, the
   oxyfluoride host resulted in a 5-fold increase in intermediate state
   lifetime, likely due to a lower maximum phonon energy; however, only a
   60\% gain in UC intensity was observed. To explain this discrepancy,
   luminescence spectral distribution and decay kinetics were studied in
   both phosphor systems. The Pr3+ 4f5d band energy distribution in each
   phosphor was found to play a key role by allowing or disallowing the
   occurrence of a previously unexplored UC mechanism, which had a
   significant impact on overall efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In the current study, a semi-analytical model for contact between a
   homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half-space with a geometrically
   anisotropic (wavelengths are different in the two principal directions)
   bisinusoidal surface on the boundary and a rigid base is developed. Two
   asymptotic loads to area relations for early and almost complete contact
   are derived. The Hertz elliptic contact theory is applied to approximate
   the load to area relation in the early contact. The noncontact regions
   occur in the almost complete contact are treated as mode-I cracks. Since
   those cracks are in compression, an approximate relation between the
   load and noncontact area can be obtained by setting the corresponding
   stress intensity factor (SIF) to zero. These two asymptotic solutions
   are validated by two different numerical models, namely, the fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) model and the finite element (FE) model. A
   piecewise equation is fit to the numerical solutions to bridge these two
   asymptotic solutions.}},

   shown to be exponential with rates that can be computed by

Abstract = {{Recycling and retreading is critical for reducing costs and energy
   consumption for the manufacture of tire casings. An effective retread
   requires tire casings with good structural integrity and no internal
   damage. This paper presents an impulse-acoustic nondestructive technique
   to investigate internal defects in rubber steel composites such as truck
   tires. The technique employs a light impactor that taps the structure to
   be inspected, measuring the impact force with a load cell and analyzing
   the resulting sound recorded with a microphone in order to discriminate
   defective regions from defect free regions. Acoustic signatures of both
   the defective and non-defective side walls of a tire were recorded. The
   acoustic signatures of were analyzed and the peak amplitude and decay
   rates demonstrated a suitable correlation in the presence of internal
   delaminations. This paper seeks to presents an understanding of the
   fundamental principles underlying the individual measurement and
   analysis techniques. The results of this investigation show that the
   acoustic responses can be used to identify the presence of internal
   delaminations and also may potentially be used to determine their size
   and location. The effort is part of a project to develop an automated
   inspection system for truck tires to determine the integrity of the base
   structure before a retreading operation is performed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between carbon molecular sieve (CMS) pore
   structure and corresponding gas separation performance enables

   temperature and starting polymer precursor are the two critical

   structure and performance changes of CMS derived from a commercially
   available polymer precursor at different pyrolysis temperatures. As
   reviewed in this paper, most traditional characterization methods based
   on microscopy, X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, sorption-based pore size
   distribution measurements etc. provide limited information for relating
   separation performance to the CMS morphology and structural changes. A
   useful alternative approach based on different sized gases as molecular
   scale probes of the CMS pore structure was successfully used here in
   conjunction with separation data to provide critical insights into the

   that, under certain conditions, a contact instability occurs leading to
   unbounded rates of change of tensile force, average gap and wetted
   radius. The effects of liquid volume, liquid surface tension, surface
   topography, nominal contact area, and external load on the stability of

   Under a periodic foot stamp, an output voltage and current of 5.5 V and
   0.63 jtA, respectively, were observed. A large-area composite
   nanogenerator (11 x 10 cm2) was fabricated; the device delivered a
   maximum output voltage and current of 35 V and 4 piA, respectively.
   Further, we have demonstrated the capability of the composite

Abstract = {{We study an incremental network design problem, where in each time
   period of the planning horizon an arc can be added to the network and a
   maximum flow problem is solved, and where the objective is to maximize
   the cumulative flow over the entire planning horizon. After presenting
   two mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations for this NP-complete
   problem, we describe several heuristics and prove performance bounds for
   some special cases. In a series of computational experiments, we compare
   the performance of the MIP formulations as well as the heuristics. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design a fast hierarchical clustering algorithm for
   high-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI). At the core of the
   algorithm, a new rank-two nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)
   algorithm is used to split the clusters, which is motivated by convex
   geometry concepts. The method starts with a single cluster containing
   all pixels and, at each step, performs the following: 1) selects a
   cluster in such a way that the error at the next step is minimized and
   2) splits the selected cluster into two disjoint clusters using rank-two
   NMF in such a way that the clusters are well balanced and stable. The
   proposed method can also be used as an endmember extraction algorithm in
   the presence of pure pixels. The effectiveness of this approach is
   illustrated on several synthetic and real-world HSIs and is shown to
   outperform standard clustering techniques such as k-means, spherical
   k-means, and standard NMF.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) technique was
   applied to monitor and quantify integrin-RGD recognition during the
   early stages of cell adhesion. Using QCM-D crystals modified with a
   photo-activatable RGD peptide, the time point of presentation of
   adhesive ligand at the surface of the QCM-D crystal could be accurately
   controlled. This allowed temporal resolution of early integrin-RGD
   binding and the subsequent cell spreading process, and their separate
   detection by QCM-D. The specificity of the integrin-RGD binding event
   was corroborated by performing the experiments in the presence of
   soluble cyclicRGD as a competitor, and cytochalasin D as inhibitor of
   cell spreading. Larger frequency change in the QCM-D signal was observed
   for cells with larger spread area, and for cells overexpressing integrin
   alpha(v)beta(3) upon stable transfection. This strategy enables
   quantification of integrin activity which, in turn, may allow
   discrimination among different cell types displaying distinct integrin
   subtypes and expression levels thereof. On the basis of these findings,
   we believe the strategy can be extended to other photoactivatable
   ligands to characterize cell membrane receptors activity, a relevant
   issue for cancer diagnosis (and prognosis) as other several pathologies.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{We report on a method for ``direct-write{''} conductive patterning via
   reduction of graphene oxide (GO) sheets using focused electron beam
   induced deposition (FEBID) of carbon. FEBID treatment of the
   intrinsically dielectric graphene oxide between two metal terminals
   opens up the conduction channel, thus enabling a unique capability for
   nanoscale conductive domain patterning in GO. An increase in FEBID
   electron dose results in a significant increase of the domain electrical
   conductivity with improving linearity of drain-source current vs.
   voltage dependence, indicative of a change of graphene oxide electronic
   properties from insulating to semiconducting. Density functional theory
   calculations suggest a possible mechanism underlying this experimentally
   observed phenomenon, as localized reduction of graphene oxide layers via
   interactions with highly reactive intermediates of
   electron-beam-assisted dissociation of surface-adsorbed hydrocarbon
   molecules. These findings establish an unusual route for using FEBID as
   nanoscale lithography and patterning technique for engineering
   carbon-based nanomaterials and devices with locally tailored electronic
   properties. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Everyone has to deal with fracturing of materials at one level or
   another, beginning from normal household chores and extending to the
   largest scale of observations reported for catastrophic events occurring
   on a geological level or even expanded to events in outer space. Such
   wide perspective is introduced in the current introduction of this theme
   issue. The follow-on organization of technical articles provides a
   flavour of the range in size scales at which fracturing occurs in a wide
   diversity of materials-from `fracking' oil extraction and earth moving
   to laboratory testing of rock material and extending to the cracking of
   tooth enamel. Of important scientific interest are observations made and
   analysed at the smallest dimensions corresponding to the mechanisms by
   which fracture is either enhanced or hindered by permanent deformation
   or other processes. Such events are irrevocably linked to the atomic
   structure in all engineering materials, a sampling of which is
   presented, including results for crystalline and amorphous materials.
   Hooray for the broad subject description that is hoped to be appealing

Abstract = {{The exact nature of the lowest K-pi = 2(+) rotational bands in all
   deformed nuclei remains obscure. Traditionally they are assumed to be
   collective vibrations of the nuclear shape in the. degree of freedom
   perpendicular to the nuclear symmetry axis. Very few such. bands have
   been traced past the usual backbending rotational alignments of high-j
   nucleons. We have investigated the structure of positive-parity bands in
   the N = 90 nucleus Dy-156, using the Nd-148(C-12,4n) Dy-156 reaction at
   65 MeV, observing the resulting. gamma-ray transitions with the
   Gammasphere array. The even-and odd-spin members of the K-pi = 2(+)gamma
   band are observed up to 32(+) and 31(+), respectively. This rotational
   band faithfully tracks the ground-state configuration to the highest
   spins. The members of a possible. vibration built on the aligned yrast S
   band are observed up to spins 28(+) and 27(+). An even-spin
   positive-parity band, observed up to spin 24(+), is a candidate for an
   aligned S band built on the seniority-zero configuration of the 0(2)(+)
   state at 676 keV. The crossing of this band with the 0(2)(+) band is at
   h omega(c) = 0.28(1) MeV and is consistent with the configuration of the
   0(2)(+) band not producing any blocking of the monopole pairing.}},

Title = {{Effect of metal-support interactions in Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with low

Abstract = {{Nickel catalysts prepared by a variety of different methods are commonly
   used for reforming reactions such as methane dry reforming. Two
   preparation methods, controlled adsorption and dry impregnation, are
   implemented to explore the effect of preparation method on the formation
   of active sites on alumina supported nickel catalysts. By varying only
   the preparation method, comparison of catalysts that differ primarily in
   metal-support interactions, strong metal-support interaction (controlled
   adsorption) and weak metal-support interactions (dry impregnation), are
   obtained. For controlled adsorption, optimal synthesis conditions are
   identified using point of zero charge measurements, pH-precipitation
   experiments, and adsorption isotherms. Using these conditions, a
   catalyst with a higher dispersion and strong metal-support interactions
   is prepared. Physicochemical characterization by N-2 physisorption, H-2
   chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), and environmental TEM (ETEM) shows that the
   types of nickel sites formed strongly depend on the synthesis method.
   Methane dry reforming reactivity studies show stable catalytic
   performance for at least 9 h and provide additional insight into the
   types of active centers present. After reductive pretreatment, the
   nickel catalyst prepared by dry impregnation is found to primarily have
   nickel present as a surface NiAl2O4. In contrast, the active centers for
   the nickel catalyst prepared by controlled adsorption consist of nickel
   particles that are encapsulated by a nickel aluminate layer with 1-2 nm
   in thickness. Combustion analysis and XPS of spent catalysts reveal
   different amounts and nature of carbonaceous deposits as a function of
   the synthesis method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By using one-dimensional rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays as the
   structure-directing scaffold as well as the TiO2 source to two
   consecutive hydrothermal reactions, densely aligned SrTiO3-modified
   rutile TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts are crafted for the first
   time. The first hydrothermal processing yielded nanostructured rutile
   TiO2 with the hollow openings on the top of nanorods (i.e., partially
   etched rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays; denoted PE-TNRAs). The subsequent
   second hydrothermal treatment in the presence of Sr2+ transforms the
   surface of partially etched rutile TiO2 nanorods into SrTiO3
   nanoparticles via the concurrent dissolution of TiO2 and precipitation
   of SrTiO3 while retaining the cylindrical shape (i.e., forming
   SrTiO3-decorated rutile TiO2 composite nanorods; denoted STO-TNRAs). The
   structural and composition characterizations substantiate the success in
   achieving STO-TNRA nanostructures. In comparison to PE-TNRAs, STO-TNRA
   photocatalysts exhibit higher photocurrents and larger photocatalytic
   degradation rates of methylene blue (3.21 times over PE-TNRAs) under UV
   light illumination as a direct consequence of improved charge carrier
   mobility and enhanced electron/hole separation. Such 1D
   perovskite-decorated semiconductor nanoarrays are very attractive for
   optoelectronic applications in photovoltaics, photocatalytic hydrogen
   production, among other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a newly emerged technology for

   because of different dielectric fillers of distinct permittivities. The
   manipulation of permittivity of dielectric materials for TENG is first
   reported, demonstrating a novel route in designing high-performance
   TENGs. When repeatedly contacting with an Object, a TENG having lateral
   dimensions of 21 mm x 10 mm can produce an open-circuit voltage of 58.5
   V and a short-circuit current of 44.7 mu A. The instantaneous output
   power density can reach up to 708 mu W. Besides, the new design
   incorporates all electrodes into a single plane, greatly simplifying the

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the dimensional aspect of structure-driven
   surface properties of metal monolayers grown on a graphene/Au template.
   Here, surface limited redox replacement (SLRR) is used to provide
   precise layer-by-layer growth of Pt monolayers on graphene. We find that
   after a few iterations of SLRR, fully wetted 4-5 monolayer Pt films can
   be grown on graphene. Incorporating graphene at the Pt-Au interface
   modifies the growth mechanism, charge transfers, equilibrium interatomic
   distances, and associated strain of the synthesized Pt monolayers. We
   find that a single layer of sandwiched graphene is able to induce a
   3.5\% compressive strain on the Pt adlayer grown on it, and as a result,
   catalytic activity is increased due to a greater areal density of the Pt
   layers beyond face-centered-cubic close packing. At the same time, the
   sandwiched,graphene does not obstruct vicinity effects of near-surface
   electron exchange between the substrate Au and adlayers Pt. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended Xray absorption fine
   structure (EXAFS) techniques are used to examine charge mediation across
   the,Pt-graphene-Au junction and the local atomic arrangement as a
   function of the Pt adlayer dimension. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are used as probes to examine the
   electrochemically active area of Pt monolayers and catalyst activity,
   respectively. Results show that the inserted graphene monolayer results
   in increased activity for the Pt due to a graphene-induced,compressive
   strain) as well as a higher resistance against loss of the catalytically
   active Pt surface.}},

Title = {{Cognitive mechanisms underlying instructed choice exploration of small
   city maps}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying the exploration and
   decision-making in realistic and novel environments. Twelve human
   subjects were shown small circular U.S. city maps with two locations
   highlighted on the circumference, as possible choices for a post office
   ({''}targets{''}). At the beginning of a trial, subjects fixated a spot
   at the center of the map and ultimately chose one of the two locations.
   A space syntax analysis of the map paths (from the center to each
   target) revealed that the chosen location was associated with the less
   convoluted path, as if subjects navigated mentally the paths in an
   ``ant's way,{''} i.e., by staying within street boundaries, and
   ultimately choosing the target that could be reached from the center in
   the shortest way, and the fewest turns and intersections. The subjects'
   strategy for map exploration and decision making was investigated by
   monitoring eye position during the task. This revealed a restricted
   exploration of the map delimited by the location of the two alternative
   options and the center of the map. Specifically, subjects explored the
   areas around the two target options by repeatedly looking at them before
   deciding which one to choose, presumably implementing an evaluation and
   decision-making process. The ultimate selection of a specific target was
   significantly associated with the time spent exploring the area around
   that target. Finally, an analysis of the sequence of eye fixations
   revealed that subjects tended to look systematically toward the target
   ultimately chosen even from the beginning of the trial. This finding
   indicates an early cognitive selection bias for the ensuing decision
   process.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Recently, piezoelectric and triboelectric energy harvesting devices have
   been developed to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.
   Especially, it is well known that triboelectric nanogenerators have a
   simple structure and a high output voltage. However, whereas
   nanostructures improve the output of triboelectric generators, its
   fabrication process is still complicated and unfavorable in term of the
   large scale and long-time durability of the device. Here, we demonstrate
   a hybrid generator which does not use nanostructure but generates much
   higher output power by a small mechanical force and integrates
   piezoelectric generator into triboelectric generator, derived from the
   simultaneous use of piezoelectric and triboelectric mechanisms in one
   press-and-release cycle. This hybrid generator combines high
   piezoelectric output current and triboelectric output voltage, which
   produces peak output voltage of similar to 370 V, current density of
   similar to 12 mu A center dot cm(-2), and average power density of
   similar to 4.44 mW center dot cm(-2). The output power successfully lit
   up 600 LED bulbs by the application of a 0.2 N mechanical force and it
   charged a 10 mu F capacitor to 10 V in 25 s. Beyond energy harvesting,
   this work will provide new opportunities for developing a small,
   built-in power source in self-powered electronics such as mobile
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, polypropylene (PP) composites reinforced with short glass
   fibers (GF) and exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets were obtained by melt
   compounding followed by injection molding. Morphological observations
   and quasi-static tensile tests were carried out in order to investigate
   how the morphology and the mechanical properties of the composites were
   affected by the combined effect of two fillers of rather different size
   scales (i.e., micro- and nanoscale). The results indicate that the
   dispersion of the nanofiller in the PP matrix promoted the formation of
   a stronger interface between the matrix and GF, as indicated by the
   increase of the interfacial shear strength determined by the
   single-fiber microdebonding test. Concurrently, a significant
   improvement of the tensile modulus and impact strength of the composites
   was observed, with small changes in the processability of hybrid
   composites compared to that of GF composites, as confirmed by
   rheological measurements. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Abstract = {{We report the observation of signature vibrational bands in the
   frequency region between 900 and 1600 cm(-1) for defects in single-layer
   graphene (SLG) using surface Raman spectroscopy in ultrahigh vacuum.
   Vapor deposition of Ag leads to the formation of surface nanoparticles
   that migrate to defects in the SLG, leading to surface enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) of the graphene G and 2D bands as well as new
   vibrational modes ascribed to native defects. Many of the new spectral
   bands of these native defects are similar, although not identical, to
   those predicted previously for defects. These new bands are observed in
   addition to bands more commonly observed for defective graphene that are
   attributed to the D, G{*}, D+G, and 2D' modes. The defects observed in
   these SLG films are not believed to result from the Ag deposition
   process but are postulated to be formed during the graphene CVD growth
   process. These defects are then made visible by postdeposition of Ag due
   to SERS.}},

Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Development of sulfur cathodes with 100\% coulombic efficiency (CE) and
   good cycle stability remains challenging due to the polysulfide
   dissolution in electrolytes. Here, it is demonstrated that
   electrochemical reduction of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI)
   based electrolytes at a potential close to the sulfur cathode operation
   forms in situ protective coating on both cathode and anode surfaces.
   Quantum chemistry studies suggest the coating formation is initiated by
   the FSI(-F) anion radicals generated during electrolyte reduction. Such
   a reduction additionally results in the formation of LiF. Accelerated
   cycle stability tests at 60 degrees C in a very simple electrolyte
   (LiFSI in dimethoxyethane with no additives) show an average CE
   approaching 100.0\% over 1000 cycles with a capacity decay less than
   0.013\% per cycle after stabilization. Such a remarkable performance
   suggests a great promise of both an in situ formation of protective
   solid electrolyte coatings to avoid unwanted side reactions and the use
   of a LiFSI salt for this purpose.}},

Title = {{Vaccination with Human Papillomavirus Pseudovirus-Encapsidated Plasmids
   Targeted to Skin Using Microneedles}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Human papilloma virus-like particles (HPV VLP) serve as the basis of the
   current licensed vaccines for HPV. We have previously shown that
   encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory
   syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when
   delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for
   basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination
   targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1)
   whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective
   immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsV-encapsidated plasmids
   delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and
   the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP
   coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and
   were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with
   HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and
   dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected
   post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post
   RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully
   protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load
   in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16
   PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing
   antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell
   responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids. Although
   the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response
   threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust. Taken together, these
   data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a
   practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be
   developed for clinical evaluation.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{1655-1664}},

Abstract = {{Leukocyte CD18 integrins increase their affinity for ligand by
   transmitting allosteric signals to and from their ligand-binding alpha I
   domain. Mechanical forces induce allosteric changes that paradoxically
   slow dissociation by increasing the integrin/ligand bond lifetimes,
   referred to as catch bonds. Mac-1 formed catch bonds with its ligands.
   However, a Mac-1 gene (ITGAM) coding variant (rs1143679, R77H), which is
   located in the beta-propeller domain and is significantly associated
   with systemic lupus erythematosus risk, exhibits a marked impairment in
   2D ligand affinity and affinity maturation under mechanical force.
   Targeted mutations and activating antibodies reveal that the failure in
   Mac-1 R77H allostery is rescued by induction of cytoplasmic tail
   separation and full integrin extension. These findings demonstrate roles
   for R77, and the beta-propeller in which it resides, in force-induced
   allostery relay and integrin bond stabilization. Defects in these
   processes may have pathological consequences, as the Mac-1 R77H variant
   is associated with increased susceptibility to lupus.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of Li adsorption on a graphene-fullerene (graphene-C-60)
   hybrid system has been investigated using density functional theory
   (DFT). The adsorption energy for Li atoms on the graphene-C-60 hybrid
   system (-2.285 eV) is found to be higher than that on bare graphene
   (-1.375 eV), indicating that the Li adsorption on the former system is
   more stable than on the latter. This is attributed to the high affinity
   of Li atoms to C-60 and the charge redistribution that occurs after
   graphene is mixed with C-60. The electronic properties of the
   graphene-C-60 system such as band structure, density of states, and
   charge distribution have been characterized as a function of the number
   of Li atoms adsorbed in comparison to those of the pure graphene and
   C-60. Li adsorption is found to preferentially occur on the C-60 side
   due to the high adsorption energy of Li on C-60, which imparts a
   metallic character to the C-60 in the graphene-C-60 hybrid system.}},

Abstract = {{Integrin receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cell
   cytoskeleton to provide essential forces and signals. To examine the
   contributions of the beta 1 integrin cytoplasmic tail to adhesive
   forces, we generated cell lines expressing wild-type and tail mutant
   beta 1 integrins in beta 1-null fibroblasts. Deletion of beta 1
   significantly reduced cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and
   adhesive forces, and expression of human beta 1 (h beta 1) integrin in
   these cells restored adhesive functions. Cells expressing a truncated
   tail mutant had impaired spreading, fewer and smaller focal adhesions,
   reduced integrin binding to fibronectin, and lower adhesion strength and
   traction forces compared to h beta 1-expressing cells. All these metrics
   were equivalent to those for beta 1-null cells, demonstrating that the
   beta 1 tail is essential to these adhesive functions. Expression of the
   constitutively-active D759A h beta 1 mutant restored many of these
   adhesive functions in beta 1-null cells, although with important
   differences when compared to wild-type beta 1. Even though there were no
   differences in integrin-fibronectin binding and adhesion strength
   between h beta 1- and h beta 1-D759A-expressing cells, h beta
   1-D759A-expressing cells assembled more but smaller adhesions than h
   beta 1-expressing cells. Importantly, h beta 1-D759A-expressing cells
   generated lower traction forces compared to h beta 1-expressing cells.
   These differences between h beta 1- and h beta 1-D759A-expressing cells
   suggest that regulation of integrin activation is important for
   fine-tuning cell spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and traction force
   generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Implant Materials Generate Different Peri-implant Inflammatory Factors}},
Journal = {{SPINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{399-404}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Study Design. An in vitro study examining factors produced by human
   mesenchymal stem cells on spine implant materials.
   Objective. The aim of this study was to examine whether the inflammatory
   microenvironment generated by cells on titanium-aluminum-vanadium
   (Ti-alloy, TiAlV) surfaces is affected by surface microtexture and
   whether it differs from that generated on poly-ether-ether-ketone
   (PEEK).
   Summary of Background Data. Histologically, implants fabricated from
   PEEK have a fibrous connective tissue surface interface whereas Ti-alloy
   implants demonstrate close approximation with surrounding bone. Ti-alloy
   surfaces with complex micron/submicron scale roughness promote
   osteoblastic differentiation and foster a specific cellular environment
   that favors bone formation whereas PEEK favors fibrous tissue formation.
   Methods. Human mesenchymal stem cells were cultured on tissue culture
   polystyrene, PEEK, smooth TiAlV, or macro-/micro-/nano-textured rough
   TiAlV (mmnTiAlV) disks. Osteoblastic differentiation and secreted
   inflammatory interleukins were assessed after 7 days. Fold changes in
   mRNAs for inflammation, necrosis, DNA damage, or apoptosis with respect
   to tissue culture polystyrene were measured by low-density polymerase
   chain reaction array. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance,
   followed by Bonferroni's correction of Student's t-test.
   Results. Cells on PEEK upregulated mRNAs for chemokine ligand-2,
   interleukin (IL) 1 beta, IL6, IL8, and tumor necrosis factor. Cells
   grown on the mmnTiAlV had an 8-fold reduction in mRNAs for toll-like
   receptor-4. Cells grown on mmnTiAlV had reduced levels of
   proinflammatory interleukins. Cells on PEEK had higher mRNAs for factors
   strongly associated with cell death/apoptosis, whereas cells on mmnTiAlV
   exhibited reduced cytokine factor levels. All results were significant
   (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion. These results suggest that fibrous tissue around PEEK
   implants may be due to several factors: reduced osteoblastic
   differentiation of progenitor cells and production of an inflammatory
   environment that favors cell death via apoptosis and necrosis. Ti alloy
   surfaces with complex macro/micro/nanoscale roughness promote
   osteoblastic differentiation and foster a specific cellular environment
   that favors bone formation.}},

Title = {{Damage assessment of older highway bridges subjected to
   three-dimensional ground motions: Characterization of shear-axial force
   interaction on seismic fragilities}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the influence of vertical ground motions on the
   seismic response and fragility of typical older highway bridges. The
   fragility is investigated using a set of functions that estimate
   exceedance probabilities of structures under seismic events. For this
   purpose, this study selects a typical older two-span single frame
   concrete box-girder bridge constructed in California in 1967. The bridge
   column has insufficient design details such as wide spacing of
   transverse reinforcement and low ratio of shear span to section depth
   resulting in an increased potential of shear-axial failure. The column
   shear response model accounts for the fluctuation in column axial force
   using an existing Zeus-NL material model and is validated through
   comparison of simulated and experimental results reported in the
   literature. Using this shear-axial force interaction model, a bridge
   system model is created in Zeus-NL to perform nonlinear time-history
   analyses. The response results are used to generate demand models, and
   component and system fragility curves of the bridge. Finally, fragility
   curves are compared for two bridge models with column shear model under
   constant axial force and with column shear model under axial force
   variation. The comparative results indicate that the shear model
   accounting for varying axial force increases the probability of
   exceeding the severe damage state by about 10\% across the entire range
   of an intensity measure and reduces the median intensity measure by more
   than 15\%. This observation highlights the importance of shear-axial
   force interaction in the seismic performance of older bridges. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{For many wireless sensor networks, high accuracy and low complexity
   localization techniques are crucial to their successful deployment. The
   radio interferometric positioning system (RIPS) has been introduced for
   accurate localization with low complexity. In this paper, a dual-tone
   radio interferometric positioning system (DRIPS) is proposed to localize
   multiple targets simultaneously. In DRIPS, multiple asynchronous targets
   emit dual-tone signals, and synchronous anchor receivers (nodes with
   known positions) extract phase information of low-frequency differential
   tones created by squaring the received dual-tone signals. Multiple
   time-of-arrivals (TOAs) coupled with unknown offsets due to the
   asynchronous targets are estimated based on the phase information.
   Accordingly, a localization algorithm taking the integer ambiguity issue
   into account is developed. Moreover, considering the case without
   accurate knowledge of the frequencies of the differential tones, an
   ESPRIT-type algorithm is proposed to estimate the frequencies. The
   proposed DRIPS is robust to flat-fading channels, immune to
   uncertainties of local oscillators, and able to distinguish different
   targets. In order to show more insights of the performance limit of the
   DRIPS, Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived. Simulation results
   illustrate the merits of the proposed DRIPS.}},

   Differential scanning calorimetry aging experiments were conducted at

Abstract = {{We studied temperature dependence of crystalline quality of AlN layers
   at 1050-1250 degrees C with a fine increment step of around 18 degrees
   C. The AlN layers were grown on c-plane sapphire substrates by
   metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterized by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) omega-scans and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   At 1050-1068 degrees C, the templates exhibited poor quality with
   surface pits and higher XRD (002) and (102) full-width at half-maximum
   (FWHM) because of insufficient Al atom mobility. At 1086 degrees C, the
   surface became smooth suggesting sufficient Al atom mobility. Above 1086
   degrees C, the (102) FWHM and thus edge dislocation density increased
   with temperatures which may be attributed to the shorter growth mode
   transition from three-dimension (3D) to two-dimension (2D). Above 1212
   degrees C, surface macro-steps were formed due to the longer diffusion
   length of Al atoms than the expected step terrace width. The edge
   dislocation density increased rapidly above 1212 degrees C, indicating
   this temperature may be a threshold above which the impact of the
   transition from 3D to 2D is more significant. The (002) FWHM and thus
   screw dislocation density were insensitive to the temperature change.
   This study suggests that high quality AlN/sapphire templates may be
   potentially achieved at temperatures as low as 1086 degrees C which is
   accessible by most of the Ill nitride MOCVD systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56-57}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{One dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D) magneto-elastic lattices
   are investigated as examples of multistable, periodic structures with
   adaptive wave propagation properties. Lumped-parameter lattices with
   embedded permanent magnets are modeled as point magnetic dipole moments,
   while elastic interactions are described as axial and torsional springs.
   The equilibrium configurations for the lattices are identified through
   minimization of the lattice potential energy. Bloch wave analysis is
   then conducted for small perturbations about stable equilibria to
   predict corresponding wave propagation properties. Finally, nonlinear
   dynamic simulations validate the findings of the linearized unit cell
   analysis, and illustrate the changes in dynamic behavior caused by
   topological transitions. Case studies for 1D systems show how pass bands
   and bandgaps are defined by lattice reconfigurations and by changes in
   lattice magnetization. In 2D systems, hexagonal lattices transition from
   regular honeycombs to re-entrant ones, which leads to significant
   changes in wave speeds, and directionality of wave motion and transition
   fronts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the influence of microgel packing on colloidal-phase
   mediated heteroaggregation using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and
   poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) microgels with 1\% mol or 5\% mol
   N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) cross-linker. This system is uniquely
   designed to interrogate the influence of microgel structure and
   stiffness on microgel deformation at a curved interface by elminating
   the necessity of electrostatic charge pairing. Microgel monomer and
   cross-linker content is expected to influence deformation at a curved
   interface. Microgel deformation and swelling were characterized via
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) and viscometry. A systematic study of
   colloidal-phase mediated heteroaggregation was performed at varied
   effective volume fractions with all microgel compositions. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and qNano pore translocation experiments were
   used to asses the microgel coverage on the resultant raspberry-like
   particles (RLPs). Results reveal that microgel composition has a strong
   influence on the efficiency (as determined by microgel coverage) of RLP
   fabrication. The compositional effects appear to be related to the
   degree of microgel spreading/deformation at the interface, which is
   coupled to the influence of packing on assembly fidelity. These findings
   are widely applicable to systems where microgel deformation occurs at a
   curved interface. We also demonstrate that qNano pore translocation
   experiments can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze RLP
   microgel coverage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{442}},
Pages = {{133-139}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Pollens possess a thin liquid coating, pollenkitt, which plays a major
   role in adhesion by forming capillary menisci at interfaces.
   Unfortunately, the influence of humidity on pollenkitt properties and
   capillary adhesion is unknown. Because humidity varies widely in the
   environment, the answers have important implications for better
   understanding plant reproduction, allergy and asthma, and pollen as
   atmospheric condensation nuclei. Here, pollenkitt-mediated adhesion of
   sunflower pollen to hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was measured as
   a function of humidity. The results quantify for the first time the
   significant water absorption of pollenkitt and the resulting complex
   dependence of adhesion on humidity. On hydrophilic Si, adhesion
   increased with increasing RH for pollens with or without pollenkitt, up
   to 200 nN at 70\% RH. In contrast, on hydrophobic PS, adhesion of
   pollenkitt-free pollen is independent of RH. Surprisingly, when
   pollenkitt was present adhesion forces on hydrophobic PS first increased
   with RH up to a maximum value at 35\% RH (similar to 160 nN), and then
   decreased with further increases in RH. Independent measurement of
   pollenkitt properties is used with models of capillary adhesion to show
   that humidity-dependent changes in pollenkitt wetting and viscosity are
   responsible for this complex adhesion behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Contactless powering of small electronic components has lately received
   growing attention for wireless applications in which battery replacement
   or tethered charging is undesired or simply impossible, and ambient
   energy harvesting is not a viable solution. As an alternative to
   well-studied methods of contactless energy transfer, such as the
   inductive coupling method, the use of ultrasonic waves transmitted and
   received by piezoelectric devices enables larger power transmission
   distances, which is critical especially for deep-implanted electronic
   devices. Moreover, energy transfer by means of acoustic waves is well
   suited in situations where no electromagnetic fields are allowed. The
   limited literature of ultrasonic acoustic energy transfer is mainly
   centered on proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating the feasibility
   of this method, lacking experimentally validated modeling efforts for
   the resulting multiphysics problem that couples the source and receiver
   dynamics with domain acoustics. In this work, we present fully coupled
   analytical, numerical, and experimental multiphysics investigations for
   ultrasonic acoustic energy transfer from a spherical wave source to a
   piezoelectric receiver bar that operates in the 33-mode of
   piezoelectricity. The fluid-loaded piezoelectric receiver under
   free-free mechanical boundary conditions is shunted to an electrical
   load for quantifying the electrical power output for a given acoustic
   source strength of the transmitter. The analytical
   acoustic-piezoelectric structure interaction modeling framework is
   validated experimentally, and the effects of system parameters are
   reported along with optimal electrical loading and frequency conditions
   of the receiver. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum chemistry is increasingly performed using large cluster
   computers consisting of multiple interconnected nodes. For a fixed
   molecular problem, the efficiency of a calculation usually decreases as
   more nodes are used, due to the cost of communication between the nodes.
   This paper empirically investigates the parallel scalability of
   Hartree-Fock calculations. The construction of the Fock matrix and the
   density matrix calculation are analyzed separately. For the former, we
   use a parallelization of Fock matrix construction based on a static
   partitioning of work followed by a work stealing phase. For the latter,
   we use density matrix purification from the linear scaling methods
   literature, but without using sparsity. When using large numbers of
   nodes for moderately sized problems, density matrix computations are
   network-bandwidth bound, making purification methods potentially faster
   than eigendecomposition methods. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Impact of branching on the supramolecular assembly of thioethers on
   Au(111)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Alkanethiolate monolayers are one of the most comprehensively studied
   self-assembled systems due to their ease of preparation, their ability
   to be functionalized, and the opportunity to control their thickness
   perpendicular to the surface. However, these systems suffer from
   degradation due to oxidation and defects caused by surface etching and
   adsorbate rotational boundaries. Thioethers offer a potential
   alternative to thiols that overcome some of these issues and allow
   dimensional control of self-assembly parallel to the surface. Thioethers
   have found uses in surface modification of nanoparticles, and chiral
   thioethers tethered to catalytically active surfaces have been shown to
   enable enantioselective hydrogenation. However, the effect of
   structural, chemical, and chiral modifications of the alkyl chains of
   thioethers on their self-assembly has remained largely unstudied. To
   elucidate how molecular structure, particularly alkyl branching and
   chirality, affects molecular self-assembly, we compare four related
   thioethers, including two pairs of structural isomers. The self-assembly
   of structural isomers N-butyl methyl sulfide and tert-butyl methyl
   sulfide was studied with high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy
   (STM); our results indicate that both molecules form highly ordered
   arrays despite the bulky tert-butyl group. We also investigated the
   effect of intrinsic chirality in the alkyl tails on the adsorption and
   self-assembly of butyl sec-butyl sulfide (BSBS) with STM and density
   functional theory and contrast our results to its structural isomer,
   dibutyl sulfide. Calculations provide the relative stability of the four
   stereoisomers of BSBS and STM imaging reveals two prominent monomer
   forms. Interestingly, the racemic mixture of BSBS is the only thioether
   we have examined to date that does not form highly ordered arrays; we
   postulate that this is due to weak enantiospecific intermolecular
   interactions that lead to the formation of energetically similar but
   structurally different assemblies. Furthermore, we studied all of the
   molecules in their monomeric molecular rotor form, and the
   surface-adsorbed chirality of the three asymmetric thioethers is
   distinguishable in STM images. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of adding nucleic acids to gold seeds during the growth stage
   of either nanospheres or nanorods was investigated using UV-Vis
   spectroscopy to reveal any oligonucleotide base or structure-specific
   effects on nanoparticle growth kinetics or plasmonic signatures.
   Spectral data indicate that the presence of DNA duplexes during seed
   aging drastically accelerated nanosphere growth while the addition of
   single-stranded polyadenine at any point during seed aging induces
   nanosphere aggregation. For seeds added to a gold nanorod growth
   solution, single-stranded polythymine induces a modest blue shift in the
   longitudinal peak wave length. Moreover, a particular sequence comprised
   of 50\% thymine bases was found to induce a faster, more dramatic blue
   shift in the longitudinal peak wave length compared to any of the
   homopolymer incubation cases. Monomeric forms of the nucleic acids,
   however, do not yield discernable spectral differences in any of the
   gold suspensions studied.}},

Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Microgels are colloidally stable, hydrogel microparticles that have
   previously been used in a range of (soft) material applications due to
   their tunable mechanical and chemical properties. Most commonly, thermo
   and pH-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels can be
   fabricated by precipitation polymerization in the presence of the
   co-monomer acrylic acid (AAc). Traditionally pNIPAm microgels are
   synthesized in the presence of a crosslinking agent, such as
   N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), however, microgels can also be
   synthesized under `crosslinker free' conditions. The resulting particles
   have extremely low (<0.5\%), core-localized crosslinking resulting from
   rare chain transfer reactions. AFM nanoindentation of these ultralow
   crosslinked (ULC) particles indicate that they are soft relative to
   crosslinked microgels, with a Young's modulus of similar to 10 kPa.
   Furthermore, ULC microgels are highly deformable as indicated by a high
   degree of spreading on glass surfaces and the ability to translocate
   through nanopores significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter
   of the particles. The size and charge of ULCs can be easily modulated by
   altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, monomer, surfactant
   and initiator concentrations, and through the addition of co-monomers.
   Microgels based on the widely utilized, biocompatible polymer
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also be synthesized under crosslinker free
   conditions. Due to their softness and deformability, ULC microgels are a
   unique base material for a wide variety of biomedical applications
   including biomaterials for drug delivery and regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{this work, a graphene quantum interference (QI) photodetector was
   simulated in two regimes of operation. The structure consists of a
   graphene nanoribbon, Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), which exhibits a
   strongly resonant transmission of electrons of specific energies. In the
   first regime of operation (that of a linear photodetector), low
   intensity light couples two resonant energy levels, resulting in
   scattering and differential transmission of current with an external
   quantum efficiency of up to 5.2\%. In the second regime of operation,
   full current switching is caused by the phase decoherence of the current
   due to a strong photon flux in one or both of the interferometer arms in
   the same MZI structure. Graphene QI photodetectors have several distinct
   advantages: they are of very small size, they do not require p- and
   n-doped regions, and they exhibit a high external quantum efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide nanoribbon (GONR) made by the oxidative unzipping of
   multiwalled carbon nanotube was dispersed in dimethylformamide and mixed
   with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to fabricate continuous PAN/GONR composite
   fibers by gel spinning. Subsequently, PAN/GONR composite fibers were
   stabilized and carbonized in a batch process to fabricate composite
   carbon fibers. Structure, processing, and properties of the composite
   precursor and carbon fibers have been studied. This study shows that
   GONR can be used to make porous precursor and carbon fibers. In
   addition, GONR also shows the potential to make higher mechanical
   property carbon fibers than that achieved from PAN precursor only.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid foams are two-phase systems in which a large volume of gas is
   dispersed as bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. These foams are
   ubiquitous in nature. In addition, they are found in industrial
   applications, such as pharmaceutical formulation, food processing,
   wastewater treatment, construction, and cosmetics. Recently, we reported
   a new type of foam material, capillary foam, which is stabilized by the
   synergistic action of particles and a small amount of an immiscible
   secondary liquid. In this study, we explore in more detail the foam
   preparation routes. To illustrate some of the potential applications, we
   create vividly colored wet and dried foams, which are difficult to
   prepare using traditional methods, and load-bearing porous solids. The
   combined action of particles and immiscible secondary fluid confers
   exceptional stability to capillary foams and many options for
   functionalization, suggesting a wide range of possible applications.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly of miktoarm star-like AB(n) block copolymer in both
   selective solvent (A- or B-selective) and miscible homopolymer matrix (A
   or B homopolymer), that is, formation of micelles, was for the first
   time investigated by theoretical calculations based on self-consistent
   mean field theory. Interestingly, the calculation revealed that the size
   of micelles in solvent was smaller than that in homopolymer under the
   same conditions. In B-selective solvent, with increasing number of B
   blocks n in miktoarm star-like AB(n) block copolymer at a fixed volume
   fraction of A block, the micellar size decreased gradually. In stark
   contrast, when miktoarm star-like AB(n) block copolymer dissolved in B
   homopolymer matrix at molecular weight ratio of B homopolymer to AB(n)
   block copolymer f(H) = 0.30, the overall micellar size decreased
   nonmonotonically as the number of B blocks n in AB(n) block copolymer
   increased. The largest micelle was formed in AB(2) (i.e., n = 2). This
   intriguing finding can be attributed to a wet-to-dry brush transition
   that occurred from n = 1 to n = 2 in the micellization of miktoarm
   star-like AB(n) block copolymer. Moreover, the micellization behaviors
   of miktoarm star-like AB(n) block copolymer in A-selective solvent and A
   homopolymer matrix were also explored, where the overall micellar size
   in both scenarios was found to decrease monotonically as n in AB(n)
   block copolymer increased. These self-assembled nanostructures composed
   of miktoarm star-like AB(n) block copolymers may promise a wide range of
   applications in size-dependent drug delivery and bionanotechnology.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria in the natural environment exist as interface- associated
   colonies known as biofilms. Complex mechanisms are often involved in
   biofilm formation and development. Despite the understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation, it remains unclear
   how physical effects in standing cultures influence biofilm development.
   The topology of the solid interface has been suggested as one of the
   physical cues influencing bacteria- surface interactions and biofilm
   development. Using the model organism Bacillus subtilis, we study the
   transformation of swimming bacteria in liquid culture into robust
   biofilms in a range of confinement geometries (planar, spherical and
   toroidal) and interfaces (air/water, silicone/water, and silicone
   elastomer/ water). We find that B. subtilis form submerged biofilms at
   both solid and liquid interfaces in addition to air- water pellicles.
   When confined, bacteria grow on curved surfaces of both positive and
   negative Gaussian curvature. However, the confinement geometry does
   affect the resulting biofilm roughness and relative coverage. We also
   find that the biofilm location is governed by oxygen availability as
   well as by gravitational effects; these compete with each other in some
   situations. Overall, our results demonstrate that confinement geometry
   is an effective way to control oxygen availability and subsequently
   biofilm growth.}},

Abstract = {{The lamina cribrosa (LC) is a tissue in the posterior eye with a complex
   trabecular microstructure. This tissue is of great research interest, as
   it is likely the initial site of retinal ganglion cell axonal damage in
   glaucoma. Unfortunately, the LCis difficult to access experimentally,
   and thus imaging techniques in tandem with image processing have emerged
   as powerful tools to study the microstructure and biomechanics of this
   tissue. Here, we present a staining approach to enhance the contrast of
   the microstructure in micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging as
   well as a comparison between tissues imaged with micro-CT and second
   harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. We then apply a modified version
   of Frangi's vesselness filter to automatically segment the connective
   tissue beams of the LC and determine the orientation of each beam. This
   approach successfully segmented the beams of a porcine optic nerve head
   from micro-CT in three dimensions and SHG microscopy in two dimensions.
   As an application of this filter, we present finite-element modelling of
   the posterior eye that suggests that connective tissue volume fraction
   is the major driving factor of LC biomechanics. We conclude that
   segmentation with Frangi's filter is a powerful tool for future
   image-driven studies of LC biomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{The metatarsal lyriform organ of the Central American wandering spider
   Cupiennius salei is its most sensitive vibration detector. It is able to
   sense a wide range of vibration stimuli over four orders of magnitude in
   frequency between at least as low as 0.1 Hz and several kilohertz.
   Transmission of the vibrations to the slit organ is controlled by a
   cuticular pad in front of it. While the mechanism of high-frequency
   stimulus transfer (above ca 40 Hz) is well understood and related to the
   viscoelastic properties of the pad's epicuticle, it is not yet clear how
   low-frequency stimuli (less than 40 Hz) are transmitted. Here, we study
   how the pad material affects the pad's mechanical properties and thus
   its role in the transfer of the stimulus, using a variety of
   experimental techniques, such as X-ray micro-computed tomography for
   three-dimensional imaging, X-ray scattering for structural analysis, and
   atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy for surface
   imaging. The mechanical properties were investigated using scanning
   acoustic microscopy and nanoindentation. We show that large tarsal
   deflections cause large deformation in the distal highly hydrated part
   of the pad. Beyond this region, a sclerotized region serves as a
   supporting frame which resists the deformation and is displaced to push
   against the slits, with displacement values considerably scaled down to
   only a few micrometres. Unravelling the structural arrangement in such
   specialized structures may provide conceptual ideas for the design of
   new materials capable of controlling a technical sensor's specificity
   and selectivity, which is so typical of biological sensors.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the prototypical hybrid interface formed between PTCDA
   and, conductive n-doped ZnO films by means of complementary optical and
   electronic spectroscopic techniques. We demonstrate that shallow donors
   in the vicinity of the ZnO surface cause an integer charge transfer to
   PTCDA, which is clearly restricted to the first monolayer. By means of
   DFT calculations, we show that the experimental signatures of the
   anionic PTCDA species can be understood in terms of Strong hybridization
   with localized states (the shallow donors) in the substrate and charge
   back-donation; resulting in an effectively integer charge transfer
   across the interface. Charge transfer is thus not merely a question of
   locating the Fermi level above the PTCDA electron-transport level but
   requires rather an atomistic understanding of the interfacial
   interactions. The study reveals that defect sites and dopants can have a
   significant influence on the specifics of interfacial coupling and thus
   on carrier injection or extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible framework dynamics present in the subset of metalorganic
   frameworks known as soft porous crystals give rise to interesting
   structural properties that are unique to this class of materials. In
   this work, we use experiments and molecular simulation to understand the
   highly dynamic nanorotor behavior of the 1,4-diazabicyclo{[}2.2.2]octane
   (DABCO) ligand in the pillared Zn-DMOF and Zn-DMOF-TM (TM = tetramethyl)
   structures. While DABCO is known to be displaced in the presence of
   water in the parent Zn-DMOF structure, the Zn-DMOF-TM variation is
   highly stable even after adsorbing significant amounts of water vapor.
   The dynamics of DABCO in the presence of water guest molecules is
   therefore also explored in the Zn-DMOF-TM structure via in situ NMR and
   IR experiments. This analysis shows that the rotational motion of the
   DABCO linkers is dependent on water content, but not a likely source of
   water instability because the dynamics are fast and largely unaffected
   by the presence of methyl functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of detailed numerical simulations of the
   flow over a submerged bridge. The method of Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
   is applied, which allows elucidation of the instantaneous flow and
   accurate quantification of its turbulence statistics. The in-house LES
   code employs a free surface algorithm based on the Level Set Method
   (LSM) to determine the complex water surface profile over the bridge,
   which is validated with data from a physical model of the bridge under
   analogous flow conditions. Numerically predicted water surface profiles
   show good agreement with measured data. The water surface resembles that
   of the flow over a broad-crested weir with a plunging nappe and a
   standing wave downstream of the bridge. The mean flow is characterized
   by a multitude of complex flow features including horizontal
   recirculation zones upstream and downstream of the bridge abutment and
   vertical recirculation zones of the separated plunging flow. The latter
   influences significantly the near-bed turbulence and the bed shear
   stress.}},

Title = {{Configurational meaning and conceptual shifts in design}},
Journal = {{Journal of Architecture}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-243}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Configuration is defined as the entailment of a set of co-present
   relationships embedded in a design, such that we can read a logic into
   the way in which the design is put together. We discuss conceptual
   shifts during design with particular emphasis on the designer's
   understanding of what kind of configuration the particular design is.
   The design for the Unitarian Church offers an historical example of such
   shifts, authorised by Kahn's own post-rationalisation of the design
   process. We subsequently construct a formal computational experiment
   where the generation, description and re-conceptualisation of designs is
   rendered entirely discursive. The experiment serves to clarify the
   nature of conceptual shifts in actual design, and the reasons why a
   reading of such shifts cannot be based on discursive evidence only but
   necessarily requires us to engage presentational forms of symbolisation
   as well. Our examples demonstrate how a conceptual shift within a
   particular design can lead to the discovery of a new potential design
   world. In the historical case, the conceptualisation of a new design
   world remains implicit and inadequately specified. But the theoretical
   experiment allows us to make explicit how geometrically similar
   configurations that arise from the application of one set of generative
   rules may possess systematic but entirely unanticipated perceptual
   properties, subsequently incorporated in new generative rules.}},

   stability in ambient a passivation layer of Al2O3 is grown by atomic

   chemicals that can either permeate through or diffuse out of the

Abstract = {{The effect of air processing, with air exposure varying from minutes to

   cell based on poly(dithienogermole-alt-thienopyrrolodione)
   p(DTG-TPD)/PC71BM blends. A similar to 10\% degradation in power
   conversion efficiency was observed due to air processing with 10 min
   exposure time, with AM1.5 power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)
   decreasing from 8.5 +/- 0.25\% for devices processed in inert nitrogen
   atmosphere to 7.7 +/- 0.18\% for devices processed in ambient air. After
   3 h air exposure, the PCE leveled off at 7.04 +/- 0.1\%. This decrease
   is attributed partially to interface issues caused by exposure of the
   electrode materials to oxygen and water and partially to a degradation
   of the hole transport in the active layer.}},

   silver nanocubes was deposited on a quartz substrate using the
   Langmuir-Blodgett technique and subsequently coated with an ultrathin

   the trans and cis states of the azobenzene-terminated branched POSS
   material results in significant changes in the refractive index (up to
   0.17) at a wavelength of 380 nm. We observed that the pronounced and
   reversible change in the surrounding refractive index results in a
   corresponding hypsochromic plasmonic shift of 6 nm in the plasmonic band
   of the embedded silver nanocubes. The reversible tuning of the plasmonic
   modes of noble-metal nanostructures using a variable-refractive-index

   Output Voltage and Multifold Enhanced Charge Transport}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{The open-circuit voltage of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
   increases with the tribo-charge density and the separated distance
   between two tribo-surfaces, which can reach several thousand volts and
   is much higher than the working voltage required by most electrical
   devices and energy storage units. Therefore, improving the effective
   efficiency of TENGs requires reducing the output voltage and enhancing
   the transferred charges. Here, a multilayered-electrode-based TENG
   (ME-TENG) is developed in which the output voltage can be managed by
   controlling the charge flow in a process of multiple (N) steps, which
   results in N times lower voltage but N times higher total charge
   transport. The ME-TENG is demonstrated to work in various modes,
   including multichannel, single-channel, and double-tribo-surface
   structures. The effects of insulator layer thickness and total layer
   number on the output voltage are simulated by the finite element method.
   The output voltage can be modulated from 14 to 102 V by changing the
   insulator layer number between two adjacent working electrodes, based on
   which the 8-bit logic representations of the characters in the ACSII
   code table are demonstrated. The ME-TENG provides a novel method to
   manage the output power and has potential applications in self-powered
   sensors array and human-machine interfacing with logic communications.}},

Abstract = {{Flow electrode deionization (FCDI) is an emerging area for continuous
   and scalable deionization, but the electrochemical and flow properties
   of the flow electrode need to be improved to minimize energy
   consumption. Chemical oxidation of granular activated carbon (AC) was
   examined here to study the role of surface heteroatoms on rheology and
   electrochemical performance of a flow electrode (carbon slurry) for
   deionization processes. Moreover, it was demonstrated that higher mass
   densities could be used without increasing energy for pumping when using
   oxidized active material. High mass-loaded flow electrodes (28\% carbon
   content) based on oxidized AC displayed similar viscosities (similar to
   21 Pa s) to lower mass-loaded flow electrodes (20\% carbon content)
   based on nonoxidized AC. The 40\% increased mass loading (from 20\% to
   28\%) resulted in a 25\% increase in flow electrode gravimetric
   capacitance (from 65 to 83 F g(-1)) without sacrificing flowability
   (viscosity). The electrical energy required to remove similar to 18\% of
   the ions (desalt) from of the feed solution was observed to be
   significantly dependent on the mass loading and decreased (similar to
   60\%) from 92 +/- 7 to 28 +/- 2.7 J with increased mass densities from 5
   to 23 wt \%. It is shown that the surface chemistry of the active
   material in a flow electrode effects the electrical and pumping energy
   requirements of a FCDI system.}},

Abstract = {{To minimize environmental pharmaceutical micropollutants, treatment of
   human urine could be an efficient approach due to the high
   pharmaceutical concentration and toxic potential excreted in urine. This
   study investigated the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of
   sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and
   N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (acetyl-SMX) in synthetic fresh and
   hydrolyzed human urines by low-pressure UV, and UV combined with H2O2
   and peroxydisulfate (PDS). The objective was to compare the two advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs) and assess the impact of urine matrices. All
   three compounds reacted quickly in the AOPs, exhibiting rate constants
   of (6.09-8.53) x 10(9) M-1.s(-1) with hydroxyl radical, and (2.35-16.1)
   x 10(9) M-1.s(-1) with sulfate radical. In fresh urine matrix, the
   pharmaceuticals' indirect photolysis was significantly suppressed by the
   scavenging effect of urine citrate and urea. In hydrolyzed urine matrix,
   the indirect photolysis was strongly affected by inorganic urine
   constituents. Chloride had no apparent impact on UV/H2O2, but
   significantly raised the hydroxyl radical concentration in UV/PDS.
   Carbonate species reacted with hydroxyl or sulfate radical to generate
   carbonate radical, which degraded SMX and TMP, primarily due to the
   presence of aromatic amino group(s) (k = 2.68 x 10(8) and 3.45 x 10(7)
   M-1.s(-1)) but reacted slowly with acetyl-SMX. Ammonia reacted with
   hydroxyl or sulfate radical to generate reactive nitrogen species that
   could react appreciably only with SMX. Kinetic simulation of radical
   concentrations, along with products analysis, helped elucidate the major
   reactive species in the pharmaceuticals' degradation. Overall, the AOPs'
   performance was higher in the hydrolyzed urine than fresh urine matrix
   with UV/PDS better than UV/H2O2, and varied significantly depending on
   pharmaceutical's structure.}},

Title = {{Opposing Effects of Humidity on Rhodochrosite Surface Oxidation}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2366-2371}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Rhodochrosite (MnCO3) is a model mineral representing carbonate aerosol
   particles containing redox-active elements that can influence particle
   surface reconstruction in humid air, thereby affecting the heterogeneous
   transformation of important atmospheric constituents such as nitric
   oxides, sulfur dioxides, and organic acids. Using in situ atomic force
   microscopy, we show that the surface reconstruction of rhodochrosite in
   humid oxygen leads to the formation and growth of oxide nanostructures.
   The oxidative reconstruction consists of two consecutive processes with
   distinctive time scales, including a long waiting period corresponding
   to slow nucleation and a rapid expansion phase corresponding to fast
   growth. By varying the relative humidity from 55 to 78\%, we further
   show that increasing humidity has opposing effects on the two processes,
   accelerating nucleation from 2.8(+/- 0.2) x 10(-3) to 3.0(+/- 0.2) x
   10(-2) h(-1) but decelerating growth from 7.5(+/- 0.3) x 10(-3) to
   3.1(+/- 0.1) x 10(-3) mu m(2) h(-1). Through quantitative analysis, we
   propose that nanostructure nucleation is controlled by rhodochrosite
   surface dissolution, similar to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism
   proposed for carbonate mineral surface reconstruction in aqueous
   solution. To explain nanostructure growth in humid oxygen, a new
   Cabrera-Mott mechanism involving electron tunneling and solid-state
   diffusion is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{UiO-66 is a Zr-based MOF that is being highly investigated for a wide
   variety of small molecule gas separations since it possess unprecedented
   thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. In this work, we have
   investigated the performance of various functionalized variations of
   UiO-66 (UiO-66-OH, UiO-66-(OH)(2), UiO-66-NO2, UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-SO3H,
   and UiO-66-(COOH)(2)) towards ammonia removal from air. Functionalized
   UiO-66 analogs have been synthesized solvothermally and characterized
   using ammonia breakthrough measurements under dry and humid (80\% RH)
   air conditions along with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns and
   results from BET modeling of N-2 adsorption isotherms. Counter to
   chemical intuition, our study demonstrates that the ammonia capacities
   of UiO-66-SO3H and UiO-66-(COOH)(2) are lower than UiO-66-OH and
   UiO-66-NH2. This is due to significant reduction in the framework
   porosity (surface area and pore volume) upon functionalization with
   bulky functional groups such as -COOH and -SO3H. The -OH group is the
   least bulky functional group considered in the work and interacts
   favorably with ammonia. UiO-66-OH has a capacity of similar to 5.7
   mmol/g for ammonia under dry conditions which is very close to the
   ammonia removal goal of 0.1 g/g MOF (or similar to 6 mmol/g). However,
   we observed a decrease in the ammonia capacities of functionalized
   UiO-66 variations under humid conditions due to competition between
   water and ammonia molecules for adsorption on the active sites. Overall,
   balancing the water adsorption behavior and high selectivity and high
   capacity for ammonia is crucial to developing new adsorbents for ammonia
   removal from air. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies have created the potential for new forms of
   organizing among geographically dispersed individuals by connecting
   their ideas across the time and space in complex multiteam systems
   (MTSs). Realizing this potential requires novel forms of shared
   leadership structures to shepherd divergent and convergent thinking
   necessary to nurture innovation. While there is limited research on how
   space influences leadership and how the time influences leadership,
   there is virtually no theorizing on how space and time interact together
   to influence the emergence of shared leadership structures that
   facilitates innovation. A key contribution of this study is to utilize
   an agent-based model (ABM) that draws upon the research on leadership,
   networks, and innovation to specify generative mechanisms (or
   micro-processes) through which shared leadership structures emerge over
   space and time. The parameters in this model were estimated from
   empirical data. Results of virtual experiments (VE) yielded testable
   hypotheses suggesting that, over time, leadership capacity and
   between-team ties are negatively influenced by space. Furthermore, the
   computational model suggests that space increases the concentration of
   divergent leadership but decreases the concentration of convergent
   leadership. The study concludes by discussing the implications for the
   design of effective leadership structures to nurture innovation in MTSs.}},

Abstract = {{Water availability is one of the greatest global sustainability
   challenges. Water is not available in adequate quantity and quality in
   many areas and water shortfalls are expected to increase. Businesses are
   lacing water-related challenges due to inadequate water availability and

   enabling companies to make effective management decisions. Several water
   assessment tools have been developed to help companies understand the
   complex nature of water challenges; however, there remain significant
   gaps in the datasets and inconsistencies in measurement and reporting of
   geographic water shortfalls. There is a need for more complete datasets
   containing information on water withdrawal and discharge, freshwater
   availability and depletion (spatially and temporally), water quality
   monitoring, reuse and recycling. We discuss four of the available water
   assessment tools (Global Water Tool, India Water Tool, Water Risk Filter

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the evaluation of synergies that derive from the
   implementation of policy packages designed to promote the use of public
   transportation and limit traffic congestion in urban areas. In this
   study, we propose the application of a land-use and transportation
   integrated (LUTI) model to study the outcomes from the implementation of
   two policy packages. We apply the long-term strategic LUTI model
   MARS-Madrid to analyze an empirical case study in Madrid, Spain. The
   analyzed policies include a road pricing scheme (congestion charge) in
   the city center and an increase in the level of service of public
   transportation (bus frequency changes) in the whole region. Different
   scenarios, involving the implementation of respectively each one of
   these policies separately or both policies simultaneously, are simulated
   and compared to a base scenario (business as usual, or
   ``do-nothing{''}). We evaluate the effects of these policies on several
   transportation indicators and on social welfare, and discuss the
   optimization of these policies in isolation or combined as a policy
   package. The study provides insights into the suitability of the
   proposed LUTI modeling approach to evaluate the impact of transportation
   policies in urban and metropolitan areas, and the evaluation of
   synergies from transportation policies, a topic that is not enough

Abstract = {{The closed-form analytical solution to the equations of motion for
   ballistic entry developed by Allen and Eggers is presented using modern
   nomenclature and is extended and enhanced through several new
   developments. A method of choosing an appropriate constant flight-path
   angle is identified. Analytical limits are proposed that bound the
   domain of applicability of the approximation. Closed-form expressions
   for range and time are developed that are consistent with the
   assumptions in the Allen-Eggers approximation. Collectively, the
   improvements address key weaknesses in the original approximate
   solution. Assessment of the accuracy of the approximate solution
   relative to the planar equations of motion shows that the extended and
   enhanced Allen-Eggers solution provides good accuracy across a wide
   range of ballistic coefficients at Earth with initial flight-path angles
   steeper than about -7 deg. In some instances, the expression developed
   for range-to-go may be accurate enough for use in onboard real-time

Title = {{Estimating Prevalence of Overweight or Obese Children and Adolescents in
   Small Geographic Areas Using Publicly Available Data}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Interventions for pediatric obesity can be geographically targeted if
   high-risk populations can be identified. We developed an approach to
   estimate the percentage of overweight or obese children aged 2 to 17
   years in small geographic areas using publicly available data. We
   piloted our approach for Georgia.
   Methods
   We created a logistic regression model to estimate the individual
   probability of high body mass index (BMI), given data on the
   characteristics of the survey participants. We combined the regression
   model with a simulation to sample subpopulations and obtain prevalence
   estimates. The models used information from the 2001-2010 National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the 2010 Census, and the 2010
   American Community Survey. We validated our results by comparing 1)
   estimates for adults in Georgia produced by using our approach with
   estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
   2) estimates for children in Arkansas produced by using our approach
   with school examination data. We generated prevalence estimates for
   census tracts in Georgia and prioritized areas for interventions.
   Results
   In DeKalb County, the mean prevalence among census tracts varied from
   27\% to 40\%. For adults, the median difference between our estimates
   and CDC estimates was 1.3 percentage points; for Arkansas children, the
   median difference between our estimates and examination-based estimates
   data was 1.7 percentage points.
   Conclusion
   Prevalence estimates for census tracts can be different from estimates
   for the county, so small-area estimates are crucial for designing
   effective interventions. Our approach validates well against external
   data, and it can be a relevant aid for planning local interventions for
   children.}},

Abstract = {{Sn materials offer high theoretical capacities in lithium ion batteries,
   but they must have good cycling stability and high rate-capability in
   order to be commercialized. Complex and costly material treatments of Sn
   have been effective in reducing capacity fade, but conventionally
   produced bare Sn is desired for reducing cost. One simple method is to
   form a high-quality solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Sn particles
   with low resistance and high passivation. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)
   added to the electrolyte forms a protective and less-resistant SEI on Sn
   particles during the in-situ electrochemical SEI formation cycle. FEC is
   a good oxidizing agent that removes highly oxidized carbon compounds and
   makes a SEI thinner during an oxidation process (delithiation) of SEI
   formation cycle. The high-quality SEI greatly improves the
   rate-capability and capacity of nano-sized bare Sn electrodes without
   any treatments: minimal capacity fade (0.014\% cycle(-1)) at 320 mA h
   g(-1) (1.3 C) for 150 cycles. The mitigating effect of FEC on capacity
   fade is not seen with electrodes fabricated from microscale (0.1 similar
   to 0.2 mu m) Sn. The long lithium-ion diffusion path makes these
   micro-sized materials susceptible to decrepitation during repeated
   volume changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The search for harvesting both the mechanical and solar energies from a
   single hybrid system is of significant value and represents a new trend
   in energy harvesting technologies. This single hybrid system can utilize
   both the energy sources easily available from nature and most
   importantly it is clean and sustainable. It is a novel technique
   involving completely different physical principles utilized for
   scavenging different types of energies. This report presents studies of
   a hybrid power generator made a direct-current piezoelectric
   nanogenerator based on ZnO nanosheets and a bulk heterojunction organic
   solar cell based on an inverted structure. The device shows much larger
   electric power output compared to its two individual power output
   components, which facilitates more effective multi-type energies
   harvesting and clarifies a mechanism for realizing multi-functional
   energy devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{588-596}},

Abstract = {{Compared with conventional Ohmic-contact nanosensors, Schottky-contact
   has been introduced as a fundamentally new design for much enhanced
   sensitivity and improved responsive time of one-dimensional
   nanostructure based sensors. Here we demonstrate ZnO micro/nanowire
   sensors for hydrogen (H-2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) detections at
   room-temperature based on a metal-semiconductor-metal (M-S-M) structure.
   By utilizing strain-induced piezoelectric polarization charges presented
   at the vicinity of local interface to modify the band structure at
   Schottky contact, piezotronic effect has been introduced to
   gate/modulate the charge carriers transport process across the M-S
   contact and thus hugely enhance/optimize the performances of H-2/NO2 gas
   sensors. Upon straining, the detection sensitivity and resolution are
   obviously improved, together with a significant enhancement in output
   current by 5359\% for H-2 and 238.8\% for NO2 detection. This work
   provides a promising approach to raise the sensitivity, improve the
   detection resolution, and generally enhance the performance of gas
   sensing, making it possible for fabricating room temperature of gas
   sensor while preserving its sensitivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A fully enclosed bearing-structured self-powered rotation sensor (SPRS)
   is developed for multi-tasking motion measurement. Due to contact
   electrification between fine-sized rolling beads and a pair of planar
   electrodes, the SPRS produce cycled electric signals when attached to a
   revolving axis. They are then analyzed to reveal the rotation rate of
   the axis and other corresponding derivable parameters, including speed,
   acceleration, and traveling distance. The device displays high
   precision, broad range, quick response, and excellent durability. It has
   novel dual roles as a rotation sensor and a structural ball bearing,
   making it easily applicable to a variety of circumstances. Integrated
   with a signal-processing interface, the compact-sized and light weighted
   SPRS was practically demonstrated in providing real-time motion
   monitoring for a vehicle wheel. It is promised to be used in a wide
   range of areas, including transportation, automation, consumer products,

   stability using direct covalent-bonding between pseudocapacitive
   nanoparticles and conducting materials}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We introduce high-performance ultrathin supercapacitor electrodes
   obtained through the direct covalent-bonding layer-by-layer (LbL)
   assembly (or ligand-exchange LbL assembly) of amine-functionalized
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and transition metal oxide
   nanoparticles (TMO NPs). The main characteristic of our approach is that
   the internal interfacial resistance of the electrodes can be minimized
   through the direct covalent-bonding adsorption of densely packed,
   high-quality TMO NPs onto CNTs without the aid of nonactive binders or
   insulating NP ligands, and the resulting volumetric capacitance and
   cycling stability of the electrodes can be significantly enhanced. For
   this study, well-defined oleic acid-stabilized pseudocapacitive metal
   oxide nanoparticles (i.e., OA-Fe3O4 and OA-MnO NPs) prepared in toluene
   were densely adsorbed onto the CNT layer due to the high affinity
   between the surface of the TMO NPs and the NH2 moieties of the CNTs. The
   (CNT/OA-Fe3O4 NP)(20) multilayer electrode exhibited a high volumetric
   capacitance of 248 +/- 15 F cm(-3) (128 +/- 7 F g(-1)) at 5 mV s(-1)
   despite the intrinsically low specific capacitance of the Fe3O4 NPs.
   Additionally, these film electrodes exhibited high performance
   stability, maintaining 99.2\% of their initial capacitance after 1000
   cycles. Furthermore, upon the insertion of OA-MnO NPs with high
   crystallinity and a high theoretical pseudocapacitance value within
   multilayers instead of OA-Fe3O4 NPs, the formed electrodes (i.e.,
   (CNT/OA-MnO NP)70 multilayers) exhibited a higher volumetric capacitance
   of 305 +/- 10 F cm(-3) (183 +/- 5 F g(-1)) (at a scan rate of 5 mV
   s(-1)) than other conventional ultrathin supercapacitor electrodes,
   including manganese oxide or iron oxide NPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator technology is emerging as a promising

   Freestanding triboelectric-layer-based nanogenerators (FTENGs) are one

   the first theoretical model of FTENGs is proposed with thorough analysis
   of their operation principle. Both contact-mode and sliding-mode FTENGs
   are discussed to fully uncover their unique characteristics.
   Contact-mode FTENGs have superior linearity, which is highly beneficial
   for both energy-harvesting and self-powered sensing applications.
   Sliding-mode FTENGs have two subcategories based on the material of
   their freestanding layer. For both of the two subcategories, the
   coupling effect of the height of the freestanding layer and the
   electrode gap on their output characteristics are discussed in detail to
   obtain the strategy for their structural optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nano aluminum particles have received considerable attention in the

   their respective time scales are compared to determine the combustion
   mechanisms for different particle sizes and pressures. Experimental data
   from several sources are gathered to elucidate the effect of the
   particle size on the flame temperature of aluminum particles. The flame
   structure and the combustion modes of aluminum particles are examined
   for wide ranges of pressures, particle sizes, and oxidizers. Key
   mechanisms that dictate the combustion behaviors are discussed. Measured
   burning times of nano aluminum particles are surveyed. The effects of
   the pressure, temperature, particle size, and type and concentration of
   the oxidizer on the burning time are discussed. A new correlation for
   the burning time of nano aluminum particles is established. Major
   outstanding issues to be addressed in the future work are identified.}},
