Abstract = {{This paper presents a decentralized H controller design for the
   vibration control of civil structures. The formulation through double
   homotopy is proposed in discrete time domain and considers feedback time
   delay. It is well-known that through bounded real lemma, H controller
   design can be transformed to an optimization problem with bilinear
   matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. To obtain a decentralized H
   controller constrained by special block-diagonal patterns on controller
   matrices, there is generally no off-the-shelf package or numerical
   algorithm to solve the BMI problem. This paper proposes a double
   homotopy method to solve the BMI problem in discrete time domain. The
   method approximates the BMI problem to a series of linear matrix
   inequality problems along two homotopic paths, and gradually deforms a
   centralized controller to a decentralized controller. The proposed
   method is first studied numerically with a six-story building example,
   and then validated experimentally through shaking table tests of a
   two-story frame with active mass dampers. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {{In dilute acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, lignin has been
   shown to form droplets that deposit on the cellulose surface and retard
   enzymatic digestion of cellulose (Donohoe et al., 2008; Selig et al.,
   2007). However, studies of this nature are limited for hydrothermal
   pretreatment, with the result that the corresponding mechanisms that
   inhibit cellulosic enzymes are not well understood. In this study,
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) and wet chemical analysis of solids
   formed by hydrothermal pretreatment of a mixture of Avicel cellulose and
   poplar wood showed that lignin droplets from poplar wood relocated onto
   the Avicel surface. In addition, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed
   higher S/G ratios in deposited lignin than the initial lignin in poplar
   wood. Furthermore, the lignin droplets deposited on Avicel significantly
   impeded cellulose hydrolysis. A series of tests confirmed that blockage
   of the cellulose surface by lignin droplets was the main cause of
   cellulase inhibition. The results give new insights into the fate of
   lignin in hydrothermal pretreatment and its effects on enzymatic
   hydrolysis. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 485-492. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have tremendous potential as
   tools for regenerative medicine and drug discovery, yet the lack of
   processes to manufacture viable and homogenous cell populations of
   sufficient numbers limits the clinical translation of current and future
   cell therapies. Microencapsulation of ESCs within microbeads can shield
   cells from hydrodynamic shear forces found in bioreactor environments
   while allowing for sufficient diffusion of nutrients and oxygen through
   the encapsulation material. Despite initial studies examining alginate
   microbeads as a platform for stem cell expansion and directed
   differentiation, the impact of alginate encapsulation parameters on stem
   cell phenotype has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to systematically examine the effects of
   varying alginate compositions on microencapsulated ESC expansion and
   phenotype. Pre-formed aggregates of murine ESCs were encapsulated in
   alginate microbeads composed of a high or low ratio of guluronic to
   mannuronic acid residues (High G and High M, respectively), with and
   without a poly-L-lysine (PLL) coating, thereby providing four distinct
   alginate bead compositions for analysis. Encapsulation in all alginate
   compositions was found to delay differentiation, with encapsulation
   within High G alginate yielding the least differentiated cell
   population. The addition of a PLL coating to the High G alginate
   prevented cell escape from beads for up to 14 days. Furthermore,
   encapsulation within High M alginate promoted differentiation toward a
   primitive endoderm phenotype. Taken together, the findings of this study
   suggest that distinct ESC expansion capacities and differentiation
   trajectories emerge depending on the alginate composition employed,
   indicating that encapsulation material physical properties can be used
   to control stem cell fate. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 618-631. (c)

Abstract = {{The work describes the manufacturing and testing of graded
   conventional/auxetic honeycomb cores. The graded honeycombs are
   manufactured using Kevlar woven fabric/914 epoxy prepreg using Kirigami
   techniques, which consist in a combination of Origami and ply-cut
   processes. The cores are used to manufacture sandwich panels for
   flatwise compression and edgewise loading. The compressive modulus and
   compressive strength of stabilized (sandwich) honeycombs are found to be
   higher than those of bare honeycombs, and with density-averaged
   properties enhanced compared to other sandwich panels offered in the
   market place. The modulus and strength of graded sandwich panel under
   quasi-static edgewise loading vary with different failure mode
   mechanisms, and offer also improvements towards available panels from
   open literature. Edgewise impact loading shows a strong directionality
   of the mechanical response. When the indenter impacts the auxetic
   portion of the graded core, the strong localization of the damage due to
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect contains significantly the maximum
   dynamic displacement of the sandwich panel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An AlGaN deep ultraviolet laser diode design exploiting AlN substrates
   is presented, featuring an inverse-tapered p-waveguide layer. The 2-D
   optoelectronic simulation predicts lasing at 290 nm. Spatial balancing
   of the lasing mode to minimize optical loss in the p-Ohmic metallization
   is achieved through the use of a narrow bandgap yet transparent
   n-waveguide layer. Several electron blocking layer (EBL) designs are
   investigated and compared with a conventionally tapered EBL design.
   Through judicious volumetric redistribution of fixed negative
   polarization charge, inverse tapering may be exploited to achieve nearly
   flat valence band profiles free from barriers to hole injection into the
   active region, in contrast to conventional designs. Furthermore, proper
   selection of quantum well barrier and spacer compositions are
   demonstrated to reduce electron leakage from the active region.
   Numerical simulations demonstrate that the inverse tapered strategy is a
   viable solution for efficient hole injection in deep ultraviolet laser
   diodes operating at shorter wavelengths (<290 nm).}},

Abstract = {{Laser welding is one of the promising ways for manufacturing metallic
   glass products with complicated shape and geometry. In this work we
   focus on the effect of annealing treatment and welding parameters on
   laser welding of annealed Zr55Cu30Ni5Al10 bulk metallic glass as
   intended and unintended heat treatment occurs in the process. We find
   that laser welding can produce well welded specimen plates with no
   obvious welding defects in the joints and high welding speed may lead to
   better joints. Although higher annealing temperature or longer annealing
   time leads crystallization, bulk metallic glass material still remains
   largely amorphous in the heat affected zone. Compared with the welded
   joint without annealing, the micro-hardness and bending strength are
   enhanced due to the presence of the nanocrystals occurred in annealed
   welding joint. Therefore, appropriate annealing treatment with the
   annealing temperature near the glass transition temperature and
   annealing time as long as that in hot embossing of BMG parts may play a
   beneficial role in laser welding of metallic glasses. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Kriging is commonly used for developing emulators as surrogates for
   computationally intensive simulations. One difficulty with kriging is
   the potential numerical instability in the computation of the inverse of
   the covariance matrix, which can lead to large variability and poor
   performance of the kriging predictor. First, we study some causes of
   ill-conditioning in kriging. We then study the use of nugget in kriging
   to overcome the numerical instability. Some asymptotic results on its
   interpolation bias and mean squared prediction errors are presented.
   Finally, we study the choice of the nugget parameter based on some
   algebraic lower bounds and use of a regularizing trace. A simulation
   study is performed to show the differences between kriging with and
   without nugget and to demonstrate the advantages of the former. This
   article has supplementary materials online.}},

Title = {{Searching Feasible Design Space by Solving Quantified Constraint
   Satisfaction Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{In complex systems design, multidisciplinary constraints are imposed by
   stakeholders. Engineers need to search feasible design space for a given
   problem before searching for the optimum design solution. Searching
   feasible design space can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction
   problem (CSP). By introducing logical quantifiers, CSP is extended to
   quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP) so that more semantics
   and design intent can be captured. This paper presents a new approach to
   formulate searching design problems as QCSPs in a continuous design
   space based on generalized interval, and to numerically solve them for
   feasible solution sets, where the lower and upper bounds of design
   variables are specified. The approach includes two major components. One
   is a semantic analysis which evaluates the logic relationship of
   variables in generalized interval constraints based on Kaucher
   arithmetic, and the other is a branch-and-prune algorithm that takes
   advantage of the logic interpretation. The new approach is generic and
   can be applied to the case when variables occur multiple times, which is
   not available in other QCSP solving methods. A hybrid stratified Monte
   Carlo method that combines interval arithmetic with Monte Carlo sampling
   is also developed to verify the correctness of the QCSP solution sets
   obtained by the branch-and-prune algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Co-feeding water is shown to increase the reaction rate in the gas
   phase, H-BEA catalyzed alkylation of phenol with propylene.
   Additionally, substitution of isopropanol for propylene produces
   co-generated water from alcohol dehydration within the zeolite crystal,
   which is concomitant with enhanced alkylation rates. Catalyst
   characterization using pyridine infrared spectroscopy and isopropylamine
   temperature programmed desorption indicates that some Lewis acid sites
   can be converted to Bronsted acid sites in zeolite beta in the presence
   of water, causing an overall increase in the number of Bronsted acid
   sites, resulting in subsequent improvements in reaction rate. The
   results suggest that biomass derived, aqueous alcohols might be suitable
   alkylating agents for bio-oil derived phenolic compounds, owing to the
   positive effects of modest amounts of water on the catalyst activity.}},

Abstract = {{Computational models of the heart's mitral valve (MV) exhibit potential
   for preoperative surgical planning in ischemic mitral regurgitation
   (IMR). However challenges exist in defining boundary conditions to
   accurately model the function and response of the chordae tendineae to
   both IMR and surgical annuloplasty repair. Towards this goal, a
   ground-truth data set was generated by quantifying the isolated effects
   of IMR and mitral annuloplasty on leaflet coaptation, regurgitation, and
   tethering forces of the anterior strut and posterior intermediary
   chordae tendineae. MVs were excised from ovine hearts (N = 15) and
   mounted in a pulsatile heart simulator which has been demonstrated to
   mimic the systolic MV geometry and coaptation of healthy and chronic IMR
   sheep. Strut and intermediary chordae from both MV leaflets (N = 4) were
   instrumented with force transducers. Tested conditions included a
   healthy control, IMR, oversized annuloplasty, true-sized annuloplasty,
   and undersized mitral annuloplasty. A2-P2 leaflet coaptation length,
   regurgitation, and chordal tethering were quantified and statistically
   compared across experimental conditions. MR was successfully simulated
   with significant increases in MR, tethering forces for each of the
   chordae, and decrease in leaflet coaptation (p<. 05). Compared to the
   IMR condition, increasing levels of downsized annuloplasty significantly
   reduced regurgitation, increased coaptation, reduced posteromedial
   papillary muscle strut chordal forces, and reduced intermediary chordal
   forces from the anterolateral papillary muscle (p<. 05). These results
   provide for the first time a novel comprehensive data set for refining
   the ability of computational MV models to simulate IMR and varying sizes
   of complete rigid ring annuloplasty.}},

Abstract = {{Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) exhibit very different
   short-circuit behavior than synchronous generators, and the conventional
   voltage-behind-reactance model typically used for short-circuit
   calculations is not appropriate for generators of this type. A new
   short-circuit model is proposed in this paper for DFIGs under balanced
   faults and uninterrupted control of the rotor-side converter (RSC) and
   grid-side converter (GSC). The proposed positive-sequence short-circuit
   model represents the RSC and GSC as controlled current sources within
   the conventional induction machine steady-state equivalent circuit.
   Short-circuit calculations using the proposed positive-sequence model of
   the DFIG are compared with transient simulations of a megawatt-scale
   DFIG under a three-phase fault. Additionally, calculations using the
   proposed model are compared with experimental short-circuit test results
   on a 6.8 kVA, 230 V DFIG testbed. From the experimental tests, it is
   found that mutual-flux saturation in the DFIG significantly affects the
   short-circuit behavior, and these effects are discussed in detail in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{With increased penetration of wind generation, the traditional control
   scheme of the wind turbine (WT), which is designed for maximum wind
   power extraction, is no longer suitable to meet emerging grid
   requirements for wind farms to participate in frequency regulation. The
   control scheme of the WT with respect to grid frequency regulation is
   proposed in many studies, such as those on pitch control. Also, energy
   storage technologies have drawn much attention in recent years because,
   as technology matures and costs decrease, they present themselves as a
   potential solution for the challenge brought about by the uncertainty of
   renewable energy generation with regard to power system stability. A
   power system consisting of a high penetration of wind generation and
   energy storage systems (ESS) is investigated in this paper for the
   regulation of grid frequency. A new strategy called state of charge
   (SoC) feedback control is proposed, and the performance of the grid
   frequency deviation response and the SoC of the battery are presented.
   The model of the power system studied in this paper is established on
   the MATLAB/SIMULINK platform.}},

   Anterior Leaflet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEART VALVE DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{171-176}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: Anterior leaflet flail resulting from
   elongated or ruptured marginal chordae is frequently diagnosed among
   adults, and is amenable to surgical repair. The study aim was to
   investigate the efficacy of three surgical techniques, namely
   neochordoplasty, limited triangular resection and edge-to-edge repair,
   to correct anterior leaflet flail in an in-vitro experimental model.
   Methods: Seven porcine mitral valves were evaluated in a pulsatile heart
   simulator before surgical manipulation, after anterior marginal chordae
   transection, and with each surgical repair. Marginal chordal transection
   induced leaflet flail with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Following
   the confirmation of MR via direct flow measurements, it was corrected by
   three repairs: neochordoplasty with ePTFE sutures, limited triangular
   resection, and edge-to-edge repair. The post-repair valve hemodynamics
   were quantified under pulsatile conditions of 120 mmHg peak transmitral
   pressure and 5 1/min cardiac output at 70 beats/min. Hemodynamic,
   geometric and echocardiographic indices were also measured.
   Results: Transecting the marginal chordae induced A2 prolapse and
   produced the regurgitant fraction to 18.7 +/- 10.2\%. Surgical repair
   effectively reduced the regurgitant fraction to 6.9 +/- 6.3\% (p = 0.019
   to prolapse, p = 0.0117 to baseline) with neochordae, to 5.8 +/- 7.0\%
   (p = 0.03 to prolapse, p = 0.0378 to baseline) with triangular
   resection, and to 13.3 +/- 10.2\% (p = 0.2091 to prolapse, p = 0.0045 to
   baseline) with edge-to-edge repair. Remnant regurgitation was largest
   with edge-to-edge repair compared to limited leaflet resection and
   neochordoplasty, though central leaflet coaptation was restored equally
   by the three repairs, with mild systolic leaflet restriction after
   repair.
   Conclusion: Anterior leaflet repair and a reduction in MR is achievable
   with the three techniques, although neochordoplasty and triangular
   resection proved superior to edge-to-edge repair in eliminating MR.}},

Abstract = {{Technology advancement that can provide new solutions and enable
   augmented capabilities to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
   (CMOS)-based technology, such as active and adaptive interaction between
   machine and human/ambient, is highly desired. Piezotronic nanodevices
   and integrated systems exhibit potential in achieving these application
   goals. Utilizing the gating effect of piezopotential over carrier
   behaviors in piezoelectric semiconductor materials under externally
   applied deformation, the piezoelectric and semiconducting properties
   together with optoelectronic excitation processes can be coupled in
   these materials for the investigation of novel fundamental physics and
   the implementation of unprecedented applications. Piezopotential is
   created by the strain-induced ionic polarization in the piezoelectric
   semiconducting crystal. Piezotronics deal with the devices fabricated
   using the piezopotential as a `gate' voltage to tune/control
   charge-carrier transport across the metal-semiconductor contact or the
   p-n junction. Piezo-phototronics is to use the piezopotential for
   controlling the carrier generation, transport, separation and/or
   recombination for improving the performance of optoelectronic devices.
   This review intends to provide an overview of the rapid progress in the
   emerging fields of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics. The concepts and
   results presented in this review show promises for implementing novel
   nano-electromechanical devices and integrating with
   micro/nano-electromechanical system technology to achieve augmented
   functionalities to the state-of-the-art CMOS technology that may find
   applications in the human-machine interfacing, active
   flexible/stretchable electronics, sensing, energy harvesting, biomedical
   diagnosis/therapy, and prosthetics.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cellular networks have been undergoing an extraordinarily fast evolution
   in the past years. With commercial deployments of Release 8 (Rel-8) Long
   Term Evolution (LTE) already being carried out worldwide, a significant
   effort is being put forth by the research and standardization
   communities on the development and specification of LTE-Advanced. The
   work started in Rel-10 by the Third Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP) had the initial objective of meeting the International Mobile
   Telecommunications-Advanced (IMT-Advanced) requirements set by the
   International Telecommunications Union (ITU) which defined fourth
   generation (4G) systems. However, predictions based on the wireless
   traffic explosion in recent years indicate a need for more advanced
   technologies and higher performance. Hence, 3GPP's efforts have
   continued through Rel-11 and now Rel-12. This paper provides a
   state-of-the-art comprehensive view on the key enabling technologies for
   LTE-Advanced systems. Already consolidated technologies developed for
   Rel-10 and Rel-11 are reviewed while novel approaches and enhancements
   currently under consideration for Rel-12 are also discussed. Technical
   challenges for each of the main areas of study are pointed out as an
   encouragement for the research community to participate in this
   collective effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Asymptotic Approach to Oblique Cross-Sectional Analysis of Beams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Structural and aeroelastic analyses using beam theories by default
   choose a cross section that is perpendicular to the reference line. In
   several cases, such as swept wings with high AR, a beam theory that
   allows for the choice of a cross section that is oblique to the
   reference line may be more convenient. This work uses the variational
   asymptotic method (VAM) to develop such a beam theory. The problems
   addressed are the planar deformation of a strip and the full 3D
   deformation of a solid, prismatic, right-circular cylinder, both made of
   homogeneous, isotropic material. The motivation for choosing these
   problems is primarily the existence of 3D elasticity solutions, which
   comprise a complete validation set for all possible deformations and
   which are shown to be accurately captured by the current analysis. A
   secondary motivation was that the development and final results of the
   beam theory, i.e., the cross-sectional stiffness matrix and
   stress-strain-displacement recovery relations, are obtainable as
   closed-form analytical expressions. These results, coupled with the
   VAM-based beam analysis being devoid of ad hoc assumptions, culminate in
   what is expected to be of significance when formulating a general
   oblique cross-sectional analysis for beams with anisotropic material and
   initial curvature/twist, the detailed treatment of which will be alluded
   to in a later paper.}},

   for hydrogen separation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{453}},
Pages = {{516-524}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important processes in producing high purity hydrogen is
   separating hydrogen from a mixture of gas streams. This work looks at
   intermetallics, stoichiometric compounds of two or more metals, as
   prospective membranes for these applications. We describe a systematic
   computational screening approach based on calculation of key properties
   like solubility, diffusivity and permeability of hydrogen through these
   materials using quantitatively accurate Density Functional Theory
   calculations. Solubility was used as a screening parameter and
   solubility data has been calculated for 78 Pd-based binary
   intermetallics. Permeability calculations were performed for the
   shortlisted candidates. After systematically examining all Pd-based
   intermetallics, no material was found to have higher hydrogen
   permeability than pure Pd. To investigate the potential influence of
   hydrogen on the stability of metastable phases, we examined a number of
   metastable structures of Pd3Mn. Two metastable Pd3Mn phases are
   stabilized in the presence of hydrogen, but these phases are predicted
   to have low permeability. We also explored whether an empirical
   relationship could be found to rapidly predict H solubility in
   intermetallics using a QSPR approach. Unfortunately, the values
   calculated using this empirical approach cannot be used to make useful
   predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a Si-graphene composite, which is composed of nano Si
   particles and nano-sized multi-layer graphene particles, and micro-sized
   multi-layer graphene plate conductor, was used as the anode for Li-ion
   battery. The Si-graphene electrode showed the high capacity and stable
   cyclability at charge/discharge rate of C/2 in half cell tests. Nickel
   cobalt aluminum material (NCA) was used as a cathode in the full cell to
   evaluate the practicality of the new Si-graphene material. Although the
   Si-graphene anode has more capacity than the NCA cathode in this
   designed full cell, the Si-graphene anode had a greater effect on the
   full-cell performance due to its large initial irreversible capacity
   loss and continuous SEI formation during cycling. When fluoro-ethylene
   carbonate was added to the electrolyte, the cyclability of the full cell
   was much improved due to less SEI formation, which was confirmed by the
   decreases in the 1st irreversible capacity loss, overpotential for the
   1st lithiation, and the resistance of the SEI. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this work structural reliability assessment is presented for
   structures with uncertain loads and material properties. Uncertain
   variables are modeled as fuzzy random variables and Interval Monte Carlo
   Simulation along with interval finite element method is used to evaluate
   failure probability. Interval Monte Carlo is compared with existing
   search algorithms used in the reliability assessment of fuzzy random
   structural systems for both efficiency and accuracy. The genetic
   algorithm as one of the well developed approaches is selected for
   comparison. Fuzzy randomness is used as a model for handling both
   aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. Fuzzy quantities are calculated
   using the -cut approach. In the case of Interval Monte Carlo, bounds on
   response quantities are obtained for each -cut using only one run of
   interval finite element method, however genetic approach requires
   performing Monte Carlo Simulation for each of the considered different
   possible combinations within the search domain (-cut) and running finite
   element for each of the Monte Carlo realizations. In the presented
   examples both load and material uncertainties are considered. Numerical
   results show the computational efficiency of the Interval Monte Carlo
   approach and its superiority to the alternative search approaches such
   as optimization and genetic algorithms. In addition, results show how
   that Interval Monte Carlo approach provides guaranteed and sharp
   enclosure to the system solution.}},

Abstract = {{A stable gain scheduled controller for a gas turbine engine that drives
   a variable pitch propeller is developed and described. A stability proof
   is developed for gain scheduled closed-loop system using global

   convex optimization tools, a single quadratic Lyapunov function is
   computed for multiple linearizations near equilibrium and nonequilibrium
   points of the nonlinear closed-loop system. This approach guarantees
   stability of the closed-loop gas turbine engine system. To verify the
   stability of the closed-loop system on-line, an optimization problem is
   proposed, which is solvable using convex optimization tools. Simulation
   results show that the developed gain scheduled controller is capable to
   regulate a turboshaft engine for large thrust commands in a stable

Abstract = {{We report the characterization of a dispersive surface acoustic wave
   (SAW) delay line for the detection of ozone in air at parts-per-billion
   (ppb) concentrations. Augmenting recent developments in wireless SAW tag
   technology, we fabricated 435 MHz SAW devices and prepared them with
   polybutadiene coatings to serve as ozone-specific gas sensors. We
   measured the frequency dependent one-port electromagnetic scattering
   parameter, S-11(f), at regular time intervals as the gas stream was
   adjusted using an EPA primary standard ozone calibrator. The temperature
   and relative humidity were also recorded using an independent commercial
   sensor. The data allowed us to estimate the sensitivity to ozone and to
   temperature, and we estimated other parameters useful in personal
   dosimetry: saturation dose, shelf life, and limit of detection. Finally,
   the built-in time multiplexed response provided reference data for first
   order temperature compensation, yielding a chemical limit of detection
   of 63 ppb-min ozone. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of hydrodynamic force on microcantilever vibrations: Applications
   to liquid-phase chemical sensing}},
Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{664-672}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{At the microscale, cantilever vibrations depend not only on the
   microstructure's properties and geometry but also on the properties of
   the surrounding medium. In fact, when a microcantilever vibrates in a
   fluid, the fluid offers resistance to the motion of the beam. The study
   of the influence of the hydrodynamic force on the microcantilever's
   vibrational spectrum can be used to either (1) optimize the use of
   microcantilevers for chemical detection in liquid media or (2) extract
   the mechanical properties of the fluid. The classical method for
   application (1) in gas is to operate the microcantilever in the dynamic
   transverse bending mode for chemical detection. However, the performance
   of microcantilevers excited in this standard out-of-plane dynamic mode
   drastically decreases in viscous liquid media. When immersed in liquids,
   in order to limit the decrease of both the resonant frequency and the
   quality factor, and improve sensitivity in sensing applications,
   alternative vibration modes that primarily shear the fluid (rather than
   involving motion normal to the fluid/beam interface) have been studied
   and tested: these include in-plane vibration modes (lateral bending mode
   and elongation mode). For application (2), the classical method to
   measure the rheological properties of fluids is to use a rheometer.
   However, such systems require sampling (no in situ measurements) and a
   relatively large sample volume (a few milliliters). Moreover, the
   frequency range is limited to low frequencies (less than 200 Hz). To
   overcome the limitations of this classical method, an alternative method
   based on the use of silicon microcantilevers is presented. The method,
   which is based on the use of analytical equations for the hydrodynamic
   force, permits the measurement of the complex shear modulus of
   viscoelastic fluids over a wide frequency range. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Promoting effect of nitration modification on activated carbon in the

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A commercial activated carbon (AC) was modified with a nitration or
   amination method, and the effects of textural and chemical properties on
   the ability of the AC samples to destroy oxalic acid (OA) using ozone
   was investigated in this work. The degradation rates of OA on the
   nitrated and aminated AC samples increased by 38.5\% and 9.6\%,
   respectively. The adsorption capacity of the AC sample was not enhanced
   after modification, but the decomposition rate of ozone in solution
   increased. The surface area of AC significantly decreased after
   nitration because the entrance of micropores and some larger pores were
   blocked by the modified functional groups. In addition, the surface area
   was recovered when the nitrated AC was further aminated. We demonstrated
   that the enhancement in the catalytic activity was primarily caused by
   the differences in surface chemistry. The pH(pzc) values and Boehm
   titration results showed that nitration increased the acidity of the AC,
   while more basic groups were grafted after amination. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed desorption
   (TPD) results confirmed that-NO2 and acid oxygenated groups were
   simultaneously grafted onto AC during nitration. Meanwhile, the-NO2
   group was completely reduced to-NH2 and the carboxylic groups were
   partially reduced during amination. The basic groups (-NH2 and possible
   pyrone groups) enhanced the catalytic activity of the aminated AC
   sample, and the increased activity of the nitrated AC material was
   mainly due to the acid oxygenated surface groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel resonator structure for efficiency and
   transferred power improvements: a transmitter (a receiver) that consists
   of two strongly coupled resonators. The two strongly coupled resonators
   are embedded within a transmitter device (a receiver device) and behave
   as a single resonator with enhanced performances. Unlike the
   conventional four-coil system, the first and the fourth resonators are
   also designed to have high loaded-Q and maximum cross couplings.
   Therefore, the first and the fourth resonators also take part in the
   coupled resonance with opposite-side resonators. This provides
   additional energy exchange path. The exact design guidelines are
   provided for each different resonance topology from analytical
   derivation. It is analyzed and experimentally demonstrated that the
   efficiency and the transferred power are increased by the proposed
   two-resonator technique. For a 30 cm x 25 cm parallel-resonant
   transmitter and an 18 cm x 16 cm parallel-resonant receiver at 13-cm
   distance, the efficiency and the transferred power with the proposed
   technique are 65.2\% and 17.2 W, respectively, whereas those values
   without the proposed technique are only 37.3\% and 6.2 W.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the origin of fine particulate matter is essential to
   proposing proper strategies for heavy haze mitigation in Shanghai,
   China. In this study we used the Particulate Matter Source Apportionment
   Technology in Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions to
   quantify the impacts of emissions on the concentrations of fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5) and its important components in Shanghai
   during heavy haze episodes in late autumn (6-22 November 2010). The
   factors considered here are regions of Shanghai and its surrounding
   areas, long-range regional transport, and different local emission
   categories. The results indicate that industrial process is the dominant
   local contributor to total PM2.5 mass in the whole city except that at
   the urban center vehicle emission contributes slightly more. In
   addition, industrial process and vehicle emission are the major local
   contributors for nitrate in Shanghai, although at urban core the
   contribution from vehicle emission is remarkably larger. Generally, both
   local contribution and regional transport contribution could dominate a
   severe haze event in late autumn. However, the dominant contributor
   could either be local emission or regional transport, usually depending
   on the meteorological conditions. Therefore, particular attentions
   should be paid to the emission control in the upwind adjacent provinces,
   as well as in local areas, for developing effective strategies to reduce
   PM2.5 pollution in Shanghai.}},

Abstract = {{Competitive adsorption-desorption behavior of popular fluorescent

   on a chemically heterogeneous graphene oxide (GO) surface is discussed

   rapidly on the surface of graphene oxide as they followed the
   traditional Langmuir adsorption behavior. FTIR analysis suggested that
   both R6G and DA molecules predominantly adsorb on the hydrophilic
   oxidized regions of the GO surface. Thus, when R6G and DA compounds were
   adsorbed from mixed solution, competitive adsorption was observed around
   the oxygen-containing groups of GO sheets, which resulted in partial
   desorption of R6G molecules from the surface of GO into the solution.
   The desorbed R6G molecules can be monitored by fluorescence change in
   solution and was dependent on the DA concentration. We suggest that the
   efficient competitive adsorption of different strongly bound bioanalytes
   onto GO-dye complex can be used for the development of sensitive and
   selective colorimetric biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Reattachment of tendon to bone has been a challenge in orthopedic
   surgery. The disparate mechanical properties of the two tissues make it
   difficult to achieve direct surgical repair of the tendon-to-bone
   insertion. Healing after surgical repair typically does not regenerate
   the natural attachment, a complex tissue that connects tendon and bone
   across a gradient in both mineral content and cell phenotypes. To
   facilitate the regeneration of the attachment, our groups have developed
   a nanofiber-based scaffold with a graded mineral coating to mimic the
   mineral composition of the native tendon-to-bone insertion. In the
   present work, we evaluated the ability of this scaffold to induce graded
   osteogenesis of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). Results
   from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay
   and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining indicated that cell
   proliferation was negatively correlated with the mineral content. In
   contrast, alkaline phosphatase staining, an indicator of osteogenesis,
   was positively correlated with the mineral content. Likewise,
   runt-related transcription factor 2 (an early marker of osteoblast
   differentiation) and osteocalcin (a late marker of osteoblast
   differentiation) immunostaining were both positively correlated with the
   mineral content. These results indicate that a gradient in mineral
   content on the surface of a nanofiber scaffold is capable of inducing
   graded differentiation of ASCs into osteoblasts for enthesis repair.}},

Abstract = {{Peachlike rutile TiO2 microsphere films were successfully produced on
   transparent conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate via a facile,
   one-pot chemical bath route at low temperature (T = 80-85 degrees C) by
   introducing polyethylene glycol (PEG) as steric dispersant. The
   formation of TiO2 microspheres composed of nanoneedles was attributed to
   the acidic medium for the growth of 1D needle-shaped building blocks
   where the steric interaction of PEG reduced the aggregation of TiO2
   nanoneedles and the Ostwald ripening process. Dye-sensitized solar cells
   (DSSCs) assembled by employing these complex rutile TiO2 microspheres as
   photoanodes exhibited a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of
   2.55\%. It was further improved to a considerably high efficiency of
   5.25\% upon a series of post-treatments (i.e., calcination, TiCl4
   treatment, and O-2 plasma exposure) as a direct consequence of the
   well-crystallized TiO2 for fast electron transport, the enhanced
   capacity of dye loading, the effective light scattering, and trapping

Abstract = {{In this work, we introduced an innovative noncontact, free-rotating disk
   triboelectric nanogenerator (FRD-TENG) for sustainably scavenging the
   mechanical energy from rotary motions. Its working principle was
   clarified through numerical calculations of the
   relative-rotation-induced potential difference, which serves as the
   driving force for the electricity generation. The unique characteristic
   of the FRD-TENG enables its high output performance compared to its
   working at the contact mode, with an effective output power density of
   1.22 W/m(2) for continuously driving 100 light-emitting diodes.
   Ultrahigh stability of the output and exceptional durability of the
   device structure. were achieved, and the reliable output was utilized
   for fast/effective charging of a lithium ion battery. Based on the
   relationship between its output performance and the parameters of the
   mechanical stimuli, the FRD-TENG could be employed as a self-powered
   mechanical sensor, for simultaneously detecting the vertical
   displacement and rotation speed. The FRD-TENG has superior advantages
   over the existing disk triboelectric nanogenerator, and exhibits
   significant progress toward practical applications of nanogenerators for
   both energy harvesting and self-powered sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{Biopolymers exist within living cells as far-from-equilibrium metastable
   polymers. Living systems must constantly invest energy for biopolymer
   synthesis. In the earliest stages of life on Earth, the complex
   molecular machinery that contemporary life employs for the synthesis and
   maintenance of polymers did not exist. Thus, a major question regarding
   the origin of life is how the first far-from-equilibrium polymers
   emerged from a prebiotic ``pool{''} of monomers. Here, we describe a
   proof-of-principle system, in which L-malic acid monomers form
   far-from-equilibrium, metastable oligoesters via repeated, cyclic
   changes in hydration and temperature. Such cycles would have been
   associated with day-night and/or seasonal cycles on the early Earth. In
   our model system, sample heating, which promotes water evaporation and
   ester bond formation, drives polymerization. Even though periodic sample
   rehydration and heating in the hydrated state promotes ester bond
   hydrolysis, successive iterations of wet-dry cycles result in polymer
   yields and molecular weight distributions in excess of that observed
   after a single drying cycle. We term this phenomenon a ``polymerization
   ratchet{''}. We have quantitatively characterized the ``ratchet{''} of
   our particular system. Ester bond formation rates and oligoester
   hydrolysis rates were determined for temperatures ranging from 60 to 95
   degrees C. Based on these rates, a mathematical model was developed
   using polycondensation kinetics, from which conditions were predicted
   for oligoester growth. This model was verified experimentally by the
   demonstration that L-malic acid monomers subjected to multiple wet-dry
   cycles form oligoesters, which reach a steady-state concentration and
   mean length after several cycles. The concentration of oligoesters that
   persist between subsequent steady-state cycles depends on the
   temperature and durations of the dry and wet phases of the cycle. These
   results provide insights regarding the potential for very simple systems
   to exhibit features that would have been necessary for initiation of
   polymer evolution, before the emergence of genomes or enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF), the furan-derived analogue to
   poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), can provide a fully biosourced
   alternative to PET with greatly improved barrier properties and
   attractive thermal and mechanical properties. The improved barrier for
   PEF compared to PET is unexpected due to the higher free volume of PEF
   vs PET. Segmental motions related to penetrant diffusion in both
   polyesters were studied using dynamic mechanical analysis, C-13-CP/MAS
   solid-state NMR variable contact-time experiments, and centerband-only
   detection of exchange (CODEX) measurements. Unlike the active phenyl
   ring-flipping mechanism in PET, furan ring-flipping is greatly
   suppressed, thereby reducing beta relaxation motions and diffusion in
   PEF due to the energy penalty associated with the nonlinear axis of ring
   rotation and ring polarity. Preliminary work also shows similar oxygen
   solubilities for PEF and PET, thereby proving that the drastic
   permeability reduction results from a decrease in diffusion coefficient
   caused by a hindrance in furan ring-flipping.}},

Title = {{Soluble factors secreted by differentiating embryonic stem cells
   stimulate exogenous cell proliferation and migration}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Stem cells are being investigated as catalysts of tissue
   regeneration to either directly replace or promote cellularity lost as a
   result of traumatic injury or degenerative disease. In many reports,
   despite low numbers of stably integrated cells, the transient presence
   of cells delivered or recruited to sites of tissue remodeling globally
   benefits functional recovery. Such findings have motivated the need to
   determine how paracrine factors secreted from transplanted cells may be
   capable of positively impacting endogenous repair processes and somatic
   cell responses.
   Methods: Embryonic stem cells were differentiated as embryoid bodies
   (EBs) in vitro and media conditioned by EBs were collected at different
   intervals of time. Gene and protein expression analysis of several
   different growth factors secreted by EBs were examined by polymerase
   chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis,
   respectively, as a function of time. The proliferation and migration of
   fibroblasts and endothelial cells treated with EB conditioned media was
   examined compared with unconditioned and growth media controls.
   Results: The expression of several growth factors, including bone
   morphogenic protein-4, insulin-like growth factors and vascular
   endothelial growth factor-A, increased during the course of embryonic
   stem cell (ESC) differentiation as EBs. Conditioned media collected from
   EBs at different stages of differentiation stimulated proliferation and
   migration of both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, based on
   5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and transwell assays,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Overall, these results demonstrate that differentiating
   ESCs express increasing amounts of various growth factors over time that
   altogether are capable of stimulating mitogenic and motogenic activity
   of exogenous cell populations.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma-fluorination is an attractive route toward the work function
   engineering of graphene. The effect of surface topography of epitaxial
   graphene grown on silicon carbide on the increase in work function after
   plasma-fluorination was investigated using scanning Kelvin probe
   microscopy. Results of these studies demonstrate the ability of
   plasma-treatments to functionalize epitaxial graphene without
   significant surface roughening. For few-layer epitaxial graphene on the
   Si-face, work function distribution corresponds to its surface
   topography. A bimodal distribution is observed before and after
   fluorination and the separation between the two modes widens after the
   fluorination. For multi-layer epitaxial graphene on the C-face, no
   correlation is observed between the work function distribution and the
   surface topography. After fluorination, the work function is fairly
   uniform except in few peeled off areas that show a stronger work
   function contrast. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{An approximate solution for n-point correlation functions is developed
   in this study. In the approximate solution, weight functions are used to
   connect subsets of (n-1)-point correlation functions to estimate the
   full set of n-point correlation functions. In previous related studies,
   simple weight functions were introduced for the approximation of three
   and four-point correlation functions. In this work, the general
   framework of the weight functions is extended and derived to achieve
   optimum accuracy for approximate n-point correlation functions. Such
   approximation can be utilized to construct global n-point correlation
   functions for a system when there exist limited information about these
   functions in a subset of space. To verify its accuracy, the new
   formulation is used to approximate numerically three-point correlation
   functions from the set of two-point functions directly evaluated from a
   virtually generated isotropic heterogeneous microstructure representing
   a particulate composite system. Similarly, three-point functions are
   approximated for an anisotropic glass fiber/epoxy composite system and
   compared to their corresponding reference values calculated from an
   experimental dataset acquired by computational tomography. Results from
   both virtual and experimental studies confirm the accuracy of the new
   approximation. The new formulation can be utilized to attain a more
   accurate approximation to global n-point correlation functions for
   heterogeneous material systems with a hierarchy of length scales. (C)

Abstract = {{Bacterial spore interactions with planar surfaces in aquatic
   environments, including adhesive forces and force-distance profiles, are
   influenced by the geometry and physicochemical properties of the system.
   The characteristics of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are
   determined using electron microscopy and electrokinetic measurements.
   The average size of the spores is 1.57 mu m long and 0.86 mu m wide, and
   the zeta potential values are negative for the solutions used in this
   work. The zeta potentials of the spores and mica surfaces used in the
   experiments are measured as a function of pH and ionic strength. The
   Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO) theory is employed to
   predict the interaction force between the spores and planar surfaces as
   a function of the separation distance, and a force balance is used to
   explain the adhesive force. Theoretical estimations are compared to
   experimental measurements obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   The DLVO-based calculations are consistent with AFM force measurements,
   while the calculated adhesive force shows some deviations from the
   measurements. The deviations can be minimized by considering the
   roughness of the Bt spore and substrate surfaces. Results are important
   in the understanding of spore interactions with environmental surfaces
   in aquatic systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{341-354}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Aromatic compounds, such as benzene and its derivatives, porphyrins,
   fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, have numerous applications
   in biomedicine, materials science, energy science, and environmental
   science. Metalla-aromatics are analogues of conventional organic
   aromatic molecules in which one of the (hydro)carbon segments is
   formally replaced by an isolobal transition-metal fragment. Researchers
   have studied these transition-metal-containing aromatic molecules for
   the past three decades, particularly the synthesis and reactivity of
   metallabenzenes. Another focus has been the preparation and
   characterization of other metalla-aromatics such as metallafurans,
   metallapyridines, metallabenzynes, and more. Despite significant
   advances, remaining challenges in this field include the limited number
   of convenient and versatile synthetic methods to construct stable and
   fully characterized metalla-aromatics, and the relative shortage of new
   topologies.
   To address these challenges, we have developed new methods for preparing
   metalla-aromatics, especially those possessing new topologies. Our
   synthetic efforts have led to a large family of dosely related
   metalla-aromatics known as aromatic osmacycles. This Account summarizes
   the synthesis and reactivity of these compounds, with a focus on
   features that are different from those of compounds developed by other
   groups. These osmacycles can be synthesized from simple precursors under
   mild conditions. Using these efficient methods, we have synthesized
   aromatic osmacycles such as osmabenzene, osmabenzyne, isoosmabenzene,
   osmafuran, and osmanaphthalene. Furthermore, these methods have also
   created a series of new topologies, such as osmabenzothiazole and
   osmapyridyne. Our studies of the reactivity of these osma-aromatics
   revealed unprecedented reaction patterns, and we demonstrated the
   interconversion of several osmacycles.
   Like other metalla-aromatics, osma-aromatics have spectroscopic features
   of aromaticity, such as ring planarity and the characteristic bond
   lengths between a single and double bond, but the osma-aromatics we have
   prepared also exhibit good stability towards air, water, and heat.
   Indeed, some seemingly unstable species proved stable, and their
   stability made it possible to study their optical, electrochemical, and
   magnetic properties. The stability of these compouds results from their
   aromaticity and the phosphonium substituents on the aromatic plane: most
   of our osma-aromatics carry at least one phosphonium group. The
   phosphonium group offers stability via both electronic and steric
   mechanisms. The phosphonium acts as an electron reservoir, allowing the
   circulation of electron pairs along metallacycles and lowering the
   electron density of the aromatic rings. Meanwhile, the bulky phosphonium
   groups surrounding the aromatic metallacycle prevent most reactions that
   could decompose the skeleton.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of NOx on the volatility of the secondary organic aerosol
   (SOA) formed from isoprene photooxidation are investigated in
   environmental chamber experiments. Two types of experiments are
   performed. In HO2-dominant experiments, organic peroxy radicals (RO2)
   primarily react with HO2. In mixed experiments, RO2 reacts through
   multiple pathways, including with NO, NO2, and HO2. The volatility and
   oxidation state of isoprene SOA are sensitive to and exhibit a nonlinear
   dependence on NOx levels. Depending on the NOx levels, the SOA formed in
   mixed experiments can be of similar or lower volatility compared to that
   formed in HO2-dominant experiments. The dependence of SOA yield,
   volatility, and oxidation state on the NOx level likely arises from
   gas-phase RO2 chemistry and succeeding particle-phase oligomerization
   reactions. The NOx level also plays a strong role in SOA aging. While
   the volatility of SOA in mixed experiments does not change substantially
   over time, SOA becomes less volatile and more oxidized as oxidation
   progresses in HO2-dominant experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop visible-to-ultraviolet C
   (UVC) upconversion ceramic materials, which inactivate surface-borne
   microbes through frequency amplification of ambient visible light.
   Ceramics were formed by high-temperature sintering of compacted yttrium
   silicate powders doped with Pr3+ and Li+ In comparison to previously
   reported upconversion surface coatings, the ceramics were significantly
   more durable and had greater upconversion efficiency under both laser
   and low-power visible light excitation. The antimicrobial activity of
   the surfaces under diffuse fluorescent light was assessed by measuring
   the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores, the rate of which was
   nearly 4 times higher for ceramic materials compared to the previously
   reported films. Enhanced UVC emissions were attributed to increased
   material thickness as well as increased crystallite size in the
   ceramics. These results represent significant advancement of
   upconversion surfaces for sustainable, light-activated disinfection
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we adopted three different commercial activated carbon
   samples (ACs) having different particle size, specific surface area and
   pore size to make sulfur carbon (S-AC) nanocomposites for rechargeable
   lithium sulfur batteries. The effect of the physical parameters of ACs
   and the combined effect of electrolyte molarity were investigated. The
   performance of the cells at two different temperatures of 25 and 70
   degrees C were compared. For room temperature operation of the cells,
   the capacities of S infiltrated into microporous AC having smaller pore
   size and stronger interactions with sulfur and sulfides were lower than
   those of the S infiltrated into micro- and mesoporous ACs containing
   larger pores. In contrast, the microporous AC demonstrated higher
   capacity at the elevated temperature due to the improved ion transport
   rate. The effect of electrolyte molarity on the performance of Li/S
   cells was found to depend on the AC pore size and particle size
   distributions. Increasing electrolyte molarity from 1 to 3 M
   demonstrated improved cell performance and reduced polysulfide
   dissolution in all the studied S-AC samples. However, further increasing
   electrolyte salt concentration resulted in a high polarization and
   reduced cell performance in S-ACs having large particle size or smaller
   pores. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{While carbon fiber paper (CFP) has been widely used in batteries, fuel
   cells, and supercapacitors, its effect on device performance can be
   rather complicated. In this study, we examined the effect of CFP from
   different batches on the performance of a CFP-supported MnOx hybrid
   supercapacitor (CFP/MnOx). It is found that the contribution of the MnOx
   to the capacitance is dominating if the MnOx coating on CFP is dense and
   conformal, but becomes much less significant if the MnOx coating on CFP
   is porous or nonconformal. This is because annealing CFP/MnOx at 400
   degrees C in air is necessary to obtain proper MnOx phases for high
   capacitance; the annealing process may increase the specific surface
   area of CFP if it is not fully covered by MnOx. Also, the etching of
   carbon surface weakens the attachment of MnOx to CFP and worsens the
   electrical connection of MnOx to CFP, further reducing the contribution
   of MnOx to capacitance. Finally, much to our surprise, it is found that
   the properties of the CFP varied from batches to batches, which
   critically influence the MnOx coating morphology/density. These factors
   in turn greatly affect the contribution of each component to the
   capacitance of the CFP/MnOx hybrid supercapacitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Electrochemical capacitor electrodes were fabricated by depositing an
   ultra-thin layer of vanadium oxide on a high conducting, large specific
   surface area (SSA) materials (substrates) using a supercritical fluid
   adsorption-calcination method. The high SSA materials included binder
   free single walled carbon-nanotube-activated carbon (SWCNT-AC)
   composites and the traditional electrode of activated carbon carbon
   black-polymer binder (AC-CB-binder). The uptake of the organometallic
   precursor for the oxide (vanadium (III) acetylacetonate) on the
   substrates were investigated and related to their SSA. Precursor uptakes
   up to 54.7 wt\% of the initial carbon substrate was achieved.
   Calcination conditions for converting the precursor to oxide and
   electrochemical properties of the electrodes were thoroughly
   investigated. The V2O5, which showed extremely high specific
   pseudo-capacitance (>1000 F g(-1) at 100 mV s(-1)), greatly enhanced the
   overall electrode performances. Conversely, the V2O5 pseudo-capacitance
   was better utilized in the SWCNT-AC substrate, particularly at high
   working speeds, because of the significantly higher electrical
   conductivity. For example, the SWCNT-AC-V2O5 composite (weight ratio
   40:60) had its volumetric capacitance doubled, comparing to the similar
   to 50\% increase in the AC-CB binder sample at 100 mV s(-1). (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We propose a new origin of unintentional gallium (Ga) incorporation
   during the epitaxial growth of AMIN layers. We observed substantial
   amount of Ga in AlInN layers on GaN-free underlying layers and wafer
   carrier grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, even though the
   Ga precursor was not introduced during the growth. The Al(Ga)InN layers
   were characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction and Rutherford
   backscattering spectrometry. The mole fraction of Ga in the Al(Ga)InN
   layers showed strong dependence on conditions of the growth chamber,
   making it difficult to maintain controlled alloy compositions only by
   growth process parameters. Also, Ga incorporation was not observed under
   the same growth parameters and conditions, when the indium (In)
   precursor was absent. The formation of In-Ga eutectic system between
   metallic Ga from the deposition on the chamber surrounding surfaces and
   adsorbed In is suggested as a possible pathway for the Ga incorporation.
   Finally, we performed an intentional chamber coating process prior to
   growth of AlInN to achieve repeatable Al(Ga)InN growth with stable alloy
   compositions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{We systematically study the origins and mechanisms for unintentional
   incorporation of gallium (Ga) during epitaxial growth of ternary InAlN
   thin-film layers. The origins of auto-incorporation of Ga have been
   investigated by using different underlying layers, regrown layers, and
   growth chamber conditions. It is shown that Ga-containing deposition on
   a wafer susceptor/carrier and on surrounding surfaces of uncooled parts
   in a growth chamber can be responsible for Ga in the InAl(Ga)N layers,
   while a GaN underlying layer below an InAl(Ga)N layer does not
   contribute to the auto incorporation of Ga in the InAl (Ga)N layers.
   Especially, the Ga-containing deposition on the surfaces inside the
   chamber is believed to be the dominant source of auto incorporated Ga,
   possibly due to the high vapor pressure of a liquid phase as a result of
   eutectic system formation between indium (In) and Ga. The pressure of
   liquid phase Ga, p(Ga)=similar to 3.67 x 10(-4) Torr, can be significant
   as compared to precursor partial pressures with P-TMAI=3.7 x 10(-4) Toff
   and p(TMIn)=24 x 10(-5) Torr. In addition, magnesium (Mg) or magnesium
   precursor (Cp2Mg) in the growth chamber is shown to promote the auto
   incorporation of Ga in the InAl(Ga)N layers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Dispersions containing 1 mg/mL of several carbon nanomaterials were used
   to deposit films containing 1 to 20 layers. The electrical properties of
   the composite films were characterized via impedance spectroscopy along
   two directions: in-plane on the film topmost surface and also through
   the thickness. It was found that carbon black nanoparticles never
   achieved full in-plane interconnection while the multiwalled carbon
   nanotube (MWNT) and single-walled carbon nanotube were already
   percolated at one layer. Graphite flakes showed a complete percolation
   curve that allowed its resistance to change by 6-7 orders of magnitude.
   The differences in the microstructure, electrical response, and thermal
   decomposition behavior of these carbon nanomaterial-paper substrate
   films were explained by detailed equivalent circuit analysis of the
   impedance spectra. Interpretation was supplemented by scanning electron
   microscopy images and thermal analysis via Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry/Thermogravimetric Analysis (DSC/TGA). Thru-plane electrical
   properties were for the most part similar, although only films with
   short MWNT showed a clearly infiltrated network structure.}},

Abstract = {{Mass-transfer limitations are examined for a conceptual
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell ``Z-scheme{''} reactor, the Dual Bed
   Colloidal Suspension Reactor (DBCSR). Modeling of the DBCSR shows
   mass-transfer limitations along the width of the reactor prevent full
   use of the channel photocatalysts. To overcome this challenge, recycling
   of product gas to sparge the electrolyte solution is proposed as a
   method to enhance mass transfer. Dimensionless mass-transfer
   correlations, based on experimental data obtained using two fabricated
   diffusion cells, are proposed to describe the mass-transfer rate.
   Additionally, the results suggest that reactor size influences solution
   convection patterns. An energy analysis is presented that shows that gas
   sparging is a low energy-consumption option to mitigate mass-transfer
   limitations. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The practical construction of scalable quantum-computer hardware capable
   of executing nontrivial quantum algorithms will require the
   juxtaposition of different types of quantum systems. We analyze a
   modular ion trap quantum-computer architecture with a hierarchy of
   interactions that can scale to very large numbers of qubits. Local
   entangling quantum gates between qubit memories within a single register
   are accomplished using natural interactions between the qubits, and
   entanglement between separate registers is completed via a probabilistic
   photonic interface between qubits in different registers, even over
   large distances. We show that this architecture can be made fault
   tolerant, and demonstrate its viability for fault-tolerant execution of
   modest size quantum circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The use of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as sensors in
   aqueous media has gained increased attention for environmental
   monitoring and medical diagnostics. However, stable operation of OFETs
   in aqueous media is particularly challenging because of electrolytic
   hydrolysis of water, high ionic conduction through the analyte, and
   irreversible damage of organic semiconductors when exposed to water. To
   date, OFET sensors have shown the capability of label-free sensing of
   various chemical/biological species, but they could only be used once
   because their operational stability and lifetime while operating in
   aqueous environments has been poor, and their response times typically
   slow. Here, we report on OFETs with unprecedented water stability. These
   OFETs are suitable for the implementation of reusable
   chemical/biological sensors because they primarily respond to charged
   species diluted in an aqueous media by rapidly shifting their threshold
   voltage. These OFET sensors present stable current baselines and
   saturated signals which are ideal for detection of low concentration of
   small or large molecules that alter the pH of an aqueous environment.
   The overall response of these OFET sensors paves the way for the
   development of continuous chemical/biological nondestructive sensor
   applications in aqueous media.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the generation of systemically releasable anti-cancer
   drugs from multilayer nanofilms. Nanofilms designed to drug release
   profiles in programmable fashion are promising new and alternative way
   for drug delivery. For the nanofilm structure, we synthesized various
   unique 3-dimensional anti cancer drug incorporated DNA origami
   structures (hairpin, Y, and X shaped) and assembled with peptide via
   layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition method. The key to the successful
   application of these nanofilms requires a novel approach of the
   influence of DNA architecture for the drug release from functional
   nano-sized surface. Herein, we have taken first steps in building and
   controlling the drug incorporated DNA origami based multilayered
   nanostructure. Our finding highlights the novel and unique drug release
   character of LbL systems in serum condition taken full advantages of DNA
   origami structure. This multilayer thin film dramatically affects not

   decreases by similar to 30K between 52 and 414MPa. Above this phase

Abstract = {{When implemented on the nanoscale, material flows driven by gradients in
   temperature, sometimes known as thermocapillary flows, can be exploited
   for various purposes, including nanopatterning, device fabrication, and
   purification of arrays of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).
   Systematic experimental and theoretical studies on thermocapillary flow
   in thin polymer films driven by heating in individual metallic SWNT over
   a range of conditions and molecular weights reveal the underlying
   physics of this process. The findings suggest that the zero-shear
   viscosity is a critical parameter that dominates the dependence on
   substrate temperature and heating power. The experimentally validated
   analytical models in this study allow assessment of sensitivity to other
   parameters, such as the temperature coefficient of surface tension, the
   thermal interface conductance, and the characteristic length scale of
   the heated zone. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the research is to obtain a more complete understanding
   of how aging affects the viscoelastic properties of polymer solutions to
   be used as starting materials for gel spinning of polymer fibers.
   Specifically, poly(acrylonitrile-co-methacrylic acid) solutions were
   prepared and characterized using rheological measurements and nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results indicate that elastic
   character increased with increasing polymer concentration and that
   gelation of these solutions continued up to aging times of several
   weeks. Additionally, comparing the results from the two characterization
   methods show that while gelation continues to occur, the viscoelastic
   properties decrease after a critical time point suggesting that a
   chemical change occurs in the solutions at long times. However, these
   changes impact the solution dynamics minimally as the effective network
   properties were similar at the aging times studied here, but
   considerations for long-term storage of polymer solutions for gel
   spinning are warranted. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Abstract = {{Construction of self-illuminating semiconducting nanocrystals, also
   called quantum dots (QDs), has attracted much attention recently due to
   their potential as highly sensitive optical probes for biological
   imaging applications. Here we prepared a self-illuminating QD system by
   doping positron-emitting radionuclide Cu-64 into CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs
   via a cation-exchange reaction. The Cu-64-doped CdSe/ZnS QDs exhibit
   efficient Cerenkov resonance energy transfer (CRET). The signal of Cu-64
   can accurately reflect the biodistribution of the QDs during circulation
   with no dissociation of Cu-64 from the nanoparticles. We also explored
   this system for in vivo tumor imaging. This nanoprobe showed high
   tumor-targeting ability in a U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model (12.796
   ID/g at 17 h time point) and feasibility for in vivo luminescence
   imaging of tumor in the absence of excitation light. The availability of
   these self-illuminating integrated QDs provides an accurate and
   convenient tool for in vivo tumor imaging and detection.}},

Title = {{Bioaugmentation with Distinct Dehalobacter Strains Achieves Chloroform
   Detoxification in Microcosms}},

Pages = {{1851-1858}},

Abstract = {{Chloroform (CF) is a widespread groundwater contaminant not susceptible
   to aerobic degradation. Under anoxic conditions, CF can undergo abiotic
   and cometabolic transformation but detoxification is generally not
   achieved. The recent discovery of distinct Dehalobacter strains that
   respire CF to dichloromethane (DCM) and ferment DCM to nonchlorinated
   products promises that bioremediation of CF plumes is feasible. To track
   both strains, 16S rRNA gene-based qPCR assays specific for either
   Dehalobacter strain were designed and validated. A laboratory
   treatability study explored the value of bioaugmentation and
   biostimulation to achieve CF detoxification using anoxic microcosms
   established with aquifer material from a CF-contaminated site.
   Microcosms that received 6\% (v/v) of the CF-to-DCM-dechlorinating
   culture Dhb-CF to achieve an initial Dehalobacter cell titer of 1.6 +/-
   0.9 x 10(4) mL(-1) dechlorinated CF to stoichiometric amounts of DCM.
   Subsequent augmentation with 3\% (v/v) of the DCM-degrading consortium
   RM to an initial Dehalobacter cell abundance of 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(2)
   mL(-1) achieved complete DCM degradation in microcosms amended with 10
   mM bicarbonate. Growth of the CF-respiring and the DCM-degrading
   Dehalobacter populations and detoxification were also observed in
   microcosms that received both inocula simultaneously. These findings
   suggest that anaerobic bioremediation (e.g., bioaugmentation) is a
   possible remedy at CF- and DCM-contaminated sites without CT, which
   strongly inhibited CF organohalide respiration and DCM organohalide
   fermentation.}},

   It is demonstrated that it is possible to correlate the thermal
   conductivity of monovalent and multivalent molten salts within
   experimental error using this approach. Furthermore, in salts with a
   common anion, the single adjustable parameter in the model exhibits
   regular behavior with the molecular weight of the salt. It is also shown
   that the thermal conductivity of several molten-salt mixtures can be

Abstract = {{Biodynamic feedthrough can occur in many types of human-controlled
   machines where the operator is also a passenger. The motion of the
   controlled machine excites motion of the human operator's body, causing
   motion of the operator's hand, creating undesirable input. Backhoes are
   one example of a machine that is susceptible to significant performance
   degradation from biodynamic feedthrough. This study investigates and
   models the system dynamics, including the human operator and biodynamic
   feedthrough, develops two methods of compensation for biodynamic
   feedthrough based on those models, compares them with similar
   controllers without vibration compensation, and experimentally validates
   the performance of the biodynamic feedthrough compensation. The
   performance results, as well as operator survey results, show that the
   operators perform better and prefer the vibration-compensating
   controllers over their non-vibration-compensating counterparts.}},

Title = {{Supervised embedding of textual predictors with applications in clinical
   diagnostics for pediatric cardiology}},

Abstract = {{Objective Electronic health records possess critical predictive
   information for machine-learning-based diagnostic aids. However, many
   traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate
   textual data into the prediction process because of its high
   dimensionality. In this paper, we present a supervised method using
   Laplacian Eigenmaps to enable existing machine learning methods to
   estimate both low-dimensional representations of textual data and
   accurate predictors based on these low-dimensional representations at
   the same time.
   Materials and methods We present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method
   to enhance predictive models by embedding textual predictors into a
   low-dimensional latent space, which preserves the local similarities
   among textual data in high-dimensional space. The proposed
   implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient descent.
   For the evaluation, we applied our method to over 2000 patient records
   from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if
   patients were diagnosed with cardiac disease. In our experiments, we
   consider relatively short textual descriptions because of data
   availability. We compared our method with latent semantic indexing,
   latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant analysis. The
   results were assessed using four metrics: the area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient
   (MCC), specificity, and sensitivity.
   Results and discussion The results indicate that supervised Laplacian
   Eigenmaps was the highest performing method in our study, achieving
   0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC, respectively. Supervised Laplacian
   Eigenmaps showed an increase of 8.16\% in AUC and 20.6\% in MCC over the
   baseline that excluded textual data and a 2.69\% and 5.35\% increase in
   AUC and MCC, respectively, over unsupervised Laplacian Eigenmaps.
   Conclusions As a solution, we present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap
   method to embed textual predictors into a low-dimensional Euclidean
   space. This method allows many existing machine learning predictors to
   effectively and efficiently capture the potential of textual predictors,
   especially those based on short texts.}},

Abstract = {{The skeleton is a preferred homing site for breast cancer metastasis. To
   date, treatment options for patients with bone metastases are mostly
   palliative and the disease is still incurable. Indeed, key mechanisms
   involved in breast cancer osteotropism are still only partially
   understood due to the lack of suitable animal models to mimic metastasis
   of human tumor cells to a human bone microenvironment. In the presented
   study, we investigate the use of a human tissue-engineered bone
   construct to develop a humanized xenograft model of breast
   cancer-induced bone metastasis in a murine host. Primary human
   osteoblastic cell-seeded melt electrospun scaffolds in combination with
   recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 were implanted
   subcutaneously in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
   mice. The tissue-engineered constructs led to the formation of a
   morphologically intact `organ' bone incorporating a high amount of
   mineralized tissue, live osteocytes and bone marrow spaces. The newly
   formed bone was largely humanized, as indicated by the incorporation of
   human bone cells and human-derived matrix proteins. After intracardiac
   injection, the dissemination of luciferase-expressing human breast
   cancer cell lines to the humanized bone ossicles was detected by
   bioluminescent imaging. Histological analysis revealed the presence of
   metastases with clear osteolysis in the newly formed bone. Thus, human
   tissue-engineered bone constructs can be applied efficiently as a target
   tissue for human breast cancer cells injected into the blood circulation
   and replicate the osteolytic phenotype associated with breast
   cancer-induced bone lesions. In conclusion, we have developed an
   appropriate model for investigation of species-specific mechanisms of
   human breast cancer-related bone metastasis in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The integrated nanogenerator (NG) based on vertical nanowire (NW) arrays

   generated, capacitance, induced mechanical energy, output electrical
   energy, and efficiency. This evaluation is essential to correctly
   understand NG operation. Three main issues are highlighted. The
   mechanical and electrical structures of the NG as an integrated system
   are optimized, and strategies for concentrating the mechanical strain
   field in the NWs and increasing the force sensitivity are developed. In
   addition, the influence of NWs length and diameter on NG performances is
   investigated. The optimization results in a piezoelectric nano composite

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) cells rely on periodic refresh
   operations to maintain data integrity. As the capacity of DRAM memories
   has increased, so has the amount of time consumed in doing refresh.
   Refresh operations contend with read operations, which increases read
   latency and reduces system performance. We show that eliminating latency
   penalty due to refresh can improve average performance by 7.2\%.
   However, simply doing intelligent scheduling of refresh operations is
   ineffective at obtaining significant performance improvement.
   This article provides an alternative and scalable option to reduce the
   latency penalty due to refresh. It exploits the property that each
   refresh operation in a typical DRAM device internally refreshes multiple
   DRAM rows in JEDEC-based distributed refresh mode. Therefore, a refresh
   operation has well-defined points at which it can potentially be Paused
   to service a pending read request. Leveraging this property, we propose
   Refresh Pausing, a solution that is highly effective at alleviating the
   contention from refresh operations. It provides an average performance
   improvement of 5.1\% for 8Gb devices and becomes even more effective for
   future high-density technologies. We also show that Refresh Pausing
   significantly outperforms the recently proposed Elastic Refresh scheme.}},

Title = {{Variance Estimation and Sequential Stopping in Steady-State Simulations
   Using Linear Regression}},

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We propose a method for estimating the variance parameter of a discrete,
   stationary stochastic process that involves combining variance
   estimators at different run lengths using linear regression. We show
   that the estimator thus obtained is first-order unbiased and consistent
   under two distinct asymptotic regimes. In the first regime, the number
   of constituent estimators used in the regression is fixed and the
   numbers of observations corresponding to the component estimators grow
   in a proportional manner. In the second regime, the number of
   constituent estimators grows while the numbers of observations
   corresponding to each estimator remain fixed. We also show that for
   m-dependent stochastic processes, one can use regression to obtain
   asymptotically normally distributed variance estimators in the second
   regime. Analytical and numerical examples indicate that the new
   regression-based estimators give good mean-squared-error performance in
   steady-state simulations.
   The regression methodology presented in this article can also be applied
   to estimate the bias of variance estimators. As an example application,
   we present a new sequential-stopping rule that uses the estimate for
   bias to determine appropriate run lengths. Monte Carlo experiments
   indicate that this `' bias-controlling `' sequential-stopping method has
   the potential to work well in practice.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of CO2 adsorption dynamics of polymer/silica supported
   poly(ethylenimine) hollow fiber sorbents in rapid temperature swing
   adsorption}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Rapid temperature swing adsorption (RTSA) using polymer/silica supported
   amine hollow fiber sorbents is a new post combustion CO2 capture
   methodology that facilitates CO2 adsorption under nearly isothermal
   conditions with improved energy efficiency via heat integration. In this
   work, the dynamic CO2 adsorption characteristics of polymer/silica
   supported poly(ethylenimine) hollow fiber sorbents (CA-S-PEI-PI) are
   evaluated in a bench scale RTSA system. Non-isothermal fibers have
   breakthrough and pseudo-equilibrium CO2 capacities of 0.67 mmol/g and
   1.03 mmol/g at 35 degrees C, respectively, under humid simulated flue
   gas conditions (100\% R.H.). Prolonged exposure of the fiber sorbents to
   water vapor enabled the breakthrough and pseudo-equilibrium CO2
   capacities to increase by 60\% and 43\%, respectively. Upon the removal
   of the heat of adsorption by flowing cooling water in the bores of the
   fiber sorbents, there is a substantial increase in the CO2 breakthrough
   capacity, reaching 1.16 mmol/g using simulated humid flue gases. The
   breakthrough capacity is found to increase 5\% upon increasing the
   adsorption temperature from 35 degrees C to at 45 degrees C, suggesting
   improved mass transfer in the fiber sorbent at the higher temperature.
   The CO2 adsorption and desorption rates are shown to be very rapid, with
   CO2 breakthrough occurring in less than 72 s and the majority of the
   adsorbed CO2 desorbing in 5 min. Extensive cycling studies demonstrate
   that the CA-S-PEI-PI sorbents have good dynamic swing capacities,
   stabilizing over 60 cycles. A newly developed rechargeable post-spinning
   amine infusion technique provides the feasibility of recovering the CO2
   adsorption performance of deactivated CA-S-PEI-PI fiber modules, by
   allowing for straightforward re-infusion of PEI into the deactivated
   sorbents. Amine-incorporated hollow fiber sorbents have good potential
   for practical use as scalable, adsorbing heat-exchangers. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In distributed microphone arrays (DMAs) the source location information
   can be defined at the intra and inter-node levels. Indeed, while the
   first type of information results from the diversity of acoustic
   channels recorded by microphones embedded in the same node, the second
   is attributed to the differences between the acoustic channels observed
   by spatially distributed nodes. Both cues are very useful in DMA
   processing, and the aim of this paper is to utilize both of them to
   cluster and separate multiple competing speech signals. To capture the
   intra-node information, we employ the normalized recording vector, while
   at the inter-node level, we consider different features including the
   energy level differences with and without the phase differences between
   nodes. We model the intra-node information using the Watson mixture
   model (WMM), and propose using the Gamma mixture model (GaMM), Dirichlet
   mixture model (DMM), and WMM to model different inter-node location
   features. Furthermore, we propose several integrations of the intra-node
   and inter-node feature contributions to cluster speech recordings using
   the expectation maximization algorithm. Finally, simulation results are
   provided to demonstrate the performance of all ensuing methods.}},

Title = {{A MAP-based Online Estimation Approach to Ensemble Speaker and Speaking
   Environment Modeling}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{An ensemble speaker and speaking environment modeling (ESSEM) approach
   was recently developed. This ESSEM process consists of offline and
   online phases. The offline phase establishes an environment structure
   using speech data collected under a wide range of acoustic conditions,
   whereas the online phase estimates a set of acoustic models that matches
   the testing environment based on the established environment structure.
   Since the estimated acoustic models accurately characterize particular
   testing conditions, ESSEM can improve the speech recognition performance
   under adverse conditions. In this work, we propose two maximum a
   posteriori (MAP) based algorithms to improve the online estimation part
   of the original ESSEM framework. We first develop MAP-based environment
   structure adaptation to refine the original environment structure. Next,
   we propose to utilize the MAP criterion to estimate the mapping function
   of ESSEM and enhance the environment modeling capability. For the MAP
   estimation, three types of priors are derived; they are the clustered
   prior (CP), the sequential prior (SP), and the hierarchical prior (HP)
   densities. Since each prior density is able to characterize specific
   acoustic knowledge, we further derive a combination mechanism to
   integrate the three priors. Based on the experimental results on the
   Aurora-2 task, we verify that using the MAP-based online mapping
   function estimation can enable ESSEM to achieve better performance than
   using the maximum- likelihood (ML) based counterpart. Moreover, by using
   an integration of the online environment structuring adaptation and
   mapping function estimation, the proposed MAP-based ESSEM framework is
   found to provide the best performance. Compared with our baseline
   results, MAP-based ESSEM achieves an average word error rate reduction
   of 15.53\% (5.41 to 4.57\%) under 50 testing conditions at a
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 to 20 dB over the three standardized
   testing sets.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental abnormalities of optic nerve are the leading cause of
   child blindness. The goal of this study was to use diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) to characterize the optic nerve development of non-human
   primates during the normal maturation from birth to adulthood. Forty
   healthy rhesus monkeys aged from 2 weeks to 6 years old were scanned
   with a clinical 3T scanner. It was demonstrated that the DTI parameters
   followed an exponential pattern during optic nerve maturation. The time
   constants of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial
   diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)) and radial diffusivity
   (lambda(perpendicular to)) were 16, 14, 18 and 15 months in rhesus
   monkeys, respectively. Significant decrease in RD was observed firstly
   at 12 months after birth (p < 0.05). No significant differences were
   observed between the left and right optic nerves in any age group. The
   in vivo imaging results reveal the normal evolution patterns of DTI
   parameters during optic nerve maturation in primates. The data might be
   used as a reference in the examination of optic nerve developmental
   abnormalities or injury in children or preclinical studies. (c) 2013

Title = {{Full-Lane Coverage Micromilling Pavement-Surface Quality Control Using
   Emerging 3D Line Laser Imaging Technology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Facing pavement preservation challenges as a result of funding
   shortages, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) has developed
   an innovative micromilling resurfacing method to cost-effectively
   preserve its pavements. The cost saving is significant: approximately
   \$60,000 per lane mile. To ensure that a smooth micromilled surface
   texture provides a good bond and water runoff capability, which is the
   key in this new method, a new, stringent ridge-to-valley-depth (RVD)
   specification has been established for quantitatively evaluating
   micromilled surface quality. This paper explores the possibility of
   using emerging three-dimensional (3D) line laser imaging technology to
   develop a full-lane quality control method that can measure RVD, provide
   quality control covering a full lane, and identify problem areas. A lab
   test was first conducted to critically assess the accuracy of the
   proposed method by using an artifact: a wood panel with V-shaped grooves
   of a known depth to simulate the ridges and valleys on a micromilled
   surface. Results show that the proposed method is very promising and can
   measure RVD with an error of less than 0.4mm (0.016in.). A field test
   was conducted by using Georgia Tech's sensing vehicle to collect 3D
   range data at two 0.8-km (0.5-mi) segments on a micromilling resurfacing
   project on I-95. Results show that the RVDs in the transverse direction
   can effectively and quantitatively differentiate between smooth (mean
   RVD=2.9mm; 0.114in.) and rough (mean RVD=4.8mm; 0.189in.) micromilled
   surface textures. A case study shows that other problem areas on the
   micromilled surface, such as underlying cracks and isolated rough spots
   that will lead to premature failure, can also be identified by using the
   proposed method, so proper pretreatment methods (e.g.,deep patches or
   crack sealing) can be effectively applied before resurfacing to ensure
   the longevity of the pavement. At the end of the paper, conclusions are
   made and recommendations are discussed for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Internal functionalization of single-walled nanotubes is an attractive,
   yet difficult challenge in nanotube materials chemistry. Here we report
   single-walled metal oxide nanotubes with covalently bonded primary amine
   moieties on their inner wall, synthesized through a one-step approach.
   Conclusive molecular-level structural information on the
   amine-functionalized nanotubes is obtained through multiple solid-state
   techniques. The amine-functionalized nanotubes maintain a high carbon
   dioxide adsorption capacity while significantly suppressing the
   adsorption of methane and nitrogen, thereby leading to a large
   enhancement in adsorption selectivity over unfunctionalized nanotubes
   (up to four-fold for carbon dioxide/methane and ten-fold for carbon
   dioxide/nitrogen). The successful synthesis of single-walled nanotubes
   with functional, covalently-bound organic moieties may open up
   possibilities for new nanotube-based applications that are currently
   inaccessible to carbon nanotubes and other related materials.}},

Abstract = {{The current polymer-exchange membrane fuel cell technology cannot
   directly use biomass as fuel. Here we present a solar-induced hybrid

   solar-induced hybrid fuel cell combines some features of solar cells,
   fuel cells and redox flow batteries. The power density of the
   solar-induced hybrid fuel cell powered by cellulose reaches
   0.72mWcm(-2), which is almost 100 times higher than cellulose-based
   microbial fuel cells and is close to that of the best microbial fuel
   cells reported in literature. Unlike most cell technologies that are
   sensitive to impurities, the cell reported in this study is inert to
   most organic and inorganic contaminants present in the fuels.}},

Title = {{The Spirodela polyrhiza genome reveals insights into its neotenous

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The subfamily of the Lemnoideae belongs to a different order than other
   monocotyledonous species that have been sequenced and comprises aquatic
   plants that grow rapidly on the water surface. Here we select Spirodela
   polyrhiza for whole-genome sequencing. We show that Spirodela has a
   genome with no signs of recent retrotranspositions but signatures of two
   ancient whole-genome duplications, possibly 95 million years ago (mya),
   older than those in Arabidopsis and rice. Its genome has only 19,623
   predicted protein-coding genes, which is 28\% less than the
   dicotyledonous Arabidopsis thaliana and 50\% less than monocotyledonous
   rice. We propose that at least in part, the neotenous reduction of these
   aquatic plants is based on readjusted copy numbers of promoters and
   repressors of the juvenile-to-adult transition. The Spirodela genome,
   along with its unique biology and physiology, will stimulate new
   insights into environmental adaptation, ecology, evolution and plant
   development, and will be instrumental for future bioenergy applications.}},

Abstract = {{The posterior eye is a complex biomechanical structure. Delicate neural
   and vascular tissues of the retina, choroid, and optic nerve head that
   are critical for visual function are subjected to mechanical loading
   from intraocular pressure, intraocular and extraorbital muscles, and
   external forces on the eye. The surrounding sclera serves to counteract
   excessive deformation from these forces and thus to create a stable
   biomechanical environment for the ocular tissues. Additionally, the eye
   is a dynamic structure with connective tissue remodeling occurring as a
   result of aging and pathologies such as glaucoma and myopia. The
   material properties of these tissues and the distribution of stresses
   and strains in the posterior eye is an area of active research, relying
   on a combination of computational modeling, imaging, and biomechanical
   measurement approaches. Investigators are recognizing the increasing
   importance of the role of the collagen microstructure in these material
   properties and are undertaking microstructural measurements to drive
   microstructurally-informed models of ocular biomechanics. Here, we
   review notable findings and the consensus understanding on the
   biomechanics and microstructure of the posterior eye. Results from
   computational and numerical modeling studies and mechanical testing of
   ocular tissue are discussed. We conclude with some speculation as to
   future trends in this field.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels sprout from
   existing blood vessels, enabling new vascular elements to be added to an
   existing vasculature. This review discusses our investigations into the
   role of cell-matrix mechanics in the mechanical regulation of
   angiogenesis. The experimental aspects of the research are based on in
   vitro experiments using an organ culture model of sprouting angiogenesis
   with the goal of developing new treatments and techniques to either
   promote or inhibit angiogenic outgrowth, depending on the application.
   Computational simulations were performed to simulate angiogenic growth
   coupled to matrix deformation, and live two-photon microscopy was used
   to obtain insight into the dynamic mechanical interaction between
   angiogenic neovessels and the extracellular matrix. In these studies, we
   characterized how angiogenic neovessels remodel the extracellular matrix
   (ECM) and how properties of the matrix such as density and boundary
   conditions influence vascular growth and alignment. Angiogenic
   neovessels extensively deform and remodel the matrix through a
   combination of applied traction, proteolytic activity, and generation of
   new cell-matrix adhesions. The angiogenic phenotype within endothelial
   cells is promoted by ECM deformation and remodeling. Sensitivity
   analysis using our finite element model of angiogenesis suggests that
   cell-generated traction during growth is the most important parameter
   controlling the deformation of the matrix and, therefore, angiogenic
   growth and remodeling. Live two-photon imaging has also revealed
   numerous neovessel behaviors during angiogenesis that are poorly
   understood such as episodic growth/regression, neovessel colocation, and
   anastomosis. Our research demonstrates that the topology of a resulting
   vascular network can be manipulated directly by modifying the mechanical
   interaction between angiogenic neovessels and the matrix.}},

Title = {{Scheduling directives: Accelerating shared-memory many-core processor

Abstract = {{We consider many-core processors with a task-graph oriented programming
   model, whereby scheduling constraints among tasks are decided offline,
   and are then enforced by the runtime system using dedicated hardware.
   Here, exposing and beneficially exploiting fine grain data and control
   parallelism is increasingly important. Therefore, high expressive power
   for stating such constraints/directives, along with the ability to
   implement, them in fast, simple hardware, is critical for success. In
   this paper, we focus on the relationship among different duplicable
   (multi-instance) tasks, which are used to express and exploit data
   parallelism. We extend the conventional Start-After-Complete
   (precedence) constraint to also be usable between replicas of different
   such tasks rather than only between entire tasks, thereby increasing the
   exposable parallelism. Additionally, we propose the parameterized
   Start-After-Start constraint, which can be used to control the degree of
   ``lockstep{''} among multiple such tasks, e.g., in order to improve
   cache performance when the tasks work on the same data. Also, we briefly
   describe several additional interesting directives. Finally, we show
   that the directives can be supported efficiently in hardware. Hypercore,
   a very efficient CREW PRAM-like shared-cache architecture, which is very
   challenging because it has extremely fast dispatching for basic
   constraints, is used in the discussion. However, the new directives have
   broader applicability. Having shown the possibility of simple
   implementation and indications of benefit, this motivates further
   exploration of these directives and their implementation in hardware, as
   well as their support by programming tools. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The fatigue properties of ultrathin protective coatings on silicon thin
   films were investigated. The cohesive and delamination fatigue
   properties of 22 nm-thick atomic-layered-deposited (ALD) titania were
   characterized and compared to that of 25 nm-thick alumina. Both coatings
   were deposited at 200 degrees C. The fatigue rates are comparable at 30
   degrees C, 50\% relative humidity (RH) while they are one order of
   magnitude larger for alumina compared to titania at 80 degrees C, 90\%
   RH. The improved fatigue performance is believed to be related to the
   improved stability of the ALD titania coating with water compared to ALD
   alumina, which may in part be related to the fact that ALD titania is
   crystalline, while ALD alumina is amorphous. Static fatigue crack
   nucleation and propagation was not observed. The underlying fatigue
   mechanism is different from previously documented mechanisms, such as
   stress corrosion cracking, and appears to result from the presence of
   compressive stresses and a rough coating-substrate interface.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress and reduced pH are involved in many inflammatory
   diseases. This study describes a nanoparticle-based system that is
   responsive to both oxidative stress and reduced pH in an inflammatory
   environment to effectively release its encapsulated curcumin, an
   immune-modulatory agent with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
   capabilities. Because of the presence of Forster resonance energy
   transfer between curcumin and the carrier, this system also allowed us
   to monitor the intracellular release behavior. The curcumin released
   upon triggering could efficiently reduce the excess oxidants produced by
   the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. The feasibility of
   using the curcumin-loaded nanoparticles for anti-inflammatory
   applications was further validated in a mouse model with ankle
   inflammation induced by LPS. The results of these studies demonstrate
   that the proposed nanoparticle system is promising for treating
   oxidative stress-related diseases.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun nanofibers with uniaxial alignment have recently gained its
   popularity as scaffolds for neural tissue engineering. Many studies have
   demonstrated that the nanofibers could guide the neurites to extend
   along the direction of alignment, resembling the native hierarchy of the
   nerve tissue. However, the contact cues provided by the nanofibers can
   be far more complicated than just guiding the neurites to extend along
   them. In the current study, we used dorsal root ganglia as a model
   system to systematically investigate the interactions between neurites
   and uniaxially aligned nanofibers. We demonstrated, for the first time,
   that the neurites could not only project along the nanofibers, but also
   be directed to grow along a direction perpendicular to the aligned
   nanofibers, depending on the following parameters: (i) the density of
   nanofibers, (ii) the protein deposited on the surfaces of the
   nanofibers, and (iii) surface properties of the substrate on which the
   nanofibers were supported. We also investigated the pharmacological
   effect of myosin II inhibition on the nanofiber-guided growth of
   neurites by adding blebbistatin to the culture medium. Our findings
   offer new insights into the design of nanofiber-based scaffolds for
   nerve injury repair and will provide new guidelines for the construction
   of well-defined neuronal network architecture (the so-called neural
   circuits).}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flowing water contains not only mechanical kinetic energy, but also the
   electrostatic energy owing to the triboelectric charges caused by its
   contact with surrounding media such as air. In this paper, a water wheel
   hybridized triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), composed of a water-TENG
   part and a disk-TENG part, has been developed for simultaneously
   harvesting the two types of energies from the tap water flowing from a
   household faucet. The wheel blades of the hybridized TENG are composed
   by superhydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin films with
   nanostructures, which are used as water-TENG to harvest the
   electrostatic energy from the flowing water. In addition, the flowing
   water impacted on the wheel blades also causes the rotation motion of
   disk-TENG and can be used to harvest the mechanical kinetic energy. The
   short-circuit current of the water-TENG and the disk-TENG at a flowing
   water rate of 54 mL/s can reach 12.9 and 3.8 mu A, respectively. The
   hybridized TENG is also demonstrated to harvest wind energy and acts as
   a self-powered sensor to detect the flowing water rate and wind speed.
   All these results show the potentials of the hybridized TENG for
   harvesting multiple types of energies from the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) with a total thickness of
   approximate to 16 m is fabricated as an active or self-powered sensor
   for monitoring local deformation on a human skin. The NG was based on an
   anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) as an insulating layer grown on a thin Al
   foil by anodization, on which a thin film made of aligned ZnO nanowire
   compacted arrays is grown by solution chemistry. The performance of the
   NG is characterized with the assistance of the finite element method
   (FEM) simulation. The extremely thin NG is attached on the surface of an
   eyelid, and its output voltage/current characterizes the motion of the
   eye ball underneath. Since there is no external power needed for the
   operation of the NG, this self-powered or active sensor can be effective
   in monitoring sleeping behavior, brain activities, and spirit status of
   a person as well as any biological associated skin deformation.}},

Abstract = {{L-Amino acid oxidases (LAAOs), which catalyze the stereospecific
   oxidative deamination of L-amino acids to alpha-keto acids and ammonia,
   are flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing homodimeric proteins. L-Amino
   acid oxidases are widely distributed in diverse organisms and have a
   range of properties. Because expressing LAAOs as recombinant proteins in
   heterologous hosts is difficult, their biotechnological applications
   have not been thoroughly advanced. LAAOs are thought to contribute to
   amino acid catabolism, enhance iron acquisition, display antimicrobial
   activity, and catalyze keto acid production, among other roles. Here, we
   review the types, properties, structures, biological functions,
   heterologous expression, and applications of LAAOs obtained from
   microbial sources. We expect this review to increase interest in LAAO
   studies.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Unsteady pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) measurements were acquired on an
   articulated model helicopter rotor of 0.26 m diameter in edgewise flow
   to simulate forward flight conditions. The rotor was operated at advance
   ratios (free stream velocity normalized by hover tip speed) of 0.15 and
   0.30 at a cycle-averaged tip chord Reynolds number of 1.1 x 10(5), with
   collective and longitudinal cyclic pitch inputs of 10 degrees and 2.5
   degrees, respectively. A single-shot data acquisition technique allowed
   a camera to record the paint luminescence after a single pulse of
   high-energy laser excitation, yielding sufficient signal-to-noise ratio
   to avoid image averaging. Platinum tetra(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin
   (PtTFPP) in a porous polymer/ceramic binder served as the PSP. To
   address errors caused by image blurring and temperature sensitivity, a
   previously reported motion deblurring algorithm was implemented and the
   temperature correction was made using temperature-sensitive paint
   measurements on a second rotor blade. Instantaneous, unsteady surface
   pressure maps at a rotation rate of 82 Hz captured different aerodynamic
   responses between the two sides of the rotor disk and were compared to
   the nominally steady hover case. Cycle-to-cycle variations in tip
   unsteadiness on the retreating blade were also observed, causing oblique
   pressure features which may be linked to three-dimensional stall.}},

Abstract = {{The velocity field over a moderately low aspect ratio retreating rotor
   blade is investigated using particle image velocimetry as the two-bladed
   teetering rotor with cyclic pitch operates in a low-speed wind tunnel.
   The phase-averaged velocity field shows that the stall vortex
   circulation is comparable to the section dynamic lift, confirming it as
   a dynamic stall vortex (DSV). Strong tip vortex effects suppress stall
   at outboard locations. The DSV on the rotating blade after liftoff is
   elongated and remains in close proximity to the blade surface in
   contrast to classical two-dimensional DSV on non-rotating blades. The
   phase-averaged DSV is roughly 40 \% weaker and spatially diffused than
   those observed in individual instantaneous velocity fields. Spanwise
   variations of the vortex are also discussed. Cycle-to-cycle variations
   of the instantaneous velocity fields suggest a radial-flow-induced
   stabilization in the strength, but not in the spatial location of the
   DSV.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Accurate mapping of spliced RNA-Seq reads to genomic DNA has been known
   as a challenging problem. Despite significant efforts invested in
   developing efficient algorithms, with the human genome as a primary
   focus, the best solution is still not known. A recently introduced tool,
   TrueSight, has demonstrated better performance compared with earlier
   developed algorithms such as TopHat and MapSplice. To improve detection
   of splice junctions, TrueSight uses information on statistical patterns
   of nucleotide ordering in intronic and exonic DNA. This line of research
   led to yet another new algorithm, UnSplicer, designed for eukaryotic
   species with compact genomes where functional alternative splicing is
   likely to be dominated by splicing noise. Genome-specific parameters of
   the new algorithm are generated by GeneMark-ES, an ab initio gene
   prediction algorithm based on unsupervised training. UnSplicer shares
   several components with TrueSight; the difference lies in the training
   strategy and the classification algorithm. We tested UnSplicer on
   RNA-Seq data sets of Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans,
   Cryptococcus neoformans and Drosophila melanogaster. We have shown that
   splice junctions inferred by UnSplicer are in better agreement with
   knowledge accumulated on these well-studied genomes than predictions
   made by earlier developed tools.}},

   single-crystal Au spheres with different diameters as the seeds for
   successive growth and the use of a slow injection rate for the precursor
   to enable surface diffusion for the atoms added onto the surface of a
   seed. The diameters could be precisely controlled by varying the size
   and/or number of the seeds. The products exhibit excellent uniformity in

Abstract = {{We report on silver nanocubes (AgNCs) infiltrated into cylindrical
   nanopores of porous alumina membranes (PAM) with an outstanding chemical
   sensitivity based on refractive index sensing (RIS) measurements.
   Numerical simulations performed using the finite-difference time-domain
   (FDTD) method suggested that the enhanced sensitivity is based mainly on
   the inter-pore coupling plasmonic effect. This effect is related to
   plasmonic amplification based on localized surface plasmon resonance
   (LSPR) coupling between AgNCs located at the pore walls of neighboring
   cylindrical pores and separated by a nanoscale wall. Results are
   discussed for different aggregation scenarios ranging from individual
   nanocubes through pentamers on a flat glass surface, a flat alumina
   surface, and a concave local shape representing the experimental
   conditions. An experimental RIS sensitivity of about 770 nm per
   refractive index unit was found to be more than an order of magnitude
   higher for silver nanocube aggregates within cylindrical pores than that
   observed for ordinary planar substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to understand more fully the
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior of paper. In the reported research,
   initial characterization of the auxetic properties of common,
   commercially available papers is described. The results of these
   experiments suggest that the auxetic response seen in paper structures
   is related to the cellulose fiber network structure, as previously
   suggested, and is related to inter-fiber bonding and fiber organization
   in the sheet. These results also indicate that further study is needed
   to understand how materials and processing variables influence auxetic
   behavior. A mathematical model, attempting to explain auxetic response
   in an idealized arrangement of fibers is included. Ultimately, the
   fundamental understanding resulting from this research should lead to

Abstract = {{In their daily lives, flying insects face a gauntlet of environmental
   challenges, from wind gusts to raindrop impacts. In this combined
   experimental and theoretical study, we use high-speed videography to
   film raindrop collisions upon both flying insects and dynamically scaled
   spherical mimics. We identify three outcomes of the collision based upon
   the insect's mass and characteristic size: drops push the insect while
   remaining intact, coat the insect, and splash. We present a mathematical
   model that predicts impact force and outcome consistent with those found
   in experiments. Small insects such as gnats and flies are pushed by
   raindrops that remain intact upon impact; conversely, large flyers such
   as locusts and micro-aerial vehicles cause drops to splash. We identify
   a critical mass of 0.3 g for which flyers achieve both peak acceleration
   (100 g) and applied force (10(4) dyn) from incoming raindrops; designs
   of similarly massed flying robots should be avoided. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The intricate hierarchical architectures in natural creatures are
   usually derived from assembly of molecular building blocks into
   nanoscale structures that then organize into micro- and macroscopic
   sizes. An example is the complex structure in arthropods (crustaceans,
   insects) constructed primarily of chitin. Because of chitin's inherent
   insolubility in common solvents, processes for mimicking the fascinating
   natural chitin-based nanostructures are still at an early stage of
   development. Here, we present a facile freeze-drying approach to
   assemble chitin nanofibers (20 nm diameter) into a variety of structures
   whose size and morphology are tunable by adjusting freezing temperature
   and heat transfer characteristics. We show that reducing the freezing
   rate allows controllable formation of structures ranging from oriented
   sheets to three-dimensional aperiodic nanofiber networks that mimic the
   size and interconnectivity of the white Cyphochilus beetle cuticle. The
   formation of nanofibrous structures is not predicted by the widely used
   particle encapsulation model of freeze-drying. We reason that this
   structure occurs due to a combination of attractive interactions of the
   nanofibers and a slow freezing rate that encapsulates and preserves the
   network structure. The method outlined here is likely applicable to
   creating fine nanofibrous structures with other polymers and materials
   classes with size ranges useful in diverse applications such as tissue
   engineering, filtration, and energy storage.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomedicine is an emerging field that integrates nanotechnology,
   biomolecular engineering, life sciences and medicine; it is expected to
   produce major breakthroughs in medical diagnostics and therapeutics.
   Nano-scale structures and devices are compatible in size with proteins

   characterization and application of nano-scale probes, carriers and
   machines may provide unprecedented opportunities for achieving a better
   control of biological processes, and drastic improvements in disease
   detection, therapy, and prevention. Recent advances in nanomedicine
   include the development of nanoparticle (NP)-based probes for molecular
   imaging, nano-carriers for drug/gene delivery, multifunctional NPs for
   theranostics, and molecular machines for biological and medical studies.
   This article provides an overview of the nanomedicine field, with an
   emphasis on NPs for imaging and therapy, as well as engineered nucleases
   for genome editing. The challenges in translating nanomedicine

Abstract = {{Protein- and cell-based therapies represent highly promising strategies

   ability to incorporate various biomolecules to convey biofunctionality,

Abstract = {{The physiochemical stem cell microenvironment regulates the delicate
   balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The three-dimensional
   assembly of stem cells facilitates cellular interactions that promote
   morphogenesis, analogous to the multicellular, heterotypic tissue
   organization that accompanies embryogenesis. Therefore, expansion and
   differentiation of stem cells as multicellular aggregates provides a
   controlled platform for studying the biological and engineering
   principles underlying spatiotemporal morphogenesis and tissue
   patterning. Moreover, three-dimensional stem cell cultures are amenable
   to translational screening applications and therapies, which underscores
   the broad utility of scalable suspension cultures across laboratory and
   clinical scales. In this review, we discuss stem cell morphogenesis in
   the context of fundamental biophysical principles, including the
   three-dimensional modulation of adhesions, mechanics, and molecular
   transport and highlight the opportunities to employ stem cell spheroids
   for tissue modeling, bioprocessing, and regenerative therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The functional regeneration of thick vascularized tissues such as bone
   and muscle is complicated by the large volume of lost tissue,
   challenging biomechanical environment, and the need to reproduce the
   highly organized structure of both the native tissue extracellular
   matrix and its vascular support system. Stem cell or progenitor cell
   delivery approaches, for example, continue to be plagued by low
   viability and engraftment in part due to the initial absence of a
   vascular supply. Recognition of diffusion limitations in thick tissues
   has prompted regenerative strategies that seek to accelerate
   establishment of a functional vasculature. The successful design of
   robust regeneration strategies for these challenging clinical scenarios
   will rely on a thorough understanding of interactions between construct
   design parameters and host biological and biomechanical factors. Here,
   we discuss the critical role of vascularization in normal bone tissue
   homeostasis and repair, vascular network adaptation to the local
   biomechanical environment, and the future directions of
   revascularization approaches being developed and integrated with bone
   regeneration strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Iron oxide nanoparticles offer unique possibilities due to the change in
   their physico-chemical parameters when synthesized on the nanoscale
   (10(-9) m) compared to their bulk forms. While novel uses exist for
   these materials when synthesized as nanoparticles, their unintended
   effects on the human body and specifically during pregnancy remain ill
   defined. In this study, an iron oxide nanoparticle, alpha-Fe2O3, was
   employed and the potential toxicity due to exposure was assessed in the
   widely used model human placental cell line BeWo b30. These cells were
   grown as epithelia, and subsequently assessed for their epithelial
   integrity, reactive oxygen species production and cellular viability,
   ultrastructural and morphological disruption, and genotoxicity as a
   result of exposure to alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Transepithelial
   electrical resistance indicated that exposure to the large (50 and 78
   nm), but not small (15 nm) diameter particles of alpha-Fe2O3
   nanomaterial resulted in leakiness of the epithelium. Exposure to the
   large diameters of 50 and 78 nm resulted in increases in cell death and
   reactive oxygen species. Disruption of junctional integrity as monitored
   by immunolocalization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 was found to
   occur as a consequence of exposure to large diameter NPs. It was found
   that there was reduction in the number of microvilli responsible for
   increased surface area for nutrient absorption after exposing the
   epithelia to large diameter NPs. Finally, genotoxicity as assessed by
   DNA microarray and confirmed by QPCR indicated that the large diameter
   particles (78 nm) induce apoptosis in these cells. These data indicate
   that large (50 and 78 nm), but not small (15 nm) alpha-Fe2O3
   nanoparticles disrupt the barrier function of this epithelium as
   assessed by in vitro analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical composition of Beijing aerosol was measured during summer
   and winter. Two distinct episodes were identified. Water-soluble
   potassium (K) increased significantly during the firework episode in
   winter with an episode to non-episode ratio of 4.97, whereas the biomass
   burning (BB) episode in summer was characterized by high episode to
   non-episode ratios of levoglucosan (6.38) and K+ (6.90). The BB and
   firework episodes had only a minor influence on the water-soluble OC
   (organic carbon) to OC ratio. Based on separate investigations of
   episode and non-episode periods, it was found that: (i) sulfate
   correlated strongly with both relative humidity and nitrate during the
   typical winter period presumably indicating the importance of the
   aqueous-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide by nitrogen dioxide, (ii)
   oxalate and WSOC during both winter and summer in Beijing were mainly
   due to secondary formation, and (iii) high humidity can significantly
   enhance the formation potential of WSOC in winter. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of macro-and pico-cells can
   well tackle the contradictory requirements on large coverage of the
   network and high data rate at the hot spots. In this paper, we study
   energy-efficient precoding for coordinated multi-point (CoMP)
   transmission for HetNets. We formulate a problem that maximizes the
   energy efficiency under the constraints of individual date rate
   requirement from each user, maximal transmit power of each base station
   (BS), and zero-forcing (ZF) for a HetNet where the macro-BS cooperates
   with multiple pico-BSs. We then simplify the problem with the help of
   the practical topology of HetNets where the macro-BS cooperates with
   each of the pico-BSs. By introducing the subspace decomposition method
   and exploiting the feature of HetNets, we obtain the structure of the
   optimal ZF CoMP precoder. To reduce the computational complexity and
   hence the circuit power consumed for signal processing, we propose a
   suboptimal ZF precoder with closed-form expression for the HetNets with
   isolated pico-cells. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed ZF
   precoders by comparing with several existing optimal linear precoders.}},

Abstract = {{Recent problems in wireless cellular networks, such as network capacity
   and indoor coverage, have been addressed by the orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) small-cell deployments of
   next-generation Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) cellular systems.
   In this new paradigm, the deployment of hybrid-access small cells can be
   seen as an optimal solution since they serve both the registered indoor
   users and unregistered neighboring users in the small-cell coverage
   area. However, effective quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning and fair
   admission control pop up as two crucial challenges in these hybrid
   accesses. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
   traffic-aware OFDMA hybrid small-cell deployment for QoS provisioning
   and an optimal admission control strategy for next-generation cellular
   systems. The traffic awareness in the proposed framework is provided by
   deriving a novel traffic-aware utility function, which differentiates
   the user QoS levels with the user's priority indexes, channel
   conditions, and traffic characteristics. An optimization procedure is
   formulated, and a novel heuristic is also developed to solve the
   traffic-aware scheduling problem under transmitted power constraints. To
   further enhance the proposed scheme, an admission control algorithm
   based on the utility function is also proposed. The proposed QoS
   awareness and admission control mechanism are evaluated by thorough
   simulations, and we show that our proposed framework achieves an optimum
   QoS performance in terms of total throughput and traffic delay.}},

Abstract = {{A sensor module that incorporates a thin film polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF) piezoelectric strain sensor rosette as well as data logging and
   wireless transmitting electronics has been designed and implemented for
   monitoring dynamic cutting torque in the end milling process-a material
   removal process widely used in the aerospace industry. The dynamic shear
   strain produced in the rotating tool during the cutting process is
   picked up by the PVDF sensor rosette attached to the tool shank and can
   be either logged into the onboard micro secure digital card or
   wirelessly transmitted to a nearby base station. The PVDF sensor rosette
   is largely insensitive to the pyroelectric effect of the PVDF sensor and
   the other strain components such as bending strain and thermal strain. A
   physics-based model is used to relate the measured PVDF sensor signal to
   the dynamic milling torque. The proposed method is experimentally
   validated using reference milling torque signals computed from cutting
   force signals measured using a platform-type piezoelectric force
   dynamometer.}},

Abstract = {{Residual stress is one of the critical characteristics for assessing the
   surface integrity of machined components as it poses a strong bearing on
   the service quality, functionality, and life of the machined components.
   The machined-in residual stresses can be affected by cutting parameters,
   tool geometry, material properties, and lubrication conditions. A
   physics-based relationship between residual stresses and processing
   conditions could support process planning in achieving desirable part
   quality and functionality. This paper presents an analytical model that
   predicts the residual stresses in machining under minimum quantity
   lubrication (MQL) condition as functions of cutting parameters, tool
   geometry, material properties as well as MQL application parameters.
   Both the lubrication and cooling effects caused by MQL air-oil mixture
   contribute to changes in friction due to boundary lubrication as well as
   changes in the thermal stress due to heat loss. The cutting force and
   cutting temperature are coupled into a thermal-mechanical model which
   incorporates the kinematic hardening and strain compatibility to predict
   the resulting residual stress under lubricated conditions. The residual
   stress prediction model is verified for orthogonal tube facing of TC4
   alloy. The predicted residual stresses captured the measured results
   well in terms of the trend and magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to solve the inverse source problem arising in
   Fluorescence Tomography (FT). In general, the solution is non-unique and
   the problem is severely ill-posed. It poses tremendous challenges in
   image reconstructions. In practice, the most widely used methods are
   based on Tikhonov-type regularizations, which minimize a cost function
   consisting of a regularization term and a data fitting term. We propose
   an alternative method which overcomes the major difficulties, namely the
   non-uniqueness of the solution and noisy data fitting, in two separate
   steps. First we find a particular solution called the orthogonal
   solution that satisfies the data fitting term. Then we add to it a
   correction function in the kernel space so that the final solution
   fulfills other regularity and physical requirements. The key ideas are
   that the correction function in the kernel has no impact on the data
   fitting, so that there is no parameter needed to balance the data
   fitting and additional constraints on the solution. Moreover, we use an
   efficient basis to represent the source function, and introduce a hybrid
   strategy combining spectral methods and finite element methods in the
   proposed algorithm. The resulting algorithm can dramatically increase
   the computation speed over the existing methods. Also the numerical
   evidence shows that it significantly improves the image resolution and
   robustness against noise.}},

Abstract = {{Whether a cationic organic polymer can remove more total cyanide (TCN)
   than a non-ionic organic polymer during the same flocculation system has
   not been reported previously. In this study, the effects of organic
   polymers with different charge density on the removal mechanisms of TCN
   in coking wastewater are investigated by polyferric sulfate (PFS) with a
   cationic organic polymer (PFS-C) or a non-ionic polymer (PFS-N). The
   coagulation experiments results show that residual concentrations of TCN
   (Fe(CN)(6)(3-)) after PFS-C flocculation (TCN < 0.2 mg/L) are much lower
   than that after PFS-N precipitation. This can be attributed to the
   different TCN removal mechanisms of the individual organic polymers. To
   investigate the roles of organic polymers, physical and structural
   characteristics of the flocs are analyzed by FT-IR, XPS, TEM and XRD.
   Owing to the presence of N+ in PFS-C, Fe(CN)(6)(3-) and negative flocs
   (Fe(CN)(6)(3-) adsorbed on ferric hydroxides) can be removed via charge
   neutralization and electrostatic patch flocculation by the cationic
   organic polymer. However, non-ionic N in PFS-N barely reacts with
   cyanides through sweeping or bridging, which indicates that the
   non-ionic polymer has little influence on TCN removal.}},

Abstract = {{ZnO nanomaterials have been shown to have novel applications in

   an electrical signal. The FNG shows consistent alternating current
   responses (relative error < 0.37\%) at regular frequencies from 1 to 15

   via the piezotronic effect. Under a forward bias of 3 V, the sensor
   presented a sensitivity of 3700\% and an accurate measurement (relative

Abstract = {{Uniaxially aligned cellulose nanofibers with well oriented cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNCs) embedded were fabricated via electrospinning using a
   rotating drum as the collector. Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   images indicated that most cellulose nanofibers were uniaxially aligned.
   The incorporation of CNCs into the spinning dope resulted in more
   uniform morphology of the electrospun cellulose/CNCs nano-composite
   nanofibers (ECCNN). Polarized light microscope (PLM) and transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) showed that CNCs dispersed well in ECCNN
   nonwovens and achieved considerable orientation along the long axis
   direction. This unique hierarchical microstructure of ECCNN nonwovens
   gave rise to remarkable enhancement of their physical properties. By
   incorporating 20\% loading (in weight) of CNCs, the tensile strength and
   elastic modulus of ECCNN along the fiber alignment direction were
   increased by 101.7 and 171.6\%, respectively. Their thermal stability
   was, significantly improved as well. in. addition, the ECCNN nonwovens
   were assessed as potential scaffold materials for tissue engineering. It
   was elucidated from MTT tests that the ECCNN were essentially nontoxic
   to human cells. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that cells could
   proliferate rapidly not only on the surface but also deep inside the
   ECCNN. More importantly, the aligned nanofibers of ECCNN exhibited a
   strong effect on directing cellular organization. This feature made the
   scaffold particularly useful for various artificial tissues or organs,
   such as blood vessel, tendon, nerve, and so on, in which cell
   orientation was crucial for their performance.}},

Abstract = {{The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells as embryoid bodies (EBs)
   remains a common method for inducing differentiation toward many
   lineages. However, differentiation via EBs typically yields a
   significant amount of heterogeneity in the cell population, as most
   cells differentiate simultaneously toward different lineages, while
   others remain undifferentiated. Moreover, physical parameters, such as
   the size of EBs, can modulate the heterogeneity of differentiated
   phenotypes due to the establishment of nutrient and oxygen gradients.
   One of the challenges in examining the cellular composition of EBs is
   the lack of analytical methods that are capable of determining the
   phenotype of all of the individual cells that comprise a single EB.
   Therefore, the objective of this work was to examine the ability of a
   microfluidic cell trapping array to analyze the heterogeneity of cells
   comprising EBs during the course of early differentiation. The
   heterogeneity of single cell phenotype on the basis of protein
   expression of the pluripotent transcription factor OCT-4 was examined
   for populations of EBs and single EBs of different sizes at distinct
   stages of differentiation. Results from the cell trap device were
   compared with flow cytometry and whole mount immunostaining.
   Additionally, single cells from dissociated pooled EBs or individual EBs
   were examined separately to discern potential differences in the value
   or variance of expression between the different methods of analysis.
   Overall, the analytical method described represents a novel approach for
   evaluating how heterogeneity is manifested in EB cultures and may be
   used in the future to assess the kinetics and patterns of
   differentiation in addition to the loss of pluripotency.}},

Abstract = {{Arterial, platelet-rich thrombosis depends on shear rates and integrin
   binding to either a collagen surface or to the growing thrombus, which
   are mechanistically different. In general, small microfluidic test
   sections may favor platelet-surface adhesion without testing for the
   primary mode of intra-arterial thrombosis, i.e. platelet-platelet
   bonding and accumulation. In the present report, the ratio of
   platelet-platelet to platelet-surface interactions, R, and the
   percentage of platelet-platelet interactions, P, are estimated using an
   analytical approach for circular and rectangular test sections. Results
   show that the test section geometry strongly affects both R and P, with
   test section height in low-aspect ratio channels or diameter greater
   than 90 mu m dominated by platelet-platelet interactions (R > 10).
   Increasing rectangular test section aspect ratio decreases the required
   height. R increases linearly while P approaches 100 \% asymptotically
   with increasing channel dimension. Analysis of platelet shape shows that
   the assumption of spherical platelets has a small effect on R compared
   to discoid platelets adhering flat against test section wall. However,
   an increase in average platelet volume resulted in a large decrease in
   R. Nonetheless, Monte Carlo simulations of a typical distribution of
   human platelet sizes show intrasubject variation in platelet size has
   only a 10 \% net effect on R. Finally, experiments of thrombus formation
   show that platelet-surface lag times and platelet-platelet accumulation
   are similar for rectangular microfluidic test sections and round test
   sections when R > 10. The findings show that the size of a microfluidic
   test section should be carefully considered in studies of cell-cell
   accumulation versus cell-surface adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring crystal size distributions in situ is a challenge in
   crystallization engineering. Such a capability provides comprehensive
   information on the crystallization, which can be used to improve the
   quality of products. We developed an empirical focused-beam reflectance
   measurement (FBRM) model to provide such estimates. By experimentally
   fixing the CSD as a system input and the chord-length distribution (CLD)
   from the FBRM as the output, we constructed the model as a linear
   transformation from CSD to CLD. A regularized least-squares algorithm,
   which considers the mass balances on solid and liquid phases, was used
   to estimate the CSD. The results of batch cooling crystallization
   experiments show that estimates of the evolution of CSD are in
   accordance with the general understanding of crystallization kinetics,
   and the CSD estimates of final product agreed with the CSD obtained from
   sieving. The simplicity and practicality of the model make it a
   significant enhancement to the use of FBRM in monitoring, simulating,
   and controlling crystallization processes.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{552-575}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have the potential to be one of the
   cleanest and most efficient energy technologies for direct conversion of
   chemical fuels to electricity. Economically competitive SOFC systems
   appear poised for commercialization, but widespread market penetration
   will require continuous innovation of materials and fabrication
   processes to enhance system lifetime and reduce cost. One early
   technical opportunity is minimization of resistance to the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which contributes the most to
   performance degradation and efficiency loss in the existing SOFCs,
   especially at temperatures <700 degrees C. Detailed study over the past
   15 years has revealed the positive impact of catalyst infiltration on
   SOFC cathode performance, both in power density and durability metrics.
   However, realizable performance improvements rely upon strongly-coupled
   relationships in materials and morphology between the infiltrate and the
   backbone, and therefore efficacious systems cannot be simply generated
   with a set of simple heuristics. This article reviews recent progress in
   enhancing SOFC cathode performance by surface modification through a
   solution-based infiltration process, focusing on two backbone
   architectures - inherently functional and skeletal - infiltrated using
   wet-chemistry processes. An efficient cathode consists of a porous
   mixed-conducting backbone and an active coating catalyst; the porous
   backbone provides excellent ionic and electronic conductivity, while the
   infiltrated surface coating possesses high catalytic activity and
   stability. As available, performance comparisons are emphasized and
   reaction schematics for specific infiltrate/backbone systems are
   summarized. While significant progress has been achieved in enhancing
   surface catalytic activity and durability, the detailed mechanisms of
   performance enhancement are insufficiently understood to obtain critical
   insights and a scientific basis for rational design of more efficient
   catalysts and novel electrode architectures. Recent progress in
   characterization of surfaces and interfaces is briefly discussed with
   challenges and perspectives in surface modification of SOFC electrodes.
   Surface modification through infiltration is expected to play an
   increasingly important role in current and next-generation commercial
   SOFC development, and this review illustrates the sophisticated
   technical considerations required to inform judicious selection of an
   infiltrate for a given SOFC system.}},

Title = {{Camassa-Holm equations and vortexons for axisymmetric pipe flows}},
Journal = {{FLUID DYNAMICS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the nonlinear dynamics of an axisymmetric
   disturbance to the laminar state in non-rotating Poiseuille pipe flows.
   In particular, we show that the associated Navier-Stokes equations can
   be reduced to a set of coupled dispersive Camassa-Holm type equations.
   These support inviscid and smooth localized travelling waves, which are
   numerically computed using the Petviashvili method. In physical space
   they correspond to localized toroidal vortices that concentrate near the
   pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or wrap around the pipe axis (centre
   vortexons) in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived by
   Fedele (2012 Fluid Dyn. Res. 44 45509) for small and long-wave
   disturbances. Inviscid singular vortexons with discontinuous radial
   velocities are also numerically discovered as associated to special
   travelling waves with a wedge-type singularity, viz. peakons. Their
   existence is confirmed by an analytical solution of exponentially shaped
   peakons that is obtained for the particular case of the uncoupled
   Camassa-Holm equations. The evolution of a perturbation is also
   investigated using an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme. We observe
   that an initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating
   vorticity in the form of wall vortexons. These can under go further
   splitting before viscosity dissipates them, leading to a slug of centre
   vortexons. The splitting process originates from a radial flux of
   azimuthal vorticity from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with
   Eyink (2008 Physica D 237 1956-68). The inviscid and smooth vortexon is
   similar to the nonlinear neutral structures derived by Walton (2011 J.
   Fluid Mech. 684 284-315) and it may be a precursor to puffs and slugs
   observed at transition, since most likely it is unstable to
   non-axisymmetric disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods, dry impregnation (DI) and controlled adsorption (CA), are
   used for the preparation of Co/Al2O3 catalysts for methane dry reforming
   reactions. Point of zero charge (PZC) measurements, pH-precipitation
   studies, and adsorption isotherms are used to develop a synthesis
   procedure in which deposition of Co2+ takes place in a more controlled
   manner than metal deposition during drying in synthesis by dry
   impregnation. The possible adsorption phenomena that occur during
   preparation of Co/Al2O3 catalysts by controlled adsorption are
   discussed. H-2 chemisorption and TEM show that catalysts prepared by CA
   have smaller average particle sizes and higher dispersions. TPR studies
   show that for the sample prepared by CA a higher amount of cobalt is
   reduced to its metallic state and that more CoAl2O4 spinet species are
   present relative to DI samples. The catalyst prepared by CA shows higher
   activity and slower deactivation for methane dry reforming than the
   catalyst prepared by DI. XPS and C, H, N analysis on spent catalysts
   confirm two types of carbonaceous deposits are formed depending on the
   preparation method.}},

Abstract = {{To suppress the impact of size effects on sub-20 nm wide wires, a novel
   aluminum-copper hybrid interconnect architecture is proposed and its
   potential performance has been quantified. Al wires offer lower
   resistivities at nanoscale dimensions because they do not need diffusion
   barriers, and size effects are less prominent in them due to their
   smaller bulk mean free path. However, their current conduction capacity
   is substantially lower than that of Cu wires. To get around this
   limitation, this letter proposes a hybrid interconnect technology to
   replace only short narrow local signal wires by Al wires. This scheme
   takes advantage of the fact that signal wires conduct bi-directional
   currents and are therefore virtually immune to electromigration. The
   improvement in chip clock frequency is predicted to be between 50\% and
   100\% for the 7 nm technology node.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the design of logarithmic CMOS image sensor with

   characteristics of the photodiode array in the 3-D image sensor. The
   coupled power, performance, thermal, and noise analysis is performed
   considering 180-nm CMOS technology. The coupled analysis shows that, due
   to die-to-die thermal coupling, 3-D stacking of the image compression
   unit, although provides for better energy efficiency, results in a
   strong interaction between image quality, desired image throughput, and

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) array is an ideal form for

   thermal conductivity and robust mechanical properties. In this paper, we
   report the growth of high-quality VACNTs for the applications as thermal
   interface materials (TIMs). The high-quality VACNTs were grown and
   confirmed by the characterizations of Raman and thermogravimetric
   analyses. Metalized VACNT array was transferred and bonded to a
   metalized silicon or copper substrate. The VACNT-based TIM structure
   (Si-Ti/Ni/Au-In-Ti/Ni/Au-VACNT-Ti/Ni/Au-In-Ti/Ni/Au-Cu) was then
   successfully made after bonding to another substrate (copper or
   silicon). The total boundary resistance between the VACNT array and the
   surrounding materials was measured by an infrared thermal imaging
   method. Compared with the TIM sample made from carbon nanotubes grown in
   our laboratory chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the thermal boundary
   resistance of the TIM sample made from CNTs in the black magic CVD was
   greatly reduced from 11.6 +/- 0.5 to 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm(2) K W-1. Overall,

Abstract = {{As the operating frequency of electronic devices increases and system
   miniaturization continues, designing power delivery networks (PDNs) that
   supply quality power throughout the system becomes very challenging. To
   guarantee successful performance of the PDN, an accurate and
   time-efficient simulation method that computes the PDN impedance is
   required. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient PDN
   modeling method that analyzes multilayer power/ground planes. The
   proposed method solves the differential form of Maxwell's equation
   applied on the circuit representation of a plane pair. To use the
   analogy between the equations of the electromagnetic field and the
   equivalent circuit, a dual mesh is created on the metal surface. The use
   of a nonuniform triangular mesh enables effective discretization of
   multidimensional and irregular geometries. Moreover, the differential
   equation generates a sparse system matrix, which requires small computer
   resources. The proposed model is extended to multiple plane pairs, and
   the modeling of apertures located on any layer is also included.
   Simulation results show that the proposed method can solve complex
   structures with less computational effort than other modeling methods,
   while maintaining accuracy. In addition, the application of the
   absorbing boundary condition (ABC) to the proposed method is presented.
   Applying ABC to the plane boundaries prevents outgoing waves from
   reflecting back into the plane pair, hence removing plane resonances.
   The use of the first-order ABC results in a simple implementation and
   the results show good correlation with the results from a full-wave
   solver using higher order ABC.}},

   catheters with real-time volumetric ultrasound imaging capability can
   provide unique benefits to many interventional procedures used in the

   Integration of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)
   arrays with front-end electronics in single-chip configuration allows
   for implementation of such catheter probes with reduced interconnect
   complexity, miniaturization, and high mechanical flexibility. We
   implemented a single-chip forward-looking (FL) ultrasound imaging system
   by fabricating a 1.4-mm-diameter dual-ring CMUT array using CMUT-on-CMOS
   technology on a front-end IC implemented in 0.35-mu m CMOS process. The
   dual-ring array has 56 transmit elements and 48 receive elements on two
   separate concentric annular rings. The IC incorporates a 25-V pulser for
   each transmitter and a low-noise capacitive transimpedance amplifier
   (TIA) for each receiver, along with digital control and smart power
   management. The final shape of the silicon chip is a 1.5-mm-diameter
   donut with a 430-mu m center hole for a guide wire. The overall
   front-end system requires only 13 external connections and provides 4
   parallel RF outputs while consuming an average power of 20 mW. We
   measured RF A-scans from the integrated single-chip array which show
   full functionality at 20.1 MHz with 43\% fractional bandwidth. We also
   tested and demonstrated the image quality of the system on a wire
   phantom and an ex vivo chicken heart sample. The measured axial and
   lateral point resolutions are 92 mu m and 251 mu m, respectively. We
   successfully acquired volumetric imaging data from the ex vivo chicken
   heart at 60 frames per second without any signal averaging. These
   demonstrative results indicate that single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS systems
   have the potential to produce real-time volumetric images with image
   quality and speed suitable for catheter-based clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the significant influence of trade allowance on store
   operation and the efficiency of shelf-space allocation, this article
   develops a model for optimizing category-level shelf-space management. A
   category shelf-space allocation framework with trade allowance is
   presented and a multi-player Retailer Stackelberg game is introduced to
   model the interaction between retailer and manufacturers. With this
   framework, a retailer maximizes profit by taking the manufacturers'
   trade allowance response into account, which provides a realistic
   approach of simultaneously determining the shelf-space and trade
   promotion decisions under the consideration of interactions among
   products. A piecewise linearization method is employed to reformulate
   the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem into a linear
   MIP problem for optimal solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate
   significant advantage of the proposed framework and quantitative
   analysis leads to a variety of managerial insights. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A wireless RF MEMS pressure sensor made entirely of biodegradable
   materials is presented. Such biodegradable sensors may be appropriate
   for short-term, acute medical implantation applications as they
   potentially eliminate the need for implant extraction when sensing is no
   longer required. The biodegradable sensors described here require
   structural materials for pressure sensing, dielectric materials for
   insulation, and conducting materials for formation of electrical
   elements and wireless links. Zinc/iron bilayers were used as the sensor
   conductor material, and known biodegradable polymers poly-L-lactide and
   polycaprolactone were used as dielectric and structural materials. Zinc,
   which otherwise degrades very slowly on its own under biological
   conditions, is galvanically activated when electrically connected to
   iron in saline, greatly increasing the total degradation rate of the
   conductors. To avoid contact of the biodegradable materials with the
   strong chemicals or solvents that are typically used in conventional
   MEMS fabrication, embossing, multilayer folding, and lamination were
   combined with traditional techniques during fabrication. The fabricated
   sensor was wirelessly tested in both air and 0.9\% saline and
   demonstrated a linear frequency response with external applied pressure.
   A sensitivity of 39 kHz/kPa was measured in the 0-20 kPa pressure range
   in air and initially in saline. After immersion in saline for 20 h, the
   sensor stabilized, remaining stable and functional for 86 h with a
   sensitivity of -54 +/- 4 kHz/kPa.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive urban development is increasing the demand for green areas
   within cities. Urban brownfields could become a source for green
   redevelopment areas. Sustainable redevelopment requires precise
   information on the environmental impact of the installation of different
   vegetation types. We performed a Life Cycle Analysis (SimaPro 7
   software) of six lawn installation and maintenance scenarios relevant to
   the conditions of Georgia, USA and confirmed that a traditional turf sod
   lawn has the highest environmental impact levels. Xeriscaped lawn
   composed of bark mulch has high impact levels owing to the substantial
   transportation needs at the installation stage. Hydroseeded lawns
   (composed of natural materials) are a sustainable alternative for
   traditional turf sod lawns, especially when native plants are included
   (11-14 times lower impact level). Professional selection and use of
   native plants could provide environmental, social, and ecological
   options for urban brownfield redevelopment into green areas. (C) 2013

Title = {{Ultrasonic Nakagami-parameter characterization of parotid-gland injury
   following head-and-neck radiotherapy: A feasibility study of late
   toxicity}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The study aims to investigate whether Nakagami
   parameters-estimated from the statistical distribution of the
   backscattered ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals-could provide a
   means for quantitative characterization of parotid-gland injury
   resulting from head-and-neck radiotherapy.
   Methods: A preliminary clinical study was conducted with 12
   postradiotherapy patients and 12 healthy volunteers. Each participant
   underwent one ultrasound study in which ultrasound scans were performed
   in the longitudinal, i.e., vertical orientation on the bilateral
   parotids. For the 12 patients, the mean radiation dose to the parotid
   glands was 37.7 +/- 9.5 Gy, and the mean follow-up time was 16.3 +/- 4.8
   months. All enrolled patients experienced grade 1 or 2 late
   salivary-gland toxicity (RTOG/EORTC morbidity scale). The normal parotid
   glands served as the control group. The Nakagami-scaling and
   Nakagami-shape parameters were computed from the RF data to quantify
   radiation-induced parotid-gland changes.
   Results: Significant differences in Nakagami parameters were observed
   between the normal and postradiotherapy parotid glands. Compared with
   the control group, the Nakagami-scaling parameter of the
   postradiotherapy group decreased by 25.8\% (p < 0.001), and the
   Nakagami-shape parameter decreased by 31.3\% (p < 0.001). The area under
   the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.85 for the
   Nakagami-scaling parameter and was 0.95 for the Nakagami-shape
   parameter, which further demonstrated the diagnostic efficiency of the
   Nakagami parameters.
   Conclusions: Nakagami parameters could be used to quantitatively measure
   parotid-gland injury following head-and-neck radiotherapy. Moreover, the
   clinical feasibility was demonstrated and this study provides meaningful
   preliminary data for future clinical investigation. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{The widespread deployment of sensors, computers, and communications in
   vehicles and roadways is creating new challenges and opportunities to
   effectively exploit the wealth of real-time data and information that is
   now becoming increasingly available. In this paper the authors
   capitalize on these rapid technological advancements using a technique
   termed on-line ad hoc distributed simulation. This approach utilizes a
   dynamic collection of autonomous simulations interacting with each other
   and with real-time data in a continuously running, distributed,
   real-time simulation environment. Within the ad hoc distributed
   simulation approach a rollback-based time synchronization method is used
   to allow the simulations to adapt to unanticipated changes in traffic
   and to changes in predictions produced by other simulations. The
   proposed approach is tested on a transportation network with different
   geographical distributions of client locations and randomized network
   partitioning under different traffic demand scenarios. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to share complex
   traffic data among participating vehicles and process the data in an
   effective way to provide drivers/system monitoring with near-term
   traffic predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{46-54}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We propose an approach for constructing a new class of space-filling
   designs, called asymmetric nested lattice samples. As a stepping stone
   to the proposed approach, we introduce two methods for generating
   asymmetric nested orthogonal arrays. We then present an elaborate
   randomization method to shuffle the levels of an asymmetric nested
   orthogonal array to produce a pair of asymmetric nested lattice samples.
   The constructed designs have a desirable nested structure, possess
   attractive space-filling properties, and allow different axes to be
   divided at different scales of fineness. For multifidelity computer
   experiments, sequential evaluations, and multistep functional fitting
   and linking parameters, the asymmetric feature is appealing for
   situations where some factors are believed to be more important or
   deserve more attention than others. The proposed designs are also useful
   in problems where different factors, by nature, require dividing their
   axes at different levels of fineness.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation signals are sensor-based signals that are correlated with
   degradation processes of engineering components. In this article, we
   present a flexible modeling framework for characterizing degradation
   signals that can only be observed up to a prespecified failure
   threshold. The underlying assumption of this framework is that the
   engineering components degrade according to a similar trend, referred to
   as the common shape function, but at different degradation rates. Under
   this assumption, the degradation signals of different components are
   synchronized using a random time warping process that transforms the
   common trend function into degradation processes that progress at
   varying rates. Our primary objective is to obtain real-time predictions
   for the residual lifetime of components deployed in the field. In the
   initial step, the historical degradation signals are used to recover the
   distribution of the degradation processes under the assumptions of the
   proposed time warping model. Next, the distribution of the degradation
   process is updated using the signal(s) of partially degraded
   component(s). The updated model is then used to predict the residual
   lifetime distributions of these components. We test the performance of
   our methodology using vibration-based degradation signals from a
   rotating machinery experiment and simulated degradation signals.

Abstract = {{Aims: Large plaque burden, certain phenotypes, and low wall shear stress
   (WSS) are associated with adverse outcomes and high WSS with development
   of plaque vulnerability. We aimed to investigate the incremental value
   of the combination of plaque burden, WSS and plaque phenotype for
   prediction of coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression and
   vulnerability.
   Methods: Twenty patients with CAD underwent baseline and 6-month
   follow-up coronary virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS)
   and computational fluid dynamics modeling for calculation of WSS. Low
   WSS was defined as <10 dynes/cm(2) and high WSS as >= 25 dynes/cm(2).
   Baseline plaque characteristics and WSS were related to plaque
   progression and vulnerability.
   Results: In 2249 VH-IVUS frames analyzed, coronary segments with both
   plaque burden >40\% and low WSS had significantly greater change in
   plaque area at follow-up (+0.68 +/- 1.05 mm(2)), compared to segments
   with plaque burden >40\% without low WSS (-0.28 +/- 1.32 mm(2)) or
   segments with low WSS and plaque burden <= 40\% (+0.05 +/- 0.71 mm(2))
   (p = 0.047). Among plaque phenotypes, pathologic intimal thickening
   (PIT) had the greatest increase in necrotic core (NC) area (p = 0.06)
   and greatest decrease in fibro-fatty (FF) area (p < 0.0001). At
   follow-up, compared to segments with either plaque burden >60\%, PIT, or
   high WSS, those with a combination of plaque burden >60\%, PIT, and high
   WSS developed greater increase in NC area (p = 0.002), greater decrease
   in FF (p = 0.004) and fibrous areas (p < 0.0001), and higher frequency
   of expansive remodeling (p = 0.019).
   Conclusion: Combination of plaque burden, WSS, and plaque phenotype has
   incremental value for prediction of coronary plaque progression and
   increased plaque vulnerability in patients with non-obstructive CAD. (C)

Abstract = {{Novel thermo-responsive affinity sugar binders were developed by fusing
   a bacterial fucose lectin with a thermo-responsive polypeptide. These
   designer affinity ligand fusions were produced using an Escherichia coli
   system capable of extracellular secretion of recombinant proteins and
   were isolated with a high recovery yield (95\%) directly from growth
   medium by Inverse Temperature Cycling (ITC). With horse radish
   peroxidase (HRP) as a model protein, we demonstrate here that the
   designer thermo-responsive ligands are capable of interacting with
   glycans on a glycoprotein, a property that was used to develop a novel
   affinity precipitation method for glycoprotein purification. The method,
   requiring only simple process steps, affords full recovery of a target
   glycoprotein, and is effective at a target glycoprotein concentration as
   low as 1.4pM in the presence of large amounts of contaminants. By
   developing other sugar binders in the similar fashion, the method should
   be highly useful for glycoprotein purification and detection. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A notable feature of the 2002 M-w 7.9 Denali, Alaska, earthquake was
   that a unique set of near-field seismic ground motion records, at Pump
   Station 10 (PS10), captured the passage of a supershear rupture followed
   by what was surmised to be a secondary slip pulse, `Trailing Rayleigh
   Pulse' (Dunham and Archuleta, 2004; Mello et al., 2010). Motivated by
   the unique features contained in these near-field ground motion records,
   which were obtained only 3 km away from the fault, a series of scaled
   laboratory earthquake experiments was conducted in an attempt to
   replicate the dominant features of the PS10 ground motion signatures.
   Particle velocity records bearing a striking similarity to the Denali
   ground motion records are presented and discussed. The success of the
   comparison opens up the possibility of routinely generating near source
   ground motion records in a scaled and controlled laboratory setting that
   could be of great societal interest towards assessing seismic hazard
   from large and potentially devastating earthquakes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the mechanism of high-speed grinding to achieve
   quality and efficiency for ceramics. The criterion of the
   brittle-ductile removal transition of ceramics is calculated and
   analyzed. The effects of the wheel velocity on the specific grinding
   forces, energy, and specific material removal rates were investigated.
   The influence of the wheel velocity on the surface integrity was studied
   in the terms of surface roughness by a 3D optical profilometer, scanning
   electron microscopy, respectively. The ductile removal mechanism of
   brittle material was validated experimentally. High quality and
   efficiency of grinding for SiC can been attained with high-speed
   grinding due to the understanding of the characteristics and mechanism
   for ductile grinding of brittle materials with high-speed grinding.
   Furthermore, based on the high-performance grinding mechanism,
   reasonable definitions on high-speed grinding are proposed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TERRAMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture is an important environmental variable that impacts
   military operations and weapons systems. Accurate and timely forecasts
   of soil moisture at appropriate spatial scales, therefore, are important
   for mission planning. We present an application of a soil moisture data
   assimilation system to military trafficability assessment. The data
   assimilation system combines hillslope-scale (e.g., lOs to 100s of m)
   estimates of soil moisture from a hydrologic model with synthetic L-band
   microwave radar observations broadly consistent with the planned NASA
   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Soil moisture outputs from
   the data assimilation system are input to a simple index-based model for
   vehicle trafficability. Since the data assimilation system uses the
   ensemble Kalman Filter, the risks of impaired trafficability due to
   uncertainties in the observations and model inputs can be quantified.
   Assimilating the remote sensing observations leads to significantly
   different predictions of trafficability conditions and associated risk
   of impaired trafficability, compared to an approach that propagates
   forward uncertainties in model inputs without assimilation.
   Specifically, assimilating the observations is associated with an
   increase in the risk of ``slow go{''} conditions in approximately
   two-thirds of the watershed, and an increase in the risk of ``no go{''}
   conditions in approximately 40\% of the watershed. Despite the
   simplicity of the trafficability assessment tool, results suggest that
   ensemble-based data assimilation can potentially improve trafficability
   assessment by constraining predictions to observations and facilitating
   quantitative assessment of the risk of impaired trafficability. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present data and predictive models for the shear rheology of
   suspended zeolite particles in polymer solutions. It was found
   experimentally that suspensions of zeolite particles in polymer
   solutions have relative viscosities that dramatically exceed the
   Krieger-Dougherty predictions for hard sphere suspensions. Our
   investigations show that the major origin of this discrepancy is due to
   the selective absorption of solvent molecules from the suspending
   polymer solution into zeolite pores. The effect raises both the polymer
   concentration in the suspending medium and the particle volume fraction
   in the suspension. Consequently, both the viscosity of the polymer
   solution and the particle contribution to the suspension viscosity are
   increased. We propose a predictive model for the viscosity of porous
   zeolite suspensions by incorporating a solvent absorption parameter,
   alpha, into the Krieger-Dougherty model. We experimentally determined
   the solvent absorption parameter by comparing viscosity data for
   suspensions of porous and nonporous MFI zeolite particles. Our results
   are in good agreement with the theoretical pore volume of MFI particles.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the possibility of using the graphene moir, superstructure
   formed on Ru(0001) (g/Ru(0001)) as a template to self-assemble
   super-lattices of metal nanoparticles as model catalysts, it is
   desirable to know the minimum-energy adsorption sites, adsorption
   energies, and diffusion properties of small metal species on this
   surface. Toward that end, density functional theory calculations have
   been carried out to investigate the adsorption and diffusion of 18 4d
   (Y-Ag) and 5d (La-Au) transition metal adatoms on g/Ru(0001), using
   small surface models representing different regions of the g/Ru(0001)
   surface. For each adatom, adsorption is the strongest in the fcc region
   and the weakest in the mound region of the moir,. Diffusion within the
   fcc region is facile for most adatoms, but an additional barrier is
   imposed by the corrugation of the graphene moir, for traversing between
   neighboring fcc regions. Overall, the earlier 4d and 5d metal adatoms
   have stronger adsorption energies and higher diffusion barriers on
   g/Ru(0001) than the later ones. The results are then interpreted to
   provide a better understanding of the conditions necessary to achieve
   dense super-lattices of monodisperse metal clusters on g/Ru(0001).}},

   the evaporation of water and to co-plasticize PVA. Thermal gravimetric
   analysis and differential scanning calorimetry indicated the melt
   processing window of PVA was expanded by 40 A degrees C. Tensile tests
   showed that the mechanical properties of injection-molded samples were
   significantly improved with the addition of CNCs. The tensile strength
   of the composites increased from 32 to 58 MPa, and modulus increased
   from 175 to 1,252 MPa when 7 wt\% CNCs was added. Moreover, the volume
   shrinkage of PVA nanocomposites upon drying as well as their water
   leaching rate could be remarkably reduced in the presence of CNCs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive guaranteed gain, sector, and disk margins for
   nonlinear optimal and inverse optimal discontinuous feedback regulators
   that minimize a nonlinear-nonquadratic performance functional for
   Filippov dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider dynamical systems
   with Lebesgue measurable and locally essentially bounded vector fields
   characterized by differential inclusions involving Filippov set-valued
   maps. In addition, we extend classical dissipativity theory to address
   the problem of dissipative discontinuous dynamical systems. These
   results are then used to derive extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov
   conditions for characterizing necessary and sufficient conditions for
   dissipativity of discontinuous systems using Clarke gradients and
   locally Lipschitz continuous storage functions. Furthermore, using the
   newly developed dissipativity notions we develop a return difference
   inequality to provide connections between dissipativity and optimality
   of nonlinear discontinuous controllers for Filippov dynamical systems.
   Specifically, using the extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions we
   show that our discontinuous feedback control law satisfies a return
   difference inequality if and only if the controller is dissipative with
   respect to a quadratic supply rate.}},

Abstract = {{We present a paper on the influence of an oxygen-plasma treatment

   transistors (HFETs) using a plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition
   (PE-ALD) system. The oxygen plasma is excited in a remote location to
   avoid the plasma damage. After the plasma treatment, the threshold
   voltage was shifted from -0.25 to 0 V and a two-orders-of-magnitude
   reduction of the drain leakage current was observed in recessed-gate
   AlGaN/AlN/GaN HFETs. The capacitance-voltage characteristics of gate
   diodes showed indistinguishable hysteresis. Improved gate-lag and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present dual-mode (DM) AlN-on-silicon micromechanical
   resonators for self-temperature sensing. In-plane width-shear (WS) and
   width-extensional (WE) modes of {[}110]-oriented silicon resonators have
   been used as alternatives to first- and third-order modes to enhance DM
   temperature sensitivity by engineering device geometry, which reduces
   inherent beat frequency f(b) between the two modes. This configuration
   provides a 50x improvement in temperature coefficient of beat frequency
   (TC f(b)) compared with single-mode temperature measurement and
   eliminates the need for additional frequency multipliers to generate
   f(b) from its constituents. {[}100]-oriented WS/WE resonators provide 4x
   larger TCF difference between modes (Delta TCF) than first and third
   width-extensional resonators, which further contributes to TC f(b)
   enhancement. WS/WE mode resonators also demonstrate the capability of
   operating as a temperature-stable reference f(b). The proposed modes for
   DM operation have high Q and low motional resistance, and are 180
   degrees out-of-phase when operated in two-port configuration, thus
   enabling mode-selective low-power oscillator interfacing for resonant
   temperature sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Effective intracellular delivery is a significant impediment to research
   and therapeutic applications at all processing scales. Physical delivery
   methods have long demonstrated the ability to deliver cargo molecules
   directly to the cytoplasm or nucleus, and the mechanisms underlying the
   most common approaches (microinjection, electroporation, and
   sonoporation) have been extensively investigated. In this review, we
   discuss established approaches, as well as emerging techniques
   (magnetofection, optoinjection, and combined modalities). In addition to
   operating principles and implementation strategies, we address
   applicability and limitations of various in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo
   platforms. Importantly, we perform critical assessments regarding (1)
   treatment efficacy with diverse cell types and delivered cargo
   molecules, (2) suitability to different processing scales (from single
   cell to large populations), (3) suitability for automation/integration
   with existing workflows, and (4) multiplexing potential and
   flexibility/adaptability to enable rapid changeover between treatments
   of varied cell types. Existing techniques typically fall short in one or
   more of these criteria; however, introduction of micro-/nanotechnology
   concepts, as well as synergistic coupling of complementary method(s),
   can improve performance and applicability of a particular approach,
   overcoming barriers to practical implementation. For this reason, we
   emphasize these strategies in examining recent advances in development
   of delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{We review algorithms developed for nonnegative matrix factorization
   (NMF) and nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) from a unified view
   based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework. NMF and NTF are
   low-rank approximation methods for matrices and tensors in which the
   low-rank factors are constrained to have only nonnegative elements. The
   nonnegativity constraints have been shown to enable natural
   interpretations and allow better solutions in numerous applications
   including text analysis, computer vision, and bioinformatics. However,
   the computation of NMF and NTF remains challenging and expensive due the
   constraints. Numerous algorithmic approaches have been proposed to
   efficiently compute NMF and NTF. The BCD framework in constrained
   non-linear optimization readily explains the theoretical convergence
   properties of several efficient NMF and NTF algorithms, which are
   consistent with experimental observations reported in literature. In
   addition, we discuss algorithms that do not fit in the BCD framework
   contrasting them from those based on the BCD framework. With insights
   acquired from the unified perspective, we also propose efficient
   algorithms for updating NMF when there is a small change in the reduced
   dimension or in the data. The effectiveness of the proposed updating
   algorithms are validated experimentally with synthetic and real-world
   data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza vaccines with broad cross-protection are urgently needed. The
   highly conserved ectodomain of the influenza matrix protein 2 (M2e) can
   be a promising candidate if its low immunogenicity was overcome. In this
   study, we generated protein nanoclusters self-assembled from
   conformation-stabilized M2e tetramers (tM2e) to improve its
   immunogenicity. The resulting nanoclusters showed an average
   hydrodynamic diameter of 227 nm. Vaccination with the nanoclusters by an
   intranasal route elicited high levels of serum antigen-specific IgG in
   mice (approximately 100-fold higher than that obtained with soluble
   tM2e), as well as antigen-specific T cell and mucosal antibody
   responses. The immunity conferred complete protection against lethal
   challenge with homo-as well as heterosubtypic viruses. These results
   demonstrate that nanoclusters assembled from conformation-stabilized M2e
   are promising as a potential universal influenza A vaccine.
   Self-assembly into nanoclusters represents a novel approach for
   increasing the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{477-486}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Reducing friction is of utmost importance to improve efficiency and
   lifetime of many products used in our daily lives. Thin hard coatings
   like diamond-like carbon (DLC) have been shown to reduce friction in
   full-film-lubricated contacts. In this work, it is shown that contrarily
   to common belief, the friction reduction stems mainly from a thermal
   phenomenon and not only a chemical/surface interaction one. It is shown
   that a few micrometer-thin DLC coating can significantly influence the
   thermal behavior in a lubricated mechanical system. The presented
   simulations, validated by experiments, show that applying a thin DLC
   coating to metal surfaces creates an insulating effect that due to the
   increased liquid lubricant film temperature at the center of the
   contact, locally reduces lubricant viscosity and thus friction. The
   results of the investigation show that the addition of thin insulating
   layers could lead to substantial performance increases in many
   applications. On a component level, the contact friction coefficient in
   some common machine components like gears, rolling element bearings, and
   cam followers can potentially be reduced by more than 40 \%. This will
   most likely open up the way to new families of coatings with a focus on
   thermal properties that may be both cheaper and more suitable in certain
   applications than DLC coatings.}},

Abstract = {{The Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a fluoride-cooled and
   graphite-moderated reactor concept designed by Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory (Holcomb et al., 2011). The modeling and optimization of the
   heat removal system and the core structure is required, in order to
   obtain an adequate heavy metal loading and to provide effective cooling
   capability. The single channel MATLAB model provides a simple tool to
   evaluate the steady state conditions for the coolant and the fuel plate
   and the effects of the power distribution; sensitivity studies on the
   main design parameters of the fuel element are performed. A RELAP5-3D
   single channel model is developed for the validation and comparison with
   the MATLAB model; this model is the starting point for the development
   of a full core model, enabling the study of transients. A one-third fuel
   assembly model is then analyzed, consisting of six fuel plates and
   modeling the heat conduction of graphite through RELAP5-3D conduction
   enclosures. Since the assembly model is not suitable for the
   implementation in a full core model with the same level of detail,
   several simplifications have been evaluated, involving the modeling of
   the plate through a single heat structure and the modeling of different
   plates through a single plate. A SCALE model of the fuel assembly was
   developed for the evaluation of the reactivity feedback and the power
   distribution in the core. The results from the neutronic evaluations and
   the assembly model were implemented in a full core model, involving the
   core, the main reactor structures, the cooling system and the safety
   system (DRACS). The RELAP5-3D core model was used for the evaluation of
   the steady state conditions and the effects of a loss of forced cooling
   accident (LOFC). (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {{121-130}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A new model for the complex dielectric constant of aqueous ammonia
   (NH4OH) under conditions characteristic of the jovian clouds has been
   developed. The new model is based on laboratory measurements in the
   frequency range between 2 and 8.5 GHz for ammonia concentrations of
   0-8.5\% by volume and temperatures between 274 and 297 K. The new model
   is based on the Meissner and Wentz (Meissner, T., Wentz, F.J. {[}2004].
   IEEE Trans. Geosci. Rem. Sens. 42, 1836-1849) model of the complex
   dielectric constant of pure water but contains corrections for dissolved
   ammonia. Assuming Raleigh scattering, these measurements are applied to
   a cloud attenuation model to calculate the range of opacity of the
   jovian aqueous ammonia clouds. These measurements will improve our
   understanding of the data collected by the Juno microwave radiometer
   (MWR) by better characterizing the absorption properties of the aqueous
   ammonia present in the jovian atmosphere.
   The new model has been validated for temperatures up to 313 K, and may
   be consistently used for the expected conditions for aqueous clouds in
   all of the outer planets. The model fits 60.26\% of all laboratory
   measurements within 2-sigma uncertainty. Descriptions of the
   experimental setups, uncertainties associated with the laboratory
   measurements, the model fitting process, the new model, and its
   application to approximating jovian cloud opacity are provided. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Non-cooperative localization is an important class of applications with
   the goal of detecting and tracking objects without their explicit
   participation. Recognizing that these objects will attenuate any radio
   signals that pass through them, recent works have proposed using the
   received signal strength (RSS) measurements from networks of portable
   wireless devices to detect, localize, and track objects through radio
   frequency (RF) tomography. Because the effects of these objects on radio
   signals can be relatively small, accurate radio propagation models are
   essential to the accuracy and reliability of these methods. Despite
   their critical importance, only limited work has been done to develop
   and test such models. In this paper, we describe the RF tomography
   problem in detail, comparing both existing and novel shadowing models
   analytically. We design an RF tomography testbed and describe the
   techniques used to conduct field test measurements. We present the
   experimental results from our RF tomography testbed comparing several
   different shadowing models. Further, we present the results of applying
   the different shadowing models to RSS measurements obtained in a field
   test and evaluate how well each model approximates the radio propagation
   experienced during our test.}},

   induce hardness. In addition, we propose a simple heuristic algorithm,
   provide its worst-case performance bounds, and demonstrate that the

Abstract = {{High thermostability is required for alkaline alpha -amylases to
   maintain high catalytic activity under the harsh conditions used in
   textile production. In this study, we attempted to improve the
   thermostability of an alkaline alpha-amylase from Alkalimonas
   amylolytica through in silico rational design and systems engineering of
   disulfide bridges in the catalytic domain. Specifically, 7 residue pairs
   (P35-G426, Q107-G167, G116-Q120, A147-W160, G233-V265, A332-G370, and
   R436-M480) were chosen as engineering targets for disulfide bridge
   formation, and the respective residues were replaced with cysteines.
   Three single disulfide bridge mutants-P35C-G426C, G116C-Q120C, and
   R436C-M480C-of the 7 showed significantly enhanced thermostability.
   Combinational mutations were subsequently assessed, and the triple
   mutant-P35C-G426C/ G116C-Q120C/ R436C-M480C showed a 6-fold increase in
   half-life at 60 degrees C and a 5.2 degrees C increase in melting
   temperature compared with the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, other
   biochemical properties of this mutant also improved: the optimum
   temperature increased from 50 degrees C to 55 degrees C, the optimum pH
   shifted from 9.5 to 10.0, the stable pH range extended from 7.0 to 11.0
   to 6.0 to 12.0, and the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m) increased from
   1.8 x 10(4) to 2.4 x 10(4) liters/g . min. The possible mechanism
   responsible for these improvements was explored through comparative
   analysis of the model structures of wild-type and mutant enzymes. The
   disulfide bridge engineering strategy used in this work may be applied
   to improve the thermostability of other industrial enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains KS and RC grow with 1,2-dichloropropane
   (1,2-D) as an electron acceptor in enrichment cultures derived from
   hydrocarbon-contaminated and pristine river sediments, respectively.
   Transcription, expression, enzymatic, and PCR analyses implicated the
   reductive dehalogenase gene dcpA in 1,2-D dichloroelimination to propene
   and inorganic chloride. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses
   demonstrated a D. mccartyi cell increase during growth with 1,2-D and
   suggested that both D. mccartyi strains carried a single dcpA gene copy
   per genome. D. mccartyi strain RC and strain KS produced 1.8 x 10(7) +/-
   0.1 x 10(7) and 1.4 x 10(7) +/- 0.5 x 10(7) cells per mu mol of propene
   formed, respectively. The dcpA gene was identified in
   1,2-D-to-propene-dechlorinating microcosms established with sediment
   samples collected from different geographical locations in Europe and
   North and South America. Clone library analysis revealed two distinct
   dcpA phylogenetic clusters, both of which were captured by the dcpA
   gene-targeted qPCR assay, suggesting that the qPCR assay is useful for
   site assessment and bioremediation monitoring at 1,2-D-contaminated
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Noting the abundance and importance of collagen as a biomaterial, we
   have developed a facile method for the production of a dense fibrillar
   extracellular matrix mimicking collagen-elastin hybrids with tunable
   mechanical properties. Through the use of excimer-laser technology, we
   have optimized conditions for the ablation of collagen lamellae without
   denaturation of protein, maintenance of fibrillar ultrastructure and
   preservation of native D-periodicity. Strengths of collagen-elastin
   hybrids ranged from 0.6 to 13 MPa, elongation at break from 9 to 70\%
   and stiffness from 2.9 to 94 MPa, allowing for the design of a wide
   variety of tissue specific scaffolds. Further, large (centimeter scale)
   lamellae can be fabricated and embedded with recombinant elastin to
   generate collagen-elastin hybrids. Exposed collagen in hybrids act as
   cell adhesive sites for rat mesenchymal stem cells that conform to
   ablate waveforms. The ability to modulate these features allows for the
   generation of a class of biopolymers that can architecturally and
   physiologically replicate native tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Cranes are commonly used to swing wrecking balls that demolish unwanted
   buildings and other structures. The crane operator moves the machine
   back and forth to increase the wrecking ball swing and then attempts to
   direct the swinging ball at the desired point of impact. By increasing
   the oscillation, the wrecking ball has more damaging force at impact.
   The rudimentary control interface, the sluggish dynamic response of the
   crane, and the limited field of view make this a challenging problem for
   the human operator. Although shaping human operator commands has
   traditionally been used to reduce oscillation, a related design process
   can be used to develop oscillation-amplifying commands. This paper
   presents such a command-shaping method that aids the operator in
   maximizing the swing of a crane payload. The effectiveness of the
   command shapers is verified through numerous simulations and
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{To recapitulate the in vivo environment and create neo-organoids that
   replace lost or damaged tissue requires the engineering of devices,
   which provide appropriate biophysical cues. To date, bioreactors for
   cartilage tissue engineering have focused primarily on biomechanical
   stimulation. There is a significant need for improved devices for
   articular cartilage tissue engineering capable of simultaneously
   applying multiple biophysical (electrokinetic and mechanical) stimuli.
   We have developed a novel high-throughput magneto-mechanostimulation
   bioreactor, capable of applying static and time-varying magnetic fields,
   as well as multiple and independently adjustable mechanical loading
   regimens. The device consists of an array of 18 individual stations,
   each of which uses contactless magnetic actuation and has an integrated
   Hall Effect sensing system, enabling the real-time measurements of
   applied field, force, and construct thickness, and hence, the indirect
   measurement of construct mechanical properties. Validation tests showed
   precise measurements of thickness, within 14m of gold standard calliper
   measurements; further, applied force was measured to be within 0.04N of
   desired force over a half hour dynamic loading, which was repeatable
   over a 3-week test period. Finally, construct material properties
   measured using the bioreactor were not significantly different (p=0.97)
   from those measured using a standard materials testing machine. We
   present a new method for articular cartilage-specific bioreactor design,
   integrating combinatorial magneto-mechanostimulation, which is very
   attractive from functional and cost viewpoints.}},

Abstract = {{Cellobiose is a major intermediate from cellulase hydrolysis of
   pretreated plant biomass. Engineering biocatalysts for direct use of
   cellobiose could eliminate the need for exogenous beta-glucosidase.
   Additionally, rapid removal of cellobiose in a simultaneous
   saccharification and fermentation facilitates enzymatic hydrolysis as
   cellobiose is a potent inhibitor for cellulases. We report here improved
   cellobiose utilization by engineering Escherichia coli to assimilate the
   disaccharide both hydrolytically and phosphorolytically (shorter
   fermentation time). Additionally, we demonstrate that engineering
   intracellular cellobiose utilization circumvents catabolite repression
   allowing simultaneous fermentation of xylose and cellobiose. Using
   meso-2,3-butanediol as model product, we further demonstrate that the
   accelerated carbon metabolism led to improved product formation (higher
   titers and shorter fermentation times), illustrating the utility of the
   engineered biocatalysts in biorefinery applications.}},

Title = {{17Beta-Estradiol Promotes Aggressive Laryngeal Cancer Through

Journal = {{HORMONES \& CANCER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-32}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{17 beta-estradiol (E-2) plays a key role in tumorigenesis by enhancing
   cell survivability and metastasis through its cytoplasmic receptors.
   Recently, a variant of estrogen receptor alpha, ER alpha 36 has been
   implicated as a substantial mediator of E-2's proliferative and
   antiapoptotic effects through rapid membrane-associated signaling, and
   cancers previously regarded as hormone-independent due to the absence of
   traditional receptors, may in fact be susceptible to E-2. Despite rising
   from a secondary sex organ and having a clear gender disposition,
   laryngeal cancer is not uniformly accepted as hormone dependent, even in
   the face of compelling evidence of E-2 responsiveness(.) The aim of this
   study was to further elucidate the role of E-2 in the tumorigenesis of
   laryngeal cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. ER alpha 36 presence was
   evaluated in membranes of the laryngeal carcinoma cell line, Hep2, as
   well as in laryngeal tumor samples. In vitro ER alpha 36 was found to
   mediate rapid activation of protein kinase C and phospholipase D by E-2,
   leading to increased proliferation and protection against
   chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in response to E-2
   activation of ER alpha 36, an upregulation of angiogenic and metastatic
   factors was observed. Clinical analysis of laryngeal tumors revealed a
   similar association between the amount of ER alpha 36 and VEGF and
   indicated a role in lymph node metastasis. These findings present
   compelling evidence of ER alpha 36-dependent E-2 signaling in laryngeal
   cancer. Thus, targeting ER alpha 36 may reduce the deleterious effects
   of E-2 in laryngeal cancer, ultimately suggesting the importance of
   antiestrogen therapy or the production of novel drugs that specifically
   target ER alpha 36.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we discover the parallelism of the forward/backward
   substitutions (FBS) for two cases and thus propose an efficient
   preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm with the modified incomplete

   GPUMICPCGA, the following are distinct characteristics: (1) the vector
   operations are optimized by grouping several vector operations into
   single kernels, (2) a new kernel of inner product and a new kernel of
   the sparse matrix-vector multiplication with high optimization are
   presented, and (3) an efficient parallel implementation of FBS on the
   GPU (GPUFBS) for two cases are suggested. Numerical results show that
   our proposed kernels outperform the corresponding ones presented in
   CUBLAS or CUSPARSE, and GPUFBS is almost 3 times faster than the
   implementation of FBS using the CUSPARSE library. Furthermore,
   GPUMICPCGA has better behavior than its counterpart implemented by the

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to investigate the quality of
   on-plot piped water and rainwater at the point of consumption in an area
   with rapidly expanding coverage of improved' water sources.
   MethodsCross-sectional study of 914 peri-urban households in Kandal
   Province, Cambodia, between July-August 2011. We collected data from all
   households on water management, drinking water quality and factors
   potentially related to post-collection water contamination. Drinking
   water samples were taken directly from a subsample of household taps
   (n=143), stored tap water (n=124), other stored water (n=92) and treated
   stored water (n=79) for basic water quality analysis for Escherichia
   coli and other parameters.
   ResultsHousehold drinking water management was complex, with different
   sources used at any given time and across seasons. Rainwater was the
   most commonly used drinking water source. Households mixed different
   water sources in storage containers, including improved' with
   unimproved' sources. Piped water from taps deteriorated during storage
   (P<0.0005), from 520cfu/100ml (coefficient of variation, CV: 5.7) E.coli
   to 1100cfu/100ml (CV: 3.4). Stored non-piped water (primarily rainwater)
   had a mean E.coli count of 1500cfu/100ml (CV: 4.1), not significantly
   different from stored piped water (P=0.20). Microbial contamination of
   stored water was significantly associated with observed storage and
   handling practices, including dipping hands or receptacles in water
   (P<0.005), and having an uncovered storage container (P=0.052).
   ConclusionsThe microbial quality of improved' water sources in our study
   area was not maintained at the point of consumption, possibly due to a
   combination of mixing water sources at the household level, unsafe
   storage and handling practices, and inadequately treated piped-to-plot
   water. These results have implications for refining international
   targets for safe drinking water access as well as the assumptions
   underlying global burden of disease estimates, which posit that
   improved' sources pose minimal risks of diarrhoeal diseases.
   ObjectifsAnalyser la qualite de l'eau provenant de robinets dans les

   MethodesUne etude transversale portant sur 914menages periurbains dans
   la province de Kandal, au Cambodge, entre juillet et aout 2011. Nous
   avons collecte des donnees dans tous les menages sur la gestion de
   l'eau, la qualite de l'eau de boisson et les facteurs potentiellement
   lies a la contamination apres la collecte de l'eau. Des echantillons
   d'eau potable ont ete collectes directement a partir d'un
   sous-echantillon de robinets des menages (n=143), de l'eau du robinet
   stockee (n=124), de l'eau stockee provenant d'autres sources (n=92) et
   de l'eau stockee traitee (n=79), pour l'analyse de base de la qualite de
   l'eau pour E. coli et d'autres parametres.
   ResultatsLa gestion de l'eau potable des menages etait complexe, avec
   differentes sources utilisees a chaque moment donne et selon les
   saisons. L'eau de pluie etait la source d'eau potable la plus couramment
   utilisee. Les menages melangeaient de l'eau provenant de sources
   differentes dans des recipients de stockage, y compris celles de sources
   << ameliorees >> et << non ameliorees >>. L'eau de robinets se
   deteriorait au cours du stockage (p<0,0005), avec des teneurs d'E. coli
   allant de 520 UFC/100ml (coefficient de variation, CV: 5,7) a 1100
   UFC/100ml (CV: 3,4). L'eau stockee provenant de sources autres que le
   robinet (principalement l'eau de pluie) avait une teneur moyenne en E.
   coli de 1500 UFC/100ml (CV: 4,1), ce qui n'est pas significativement
   different de l'eau de robinet stockee (p=0,20). La contamination
   microbienne de l'eau stockee etait significativement associee aux
   pratiques de stockage et de manipulation observees, y compris le
   trempage des mains ou des recipients dans l'eau (p<0,005) et le fait
   d'avoir un recipient de stockage non couvert (p=0,052).
   ConclusionsLa qualite microbienne des sources d'eau << ameliorees >>
   dans notre zone d'etude n'etait pas maintenue aux lieux de consommation,
   probablement en raison d'une combinaison du melange d'eau de sources
   differentes a l'echelle des menages, des pratiques de stockage et de
   manipulation a risque et d'eau de robinet des menages inadequatement
   traitee. Ces resultats ont des implications pour affiner les objectifs
   internationaux pour l'acces a l'eau potable ainsi que les hypotheses
   sous-jacentes sur les estimations de la charge mondiale des maladies,
   qui postulent que les sources << ameliorees >> posent des risques
   reduits de maladies diarrheiques.
   ObjetivosInvestigar la calidad del agua corriente y del agua de lluvia
   en el punto de consumo, en un area con una cobertura en rapida expansion
   de fuentes de agua mejoradas.
   MetodosEstudio croseccional de 914 hogares periurbanos en la Provincia
   de Kandal, Camboya, entre Julio-Agosto 2011. Hemos recogido datos de
   todos los hogares sobre el manejo del agua, la calidad del agua potable,
   y los factores potencialmente relacionados con la contaminacion del agua
   despues de su recoleccion. Las muestras del agua potable se tomaron
   directamente de una submuestra de grifos de los hogares (n=143), de agua
   corriente almacenada (n=124), de otra agua almacenada (n=92) y de agua
   almacenada tratada (n=79) y se les realizaron analisis basicos para
   E.coli y otros parametros.
   ResultadosEl manejo del agua potable de los hogares era complejo, con
   varias fuentes utilizadas al mismo tiempo y a lo largo de las
   estaciones. El agua de lluvia era la mas comunmente utilizada como
   fuente de agua para beber. Los hogares mezclaban en contenedores, para
   su almacenaje, agua proveniente de diferentes fuentes, incluyendo agua
   de fuentes mejoradas con agua de fuentes sin mejorar. El agua corriente
   obtenida a traves de los grifos se deterioraba durante su almacenaje
   (p<0.0005), de 520 ufc/100ml (coeficiente de variacion, CV: 5.7) E. coli
   a 1100 UFC/100ml (CV: 3.4). El agua almacenada que no provenia de la red
   de tuberias (principalmente agua de lluvia), tenia un conteo de E. coli
   de 1500 ufc/100ml (CV: 4.1), nada significativamente diferente al agua
   corriente almacenada (p=0.20). La contaminacion microbiana del agua
   almacenada estaba significativamente asociada con las practicas de
   almacenamiento y de manejo observadas, que incluian el introducir las
   manos o recipientes dentro del agua (p<0.005), o mantener el contenedor
   de almacenaje sin cubrir (p=0.052).
   ConclusionesLa calidad microbiana de las fuentes de agua mejoradas en
   nuestra area de estudio no se mantenia en el lugar de consumo,
   posiblemente debido a una combinacion de mezclar las fuentes de agua
   dentro del hogar, un almacenamiento y practicas de manejo poco seguras,
   y un agua corriente tratada inadecuadamente. Estos resultados tienen
   implicaciones a la hora de refinar los objetivos internacionales para el
   acceso a agua potable segura, al igual que los supuestos sobre los que
   se basan los calculos de la carga global de la enfermedad diarreica, que
   postulan que las fuentes mejoradas de agua plantean un riesgo minimo
   para la enfermedad diarreica.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flows and heat transfer of hydrocarbon fuels with endothermic
   pyrolysis play an important role in regenerative cooling of many flight
   vehicles and energy-conversion devices. In this paper, an approach to
   simplifying the global pyrolytic reaction mechanism of n-decane is
   proposed for problems with mild endothermic pyrolysis at supercritical
   pressures. The basic idea lies in the fact that the
   high-molecular-weight alkane or alkene components in a thermally
   decomposed n-decane mixture possess similar thermophysical properties
   and make only minor contributions to heat absorption; they can thus be
   grouped together and represented by a single light species. Numerical
   tests indicate that a reduced 12-species reaction mechanism for mild
   cracking of n-decane represents a reasonable choice in terms of model
   accuracy and efficiency. The reduced pyrolytic reaction mechanism is
   employed to study the effect of mild thermal decomposition of n-decane
   on turbulent convective heat transfer at supercritical pressures. The
   wall heat flux can be increased significantly at high fluid
   temperatures, due mainly to heat absorption resulting from endothermic
   pyrolytic reactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-electrochemical cells (or thermocells) convert thermal energy to
   electricity in continuous operation based on a balance of ion conduction
   and redox reactions at hot and cold electrodes. In this study, the

   dynamics, and electrokinetics in thermocells are presented and solved
   numerically using COMSOL. A parametric study is performed to explore the
   limitations and optimal cell dimensions for maximum energy conversion
   efficiency in thermocells. Series-stacking designs are demonstrated to
   have the potential to increase conversion efficiency by 100 \% compared
   to a single cell configuration. Natural convection is shown to
   significantly increase the conversion efficiency of thermocells with
   conventional aqueous electrolyte (0.4 M potassium ferri/ferrocyanide),
   by compressing the diffusive boundary layers. A flow cell thermocell
   design is also considered. Results reveal that the ohmic resistance of
   the electrolyte limits the energy conversion efficiency of this design.}},

Title = {{Development of an Experimentally Validated Analytical Model for Modular

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Modular bridge expansion joints (MBEJ) are large-capacity systems placed
   between two superstructure segments designed to provide safe joint
   crossing based on anticipated bridge movements. Locations of
   discontinuity in bridges are often recognized as weak links and
   therefore characterizing the behavior of expansion systems installed at
   deck joints under various excitations is critical to support the
   forecasting of bridge functionality. This paper presents the development
   of an analytical model representative of a common modular bridge
   expansion joint including its critical components, such as friction
   elements, equidistant devices, support bars, and center beams. The model
   is then validated through full-scale experimental testing of the joint.
   The results of this study offer a predictive model for the longitudinal
   motion of bridge joints excited through anticipated service or extreme
   events, which can be used to help determine local and global failure
   within the joint and make inferences as to how a bridge system could be
   affected. Such models provide a key step toward aiding design efforts,
   enabling more accurate specification of MBEJs, and supporting
   functionality-based risk assessment for bridges. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{A growing amount of scientific research is done in an open collaborative
   fashion, in projects sometimes referred to as ``crowd science{''},
   ``citizen science{''}, or ``networked science{''}. This paper seeks to
   gain a more systematic understanding of crowd science and to provide
   scholars with a conceptual framework and an agenda for future research.
   First, we briefly present three case examples that span different fields
   of science and illustrate the heterogeneity concerning what crowd
   science projects do and how they are organized. Second, we identify two
   fundamental elements that characterize crowd science projects - open
   participation and open sharing of intermediate inputs - and distinguish
   crowd science from other knowledge production regimes such as innovation
   contests or traditional ``Mertonian{''} science. Third, we explore
   potential knowledge-related and motivational benefits that crowd science
   offers over alternative organizational modes, and potential challenges
   it is likely to face. Drawing on prior research on the organization of
   problem solving, we also consider for what kinds of tasks particular
   benefits or challenges are likely to be most pronounced. We conclude by
   outlining an agenda for future research and by discussing implications
   for funding agencies and policy makers. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Kernel summations are a ubiquitous key computational bottleneck in many
   data analysis methods. In this paper, we attempt to marry, for the first
   time, the best relevant techniques in parallel computing, where kernel
   summations are in low dimensions, with the best general-dimension
   algorithms from the machine learning literature. We provide the first
   distributed implementation of kernel summation framework that can
   utilize: (i) various types of deterministic and probabilistic
   approximations that may be suitable for low and high-dimensional
   problems with a large number of data points; (ii) any multidimensional
   binary tree using both distributed memory and shared memory parallelism;
   and (iii) a dynamic load balancing scheme to adjust work imbalances
   during the computation. Our hybrid message passing interface
   (MPI)/OpenMP codebase has wide applicability in providing a general
   framework to accelerate the computation of many popular machine learning
   methods. Our experiments show scalability results for kernel density
   estimation on a synthetic ten-dimensional dataset containing over one
   billion points and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data up to

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{A simulation-based probabilistic strategy is developed to characterize
   the surface to bulk transition of high cycle fatigue failures dominated
   by primary inclusions. The probability of fatigue crack initiation in
   the surface region is calculated by computing the expected number of
   critical fatigue hot spots in this region. This is done by considering
   the probability of inclusion-matrix debonding and the fatigue crack
   initiation potency of partially-debonded inclusions for a given load
   ratio and stress amplitude.
   A case study is presented whereby the surface initiation probability is
   studied in uniaxial strain-controlled cyclic loading simulations of
   round smooth specimens of the fine grained powder metallurgy (PM)
   processed Ni-base superalloy IN100. The fatigue crack initiation potency
   of partially-debonded nonmetallic inclusions is assessed by calculating
   the Fatemi-Socie (FS) critical plane parameter from generalized plain
   strain crystal plasticity finite element simulations. Idealized
   spherical ceramic inclusions with homogeneous linear elastic isotropic
   material properties are considered to isolate the FS parameter
   sensitivity to inclusions' size, stress amplitude, and polycrystalline
   microstructure realization around the inclusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The modeling of heat transport for small length scales requires
   accounting for the physics of heat carrier transport such as the
   propagation, scattering, and relaxation of phonons. However, the models
   used to describe such phenomena are often too computationally expensive
   to model large domains where relevant system boundaries are far removed
   from the region where ballistic-diffusive phonon transport is dominant.
   To address the response of such systems to its far field thermal
   boundary conditions, a multiscale thermal model is needed to efficiently
   account for transport phenomena in each domain. In this work, a
   multiscale thermal modeling approach is presented where the transport of
   phonons is treated with a Finite Volume Discrete Ordinates Model (FVDOM)
   solution to the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) which is
   embedded in a region treated by diffusive thermal transport. The
   approach shows that it is possible to create a coupled multiscale model
   where the boundary conditions of the FVDOM model are derived from the
   diffusive transport model. The limitations of the method and the key
   parameters for accurate modeling are investigated and discussed. The
   final model is used to explore the impact of the size of heat generation
   regions with respect to the overall domain size on the peak temperature.
   The results show that by using such a model it is possible to capture
   the ballistic-diffusive transport in pertinent areas of a domain that is
   mostly dominated by diffusive transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries suffer from inherent thermal limitations (i.e.,
   capacity fade and thermal runaway); thus, it is critical to understand
   heat generation experienced in the batteries under normal operation. In
   the current study, reversible and irreversible electrochemical heat
   generation rates were measured experimentally on a small commercially
   available C/LiFePO4 lithium-ion battery designed for high-rate
   applications. The battery was tested over a wide range of temperatures
   (10-60 degrees C) and discharge and charge rates (similar to C/4-5C) to
   elucidate their effects. Two samples were tested in a specially designed
   wind tunnel to maintain constant battery surface temperature within a
   maximum variation of +/- 0.88 degrees C. A data normalization technique
   was employed to account for the observed capacity fade, which was
   largest at the highest rates. The heat rate was shown to increase with
   both increasing rate and decreasing temperature, and the reversible heat
   rate was shown to be significant even at the highest rate and
   temperature (7.4\% at 5C and 55 degrees C). Results from cycling the
   battery using a dynamic power profile also showed that constant-current
   data predict the dynamic performance data well. In addition, the
   reversible heat rate in the dynamic simulation was shown to be
   significant, especially for charge-depleting HEV applications. (C) 2013

   performance of ester-crosslinked hollow fiber membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{451}},
Pages = {{1-9}},

Abstract = {{High-performance ester-crosslinked hollow fiber membranes were evaluated
   for sensitivity to aggressive hydrocarbon and water impurities. The
   hollow fiber samples show improved separation productivity and
   hydrocarbon-induced antiplasticization resistance under extremely
   challenging feed conditions in comparison to previously reported cases.
   The CO2 permeance was improved from 10 GPU to 50 GPU with a CO2/CH4
   selectivity of 28 in testing at an 800 psi 50/50 CO2/CH4 feed with 1000
   ppm(molar) toluene, 35 degrees C. Moreover, membrane samples with
   different skin layer thicknesses show significantly different
   sensitivities to toluene. The thinner skinned samples are hypothesized
   to have higher fractional free volume (FFV) and hence show more tendency
   to antiplasticize when exposed to impurities as compared to thicker
   skinned samples. The high separation performance of crosslinked hollow
   fibers was fully recovered after removing the high-level contaminants,
   including toluene and heptane, and showed negligible changes over 100h
   exposure to a 600 psi 50/50 CO2/CH4 feed with 750 ppm toluene,
   indicating a strong stability against contaminants. Furthermore,
   exposure to 101 ppm(molar) water impurity did not cause an apparent
   subsequent change in the separation properties. The excellent properties
   in the presence of hydrocarbon and water contaminants demonstrate that
   ester-crosslinked hollow fiber membranes are attractive for natural gas
   purification, even under more aggressive operating conditions. (C) 2013

Title = {{A unified internal state variable material model for inelastic
   deformation and microstructure evolution in SS304}},

Abstract = {{At a fundamental level, the thermomechanical response of metals during
   inelastic deformation is governed by dislocation mechanics and
   associated microstructure evolution. However, the most commonly used
   material models in severe plastic deformation processes such as metal
   machining and forming are phenomenological (e.g. Johnson-Cook) or
   semi-phenomenological (e.g. Zerilli-Armstrong) and do not account for
   the dependence of material flow stress on dislocation and microstructure
   evolution processes in a unified manner. The latter negatively affects
   the accuracy and range of applicability of process simulation models.
   This paper presents a unified material model that explicitly accounts
   for dislocation and grain size evolution processes associated with
   inelastic deformation. The corresponding microstructure evolution laws
   are formulated and integrated into the constitutive model, which is
   derived from thermal activation theory and is an additive decomposition
   of athermal and thermal components representing the effects of long- and
   short-range obstacles, respectively. The unified model is seen to
   compare well with experimental data for the deformation of SS304 alloy.
   Different aspects of inelastic deformation including thermal softening
   and sensitivity, rate hardening and sensitivity, and strain hardening
   rate are reproduced quite accurately by the unified model. The unified
   model is further used to isolate the contribution of various
   microstructural features and it is found that the stress component
   representing the interaction of individual dislocations with dislocation
   forests accounts for the major contribution to the overall flow stress
   in SS304. The thermal stress does not vary with strain while the
   athermal stress varies with strain in addition to tracing the
   microstructure evolution. Moreover, the variation of both thermal and
   athermal stresses are analyzed as a function of the Zener-Hollomon
   parameter. It is seen that the thermal stress vanishes entirely below a
   critical value of the Zener-Hollomon parameter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Novel magnetic hydrogel beads (m-CS/PVA/CCNFs), consisting of
   carboxylated cellulose nanofibrils (CCNFs), amine-functionalized
   magnetite nanoparticles and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) blended chitosan

   TGA techniques were applied to investigate the structure of the hydrogel
   materials. The magnetic hydrogels were employed as absorbents for
   removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solutions and the fundamental
   adsorption behavior was studied. Experimental results revealed that the
   m-CS/PVA/CCNFs hydrogels exhibit higher adsorption capacity with the
   value of 171.0 mg/g, and the carboxylate groups on the CCNFs surface
   play an important role in Pb(II) adsorption. Moreover, adsorption
   isotherm data were reliably described by the Langmuir model and the
   adsorption kinetics closely followed pseudo-second order model.
   Additionally, the Pb(II)loaded m-CS/PVA/CCNFs hydrogels could be easily
   regenerated in weak acid solution and the adsorption effectiveness of
   90\% can be maintained after the 4 cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Rainfall-runoff modelling at ungauged catchments often involves the
   transfer of calibrated model parameters from donor' gauged catchments.
   However, in any rainfall-runoff model, some parameters tend to be more
   sensitive to the objective function, whereas others are insensitive over
   their entire feasible range. In this paper, we analyse the effect of
   selectively transferring sensitive versus insensitive parameters on
   streamflow predictability at ungauged catchments. We develop a simple
   daily time-step rainfall-runoff model {[}exponential bucket hydrologic
   model (EXP-HYDRO)] and calibrate it at 756 catchments within the
   continental USA. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of Q (NS) is used as the
   objective function. The model simulates satisfactorily at 323 catchments
   (NS>0.6), most of which are located in the eastern part of the USA,
   along the Rocky Mountain Range, and near the western Pacific coast. Of
   the six calibration parameters, only three parameters are found to be
   sensitive to NS. Two of these parameters control the hydrograph
   recession behaviour of a catchment, and the third parameter controls the
   snowmelt rate. We find that when only sensitive parameters are
   transferred, model performance at ungauged catchments is almost at par
   with that of transferring all six parameters. Conversely, the transfer
   of only insensitive parameters results in a significant deterioration in
   model performance. Results suggest that streamflow predictability at
   ungauged catchments using rainfall-runoff models is largely dependent on
   the transfer of a small subset of parameters. We recommend that, in any
   modelling framework, such parameters should be identified and further
   characterized to better understand the information controlling
   streamflow predictability at ungauged catchments. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{We investigate the failure mechanisms of load-sharing complex systems.
   The system is composed of multiple nodes or components whose failures
   are determined based on the interaction of their respective strengths

   of a component to share its load with its neighbors when needed. We
   focus on two distinct mechanisms to model the interaction between
   components' strengths and loads. The failure mechanisms of these two
   models demonstrate temporal scaling phenomena, phase transitions, and
   multiple distinct failure modes excited by extremal dynamics. For
   critical ranges of parameters the models demonstrate power-law and
   exponential failure patterns. We identify the similarities and
   differences between the two mechanisms and the implications of our
   results for the failure mechanisms of complex systems in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to design artificial extracellular matrices as
   cell-instructive scaffolds has opened the door to technologies capable
   of studying the fate of cells in vitro and to guiding tissue repair in
   vivo. One main component of the design of artificial extracellular
   matrices is the incorporation of biochemical cues to guide cell
   phenotype and multicellular organization. The extracellular matrix (ECM)
   is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of proteins that present a
   variety of spatially discrete signals to residing cell populations. In
   contrast, most engineered ECMs do not mimic this heterogeneity. In
   recent years, photo-deprotection has been used to spatially immobilize
   signals. However, this approach has been limited mostly to small
   peptides. Here we combine photo-deprotection with enzymatic reaction to
   achieve spatially controlled immobilization of active bioactive signals
   that range from small molecules to large proteins. A peptide substrate
   for transglutaminase factor XIII (FXIIIa) was caged with a
   photo-deprotectable group, which was then immobilized to the bulk of a
   cell-compatible hydrogel. With focused light, the substrate can be
   deprotected and used to immobilize patterned bioactive signals. This
   approach offers an innovative strategy to immobilize delicate bioactive
   signals, such as growth factors, without loss of activity and enables in
   situ cell manipulation of encapsulated cells.}},

Abstract = {{H2O, CO2, SO2, O-2, H-2, H2S, HCl, chlorinated hydrocarbons, NO, and
   other trace gases were evolved during pyrolysis of two mudstone samples
   acquired by the Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay within Gale crater,
   Mars. H2O/OH-bearing phases included 2:1 phyllosilicate(s), bassanite,
   akaganeite, and amorphous materials. Thermal decomposition of carbonates
   and combustion of organic materials are candidate sources for the CO2.
   Concurrent evolution of O-2 and chlorinated hydrocarbons suggests the
   presence of oxychlorine phase(s). Sulfides are likely sources for
   sulfur-bearing species. Higher abundances of chlorinated hydrocarbons in
   the mudstone compared with Rocknest windblown materials previously
   analyzed by Curiosity suggest that indigenous martian or meteoritic
   organic carbon sources may be preserved in the mudstone; however, the
   carbon source for the chlorinated hydrocarbons is not definitively of
   martian origin.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its high carrier mobility, broadband absorption, and fast
   response time, the semi-metallic graphene is attractive for
   optoelectronics. Another two-dimensional semiconducting material
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is also known as light-sensitive. Here we
   show that a large-area and continuous MoS2 monolayer is achievable using
   a CVD method and graphene is transferable onto MoS2. We demonstrate that
   a photodetector based on the graphene/MoS2 heterostructure is able to
   provide a high photogain greater than 108. Our experiments show that the
   electron-hole pairs are produced in the MoS2 layer after light
   absorption and subsequently separated across the layers. Contradictory
   to the expectation based on the conventional built-in electric field
   model for metal-semiconductor contacts, photoelectrons are injected into
   the graphene layer rather than trapped in MoS2 due to the presence of a
   perpendicular effective electric field caused by the combination of the
   built-in electric field, the applied electrostatic field, and charged
   impurities or adsorbates, resulting in a tuneable photoresponsivity.}},

Title = {{Control of dynamic foot-ground interactions in male and female soccer
   athletes: Females exhibit reduced dexterity and higher limb stiffness

Abstract = {{Controlling dynamic interactions between the lower limb and ground is
   important for skilled locomotion and may influence injury risk in
   athletes. It is well known that female athletes sustain anterior
   cruciate ligament (ACL) tears at higher rates than male athletes, and
   exhibit lower extremity biomechanics thought to increase injury risk
   during sport maneuvers. The purpose of this study was to examine whether
   lower extremity dexterity (LED) - the ability to dynamically control
   endpoint force magnitude and direction as quantified by compressing an
   unstable spring with the lower limb at submaximal forces - is a
   potential contributing factor to the ``at-risk{''} movement behavior
   exhibited by female athletes. We tested this hypothesis by comparing
   LED-test performance and single-limb drop jump biomechanics between 14
   female and 14 male high school soccer players. We found that female
   athletes exhibited reduced LED-test performance (p=0.001) and higher
   limb stiffness during landing (p=0.008) calculated on average within 51
   ms of foot contact. Females also exhibited higher coactivation at the
   ankle (p=0.001) and knee (p=0.02) before landing. No sex differences in
   sagittal plane joint angles and center of mass velocity at foot contact
   were observed. Collectively, our results raise the possibility that the
   higher leg stiffness observed in females during landing is an
   anticipatory behavior due in part to reduced lower extremity dexterity.
   The reduced lower extremity dexterity and compensatory stiffening
   strategy may contribute to the heightened risk of ACL injury in this
   population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous
   composite plates with elastic moduli and layered geometries varying
   through the thickness direction and periodically along the in-plane
   directions. By using the concept of decomposition of the rotation
   tensor, we first formulate the three-dimensional elastic problem in an
   intrinsic form for application to the geometrically nonlinear problem.
   The variational asymptotic method is then exercised, leading to
   simultaneous homogenization and dimensional reduction to construct an
   effective and simple model suitable for plates with in-plane
   periodicity. In particular, having obtained the refinement terms up to
   the second order, we develop a refined plate model, namely a generalized
   Reissner-Mindlin model that is capable of capturing the transverse shear
   deformations. In order to deal with realistic and complex plate
   geometries and constituent materials efficiently and conveniently, the
   proposed model is implemented into a single unified formulation suitable
   for incorporation into a commercial analysis package. Numerical results
   computed herein for a few examples are compared to similar results
   available in the literature to demonstrate the application and
   performance of the present model. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{Tethered-particle motion experiments do not require expensive or
   technically complex hardware, and increasing numbers of researchers are
   adopting this methodology to investigate the topological effects of
   agents that act on the tethering polymer or the characteristics of the
   polymer itself. These investigations depend on accurate measurement and
   interpretation of changes in the effective length of the tethering
   polymer (often DNA). However, the bead size, tether length, and buffer
   affect the confined diffusion of the bead in this experimental system.
   To evaluate the effects of these factors, improved measurements to
   calibrate the two-dimensional range of motion (excursion) versus DNA
   length were carried out. Microspheres of 160 or 240 nm in radius were
   tethered by DNA molecules ranging from 225 to 3477 basepairs in length
   in aqueous buffers containing 100 mM potassium glutamate and 8 mM MgCl2
   or 10 mM Tris-HCl and 200 mM KCl, with or without 0.5\% Tween added to
   the buffer, and the motion was recorded. Different buffers altered the
   excursion of beads on identical DNA tethers. Buffer with only 10 mM NaCl
   and > 5 mM magnesium greatly reduced excursion. Glycerol added to
   increase viscosity slowed confined diffusion of the tethered beads but
   did not change excursion. The confined-diffusion coefficients for all
   tethered beads were smaller than those expected for freely diffusing
   beads and decreased for shorter tethers. Tethered-particle motion is a
   sensitive framework for diffusion experiments in which small beads on
   long leashes most closely resemble freely diffusing, untethered beads.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic and diagnostic nanomaterials are being intensely studied for
   several diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis. However, the
   exact mechanism by which nanomedicines accumulate at targeted sites
   remains a topic of investigation, especially in the context of
   atherosclerotic disease. Models to accurately predict transvascular
   permeation of nanomedicines are needed to aid in design optimization.
   Here we show that an endothelialized microchip with controllable
   permeability can be used to probe nanoparticle translocation across an
   endothelial cell layer. To validate our in vitro model, we studied
   nanoparticle translocation in an in vivo rabbit model of atherosclerosis
   using a variety of preclinical and clinical imaging methods. Our results
   reveal that the translocation of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles
   across the atherosclerotic endothelium is dependent on microvascular
   permeability. These results were mimicked with our microfluidic chip,
   demonstrating the potential utility of the model system.}},

Abstract = {{Structured xylan-based hydrogels, reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals
   (CNCs), have successfully been prepared from water suspensions by
   cross-linking during freeze-casting. In order to induce cross-linking
   during the solidification/sublimation operation, xylan was first
   oxidized using sodium periodate to introduce dialdehydes. The oxidized
   xylan was then mixed with CNCs after which the suspension was frozen
   unidirectionally in order to control the ice crystal formation and by
   that the pore morphology of the material. Finally the ice crystal
   templates were removed by freeze-drying. During the freeze-casting
   process hemiacetal bonds are formed between the aldehyde groups and
   hydroxyl groups, either on other xylan molecules or on CNCs, which
   cross-links the system. The proposed cross-linking reaction was
   confirmed by using cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS)
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The pore morphology of
   the obtained materials was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The materials were also tested for compressive strength
   properties, both in dry and water swollen state. All together this study
   describes a novel combined freeze-casting/cross-linking process which
   enables fabrication of nanoreinforced biopolymer-based hydrogels with
   controlled porosity and 3-D architecture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Joint optimization of product family configuration and scaling design by

Abstract = {{Product family design is generally characterized by two types of
   approaches: module-based and scale-based. While the former aims to
   enable product variety based on module configuration, the latter is to
   variegate product design by scaling up or down certain design
   parameters. The prevailing practice is to treat module configuration and
   scaling design as separate decisions or aggregate two design problems as
   a single-level, all-in-one optimization problem. In practice,
   optimization of scaling variables is always enacted within a specific
   modular platform; and meanwhile an optimal module configuration depends
   on how design parameters are to be scaled. The key challenge is how to
   deal with explicitly the coupling of these two design optimization
   problems.
   This paper formulates a Stackelberg game theoretic model for joint
   optimization of product family configuration and scaling design, in
   which a bilevel decision structure reveals coupled decision making
   between module configuration and parameter scaling. A bilevel mixed 0-1
   non-linear programming model is developed and solved, comprising an
   upper-level optimization problem and a lower-level optimization problem.
   The upper level seeks for an optimal configuration of modules and module
   attributes by maximizing the shared surplus of an entire product family.
   The lower level entails parametric optimization of attribute values for
   optimal technical performance of each individual module. A case study of
   electric motors demonstrates that the bilevel joint optimization model
   excels in leveraging optimal scaling in conjunction with optimal module
   configuration, which is advantageous over the existing paradigm of
   product family scaling design that cannot change the product family
   configuration. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PM2.5, as one of the criteria pollutants regulated in the U.S. and other
   countries due to its adverse health impacts, contains more than hundreds
   of organic pollutants with different sources and formation mechanisms.
   Daytime and nighttime PM2.5 samples from the August Mini-Intensive Gas
   and Aerosol Campaign (AMIGAS) in the southeastern U.S. were collected
   during summer 2008 at one urban site and one rural site, and were
   analyzed for organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble
   organic carbon (WSOC), and various individual organic compounds
   including some important tracers for carbonaceous aerosol sources by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. Most samples exhibited higher daytime
   OC concentration, while higher nighttime OC was found in a few events at
   the urban site. Sources, formation mechanisms and composition of organic
   aerosol are complicated and results of this study showed that it
   exhibited distinct diurnal variations. With detailed organic tracer
   information, sources contributing to particulate DC were identified:
   higher nighttime OC concentration occurring in several occasions was
   mainly contributed by the increasing primary emissions at night,
   especially diesel exhaust and biomass burning; whereas sources
   responsible for higher daytime DC concentration included secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA) formation (e.g., cis-pinonic acid and non-biomass
   burning WSOC) together with traffic emissions especially gasoline engine
   exhaust. Primary tracers from combustion related sources such as EC,
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and hopanes and steranes were
   significantly higher at the urban site with an urban to rural ratio
   between 5 and 8. However, this urban-rural difference for secondary
   components was less significant, indicating a relatively homogeneous
   distribution of SOA spatially. We found cholesterol concentrations, a
   typical tracer for meat cooking, were consistently higher at the rural
   site especially during the daytime, suggesting the likely additional
   sources for this tracer at rural site and that it should be used with
   caution as meat cooking tracer in rural areas in the future. (C) 2013

   both the nucleation and growth steps. In the first part of this review,
   we discuss the critical components needed for oxidative etching, as well
   as methods for enabling or preventing oxidative etching in a synthesis.
   We then present and analyze a number of interesting experimental
   observations caused by oxidative etching. In the following sections, we
   highlight four major applications of oxidative etching in the synthesis
   of metal nanocrystals, with regards to experimental controls over the
   crystallinity, size, shape, morphology, and growth kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Isoindigo (iI) has proven successful as an electron-accepting building
   block for the preparation of electroactive materials for organic
   electronics. Its high yielding and scalable synthesis has enabled the
   rapid development of a large number of molecular and polymeric iI-based
   materials with remarkable physical properties. This perspective provides
   an overview of the fundamental properties of isoindigo and summarizes
   the progress in the development of new materials for varied electronic
   applications during the last 3 years, focusing in particular on organic
   photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs). The
   fundamental electronic properties of isoindigo are discussed in the
   context of the substitution pattern effect (5,5' vs 6,6') on the
   frontier orbitals energies and optical properties. The development of
   molecular systems in the 6,6'-iI configuration for OPVs is examined with
   an emphasis on molecular design for improved electronic properties thank
   to fine-tuning of the active layer morphology via crystallization
   control. Numerous copolymers of iI have been reported, with both
   electron-rich and electron-poor comonomers. The homopolymer of isoindigo
   displays electron-accepting and electrochromic properties and serves as
   a polymeric surrogate for fullerenes in all-polymer solar cells. The
   copolymers' absorption profiles span the entire visible spectrum into
   the near-infrared, up to 900 nm. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells based
   on iI copolymers have reached up to 6.3\% efficiency. While the effect
   of processing additives and cell architecture are important, the unique
   electronic properties of iI polymers also provide useful insight on
   energetic losses within blends with fullerenes. Selected copolymers also
   perform highly in air-stable field effect transistors, with p-type
   mobilities exceeding 3 cm(2)/(V s). New concepts concerning the effect
   of backbone curvature and side-chain branching or polarity have been
   investigated using iI copolymers. Additionally, some all-acceptor
   copolymers display n-type mobility. As the design of iI materials
   evolves, structural modifications of the iI core emerge, targeting
   ambipolar charge transport and enhanced backbone planarity. Overall,
   isoindigo provides the field of organic electronics with impressive
   performance as well as a valuable platform for structure property
   relationship investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Cell patches are widely used for healing injuries on the surfaces or
   interfaces of tissues such as those of epidermis and myocardium. Here we
   report a novel type of porous scaffolds made of
   poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) for fabricating cell patches. The
   scaffolds have a single layer of spherical pores arranged in a unique
   hexagonal pattern and are therefore referred to as ``scaffolds with a
   hexagonal array of interconnected pores (SHAIPs){''}. SHAIPs contain
   both uniform pores and interconnecting windows that can facilitate the
   exchange of biomacromolecules, ensure homogeneous cell seeding, and
   promote cell migration. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we have
   created skeletal muscle patches with a thickness of approximately 150 pm
   using SHAIPs. The myoblasts seeded in the scaffolds maintained high
   viability and were able to differentiate into multi-nucleated myotubes.
   Moreover, neovasculature could efficiently develop into the patches upon
   subcutaneous implantation in vivo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{The initiation of chemical reaction in cold-rolled Ni/Al multilayered
   composites by shock compression is investigated numerically. A
   simplified approach is adopted that exploits the disparity between the
   reaction and shock loading timescales. The impact of shock compression
   is modeled using CTH simulations that yield pressure, strain, and
   temperature distributions within the composites due to the shock
   propagation. The resulting temperature distribution is then used as
   initial condition to simulate the evolution of the subsequent
   shock-induced mixing and chemical reaction. To this end, a reduced
   reaction model is used that expresses the local atomic mixing and heat
   release rates in terms of an evolution equation for a dimensionless time
   scale reflecting the age of the mixed layer. The computations are used
   to assess the effect of bilayer thickness on the reaction, as well as
   the impact of shock velocity and orientation with respect to the
   layering. Computed results indicate that initiation and evolution of the
   reaction are substantially affected by both the shock velocity and the
   bilayer thickness. In particular, at low impact velocity, Ni/Al
   multilayered composites with thick bilayers react completely in 100 ms
   while at high impact velocity and thin bilayers, reaction time was less
   than 100 mu s. Quantitative trends for the dependence of the reaction
   time on the shock velocity are also determined, for different bilayer
   thickness and shock orientation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Daily intermittent hypoxia enhances walking after chronic spinal cord

Journal = {{NEUROLOGY}},

Volume = {{82}},

Pages = {{104-113}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:To test the hypothesis that daily acute intermittent hypoxia
   (dAIH) and dAIH combined with overground walking improve walking speed
   and endurance in persons with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury
   (iSCI).Methods:Nineteen subjects completed the randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received 15, 90-second
   hypoxic exposures (dAIH, fraction of inspired oxygen {[}Fio(2)] = 0.09)
   or daily normoxia (dSHAM, Fio(2) = 0.21) at 60-second normoxic intervals
   on 5 consecutive days; dAIH was given alone or combined with 30 minutes
   of overground walking 1 hour later. Walking speed and endurance were
   quantified using 10-Meter and 6-Minute Walk Tests. The trial is
   registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01272349).Results:dAIH improved
   walking speed and endurance. Ten-Meter Walk time improved with dAIH vs
   dSHAM after 1 day (mean difference {[}MD] 3.8 seconds, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.1-6.5 seconds, p = 0.006) and 2 weeks (MD 3.8 seconds,
   95\% CI 0.9-6.7 seconds, p = 0.010). Six-Minute Walk distance increased
   with combined dAIH + walking vs dSHAM + walking after 5 days (MD 94.4 m,
   95\% CI 17.5-171.3 m, p = 0.017) and 1-week follow-up (MD 97.0 m, 95\%
   CI 20.1-173.9 m, p = 0.014). dAIH + walking increased walking distance
   more than dAIH after 1 day (MD 67.7 m, 95\% CI 1.3-134.1 m, p = 0.046),
   5 days (MD 107.0 m, 95\% CI 40.6-173.4 m, p = 0.002), and 1-week
   follow-up (MD 136.0 m, 95\% CI 65.3-206.6 m, p < 0.001).Conclusions:dAIH
   walking improved walking speed and distance in persons with chronic
   iSCI. The impact of dAIH is enhanced by combination with walking,
   demonstrating that combinatorial therapies may promote greater
   functional benefits in persons with iSCI.Classification of evidence:This
   study provides Class I evidence that transient hypoxia (through measured
   breathing treatments), along with overground walking training, improves
   walking speed and endurance after iSCI.}},

Abstract = {{Cobalt-free oxide Sr0.7Y0.3CuO2+delta (SYCu) with one-dimensional
   structure has been investigated as potential cathode material for
   intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) applications.
   The crystal structure, chemical compatibility, thermal expansion and
   electrochemical performance were examined by X-ray diffraction
   technique, electrochemical workstation and thermal dilatometer.
   One-dimensional structure Sr1-xYxCuO2+delta and Sr2-xYxCuO3+delta phases
   appeared as the main parts after calcination above 900 degrees C. The
   copper based oxide SYCu showed a thermal expansion coefficient (TEC)
   about 11.1 x 10(-6)/degrees C at 25-800 degrees C, exhibiting good
   physical compatibility with samarium doped cerium (SDC) electrolyte.
   High electro-catalytic performance was obtained for SYCu cathode in a
   symmetrical cell with a polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.029 Omega
   cm(2) and an overpotential of 4.9 mV at 100 mA/cm(2) at 800 degrees C,
   showing great promising use as cathode materials for IT-SOFCs. In

Abstract = {{Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheet is a novel high thermal
   conductivity and high aspect ratio filler that has the potential to
   substantially enhance the thermal conductivity of polymer composites. We
   prepared h-BN nanosheet by liquid exfoliation of bulk h-BN flakes, and
   demonstrated the enhanced thermal conductivity of its epoxy composite.
   It is found that the enhancement of thermal conductivity by using h-BN
   nanosheet is substantial at low filler loadings. At a loading of 5 wt\%,
   the thermal enhancement factor is 113\% for exfoliated h-BN nanosheets,
   and is only 28\% for h-BN control. It is also noted that the effect of
   using h-BN nanosheets becomes less obvious at high filler loading
   probably due to the large thermal boundary resistance. Infrared thermal
   imaging measurement confirmed that the resulting h-BN nanosheet/epoxy
   nanocomposite can successfully reduce the thermal resistance between
   Cu-Si interfaces when being used as thermal conductivity adhesives.
   Further, detailed characterizations on the flow-ability,
   thermomechanical properties and moisture adsorption, etc. revealed the
   promising application of the BN nanosheet/epoxy nanocomposite for
   electronic encapsulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   g/L whole-cell biocatalyst, 5 mM MgCl2, 40 degrees C, pH 8.0, and 24-h
   incubation. Immobilization of whole cells with alginate increased the
   recyclability by an average of 23.33\% per cycle. This work established
   an efficient one-step biotransformation process for the production of
   alpha-KG using immobilized whole B. subtilis overexpressing P. mirabilis
   L-AAD. Compared with traditional multistep chemical synthesis, the
   biocatalytic process described here has the advantage of reducing
   environmental pollution and thus has great potential for the large-scale
   production of alpha-KG. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes site-selective sulfurization of Pd nanocubes
   capped by a monolayer of chemisorbed Br ions. High-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy and high-angle annular dark-field
   scanning TEM observations showed that PdS was not formed until a certain
   quantity of polysulfide (S-x(2-)) ions had been introduced (300 mu l, or
   18.8 ppm in the final reaction solution). Spot energy dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed
   that the surface-chemisorbed Br ions were completely substituted by
   S-x(2-) ions before the initiation of the sulfurization reaction. In the
   presence of sufficient S-x(2-) ions (> 300 mu l or > 18.8 ppm), PdS
   phase was selectively developed from the highly active corners, which
   then moved to the edges and finally towards the center until the entire
   nanocube was converted into PdS. The resultant PdS was found to be
   amorphous by electron microscopy and powder x-ray diffraction
   measurements. The amorphous structure of PdS facilitated the penetration
   and diffusion of S-x(2-) species and thus acceleration of the reaction
   kinetics. As a result, the sulfurization of 13 nm Pd nanocubes was
   completed within a few minutes after the addition of adequate Na2Sx,
   leading to a much more severe poisoning effect, compared with other
   noble metals such as Ag, by sulfur.}},

Abstract = {{The multiplexing capability and high sensitivity of surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering (SERS) make this new imaging modality particularly
   attractive for rapid diagnosis. With 100 nm Ag nanocubes serving as the
   substrate, this work quantitatively evaluated, for the first time, some
   of the fundamental parameters of SERS imaging such as blur, spatial
   resolution and penetration depth. Our results imply that SERS is a
   high-resolution imaging technique with a blur value of 0.5 mu m that is
   lower than many traditional modalities such as mammography. The spatial
   resolution was measured to be 1.1 mu m, suggesting that SERS images
   could be collected effectively by adjusting the imaging step size to the
   same length scale, or no more than 2 mu m. The major drawback of SERS
   imaging is its penetration depth, which is limited by the scattering and
   absorption of tissues. We demonstrated that enhancement of signal caused
   by aggregation of multiple nanoparticles could help overcome this
   potential road-block to in vivo imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays show great promise in developing
   anisotropic thermal conductive composites for efficiently dissipating
   heat from high-power devices along thickness direction. However, CNT
   arrays are always grown on some substrates and liable to be deformed,
   and broken into pieces during transfer and solution treatment. In the
   present study, we intentionally synthesized well-crystallized and
   large-diameter (similar to 80 nm) multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) arrays by
   floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method. Such arrays
   provided high packing density and robust structure from collapse and
   crack formation during post solution treatment and therefore favored to
   maintain original thermal and electrical conductive paths. Under
   optimized condition, the CNT arrays can be transferred into flexible
   composite films. Furthermore, the composite film also exhibited
   excellent thermal conductivity at 8.2 W/(m.K) along thickness direction.
   Such robust, flexible, and highly thermal conductive composite film may
   enable some prospective applications in advanced thermal management.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has been proposed as a
   promising wet-etching method for the fabrication of micro- and
   nanostructures on silicon with low cost. However, uniform vertical
   trench etching with high aspect ratio is still of great challenge for
   traditional MaCE. Here we report an innovated MaCE method, which
   combined the use of a nanoporous gold thin film as the catalyst and a
   hydrofluoric acid (HF)-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mixture solution with a
   low HF-to-H2O2 concentration ratio (rho) as the etchant. The reported
   method successfully fabricated vertical trenches on silicon with a width
   down to 2 mu m and an aspect ratio of 16. The geometry of the trenches
   was highly uniform throughout the 3D space. The vertical etching
   direction was favored on both (100)- and (111)-oriented silicon
   substrates. The reported method was also capable of producing multiple
   trenches on the same substrate with individually-tunable lateral
   geometry. An etching mechanism including a through-catalyst
   mass-transport process and an electropolishing-favored charge-transport
   process was identified by a comparative study. The novel method
   fundamentally solves the problems of distortion and random movement of
   isolated catalysts in MaCE. The results mark a breakthrough in
   high-quality silicon trench-etching technology with a cost of more than
   2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the currently available
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Plexins and semaphorins comprise a large family of receptor-ligand pairs
   controlling cell guidance in nervous, immune, and vascular systems. How
   plexin regulation of neurite outgrowth, lymphoid trafficking, and
   vascular endothelial cell branching is linked to integrin function,
   central to most directed movement, remains unclear. Here we show that on
   developing thymocytes, plexinD1 controls surface topology of
   nanometer-scaled beta 1 integrin adhesion domains in cis, whereas its
   ligation by sema3E in trans regulates individual beta 1 integrin catch
   bonds. Loss of plexinD1 expression reduces beta 1 integrin clustering,
   thereby diminishing avidity, whereas sema3E ligation shortens individual
   integrin bond lifetimes under force to reduce stability. Consequently,
   both decreased expression of plexinD1 during developmental progression
   and a thymic medulla-emanating sema3E gradient enhance thymocyte
   movement toward the medulla, thus enforcing the orchestrated lymphoid
   trafficking required for effective immune repertoire selection. Our
   results demonstrate plexin-tunable molecular features of integrin
   adhesion with broad implications for many cellular processes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is important to understand the relationship between
   electrical and mechanical ventricular activation in CRT patients. By
   measuring local electrical activation at multiple locations within the
   coronary veins and myocardial contraction at the same locations in the
   left ventricle, we determined the relationship between electrical and
   mechanical activation at potential left ventricular pacing locations.
   Methods: In this study, mechanical contraction times were computed using
   high temporal resolution cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
   data, while electrical activation times were derived from
   intra-procedural local electrograms.
   Results: In our cohort, there was a strong correlation between
   electrical and mechanical delay times within each patient (R-2 = 0.78
   +/- 0.23). Additionally, the latest electrically activated location
   corresponded with the latest mechanically contracting location in 91\%
   of patients.
   Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that our method of
   obtaining non-invasive mechanical activation patterns accurately
   reflects the underlying electromechanical substrate of intraventricular
   dyssynchrony.}},

Title = {{Rotenone and paraquat perturb dopamine metabolism: A computational
   analysis of pesticide toxicity}},
Journal = {{TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{315}},
Pages = {{92+}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Pesticides, such as rotenone and paraquat, are suspected in the
   pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), whose hallmark is the
   progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars
   compacta. Thus, compounds expected to play a role in the pathogenesis of
   PD will likely impact the function of dopaminergic neurons. To explore
   the relationship between pesticide exposure and dopaminergic toxicity,
   we developed a custom-tailored mathematical model of dopamine metabolism
   and utilized it to infer potential mechanisms underlying the toxicity of
   rotenone and paraquat, asking how these pesticides perturb specific
   processes. We performed two types of analyses, which are conceptually
   different and complement each other. The first analysis, a purely
   algebraic reverse engineering approach, analytically and
   deterministically computes the altered profile of enzyme activities that
   characterize the effects of a pesticide. The second method consists of
   large-scale Monte Carlo simulations that statistically reveal possible
   mechanisms of pesticides. The results from the reverse engineering
   approach show that rotenone and paraquat exposures lead to distinctly
   different flux perturbations. Rotenone seems to affect all fluxes
   associated with dopamine compartmentalization, whereas paraquat exposure
   perturbs fluxes associated with dopamine and its breakdown metabolites.
   The statistical results of the Monte-Carlo analysis suggest several
   specific mechanisms. The findings are interesting, because no a priori
   assumptions are made regarding specific pesticide actions, and all
   parameters characterizing the processes in the dopamine model are
   treated in an unbiased manner. Our results show how approaches from
   computational systems biology can help identify mechanisms underlying
   the toxicity of pesticide exposure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {{System factors to explain 2009 pandemic H1N1 state vaccination rates for

Journal = {{VACCINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: During the 2009-2010 Hi NI pandemic, children and
   high-risk adults had priority for vaccination. Vaccine in short supply
   was allocated to states pro-rata by population, but vaccination rates as
   of January 2010 varied among states from 21.3\% to 84.7\% for children
   and 10.4\% to 47.2\% for high-risk adults. States had different campaign
   processes and decisions.
   Objective: To determine program and system factors associated with
   higher state pandemic vaccination coverage for children and high-risk
   adults during an emergency response with short supply of vaccine.
   Methods: Regression analysis of factors predicting state-specific H1N1
   vaccination coverage in children and high-risk adults, including state
   campaign information, demographics, preventive or health-seeking
   behavior, preparedness funding, providers, state characteristics, and
   surveillance data.
   Results: Our modeling explained variation in state-specific vaccination
   coverage with an adjusted R-squared of 0.82 for children and 0.78 for
   high-risk adults. We found that coverage of children was positively
   associated with programs focusing on school clinics and with a larger
   proportion of doses administered in public sites; negatively with the
   proportion of children in the population, and the proportion not
   visiting a doctor because of cost. The coverage for high-risk adults was
   positively associated with shipments of vaccine to ``general access{''}
   locations, including pharmacy and retail, with the percentage of women
   with a Pap smear within the past 3 years and with past seasonal
   influenza vaccination. It was negatively associated with the expansion
   of vaccination to the general public by December 4, 2009. For children
   and high-risk adults, coverage was positively associated with the
   maximum number of ship-to-sites and negatively associated with the
   proportion of medically underserved population.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that distribution and system decisions such
   as vaccination venues and providers targeted can positively impact
   vaccination rates for children and high-risk adults. Additionally,
   existing health infrastructure, health-seeking behaviors, and access
   affected coverage. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Microfluidic Thrombosis under Multiple Shear Rates and Antiplatelet
   Therapy Doses}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{The mainstay of treatment for thrombosis, the formation of occlusive
   platelet aggregates that often lead to heart attack and stroke, is
   antiplatelet therapy. Antiplatelet therapy dosing and resistance are
   poorly understood, leading to potential incorrect and ineffective
   dosing. Shear rate is also suspected to play a major role in thrombosis,
   but instrumentation to measure its influence has been limited by flow
   conditions, agonist use, and non-systematic and/or non-quantitative
   studies. In this work we measured occlusion times and thrombus
   detachment for a range of initial shear rates (500, 1500, 4000, and
   10000 s(-1)) and therapy concentrations (0-2.4 mu M for eptifibatide,
   0-2 mM for acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA), 3.5-40 Units/L for heparin)
   using a microfluidic device. We also measured complete blood counts
   (CBC) and platelet activity using whole blood impedance aggregometry.
   Effects of shear rate and dose were analyzed using general linear
   models, logistic regressions, and Cox proportional hazards models. Shear
   rates have significant effects on thrombosis/dose-response curves for
   all tested therapies. ASA has little effect on high shear occlusion
   times, even at very high doses (up to 20 times the recommended dose).
   Under ASA therapy, thrombi formed at high shear rates were 4 times more
   prone to detachment compared to those formed under control conditions.
   Eptifibatide reduced occlusion when controlling for shear rate and its
   efficacy increased with dose concentration. In contrast, the hazard of
   occlusion from ASA was several orders of magnitude higher than that of
   eptifibatide. Our results show similar dose efficacy to our low shear
   measurements using whole blood aggregometry. This quantitative and
   statistically validated study of the effects of a wide range of shear
   rate and antiplatelet therapy doses on occlusive thrombosis contributes
   to more accurate understanding of thrombosis and to models for
   optimizing patient treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation is among the most important properties of biomaterial
   scaffolds, which are indispensable for regenerative medicine. The
   currently used method relies on the measurement of mass loss across
   different samples and cannot track the degradation of an individual
   scaffold insitu. Here we report, for the first time, the use of
   multiscale photoacoustic microscopy to non-invasively monitor the
   degradation of an individual scaffold. We could observe alterations to
   the morphology and structure of a scaffold at high spatial resolution
   and deep penetration, and more significantly, quantify the degradation
   of an individual scaffold as a function of time, both invitro and
   invivo. In addition, the remodeling of vasculature inside a scaffold can
   be visualized simultaneously using a dual-wavelength scanning mode in a
   label-free manner. This optoacoustic method can be used to monitor the
   degradation of individual scaffolds, offering a new approach to
   non-invasively analyze and quantify biomaterial-tissue interactions in
   conjunction with the assessment of invivo vascular parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of customer satisfaction' (CS) and quality of life' (QOL)
   have both been used, on a limited basis, in strategic planning and
   performance measurement at state departments of transportation. However,
   the meanings and usefulness of these concepts are still unclear or
   evolving to many practitioners. Based on a review of the literature and
   customer opinion data collected for various transportation studies in
   the USA and Europe, this paper offers two important contributions to the
   transportation literature. The paper clarifies the relationship between
   the CS and QOL concepts, placing CS in the broader context of customer
   opinions and subjective well-being. The paper then identifies six
   categories of survey tools for collecting customer opinions, describing
   how each can be used within a performance management framework to reveal
   the QOL impacts of transportation decisions. Agencies can use the
   definitions, conceptual relationships, performance measures, and
   decision-making processes discussed in this paper to refine their
   performance management programs, to better understand customer and
   public perceptions, and to make systematic progress toward their QOL
   oriented goals.}},

Abstract = {{Technology opportunities analysis (TOA) can support policy-makers or
   managers in making strategic technical decisions so as to enhance their
   technological innovation capability and international competitiveness.
   This paper presents a multi-level framework to support and
   systematically identify technological opportunities. Patent data as a
   key component of technology innovation are used to enable TOA within the
   framework in the present research. At the research and development
   (R\&D) level, we anticipate the directions of technology development
   based on technology morphology. Countries' development emphases can also
   be investigated in order to help identify their R\&D strengths and
   weaknesses and to seek promising development pathways. At the level of
   competition, we devise the assignee-technology analysis to obtain
   insight into competitive participants' technical emphases and intents.
   It is also used to explore possible collaboration opportunities among
   them. At the market level, we apply patent family analysis to understand
   countries' target markets and to assess prospects for the
   commercialisation of their technology. We pursue TOA to explore China's
   opportunities and challenges in dye-sensitised solar cells. The
   empirical case analysis supports the effectiveness of the TOA model. We
   believe it can be adapted well to fit other emerging technologies.}},

Abstract = {{We report a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of organic
   particulate material (PM) emissions of aircraft engine exhaust that
   includes data from five different aircraft engines and two different
   fuels (petroleum jet fuel and a Fischer-Tropsch fuel) collected over
   three field missions. PMF of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) data was
   used to identify six distinct factors: two lubrication oil factors, two
   aliphatic factors, an aromatic factor, and a siloxane factor. Of these,
   the lubrication oil factors and the siloxane factor were noncombustion
   sources. The siloxane factor was attributed to silicone tubing used in
   the sampling system deployed in one of the three missions included in
   this study, but not the other two. The two lubrication oil factors
   correlate with the two different lubrication oils used by the aircraft
   engines evaluated in this study (Mobil II and Air BP) as well as minor
   differences presumably due to variation in the blend stocks, temperature
   history, and analytical factors. Overall, the sum of the aliphatic and
   aromatic factors decreased with increasing power, as expected based on
   known trends in VOC emissions. The aliphatic \#1 factor correlated with
   soot emissions, especially at power conditions where EIm-soot was
   greater than 30mg kg(?1). The aliphatic factor \#2 mass spectrum shared
   some similarities with ambient aerosol organic PM present during the
   tests and correlated most strongly with dilution levels, two
   observations that suggest that aliphatic \#2 contains components found
   in ambient aerosol. The aromatic factor correlated with benzene
   emissions, especially at low power conditions were EIm-benzene was
   greater than 0.03mg kg(?1). Our results improve the current
   understanding of aircraft PM composition. Copyright 2014 American

Abstract = {{The problem of designing a water quality monitoring network for river
   systems is to find the optimal location of a finite number of monitoring
   devices that minimizes the expected detection time of a contaminant
   spill event while guaranteeing good detection reliability. When
   uncertainties in spill and rain events are considered, both the expected
   detection time and detection reliability need to be estimated by
   stochastic simulation. This problem is formulated as a stochastic
   discrete optimization via simulation (OvS) problem on the expected
   detection time with a stochastic constraint on detection reliability;
   and it is solved with an OvS algorithm combined with a recently proposed
   method called penalty function with memory (PFM). The performance of the
   algorithm is tested on the Altamaha River and compared with that of a
   genetic algorithm due to Telci, Nam, Guan and Aral (2009).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING PERFORMANCE SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-32}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{The last decade has seen a surge in the need for uncertainty analysis
   (UA) for building energy assessment. The rigorous determination of
   uncertainty in model parameters is a vital but often overlooked part of
   UA. To undertake this, one has to turn one's attention to a thriving
   area in engineering statistics that focuses on uncertainty
   quantification (UQ) for short. This paper applies dedicated methods and
   theories that are emerging in this area of statistics to the field of
   building energy models, and specifically to the microclimate variables
   embedded in them. We argue that knowing the uncertainty in these
   variables is a vital prerequisite for ensuing UA of whole building
   behaviour. Indeed, significant discrepancies have been observed between
   the predicted and measured state variables of building microclimates.
   This paper uses a set of approaches from the growing UQ arsenal, mostly
   regression-based methods, to develop statistical models that quantify
   the uncertainties in the following most significant microclimate
   variables: local temperature, wind speed, wind pressure and solar
   irradiation. These are the microclimate variables used by building
   energy models to define boundary conditions that encapsulate the
   interaction of the building with the surrounding physical environment.
   Although our analysis is generically applicable to any of the current
   energy models, we will base our UQ examples on the energy model used in
   EnergyPlus.}},

   at the transmitted (Tx) side by reducing the number of transmitted
   pulses for each sample. Amplitude information is encoded in the time and
   modulated within a sampling period, similar to PWM. A pattern of narrow
   pulses is then transmitted at the edges of the PWM signal. Therefore,
   instead of transmitting pulses for each data bit using conventional
   digital encoding techniques, such as pulse-position multiplexing (PPM),
   only two pulses are sent in lieu of multiple data bits, resulting in
   significant power saving. On the receiver (Rx) side, narrow pulses
   corresponding to PWM edges are detected and a time-to-digital converter
   (TDC) recovers the digital data bits corresponding to the analog sample
   by precisely measuring the pulse width of the recovered PWM signal. We
   demonstrate the proposed method by post-layout simulation of a
   PWM-IR-UWB transceiver in a 0.13-mu m mixed-mode CMOS process. The
   transceiver achieved 10 bits of resolution with 2.8 pJ/bit power
   consumption in the Tx when transmitting a PWM signal at 10 M samples per
   seconds (Sps), which is the equivalent of 100 Mbps data rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the trade-offs in architecting stacked DRAM either
   as part of main memory or as a hardware-managed cache. Using stacked
   DRAM as part of main memory increases the effective capacity, but
   obtaining high performance from such a system requires Operating System
   (OS) support to migrate data at a page-granularity. Using stacked DRAM
   as a hardware cache has the advantages of being transparent to the OS
   and perform data management at a line-granularity but suffers from
   reduced main memory capacity. This is because the stacked DRAM cache is
   not part of the memory address space. Ideally, we want the stacked DRAM
   to contribute towards capacity of main memory, and still maintain the
   hardware-based fine-granularity of a cache.
   We propose CAMEO, a hardware-based CAche-like MEmory Organization that
   not only makes stacked DRAM visible as part of the memory address space
   but also exploits data locality on a fine-grained basis. CAMEO retains
   recently accessed data lines in stacked DRAM and swaps out the victim
   line to off-chip memory. Since CAMEO can change the physical location of
   a line dynamically, we propose a low overhead Line Location Table (LLT)
   that tracks the physical location of all data lines. We also propose an
   accurate Line Location Predictor (LLP) to avoid the serialization of the
   LLT look-up and memory access. We evaluate a system that has 4GB stacked
   memory and 12GB off-chip memory. Using stacked DRAM as a cache improves
   performance by 50\%, using as part of main memory improves performance
   by 33\%, whereas CAMEO improves performance by 78\%. Our proposed design
   is very close to an idealized memory system that uses the 4GB stacked
   DRAM as a hardware-managed cache and also increases the main memory
   capacity by an additional 4GB.}},

Abstract = {{Stacked memory modules are likely to be tightly integrated with the
   processor. It is vital that these memory modules operate reliably, as
   memory failure can require the replacement of the entire socket. To make
   matters worse, stacked memory designs are susceptible to newer failure
   modes (for example, due to faulty through-silicon vias, or TSVs) that
   can cause large portions of memory, such as a bank, to become faulty. To
   avoid data loss from large-granularity failures, the memory system may
   use symbol-based codes that stripe the data for a cache line across
   several banks (or channels). Unfortunately, such data-striping reduces
   memory level parallelism causing significant slowdown and higher power
   consumption.
   This paper proposes Citadel, a robust memory architecture that allows
   the memory system to retain each cache line within one bank, thus
   allowing high performance, lower power and efficiently protects the
   stacked memory from large-granularity failures. Citadel consists of
   three components; TSV-Swap, which can tolerate both faulty data-TSVs and
   faulty address-TSVs; Tri Dimensional Parity (3DP), which can tolerate
   column failures, row failures, and bank failures; and Dynamic
   Dual-Granularity Sparing (DDS), which can mitigate permanent faults by
   dynamically sparing faulty memory regions either at a row granularity or
   at a bank granularity. Our evaluations with real-world data for DRAM
   failures show that Citadel provides performance and power similar to
   maintaining the entire cache line in the same bank, and yet provides
   700x higher reliability than ChipKill-like ECC codes.}},

Abstract = {{GPU has become a first-order computing platform. Nonetheless, not many
   performance modeling techniques have been developed for architecture
   studies. Several GPU analytical performance models have been proposed,
   but they mostly target application optimizations rather than the study
   of different architecture design options.
   Interval analysis is a relatively accurate performance modeling
   technique, which traverses the instruction trace and uses functional
   simulators, e.g., cache simulator, to track the stall events that cause
   performance loss. It shows hundred times of speedup compared to detailed
   timing simulations and better accuracy compared to pure analytical
   models. However, previous techniques are limited to CPUs and not
   applicable to multithreaded architectures.
   In this work, we propose GPUMech, an interval analysis-based performance
   modeling technique for GPU architectures. GPUMech models multithreading
   and resource contentions caused by memory divergence. We compare GPUMech
   with a detailed timing simulator and show that on average, GPUMech has
   13.2\% error for modeling the round-robin scheduling policy and 14.0\%
   error for modeling the greedy-then-oldest policy while achieving a 97x
   faster simulation speed. In addition, GPUMech generates CPI stacks,
   which help hardware/software developers to visualize performance
   bottlenecks of a kernel.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a fully integrated 2x2 SiGe transmitter array at 316 GHz.
   A novel method is introduced to phase-lock the high frequency signal
   sources without any additional circuitry. This method suppresses the
   other possible oscillatory modes automatically. The power of the locked
   signal sources are combined in the air by the 2x2 on-chip antenna array
   which are fed with the locked sources. This array is scalable to larger
   sizes in the same layout style. This array transmitter utilizes Colpitts
   oscillators as high frequency signal sources; however, this method can
   be applied to any other oscillator architecture to perform the frequency
   and phase locking. The frequency of this transmitter follows the simple
   equations for a single Colpitts oscillator, thereby facilitating the
   design of the circuit.}},

   biased transistor cores to activate additional transistor area and

   phased-array systems. The amplifier was fabricated in a 180 nm SiGe

   240/260 GHz. When all transistor cores are activated, the amplifier
   achieves 16.5 dB of gain and a noise figure of 1.6 dB at 10 GHz. A gain
   variation of 7 dB from the maximum to the minimum state is demonstrated.
   In addition, the noise figure, linearity, and gain all improve with

Abstract = {{The scheduling of track dwells to minimize radar energy and time with an
   agile beam radar is considered. Typically, a radar scheduler picks a
   waveform pulsewidth to achieve a desired signal-to-noise (SNR) level,
   and this is called the nominal tracking SNR. In theory, the combination
   of high quality measurements and good kinematic modeling in the tracker
   yields longer track revisit periods, thus minimizing total radar time
   allocated to the track. However, high quality measurements are at the
   cost of higher tracking SNR, thus higher energy. In this study, the
   trade between higher energy waveforms and radar time is further
   investigated. The role of those higher energy waveforms with more
   accurate measurements in the performance of the Interacting Multiple
   Model (IMM) estimator is also investigated. Using simulation studies,
   the optimal tracking SNR levels that minimize radar time and energy are
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of new surface modifications that superimpose
   well-defined nanostructures on microrough implants mimicking the
   hierarchical complexity of native bone, report synergistically enhanced
   osteoblast maturation and local factor production at the protein level
   compared to smooth, nanorough and microrough surfaces. Whether these
   micro/nanorough surfaces enhance the osteogenic response by triggering
   similar patterns of integrin receptors and their associated signaling
   pathways as with well-established microrough surfaces is not well
   understood. Human osteoblasts (hOBs) were cultured until confluent for
   gene expression studies on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) or on
   titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) disks with different surface topography:
   smooth, nanorough, microrough and micro/nanorough surfaces. mRNA
   expression levels of osteogenesis-related markers such as osteocalcin
   (BGLAP) and bone sialoprotein (BSP), bone morphogenetic protein 2
   (BMP2), BMP4, noggin (NOG) and gremlin 1 (GREM1) were all higher on
   microrough and micro/nanorough surfaces, with few differences between
   them, compared to smooth and nanorough groups. Interestingly, expression
   of integrins alpha 1 and alpha 2, which interact primarily with
   collagens and laminin and have been commonly associated with osteoblast
   differentiation on microrough Ti and Ti6Al4V, were expressed at lower
   levels on micro/nanorough surfaces compared to microrough ones.
   Conversely, the alpha v subunit, which binds ligands such as
   vitronectin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein among others, had higher
   expression on micro/nanorough surfaces concomitantly with regulation of
   the beta 3 mRNA levels on nanomodified surfaces. These results suggest
   that the maturation of osteoblasts on micro/nanorough surfaces may be
   occurring through different integrin engagement than those established
   for microrough-only surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{There has been limited progress toward the development of in vitro
   cardiac tissue models and cellular cardiac therapies due to the lack of
   an easily obtainable and expandable cell source. Human pluripotent stem
   cells (hPSCs) represent a potentially unlimited source of cardiomyocytes
   for use in regenerative cardiac therapies as well as for the study of
   cardiovascular development, disease, and tissue homeostasis. An enhanced
   understanding of the interactions between cardiomyocytes and their
   surrounding microenvironment is required in order to generate
   appropriate in vitro models of human cardiac development and disease. In
   this study, we model cardiac microenvironments by generating 3D
   cardiospheres of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and control spheroid
   formation conditions to modulate both cardiomyocyte phenotype and
   physiological function.}},

Abstract = {{Many medications and therapies are available to treat neurological
   movement disorder symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia, postural
   instability, and gait disturbances. However, proper dosages and
   treatment combinations can be difficult to determine and often must be
   adjusted over time. Such adjustments are typically based on infrequent
   clinical evaluations. Mobile, long term monitoring of motor signs will
   allow better informed treatment adjustments and, as a result, has the
   potential to improve the quality of life for patients. With this in
   mind, we built a system for portable monitoring of neurological
   disorders in humans. The system analyzes movement signals from
   distributed wirelessly connected gyroscopes and accelerometers using a
   commercial smartphone, off-the-shelf attachments, and custom-programmed
   software. With approval from the Georgia Institute of Technology
   Institutional Review Board, we conducted a study with human subjects to
   evaluate whether unsupervised remote mobile monitoring might be possible
   with such a system, and, if so, how accurately the system could assess
   the signs of Parkinson's disease. We found that it was useful to
   consider data from multiple sensors in order to discriminate between
   normal and parkinsonian movement and that it was possible to identify
   activity types from the accelerometer and gyroscope data with high
   accuracy (1.0). After the activity type was identified, average
   discrimination accuracy between parkinsonian and normal conditions was
   0.88. Additionally, individual symptoms of the disease could be
   accurately detected in > 0.8 of cases.}},

Abstract = {{Cell patches are widely used for healing injuries on the surfaces or
   interfaces of tissues. Here we present a novel class of porous scaffolds
   made of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic) acid for fabricating cell patches.
   The scaffolds have a single layer of spherical pores that are arranged
   in a unique hexagonal pattern and are therefore referred to as
   ``scaffolds with a hexagonal array of interconnected pores (SHAIPs){''}.
   SHAIPs contain both uniform pores and interconnecting windows that can
   facilitate the exchange of biomacromolecules, ensure homogeneous cell
   seeding, and promote cell migration. As a proof-of-concept
   demonstration, we have created skeletal muscle patches with a thickness
   of approximately 150 mu m using SHAIPs. The myoblasts seeded in the
   scaffolds maintained high viability and were able to differentiate into
   multi-nucleated myotubes. Moreover, neovasculature could efficiently
   develop into the patches upon subcutaneous implantation in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Validating modern oceanographic theories using models produced through
   stereo computer vision principles has recently emerged. Space-time (4-D)
   models of the ocean surface may be generated by stacking a series of 3-D
   reconstructions independently generated for each time instant or; in a
   more robust manner; by simultaneously processing several snapshots
   coherently in a true ``4-D reconstruction.{''} However, the accuracy of
   these computer-vision-generated models is subject to the estimations of
   camera parameters, which may be corrupted under the influence of natural
   factors such as wind and vibrations. Therefore, removing the
   unpredictable errors of the camera parameters is necessary for an
   accurate reconstruction. In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm
   that can jointly perform a 4-D reconstruction as well as correct the
   camera parameter errors introduced by external factors. The technique is
   founded upon variational optimization methods to benefit from their
   numerous advantages: continuity of the estimated surface in space and
   time, robustness, and accuracy. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is tested using synthetic data produced through computer
   graphics techniques, based on which the errors of the camera parameters
   arising from natural factors can be simulated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Manifold, an open-source parallel simulation
   framework for multicore architectures. It consists of a parallel
   simulation kernel, a set of microarchitecture components, and an
   integrated library of power, thermal, reliability, and energy models.
   Using the components as building blocks, users can assemble multicore
   architecture simulation models and perform serial or parallel
   simulations to study the architectural and/or the physical
   characteristics of the models. Users can also create new components for
   Manifold or port existing models. Importantly, Manifold's
   component-based design provides the user with the ability to easily
   replace a component with another for efficient explorations of the
   design space. It also allows components to evolve independently and
   making it easy for simulators to incorporate new components as they
   become available. The distinguishing features of Manifold include i)
   transparent parallel execution, ii) integration of power, thermal,
   reliability, and energy models, iii) full system simulation, e.g.,
   operating system and system binaries, and iv) component-based design. In
   this paper we provide a description of the software architecture of
   Manifold, and its main elements - a parallel multicore emulator
   front-end and a parallel component-based back-end timing model. We
   describe a few simulators that are built with Manifold components to
   illustrate its flexibility, and present test results of the scalability
   obtained on full-system simulation of coherent shared-memory multicore
   models with 16, 32, and 64 cores executing PARSEC and SPLASH-2
   benchmarks.}},

   secondary coil for conformal and rollable antenna applications. The
   hosting substrate is Liquid Crystalline Polymer (LCP) by Rogers

   achieved a design with a good maximum available gain (MAG) of about
   -1.765 dB (given the lossy conductive ink) and high self-resonant
   frequencies of the coils. The MAG indicates that 67\% of the input power
   is received at the output, given appropriate matching. The transformer
   has an inductance of 6.1 nH and 14.2 nH for the primary and the
   secondary respectively at 1.4 GHz. The simulated k-factor is equal to

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel inkjet-printed microfluidic tunable coplanar
   patch antenna combining microfluidic-based sensing technology and inkjet
   printing technique is proposed. The antenna is fabricated using a rapid,
   low-cost, and environmental friendly inkjet printing process on paper
   substrate. Based on the fluid pumped in the sensor, the resonant
   frequency of the antenna is tuned due to variation in the fluid
   permittivity. 13\% frequency shift can be easily achieved, which
   verifies that the sensitivity of this antenna is good and allows for an
   easy tunability of the operating frequency from 3.8 GHz, for an empty
   microfluidic channel, to 3.3 GHz, for a water-filled channel. The
   antenna features a return loss better than 30 dB in the tunable
   frequency range of 3.5 to 3.8 GHz. This antenna can be used in multiple
   applications such as liquid monitoring and identification, bio-liquids
   sensing as well as low-cost reconfigurable antennas with the advantage
   of requiring the use of less than 25 uL of liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms which exhibits remarkable
   electronic and mechanical properties amenable to photonic and sensor
   applications. While the plasmonic nature of graphene at terahertz
   frequency has been widely reported, investigations on the practical
   utility of graphene in antennas have been very sparse. In particular,
   losses in graphene significantly limit the radiation performance of
   microwave antennas fabricated entirely using graphene. In this paper, a
   dual-port printed slot antenna is designed with graphene film used as an
   overlay in the microstrip feed line for broadband impedance matching.
   Antenna losses are minimized by confining the film to a small area
   outside the radiator. Through simulations, the effect of varying the
   surface impedance of the graphene film is parametrically examined to
   demonstrate 100\% impedance bandwidth centered at 3.5 GHz. The proposed
   antenna design, selectively using graphene away from the antenna
   surface, is very attractive to configuring low-power wireless sensor
   nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been considered for designing antennas, but
   their losses result in poor radiation efficiency, especially at
   microwave frequencies. However, their outstanding carrier mobility,
   large surface area per unit mass and adjustable surface chemistry make
   them ideal for functions such as reconfigurability and tuning. In this
   paper, we investigate the tunability of a patch antenna using a CNT thin
   film placed across a set of electrodes connected to the nonradiating
   edge. In a passive implementation, the surface impedance of the CNT film
   can be changed by altering its thickness. Through simulations, the
   effect of varying the surface impedance is parametrically examined to
   demonstrate about 500 MHz tunability in a patch antenna resonant at 6.6
   GHz. Antenna losses are minimized by confining the CNT film to a small
   area outside the radiator.}},

   distilled (DI) water (epsilon(r) = 80), is placed below a 2 mil LCP
   layer. Based on this multilayer structure, the dimensions of microstrip
   lines are determined. In order to tune the filter center frequency, DI
   water is replaced by acetone, with a dielectric constant that is 4 times
   lower than that of DI water (epsilon(r) = 20.7). A micropump is used to
   inject the different fluids and provide the necessary pressure to trap
   the liquid inside the microfluidic channel. Measured results show 50\%
   tuning which translates into a maximum center frequency shift of 500
   MHz. The insertion loss is 1.4 dB and the return loss is 25 dB at 1 GHz
   for the DI water filter while the insertion loss is 1.3 dB and the
   return loss is 15.8 dB at 1.5 GHz for the acetone filter.}},

Abstract = {{Presented herein is the first ever hardware based methodology for
   collision avoidance of multiple, frequency doubling transceivers.
   Frequency doubling transceivers have many advantages over other passive
   RFID systems, including their simplicity, size, and read range. The
   drawback of frequency doubling transceivers is the lack of a method for
   uniquely identifying a single tag when multiple tags are within read
   range of an interrogator, i.e. collision avoidance. Therefore, a
   methodology is developed which allows for the switching on and off of
   individual tags while maintaining a relatively simple and small
   structure. Measurement demonstrates a switching mechanism which requires
   -10 dBm of power in a control signal for over 30 dBm of attenuation in
   the transceivers doubled return power. Different modes of operation are
   demonstrated which allow for easier signal interrogation. Wireless
   measurements demonstrate the viability of the transceiver as part of an
   RFID system. Read range, and number of uniquely identifiable tags are
   covered in the conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{A great challenge in UHF RFID systems consists of increasing their
   operating range. In this work, a circuit topology consisting of a
   reflection amplifier and a passive coupler is proposed to both amplify
   the input signal to the tag as well as the backscattered signal towards
   the reader. System analysis is provided to estimate the performance
   requirements of the proposed circuit. The amplifier is optimized in
   order to maximize its gain while minimizing its dissipated power, thus
   allowing for low-power operation by using ambient energy harvesting
   devices such as solar cells. The circuit is compatible with commercial
   UHF RFID tags and is implemented using low-cost inkjet printing
   fabrication. Prototypes of the various circuit components are fabricated
   and evaluated demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system.
   Interesting results are showcased for tag efficiency improvement through
   such non-conventional front-end designs.}},

   devices is connected to a heat sink by a second flip-chip process to
   improve thermal management. When realized on a low-cost organic

   results show that the proposed packaging technique can still achieve
   performance levels comparable to devices packaged on expensive, high

   highest output power among silicon-based signal sources in this
   frequency range, and the 367 GHz signal source achieves the best phase

   CHANGE}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENHANCED HEAT TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4-5}},
Pages = {{373-395}},
Abstract = {{Optimal design of microchannels using fluid phase change requires the
   maximum possible heat dissipation and/or the minimum device surface
   temperature, with the least possible expenditure of overall power.
   Detailed analysis using fundamental fluid dynamics and heat transfer
   principles is essential in achieving these optimal designs. The
   investigation reported here was directed toward the development of an
   optimal design for rectangular microchannel heat sinks, employing phase
   change with an annular flow pattern. The determination of an optimal
   design was based on solution of the governing fluid dynamic and energy
   equations using a quasi-three-dimensional model to obtain the pressure
   drop and heat transfer results as a function of pumping power. The
   effects of geometric parameters were correlated using multiple
   regression analysis and were then used to obtain the optimal
   microchannel design within a given parameter range. Incorporated in the
   mathematical model were the longitudinal variations in the
   cross-sectional area of the liquid and vapor phases, the surface tension
   effects, and variations in film thickness along the channel. This
   analysis should provide guidelines for the design of microchannel heat
   sinks using phase change that are suitable for compact heat-dissipating
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Pulp and paper manufacturing has been known to be one the largest
   industrial sector consumers of energy. The need energy cost saving is
   compelling due to the increasing volatility of energy prices in today's
   marketplace. The challenge of maintaining high product quality while
   simultaneously reducing production costs can often be met through
   investments in energy efficiency, which can include the purchase of
   energy efficient technologies and the implementation of plant-wide
   energy efficiency practices. In this paper, a technical framework of
   system modeling technique is introduced to model energy conversion and
   utilization throughout the pulp and paper manufacturing system and
   sub-systems. A well-established SysML-based process model is translated
   to a Discrete-Event Simulation model. By simulating the system's
   response to the changing energy price and market demands, diverse
   what-if scenarios of system energy utilization can be analyzed in terms
   of reduction of the total energy cost.}},

Abstract = {{A general method for equation of motion of a human body is presented.
   The equation is in closed-form(i.e., analytic form). A hierarchical
   approach is introduced to get the equation of motion of the human body.
   The constraint force between subsystems is explicitly obtained which can
   be used to calculate the joint friction torque. The final equation of
   motion includes the dynamics of the unconstrained motion, the
   constraints, and the constraint forces including the joint friction
   torque induced by the nonideal constraints. No auxiliary variables such
   as Lagrange multipliers or pseudo-generalized speeds are needed.
   Therefore the equation of motion is most suitable for generic dynamic
   analysis and control design. A four-segment, planar, articulated linkage
   free fall human body is chosen to demonstrate this method.}},

   the transformed system practically stable. A proof shows that the

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting has attracted interest of researchers
   from various disciplines over the past decade. In the literature of
   piezoelectric energy harvesting, the typical configuration is a unimorph
   or a bimorph cantilevered piezoelectric beam located on a vibrating host
   structure subjected to base excitations. As an alternative to
   cantilevered piezoelectric beams, piezoelectric layers structurally
   integrated on thin plates can be used as vibration-based energy
   harvesters since plates and plate-type structures are commonly used in
   aerospace, automotive and marine applications. The aim of this paper is
   to present experiments and electroelastic finite element simulations of
   a piezoelectric energy harvester structurally integrated on a thin
   plate. The finite element model of the piezoceramic patch and the
   all-edges-clamped plate are built. In parallel, an experimental setup is
   constructed using a thin PZ715A piezoceramic patch attached on the
   surface of all-edges-clamped rectangular aluminum plate. The
   electroelastic frequency response functions relating voltage output and
   vibration response to forcing input are validated using the
   experimentally obtained results. Finally, electrical power generation of
   the piezoceramic patch is investigated using the experimental set-up for
   a set of resistive loads. The numerical predictions and experimental
   results show that the use of all-edge-clamped flexible plate as host
   structure for piezoelectric energy harvester leads to multimodal
   vibration-to-electricity conversion.}},

Abstract = {{The development of accurate and efficient numerical models for jointed
   structures is an important and challenging problem. Due to
   nonlinearities in the joints, notably dry friction, contact stiffness,
   and impact, joint models are often complicated and computer-intensive.
   To create practical models, engineers typically combine ``lumped joint
   models{''} with reduced-order models for the structural members that
   they connect. However, the model reduction often distorts how the joint
   behaves and sometimes destroys important qualitative traits. Simple
   modal truncation is often inadequate to produce reduced-order models
   because nonlinearities within the joints such as impact and dry friction
   can depend critically on the high-frequency characteristics of the
   mating structural elements. This paper examines the issues surrounding
   the development of accurate, reduced-order models for nonlinear, jointed
   structures. The concept of ``balanced realizations{''} from control
   them) are used to create reduced-order models that best capture the
   input-output characterization of the linear substructures with the
   smallest model order. The balanced-realizations are seen to produce very
   favorable results when compared with standard modal truncation
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The harvesting of flow energy by exploiting aeroelastic and hydroelastic
   vibrations has received growing attention over the last few years. The
   goal in this research field is to generate low-power electricity from
   flow-induced vibrations of scalable structures involving a proper
   transduction mechanism for wireless applications ranging from
   manned/unmanned aerial vehicles to civil infrastructure systems located
   in high wind areas. The fundamental challenge is to enable geometrically
   small flow energy harvesters while keeping the cut-in speed (lowest flow
   speed that induces persistent oscillations) low. An effective design
   with reduced cut-in speed is known to be the T-shaped cantilever
   arrangement that consists of a horizontal piezoelectric cantilever with
   a perpendicular vertical beam attachment at the tip. The direction of
   incoming flow is parallel to the horizontal cantilever and perpendicular
   to the vertical and symmetric tip attachment. Vortex-induced vibration
   resulting from flow past the tip attachment is the source of the
   aeroelastic response. For a given width of the T-shaped harvester with
   fixed thickness parameters, an important geometric parameter is the
   length ratio of the tip attachment to the cantilever. In this paper we
   investigate the effect of this geometric parameter on the
   piezoaeroelastic response of a T-shaped flow energy harvester. A
   controlled desktop wind tunnel system is used to characterize the
   electrical and mechanical response characteristics for broad ranges of
   flow speed and electrical load resistance using different vertical tip
   attachment lengths for the same horizontal piezoelectric cantilever. The
   variations of the electrical power output and cut-in speed with changing
   head length are reported along with an investigation into the
   electroaeroelastic frequency response spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear oscillators have been given growing attention due to their
   ability to enhance the performance of energy harvesting devices by
   increasing the frequency bandwidth. Duffing oscillators are a typical
   type of nonlinear oscillator characterized by a symmetric hardening or
   softening cubic restoring force. In order to realize the cubic
   nonlinearity in a cantilever at reasonable excitation levels, often an
   external magnetic field or mechanical load is imposed, since the
   inherent geometric nonlinearity would otherwise require impractically
   high excitation levels to be pronounced. As an alternative to
   magnetoelastic structures and other forms of symmetric Duffing
   oscillators, in this paper, an M-shaped bent beam with clamped end
   conditions is investigated for bandwidth enhancement under base
   excitation. The M-shaped beam geometry can exhibit significantly
   asymmetric spring behavior: hardening in one direction and softening in
   the other. A particular advantage of the M-shaped structure is its
   well-pronounced nonlinear characteristics without needing an external
   component to create hardening or softening. The force-displacement
   relationship of the M-shaped beam with a central lumped mass attachment
   is experimentally identified and asymmetric nonlinear behavior is
   verified. The purely elastic system parameters (such as the linear and
   nonlinear stiffness components) identified from the experiments are used
   in numerical simulations and compared with the experimental results. A
   quadratic damping term is included to account for nonlinear dissipative
   effects. Bandwidth enhancement with increasing base excitation is
   investigated experimentally and numerically. Very good agreement is
   observed between the simulated frequency response curves and
   experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a wave-based analysis approach for predicting static
   buckling instabilities in axially-loaded columns and frames. It builds
   upon recent work on the wave-based vibration analysis of frame-like
   structures modeled by Timoshenko beams. To predict buckling, axial
   preload modeling is included in the equations of motion and the
   wave-based analysis approach is reformulated accordingly. This
   reformulation includes development of reflection and transmission
   matrices for a general, four-member angled joint. An eigenvalue problem
   (EVP) is then solved for example systems by setting the frequency of the
   wave solutions arbitrarily close to zero while seeking the axial preload
   which zeroes the EVP determinant. Numerical conditioning of the EVP
   problem is discussed as an essential step for ensuring successful
   application of the method. Notably, the method allows exact solutions to
   parameterized systems to be computed quickly and easily without the need
   for special discretization or mesh generation. This is exploited, for
   example, to find the optimal cross-brace location for an H-frame by
   varying a single parameter in the EVP determinant, avoiding the need to
   regenerate geometry and/or discretization (e.g., mesh topology). For a
   conservatively-loaded column, and for example portal and H-frames,
   results from the introduced approach show excellent agreement with known
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Loads prediction for helicopters is more complex than that for fixed
   wing aircraft given that the aerodynamic forces that produce the air
   vehicle's lift and moments are generated by rotating components (e.g.,
   the main and tail rotors). This paper examines rotor load content as a
   function of harmonics of the rotor angular speed. Accurate rotor loads
   prediction is driven by a clear understanding of the underlying physics
   of the problem. This understanding is important for several reasons.
   First, additive effects of multiple load components fed from the
   rotating frame to the fixed frame influence the vibratory response of
   the hub and fuselage. Second, structural fatigue life is driven by load
   magnitude as well as the number of applications of each load. The
   mechanics of load transference between the rotating and fixed frames
   will also be examined. Examples for 4-bladed and 7-bladed rotors will be
   presented. Definitions of cyclic/whirl (moment transference), collective
   (force transference), and reactionless/warp (zero force, zero moment
   transference) modes will be presented for a generic n-bladed rotor. US
   Army UH-60A Black Hawk flight test data will be examined. Blade lift,
   main rotor shaft bending, pushrod axial load, and fixed system servo
   loads will be derived and compared with measured UH-60A results. The
   intent of this paper is to provide clear insight into the nature of
   rotor load harmonic composition and load transference between the fixed
   and rotating frames for a rotor - two areas not well documented (and
   never visually described) in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The use of online, user-generated content for consumer preference
   modeling has been a recent topic of interest among the engineering and
   marketing communities. With the rapid growth of many different types of
   user-generate content sources, the tasks of reliable opinion extraction
   and data interpretation are critical challenges. This research
   investigates one of the largest and most-active content sources,
   Twitter, and its viability as a content source for preference modeling.
   Support Vector Machine (SVM is used for sentiment classification of the
   messages, and a Twitter query strategy is developed to categorize
   messages according to product attributes and attribute levels. Over
   7,000 messages are collected for a smartphone design case study. The
   preference modeling results are compared with those from a typical
   product review study, including over 2,500 product reviews. Overall, the
   results demonstrate that consumers do express their product opinions
   through Twitter; thus, this content source could potentially facilitate
   product design and decision-making via preference modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Interval is an alternative to probability distribution in quantifying
   epistemic uncertainty for reliability analysis when there is a lack of
   data to fit a distribution with good confidence. It only requires the
   information of lower and upper bounds. The propagation of uncertainty is
   analyzed by solving interval-valued constraint satisfaction problems
   (CSPs). By introducing logic quantifiers, quantified constraint
   satisfaction problems (QCSPs) can capture more semantics and engineering
   intent than CSPs. Sensitivity analysis (SA) takes into account of
   variations associated with the structure and parameters of interval
   constraints to study to which extent they affect the output. In this
   paper, a global SA method is developed for QCSPs, where the effects of
   quantifiers and interval ranges on the constraints are analyzed based on
   several proposed metrics, which indicate the levels of indeterminacy for
   inputs and outputs as well as unsatisfiability of constraints. Two
   vehicle design problems are used to demonstrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic differential equation (SDE) and Fokker-Planck equation (FPE)
   are two general approaches to describe the stochastic drift-diffusion
   processes. Solving SDEs relies on the Monte Carlo samplings of
   individual system trajectory, whereas FPEs describe the time evolution
   of overall distributions via path integral alike methods. The large
   state space and required small step size are the major challenges of
   computational efficiency in solving FPE numerically. In this paper, a
   generic continuous-time quantum walk formulation is developed to
   simulate stochastic diffusion processes. Stochastic diffusion in
   one-dimensional state space is modeled as the dynamics of an
   imaginary-time quantum system. The proposed quantum computational
   approach also drastically accelerates the path integrals with large step
   sizes. The new approach is compared with the traditional path integral
   method and the Monte Carlo trajectory sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional user experience (UX) models are mostly qualitative in terms
   of its measurement and structure. This paper proposes a quantitative UX
   model based on cumulative prospect theory. It takes a decision making
   perspective between two alternative design profiles. However, affective
   elements are well-known to have influence on human decision making, the
   prevailing computational models for analyzing and simulating human
   perception on UX are mainly cognition-based models. In order to
   incorporate both affective and cognitive factors in the decision making
   process, we manipulate the parameters involved in the cumulative
   prospect model to show the affective influence. Specifically, three
   different affective states are induced to shape the model parameters. A
   hierarchical Bayesian model with a technique called Markov chain Monte
   Carlo is used to estimate the parameters. A case study of aircraft cabin
   interior design is illustrated to show the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Much progress has been made in sustainable design over the past 20 years
   since the first publications on design for the environment started to
   appear in the mechanical engineering literature. Engineering design
   methods now attempt to include environmental considerations and
   Life-Cycle Analysis is a commonly used approach nowadays. Nevertheless,
   some fundamental problems seem to be recurring and remain unresolved.
   More so, some of these problems can have significant effects on the
   efficacy of design methods. Without consideration or even
   acknowledgement of these problems, proposed sustainable design methods
   may not bring us closer to sustainability at all. In this paper, we
   highlight a few of these recurring problems. Although true sustainable
   design should also include social and financial considerations, we will
   focus primarily on the environmental issues in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical methods used for studying design thinking have included verbal
   protocols, case studies, and controlled experiments. Studies have looked
   at the role of design methods, strategies, tools, environment,
   experience, and group dynamics. Early empirical studies were casual and
   exploratory with loosely defined objectives and informal analysis
   methods. Current studies have become more formal, factor controlled,
   aiming at hypothesis testing, using statistical DOE and analysis methods
   such as ANOVA. Popular pursuits include comparison of experts and
   novices, identifying and overcoming fixation, role of analogies,
   effectiveness of ideation methods, and other various tools. A variety of
   data may be collected, related to both the process and the outcome
   (designs).There are still no standards for designing, collecting and
   analyzing data, partly due to the lack of cognitive models and theories
   of design thinking. Data analysis is tedious and the rate of discoveries
   has been slow. Future studies may need to develop computer based data
   collection and automated analyses, which may facilitate collection of
   massive amounts of data with the potential of rapid advancement of the
   rate of discoveries and development of cognitive models of design
   thinking.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying applicable biological systems for engineering design remains
   a persistent challenge for bioinspired design. Previous researchers have
   proposed an Engineering-to-Biology thesaurus that allows designers to
   identify biological keywords that are functionally similar to terms in
   the Functional Basis. This work presents an experimental examination of
   the effectiveness of the Engineering-to-Biology thesaurus. A group of
   100 mechanical engineering students are presented with a simple design
   problem: to create a device to remove the husk and silk from ears of
   corn. The participants read passages drawn from a large biology corpus
   with keywords from the Engineering-to-Biology thesaurus and indicate
   which passages prompt some idea for solving the design problem. The
   analysis of student responses indicates that students' level of design
   training is not a significant factor in the number of analogies they
   found in the passages and that some non-random criteria is used to
   identify passages as useful for idea generation. Passages that rarely
   offer participants ideas can be reasonably well classified as either
   being too technical for a lay-reader to understand or lacking
   information on a biological system. Passages that typically offer ideas
   cannot be so easily classified. Finally, keywords from the
   Engineering-to-Biology thesaurus are examined to find that keywords very
   specific to biology and those that are very common words with multiple
   meanings are rarely contained in sentences that offer strong design
   inspiration.}},

Abstract = {{User experience (UX) design involves combination of different design
   attributes with their corresponding attribute levels to form different
   product profiles. This raises the issue of how to integrate
   corresponding UX of individual design attribute levels (i.e., partworth
   UX measures) into a holistic measure of UX of the entire product
   profile. Traditional methods often use a weighted sum of single
   partworth UX strategy without considering their dependence. This paper
   proposes to use utility copulas to accommodate the dependence of
   individual partworth UX measures. Single utility functions are
   constructed based on cumulative prospect theory, based on which
   multivariate Archimedean utility copulas are constructed using a nested
   structure based on the modularized attributes. A case study of aircraft

Abstract = {{Antenna miniaturization without deteriorating performance is challenging
   because the performance is bounded by fundamental limits depending on
   the size of the antenna. Magneto-dielectric materials, however, have
   been reported as providing new possibilities for antenna miniaturization

   method which is a cavity perturbation technique (CPT) with substrate
   integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity resonator is presented for extracting
   the properties of magneto-dielectric material. CPT formulas for
   extracting complex permittivity and complex permeability are explained
   and modification process using 3D EM simulation tool is discussed.
   Design and fabrication of SIW cavity resonators is presented. The
   frequency dependent properties of permittivity and permeability for
   synthesized magneto-dielectric material are extracted in the frequency
   range of 1-4 GHz. Microstrip patch antenna working at 1GHz on

Abstract = {{In this paper, a plasmonic nano-transceiver for wireless communication
   in the Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) is proposed, modeled and analyzed.
   The nano-transceiver is based on a High Electron Mobility Transistor
   (HEMT) built with a III-V semiconductor and enhanced with graphene. In
   transmission, when a voltage is applied between the HEMT drain and
   source, electrons are accelerated at the HEMT channel. This movement of
   electrons results in the excitation of a plasma wave which, on its turn,
   induces a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave on the graphene-based
   gate. The reciprocal behavior is achieved in reception. The performance
   of the proposed nano-transceiver is analytically investigated in
   transmission by coupling the hydrodynamic equations that govern the
   generation of plasma waves in the HEMT, with the dynamic complex
   conductivity of graphene and the Maxwell's equations. Numerical results
   show that the proposed nano-transceiver can effectively generate the
   necessary SPP wave to drive a plasmonic nanoantenna at Terahertz Band
   frequencies. Moreover, the utilization of the same nanomaterial as in
   the plasmonic nano-antennas is expected to ease the transceiver-antenna
   integration and opens the door to tunable compact nano-transceivers for
   Terahertz Band communication.}},

Abstract = {{The consideration of function is prevalent across numerous domains as a
   technique allowing complex problems to be abstracted into a form more
   readily solvable. In engineering design, functional models tend to be of
   a more generalized nature describing what a system should do based on
   customer needs, target specifications, objectives, and constraints.
   While the value of function in engineering design seems to be generally
   recognized, it remains a difficult concept to teach to engineering
   design students. In this paper, a study on the effectiveness of an
   algorithmic approach for teaching function and functional model
   generation is presented. This paper is a follow-up on to the 2012 ASME
   IDETC paper, An Algorithmic Approach to Teaching Functionality. This
   algorithmic approach uses a series of grammar rules to assemble function
   chains which then can be aggregated into a complete functional model. In
   this paper, the results of a study using the algorithmic approach at
   Texas A\&M in a graduate level design course are presented. The analysis
   of the results is discussed, and the preliminary evidence shows promise
   toward supporting our hypothesis that the algorithmic approach has a
   positive impact on student learning.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, Social Product Development (SPD) has emerged as
   a new trend to improve traditional engineering design and product
   realization processes. SPD involves the concepts of crowdsourcing, mass
   collaboration, customer co-creation, and most recently cloud-based
   design and manufacturing. One of the key characteristics of SPD is to
   apply social computing techniques (e.g., social networking sites and
   online communities) to support different phases of product realization
   processes. In line with this trend, our objective is to help our
   students become familiar with this paradigm shift and learn how to solve
   engineering design problems in a distributed and collaborative setting.
   Consequently, we have experimented with introducing some aspects of SPD
   into one of our graduate level engineering design courses. In this
   paper, we (1) introduce a SPD process that is implemented in the course,
   (2) present a case study from one of the design teams, and (3) share our
   experience and lessons with respect to the implementation of the SPD
   process.}},

   analysis, physical experimentation, and a classification processes are
   conducted in order to establish the analytical certification of its
   current design. Specifically, the finite element analysis and fatigue
   life analysis are performed and their results are validated compared to
   physical experimental results. The classification process is developed
   to estimate the probability of failure of the spider assembly in terms
   of stress and fatigue life. The relationship between the random
   quantities and structural responses of the spider assembly is
   established using probabilistic neural network and the support vector
   machine classifiers. The performance margin of the spider assembly is
   fully identified based on the estimated failure probability and

Abstract = {{The challenge of accurately predicting a phase transition in
   computer-aided nano-design is estimating the true value of transition
   rate, which is determined by the saddle point with the minimum energy
   barrier between stable states on the potential energy surface (PES). In
   this paper, a new algorithm for searching the minimum energy path (MEP)
   is presented. Unlike existing pathway search methods, the new algorithm
   is able to locate both the saddle points and local minima
   simultaneously. Therefore no prior knowledge of the precise positions
   for the reactant and product on the PES is required. In addition, the
   algorithm is able to search multiple transition paths on the PES
   simultaneously. In this method, a Bezier curve is used to represent each
   transition path. Starting from a single Bezier curve, multiple curves
   with ends connected can be generated during the search process. For each
   Bezier curve, the reactant and product states are located by minimizing
   the two end control points of the curve, while the transition pathway is
   refined by moving the intermediate control points of the curve in the
   conjugate directions. A curve subdivision scheme is developed so that
   multiple transition paths can be located. The algorithm is demonstrated
   by examples.}},

Abstract = {{Image reconstruction is the transformation process from some other data

   to construct the geometric boundary and internal material distribution
   of heterogeneous materials at the same time. A surfacelet transform is
   able to efficiently represent boundary information in images of
   materials. In this paper, new constrained-conjugate-gradient-based image
   reconstruction methods are proposed as the inverse surfacelet transform.
   With geometric constraints on internal boundaries of materials, the
   proposed method is able to automatically identify the locations and
   orientations of the internal boundaries based on prior knowledge so as

Abstract = {{The parallelization of silicon anisotropic etching simulation with the
   cellular automata (CA) model on graphics processing units (GPUs) is
   challenging, because the numbers of computational tasks in etching
   simulation dynamically change and the existing parallel CA mechanisms do
   not fit in GPU computation well. In this paper, an improved CA model,
   called clustered cell model, is proposed for GPU-based etching
   simulation. The model consists of clustered cells, each of which manages
   a scalable number of atoms. In this model, only the etching and update
   of states for the atoms on the etching surface and their unexposed
   neighbors are performed at each CA time step, whereas the clustered
   cells are reclassified in a longer time step. With this model, a crystal
   cell parallelization method is given, where clustered cells are
   allocated to threads on GPUs in the simulation. With the optimizations
   from the spatial and temporal aspects as well as a proper granularity,
   this method provides a faster process simulation. The proposed
   simulation method is implemented with the Compute Unified Device
   Architecture (CUDA) application programming interface. Several
   computational experiments are taken to analyze the efficiency of the

Abstract = {{Two types of uncertainty are generally recognized in modeling and

   incertitude due to the lack of perfect knowledge. Generalized interval
   probability is able to model both uncertainty components simultaneously,
   where epistemic uncertainty is quantified by the generalized interval in
   addition to the probabilistic measure. With the conditioning,
   independence, and Markovian property uniquely defined, the calculus
   structures in generalized interval probability resembles those in the
   classical probability theory. An imprecise Markov chain model is
   proposed with the ease of computation. A Krylov subspace projection
   method is developed to solve the interval master equation to simulate
   jump processes with finite state transitions under uncertainties. The
   state transitions with interval-valued probabilities can be simulated,
   which provides the lower and upper bound information of evolving

Abstract = {{Vehicles with better usability have become increasingly popular due to
   their ease of operations and safety for driving. However, the way how
   usability of in-vehicle system user interface is studied still needs
   improvement. This paper concerns how to use advanced computational,
   neurophysiology- and psychology-based tools and methodologies to
   determine affective (emotional) states and behavioral data of an
   individual in real time and in turn how to adapt the human-vehicle
   interaction to meet the user's cognitive needs based on this real-time
   assessment. Specifically, we set up a set of neuro-physiological
   equipment that is capable of collecting EEG, facial EMG
   (electromyography), skin conductance response, and respiration data and
   a set of motion sensing and tracking equipment that is capable of eye
   ball movement and objects that the user interacts. All hardware
   components and software is integrated into a cohesive augmented sensor
   platform that can perform as ``one coherent system{''} to enable
   multi-modal data processing and information inference for context-aware
   analysis of affective and cognitive states based on the rough set
   inference engine. Meanwhile subjective data is also recorded for
   comparison. A usability study of in-vehicle system UI is shown to
   demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Designing propulsion system architectures to meet next generation
   requirements requires many tradeoffs be made. These trades are often
   between performance, risk, and cost. For example, the core of an engine
   is the most expensive and highest risk area of a propulsion system
   design. However, a new core design provides the greatest flexibility in
   meeting future performance requirements. The decision to upgrade or
   redesign the core must be justified by comparison with other lower risk
   options. Furthermore, for turboshaft applications, the choice of
   compressor, whether axial or centrifugal, is a major decision and trade
   with the choice being heavily driven by both current and projected
   weight and performance requirements. This problem is confounded by
   uncertainty in potential benefits of technologies or future performance
   of components. To address these issues this research proposes the use of
   a Bayesian belief network (BBN) to extend the more traditional robust
   engine design process. This is done by leveraging forward and backward
   inference to identify engine upgrade paths that are robust to
   uncertainty in requirements performance. Prior beliefs on the different
   scenarios and technology uncertainty can be used to quantify risk.
   Forward inference can be used to compare different scenarios.
   The problem will be demonstrated using a two-spool turboshaft
   architecture modeled using the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation
   (NPSS) program. Upgrade options will include off the shelf, derivative
   engine (fixed core) with no technologies, derivative engine with new
   technologies, a new engine with no technologies, and a new engine with
   new technologies. The robust design process with a BBN will be used to
   identify which engine cycle and upgrade scenario is needed to meet
   performance requirements while minimizing cost and risk. To demonstrate
   how the choice of upgrade and cycle change with changes in requirements,
   studies are performed at different horsepower, ESFC, and power density
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{NASA is actively funding research into advanced, unconventional aircraft
   and engine architectures to achieve drastic reductions in vehicle fuel
   burn, noise, and emissions. One such concept is being explored by
   Boeing, General Electric, Virginia Tech, and Georgia Tech under the
   Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) project {[}1]. A major
   cornerstone of this research is evaluating the potential performance
   benefits that can be attributed to using hybrid electric propulsion.
   Hybrid electric propulsion in this context involves a non-Brayton power
   generation or storage source, such as a battery or a fuel cell, which
   can be used to provide additional propulsive energy to a conventional
   Brayton cycle powered turbofan engine. Employing additional power
   sources for thrust production increases the number of degrees of freedom
   both from a design and configuration standpoint and from an operational
   one. In order to assess and understand the myriad number of potential
   new configurations a modeling and simulation tool is needed; however,
   current state of the art propulsion modeling tools such as the Numerical
   Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) are not natively capable of
   assessing novel hybrid electric configurations.
   This research addresses the gap between hybrid electric propulsion and
   conventional cycle analysis tools by developing a suite of native NPSS
   elements suitable for hybrid electric engine cycle design and analysis.
   Elements have been developed for a fuel cell, battery, motor, generator,
   and electrical distribution system. loth room temperature and
   cryogenically cooled superconducting variants are developed. The
   elements are designed such that they can be seamlessly integated into
   existing NPSS cycle models to assess any system configuration or
   architecture the designer can envision.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in computing power have enabled designers to efficiently use
   Monte Carlo simulation to perform robust design analyses of engine
   systems. Unfortunately, the designer is now faced with the problem of
   being able to generate more data than he is capable of analyzing or
   understanding in any tractable manner. Traditional filtered Monte Carlo
   methods involve creating surrogate model representations (such as
   Artificial Neural Networks) of a physics based model in order to rapidly
   generate tens of thousands of model responses as design and technology
   input parameters are randomly varied within user defined distributions.
   The downside to this approach is that the designer is often faced with a
   large design space with which he must perform a significant amount of
   post processing to arrive at probabilities of meeting design
   requirements.
   This research enhances the traditional filtered Monte Carlo robust
   design approach by regressing surrogate responses of joint confidence
   intervals for metric responses of interest. Fitting surrogate responses
   of probabilistic confidence intervals rather than the raw response data
   changes the problem the engineer is able to answer. Using the new
   approach the question can be better phrased in terms of the probability
   of meeting certain requirements. For example, one will be able to ask,
   ``What engine overall pressure ratio is needed to achieve a 90\% chance
   of reaching a 25\% reduction in ISFC from the current state of the
   art?{''} The more traditional approach does not have the ability to
   include confidence in the process without significant post-processing.
   The process will be demonstrated using a two-spool axicentrifugal
   turboshaft architecture modeled using the Numerical Propulsion System
   Simulation (NPSS) program. The new robust design process will be used to
   demonstrate the probabilistic impacts of both technology and design
   variables on choosing a cycle that is robust to both growth in mission
   requirements and changes in anticipated technology levels as the design
   matures. More specifically, the research will present engine cycle
   variables including component pressure ratios and temperatures that
   provide for high probability of meeting notional system level
   requirements, such as ESFC, under different levels of technology
   uncertainty. Technology uncertainty will be defined in terms of
   available material properties and component efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of a spark kernel ejected by a sunken fire igniter into a
   turbulent, fuel-air stratified cross-flow was studied both
   experimentally and using a model in a configuration that is similar to
   the conditions found in turbine engine combustors. This study allows for
   variations in the transit time of the kernel across a uniform
   non-flammable region, before entering a second stream containing a
   flammable fuel-air mixture. High speed schlieren and emission imaging
   systems are used to visualize the evolution of the kernel and determine
   the probability of ignition based on measurements over many spark
   events. Experiments are performed for a range of mean velocities,
   transit times, inlet (preheat) temperatures, flammable zone equivalence
   ratios, and non-flammable zone equivalence ratios. In addition to the
   typical dependence of ignition on the equivalence ratio of the flammable
   mixture, the results indicate the strong influence of the kernel transit
   time and the inlet flow temperature on the probability of ignition. The
   entrainment between the kernel and the surrounding flow appears to be
   primarily controlled by the kernel ejection-induced flowfield.
   Reduced-order modeling suggests that the lowering of the kernel
   temperature associated with entrainment of the non-flammable mixture
   significantly reduces the ignition probability, and leads to the
   conclusion that the presence of fuel close to the igniter is necessary
   to ensure reliable ignition under adverse conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate building energy technology portfolio evaluation approach is

   Open source, parametric building modeling tools have recently matured to
   enable system-level building energy analysis at high fidelities. It is
   observed that these modeling tools usually only analyze energy savings
   and are not concerned with other criteria often factored into the choice
   of an energy technology portfolio. This paper `presents an approach to
   constructing a parametric, physics-based, building-specific, business
   case analysis tool for quantifying multi-criteria performance of
   building energy technology portfolios. The resulting environment, which
   is used to build up a portfolio step-by-step and analyze performance
   trades, is explained through a case study. The application presented is
   for a building energy retrofit, comparing building energy consumption
   before and after application of technologies from a set of contenders,
   but it can be extended to the design of new buildings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel wet etching method, named metal-assisted chemical
   etching (MaCE), is applied for through silicon vias (TSVs) fabrications.
   The influence of key experimental parameters in MaCE, including
   catalyst, etchant and dimension of TSVs are discussed. Especially, the
   type, geometry and morphology of catalyst are varied and the results are
   compared. A high etching rate over 10 mu m/min and a high aspect ratio
   over 100 are observed in sub-micron scale TSV etching. The presented
   data demonstrates that MaCE is a promising candidate for TSVs etching
   with high speed, high aspect ratio capability, submicron capability and
   low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Antenna size has fundamental limits based on the frequency of operation
   and performance required. In the past, various methods have been
   developed to miniaturize antennas with limited success.
   Magneto-dielectric materials, however, have been reported as providing
   new opportunities for effective antenna size reduction in many recent
   studies. In this paper, a novel material characterization method which
   is a cavity perturbation technique (CPT) with substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) cavity resonator is presented for measuring electric and
   magnetic properties of magneto-dielectric material. CPT formulas for
   extracting complex permittivity and complex permeability are explained
   and modification process using 3D EM simulation tool is discussed.
   Design and fabrication of SIW cavity resonators is presented. The
   frequency dependent properties of permittivity and permeability for
   synthesized magneto-dielectric material are extracted in the frequency
   range of 1-4 GHz. Planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) working at 1GHz on
   magneto-dielectric substrate has been designed and simulated in this

Abstract = {{As complex multi-layered packaging becomes more common in
   microelectronic design, delamination remains a prominent failure
   mechanism due to coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch. Numerous
   studies have investigated interfacial cracking in microelectronic
   packages. These studies commonly use classical interfacial fracture
   mechanics analyses, but such analyses require knowledge of starter crack
   size, locations, and propagation paths. Cohesive zone theory has been
   identified as an alternative method for modeling crack propagation and
   delamination without the need for a pre-existing crack. This paper
   presents a framework to determine mixed-mode cohesive zone parameters
   using experimental methods. We demonstrate this method by characterizing
   cohesive zone parameters for a copper/epoxy molding compound interface.
   Fully characterized cohesive zone elements can be placed at interfaces
   in finite-element models of microelectronic systems to simulate loading
   and failure in mixed-mode conditions.}},

Abstract = {{For current light-emitting diode (LED) packaging technology, one of the
   key challenges is light extraction, due to the difference in index of
   refraction between LED chip and air. Silicone nanocomposites have been
   widely researched for applications in LED encapsulant to reduce the
   difference in refractive index. Silicone is desirable for LED
   encapsulant because of its optical transparency and photothermal
   resistance. However, less attention has been paid to the elastic
   properties of silicone which would enable a stretchable LED encapsulant.
   Hence the objective of this study is to examine the stretch ability of
   silicone/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites for LED packaging. Wurtzite ZnO
   nanoparticles were prepared in colloids and subjected to silane
   treatment. Effects of both ex situ and in situ silane treatment on the
   final mechanical and optical properties of the silicone/ZnO
   nanocomposites were examined. Silicone/ZnO nanocomposites exhibit
   significantly more compliant stress-strain behavior than silicone
   control; silicone/silane-treated ZnO nanocomposites, in particular,
   exhibit more serrated stress-strain curves. Silicone/silane-treated ZnO
   nanocomposites exhibit higher transmittance than silicone/unmodified ZnO
   nanocomposites, indicating improved dispersion of the nanoparticles. The
   silicone/5\% silane-treated ZnO nanocomposite using in situ method is
   able to deform over a range of up to 160\%; its film (similar to 40
   microns thick) exhibits transmittance >70\% throughout the visible
   range.}},

Abstract = {{As microelectronic industry moves toward stacking of dies to achieve
   greater performance in smaller footprint, there are several reliability
   concerns when assembling the stacked dies on current organic substrates.
   These concerns include excessive warpage, interconnect cracking, die
   cracking, and others. Silicon interposers are being developed to
   assemble the stacked dies, and then to assemble the silicon interposers
   onto organic substrates. Although such an approach could address
   stacked-die to interposer reliability concerns, there are still
   reliability concerns between the silicon interposer and the organic
   substrate. The ongoing work at the Packaging Research Center is
   exploring the use of glass substrates as a superior alternative to
   organics in I/Os and to silicon in electrical performance. In addition,
   glass provides intermediate and tunable coefficient of thermal expansion
   between silicon and organic, good mechanical rigidity, large-area panel
   processing for low cost, planarity, and better electrical properties.
   However, glass is brittle and low in thermal conductivity, and there is
   very little work in existing literature to examine glass as a potential
   substrate material. In this paper, we examine large glass panels as
   substrates for microelectronic packages through experiments and
   simulation. Starting with a 150 x 150 mm glass panel with a thickness in
   the range of 100 to 300 um mu m, we have built alternating layers of
   dielectric and copper on both sides of the panel. The panels go through
   typical cleanroom processes such as lithography, electroplating, etc.
   Upon fabrication, the panels are diced into individual substrates of 25
   x 25 mm, and a 10 mm x 10 mm Si die with a peripheral staggered bump
   pitch of 80/40 um mu m is then assembled on the glass substrate by
   thermocompression bonding with a pre-applied no-flow underfill. The
   warpage of the flip-chip assembly is measured. In parallel to the
   experiments, numerical models have been developed. These models account
   for temperature-dependent properties of the dielectric as well as
   viscoplastic behavior of the solder. The models also mimic material
   addition and etching through element ``birth-and-death{''} approach. The
   warpage from the models has been compared against experimental
   measurements for glass substrates with flip-chip assembly. It is seen
   that the glass substrates provide significantly lower warpage compared
   to organic substrates, and thus could be a potential candidate for
   future 3D and 2.5D systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling, design, fabrication and
   characterization, up to 30 GHz, of low loss and high aspect-ratio 55 mu
   psi m diameter through package vias (TPVs) in 300 mu m thick glass
   interposers. These TPVs were fabricated using a novel, high-throughput,
   focused electrical discharge method and low cost panel-based double-side
   metallization processes. Such a glass interposer is targeted at two
   emerging applications, (a) large 30 mm to 60 mm body size 2.5D
   interposers to achieve 28.8 Gbps logic-memory bandwidth and (b) 3D
   interposers for mm wave applications at 28 GHz local multipoint
   distribution service (LMDS) for future 5G networks. Accurate measurement
   of the electrical performance of fine pitch metallized through vias in
   glass up to 30 GHz and beyond is critical for both these high
   performance interposer applications. In this paper, two novel
   characterization methods are applied: 1) the
   short-circuit-andopen-circuit method and 2) the dual-via-chain method.
   The resistance and the inductance of a single via are extracted by using
   a short-circuit structure along with an open-circuit structure. At 10
   GHz, the values for the series resistance and inductance have average
   values of 0.1 Omega and 160 pH respectively. Long dual-via chains were
   designed to evaluate their performance in insertion loss, delay and eye
   diagram. The insertion loss achieved with the longest dual-via chain was
   found to be less than 1 dB/cm up to 30 GHz with only a 6.2 ps delay in
   the TPVs, and the simulations indicate a wide open eye.}},

Abstract = {{Isolation of supply noise between disparate circuit blocks is crucial.
   When powered by the same voltage supply, the switching noise created at
   the supply node of the digital devices can couple into the power path of
   the RF circuitry and cause significant performance degradation.
   Electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures, ferrite beads, and split
   planes are all commonly used to mitigate this problem, but each have
   drawbacks which can be detrimental to signal and power integrity.
   Furthermore, previous works in {[}1] and {[}2] have shown that by
   utilizing a power transmission line (PTL) in place of a power plane, one
   can significantly reduce the effect of switching noise in high speed
   digital I/Os by preventing the occurrence of return path
   discontinuities.
   The method proposed here extends the concept of the PTL to mitigate the
   effect of supply noise coupling between a set of digital I/O buffers and
   an RF low noise amplifier (LNA). In this work, the approach is to place
   a notch filter with a bandstop frequency corresponding to center
   frequency of the LNA in the power supply path of the LNA. Therefore, any
   frequency content of the switching noise close to operating frequency of
   the LNA is prevented from entering into its supply node. A board-level
   test vehicle was built to demonstrate this concept with off-the-shelf
   components. Through theory, simulation, and lab measurements, is has
   been shown that utilizing this method can reduce the amount of the
   switching noise that couples into the output of the LNA by 84\%.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium nitride (GaN) technology has emerged as a frontrunner for high
   power electronics applications. By performing a survey of wire-bond and
   flip-chip-packaged GaN HEMTs on either AlN (a ceramic with high thermal
   conductivity) or LCP (an organic polymer with low thermal conductivity),
   the thermal and electrical limits of each package are established.
   Flip-chip packaging has the benefit of improving the bandwidth of a
   hybrid PA. Dies that were wire-bonded on AlN showed best performance,
   and were able to dissipate more than 6 W of power while remaining below
   the maximum operating junction temperature. On the other hand,
   flip-chipped devices on LCP were severely limited by thermal effects,
   even at a 10\% duty cycle. This study motivates the need for advanced
   packaging techniques, such as integrated microfluidics or backside
   heat-sinking, in order to make LCP a viable material for high-power
   applications.}},

   the high field breakdown of carbon nanotube (CNT) network thin film

   angle and length distribution on the breakdown process caused by
   excessive self-heating. We examine relevant breakdown characteristics
   such as the peak current and corresponding voltage and power in relation
   to these two network parameters. We find that the breakdown behavior can
   significantly vary with respect to the CNT length and alignment
   distribution even when the network density is kept the same. Results
   suggest that an optimum alignment (65) can be found for a network with
   constant CNT lengths to obtain higher current/power without setting off
   an early breakdown. When both CNT length and alignment angle are varied,
   we find that networks with higher average CNT length have lower optimum
   alignment such that doubling the average CNT length lowers the optimum
   alignment angle by half Therefore these network parameters need to be
   carefully selected to achieve greater thermal reliability and higher

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) chip stacking is a promising approach for high
   performance microsystems. Such vertical integration could increase the
   clock frequency and reduce the signal delay. During operation, the input
   signal and the resulting input power change with time. Realistic power
   maps on active chip tiers produce highly non-uniform heat flux patterns
   with hotspots, which change with time. In this paper, a transient
   compact model of a multi-layer chip stack subjected to time dependent
   power map was developed. Inter-tier single phase microfluidic cooling
   with a pin fin array was used to enhance heat transfer. The validity of
   the compact model was confirmed by comparison with full computational
   fluid dynamics/heat transfer (CFD/HT) modeling. It was found that the
   transient compact model ran thousand times faster than the CFD/HT model.
   The maximum deviation between the two models was 1 degrees C. The
   compact model was then used to analyze the transient thermal response of
   a 4 layer dual core stack of Penryn microprocessors when a total power
   of 172.4 W. with a 300 W/cm(2) hot spot was suddenly applied. The
   hotspot temperature rise approaches 35 degrees C, at a steady state time
   of about 0.015 s. The temperature rise of bottom tier was always higher
   than the other three tiers during the transient process because it has
   only single side cooling, while other tiers have double sided cooling.
   Also, different power maps and flow patterns, including parallel and
   counter flow for different layers were investigated. It was found that
   controlling the flow in different layers individually instead of
   applying the same flow conditions could achieve better thermal
   performance and energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we report on a field investigation into airflow management
   challenges in high density data centers. This field investigation has
   also served to validate laboratory investigaticins into high density air
   cooling issues. In data centers with significant power consumption, and
   consequently high cooling loads per rack, high volumes of room airflow
   are required to Meet server cooling airflow requirements. These volumes
   of air can be difficult to deliver in raised floor hot aisle / cold
   aisle layouts. The velocity of the airflow is such that it creates a
   negative pressure near the bottom of the rack. This negative pressure
   entrains air from under and behind the rack, causing recirculation and
   warmer air being provided to the servers at the base of the rack. This
   can cause operational problems and server performance impacts. This
   phenomenon has been demonstrated in previous papers reporting on test
   data using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The current
   work validates those studies by looking at airflow, infrared
   thermography, and actual IT performance while the under rack
   recirculation flows are occurring. Additionally, we demonstrate
   significant improvement by employing rigorous airflow management
   practices. We also discuss the limitations of current CFD modeling, the
   majority of which does not have sufficient grid-wise resolution to
   capture the problem. Further we discuss typical operational conditions
   that have suppressed the problem (or perhaps the awareness of) to date.
   Finally, the paper recommends best practices to mitigate the problem in
   high density data centers.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile social services utilize profile matching to help users find

   property-preserving encryption (PPE). First, we illustrate that PPE
   should not be considered secure when directly used on social attribute
   data due to its key-sharing problem and information leakage problem.
   Then, we address the aforementioned problems of applying PPE to social
   network data and develop an efficient and verifiable privacy-preserving
   profile matching scheme. We implement both the client and server
   portions of S-MATCH and evaluate its performance under three real-world
   social network datasets. The results show that S-MATCH can achieve at
   least one order of magnitude better computational performance than the
   techniques that use homomorphic encryption.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an analysis of a new class of domain names:
   disposable domains. We observe that popular web applications, along with
   other Internet services, systematically use this new class of domain
   names. Disposable domains are likely generated automatically,
   characterized by a ``one-time use{''} pattern, and appear to be used as
   a way of ``signaling{''} via DNS queries. To shed light on the
   pervasiveness of disposable domains, we study 24 days of live DNS
   traffic spanning a year observed at a large Internet Service Provider.
   We find that disposable domains increased from 23.1\% to 27.6\% of all
   queried domains, and from 27.6\% to 37.2\% of all resolved domains
   observed daily. While this creative use of DNS may enable new
   applications, it may also have unanticipated negative consequences on
   the DNS caching infrastructure, DNSSEC validating resolvers, and passive
   DNS data collection systems.}},

   this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving and fine-grained power

   provable privacy and an accuracy guarantee based on distributed

   real-world power usage dataset, which validates the efficiency and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a K-band 5-bit vector modulator phase rotator. A
   fully differential based on a 6-port folded transformer I/Q generation
   passive network generates the quadrature signals at K-band with low
   loss, wide bandwidth and high precision, all within an ultracompact
   foot-print; this makes the phase rotator design especially suitable for
   large-scaled high-density phased array systems. Two linear digital VGAs
   scale the quadrature signals to achieve the desired vector phase
   interpolation. As a proof-of-concept design, we implement the phase
   rotator in a SiGe BiCMOS process within a compact chip area of only 310
   mu m by 380 mu m. It achieves -3 dB bandwidth of 6 GHz at the center
   frequency of 23.5 GHz. The maximum RMS phase error is only 2 degrees for
   phase interpolation over the full 360 degrees phase span. It consumes 4
   mA from 2.5 V and the measured P1dB and IIP3 are -16 dBm and -5.5 dBm,
   respectively. Leveraging the dense phase interpolation points to
   calibrate undesired I/Q mismatch is also demonstrated, which shows the
   robustness of the design.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 314 GHz transmitter and receiver chipset which is
   implemented in an advanced SiGe HBT platform, and which has on-chip
   antennas. The transmitter uses an active antenna structure, where the
   generated on-chip signal is directly fed into the antenna. The receiver
   consists of a novel sub-harmonic resistive mixer with an on-chip
   high-power differential signal source feeding the LO port. A test link
   which directly connects the transmitter to the receiver was also
   implemented as a reference for characterization. This reference circuit
   enables a simple and accurate measurement method for conversion loss and
   antenna gain by omitting external high frequency signal sources. To
   further facilitate the characterization, the utilized on-chip signals
   were implemented and tested separately as well. The receiver achieves
   22.5 dB conversion loss and the transmitter generates a signal power of
   -8 dBm at 314 GHz. On-die end-fire antennas were designed for both
   transmit and receive paths, and utilize a substrate etching technology
   to boost performance. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
   fully-integrated and compact sub-mmW transceiver implementations using
   SiGe technology.}},

Abstract = {{The sidelobe level of a base station antenna is one of the important
   parameters to describe the performance of an antenna array. Given a
   required value of the sidelobe level, we can obtain a set of initial
   phases, and then further get a set of cable lengths. However, a
   tolerance (or error range) associated with manufacturing techniques will
   introduce an error in each cable length, thereby influencing the
   sidelobe level. This paper uses the knowledge of probability and
   mathematical statistics to make a statistical analysis for the
   reliability of the first sidelobe of the antenna array based on Monte
   Carlo simulations. We also obtain a distribution curve of reliabilities
   of the first sidelobe versus phase tolerances, which can bring great
   convenience for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{A significant market need has been identified for an improved assist
   device for transferring mobility limited patients, particularly those
   who are heavier or bariatric. This paper discusses our needs assessment
   for a new patient transfer assist device (PTAD), an initial design for a
   multiple degree of freedom hydraulically actuated device, and possible
   solutions for the caretaker interface design. The relevant patient
   population includes those with spinal cord injuries, neuromuscular
   disorders, and the elderly; most patients are wheelchair users and
   unable to perform independent transfers. The caretaker interface design
   for the PTAD presents a unique challenge in terms of human-machine
   collaborative manipulation, as well as control of a powerful and
   intrinsically stiff machine in a delicate environment with both the
   caretaker and patient in the workspace. This paper presents a needs
   assessment to determine the specific problems with the antiquated
   current market patient lifts, as well as user input on proposed
   improvements. It also presents the design of a functional first
   prototype PTAD, a mechanical simulation, preliminary simulation results
   on an impedance control approach, and next steps toward design and

Abstract = {{An adaptive multi-loop mode (AMLM) imaging of atomic force microscope
   (AFM) is proposed. Due to its superior image quality and less sample
   disturbances, tapping mode (TM) imaging is currently the de facto most
   widely used imaging technique. However, the speed of TM-imaging is
   substantially limited, and becoming the major bottleneck of this
   technique. The proposed AMLM-imaging overcomes the limits of TM-imaging
   by utilizing control techniques to substantially increase the speed of
   TM-imaging while preserving the advantages of TM-imaging. The
   AMLM-imaging is tested and demonstrated through imaging a PtBA sample in
   experiments, and the experiment results demonstrated that the image
   quality over large-size imaging (50 pm by 25 mu m) achieved at the scan
   rate of 25 Hz is at the same level of that when using TM-imaging at 1
   Hz, while the probe-sample interaction force is smaller than that of the
   TM-imaging at 2.5 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumatic systems possess inherent compliance and potentially variable
   stiffness that make them an appealing actuator choice for tracking
   applications where contact and interaction are likely. However, good
   control of pneumatic systems is impeded by discontinuous and nonlinear
   dynamics, especially compliance and friction. The most successful
   previous solutions have either applied high-gain PD or sliding mode
   control. These achieve tracking control for compliant systems by
   transforming them into stiffer ones. Model predictive control can better
   balance precision tracking with compliance (low output impedance), so
   that the system is safer in case of collision disturbance. It can be
   coupled with a predictive observer that estimates friction as a known
   disturbance. The estimate is incorporated into the optimization,
   improving friction compensation for pneumatics, which has slow dynamics
   that do not react quickly enough with traditional feedforward
   compensation. Finally, predictive control enables constrained
   finite-time optimization, driving the system closer to its peak
   performance capability.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic Programming (DP) technique is an effective algorithm to find the
   global optimum. However when applying DP for finite state problems, if
   the state variables are discretized, it increases the cumulative errors
   and leads to suboptimal results. In this paper we develop and present a
   new DP algorithm that overcomes the above problem by eliminating the
   need to discretize the state space by the use of sets. We show that the
   proposed DP leads to a globally optimal solution for a discrete time
   system by minimizing a cost function at each time step. To show the
   efficacy of the proposed DP, we apply it to optimize the fuel economy of
   the series and parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle (REV) architectures and
   the case study of Chevrolet Volt 2012 and the Honda Civic 2012 for the
   series and parallel HEV's respectively are considered. Simulations are
   performed over predefined drive cycles and the results of the proposed
   DP are compared to previous DP algorithm (DPdis). The proposed DP showed
   an average improvement of 2.45\% and 21.29\% over the DPdis algorithm
   for the series and the parallel REV case respectively over the drive
   cycles considered. We also propose a real time control strategy (RTCS)
   for online implementation based on the concept of Preview Control. The
   RTCS proposed is applied for the series and parallel HEV's over the
   drive cycles and the results obtained are discussed.}},

   inherent oscillatory nature and sluggish response. Tasks are made even
   harder when the operator moves around the workspace and changes his/her

   independent of operator orientation and location. When the operators

Abstract = {{In numerous applications of lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based devices,
   such as dynamic actuation, vibration control, sensing, and energy
   harvesting, inherent nonlinearities are inevitably pronounced for a
   broad range of mechanical and electrical excitation levels. Even in the
   absence of any geometric nonlinearity, researchers observed and reported
   nonlinear behavior in PZT-based devices for moderate-to-high excitation
   levels. Over the past two decades, the softening nonlinearities have
   been attributed to different phenomena by different research groups,
   such as purely elastic nonlinear terms and coupling nonlinearity.
   Dissipative effects of quadratic order have been observed but often
   attributed to air damping in symmetric structures. In an effort to
   develop a global nonlinear, non-conservative modeling framework, we
   combined elastic, coupling, and dissipative nonlinearities to explore
   primary resonance behavior in bimorph cantilevers for problems of
   mechanical and electrical excitation. We use this model to characterize
   the nonlinearities in piezoelectric bimorphs for energy harvesting with
   a focus on a symmetric brass-reinforced PZT-5A sample under base
   excitation. Specifically we point out the importance of quadratic
   nonlinearities in both stiffness and damping. Coupling and higher-order
   elastic nonlinearities from the electric enthalpy are observed to become
   effective only for the highest excitation levels close to physical
   limits of the device with high linear stiffness tested in this work.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel design of an eddy-current sensing system
   with an array of high-accuracy solid magnetic sensors for duplex lathe

   measured magnetic flux density simultaneously measures the in-feed

   paper provides the design concept and operational principle of the
   eddy-current sensing system along with the theory for designing the
   sensor and analyzing its performance. As eddy current cannot be measured
   directly, results of a numerical investigation based on finite-element
   analyses are presented with illustrative examples offering new physical
   insights into the effects of optimal design parameters on the magnetic
   and electric field distributions of the induced eddy-current. The

   classifier for operator state estimation is used in an interaction
   system with a one degree-of-freedom haptic device. Results from
   performance (e.g. speed, accuracy) trials investigating a stochastic
   approach to position control are presented in comparison to other
   standard approaches. This research serves a basis for the exploration of

Abstract = {{A group of eutectic ternary halide salts were surveyed and studied for
   the objective of developing a high temperature heat transfer fluid with
   a freezing point below 250 degrees C and a low vapor pressure, below 1.0
   atm, at temperatures up to 800 degrees C. The studied salts include: 1)
   NaCl-KCl-ZnCl2 with a mole fractions of 18.6\%-21.9\%-59.5\% and a
   melting point of t(m)=213 degrees C; 2) NaCl-KCl-ZnCl2 with a mole
   fraction of 13.4\%-33.7\%-52.9\% and a melting point of t(m)=204 degrees
   C; and 3) NaCl-KCl-ZnCl2 with mole fraction of 13.8\%-41.9\%-44.3\% and
   a melting point of t(m)=229 degrees C. Vapor pressures of these salts at
   different temperatures were experimentally obtained using an in-house
   developed test facility. The results show that vapor pressures of all
   the three eutectic molten salts are below 1.0 atm at a temperature of
   800 degrees C. The salt of ZnCl2-KCl-NaCl in mole faction of
   44.3\%-41.9\%-13.8\% has lowest vapor pressure which is only about 1.0
   atm even at a temperature of 900 degrees C. Viscosities of these salts
   were measured in the temperature range from after melting to 850 degrees
   C. At low temperatures near their melting points of the salts, the
   viscosities are about 16 x 10(-3)Pa s, while at high temperatures above
   700 degrees C the viscosities are around 4 x 10(-3)Pa s, which is
   satisfactorily low to serve as heat transfer fluid for circulation in a
   CSP system. Both the vapor pressure and the viscosities of the studied
   three eutectic salts demonstrated satisfaction to serve as high
   temperature heat transfer fluids. Other thermal and transport properties
   of these salts are expected to be reported in the future for screening
   out a satisfactory high temperature heat transfer fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers at Georgia Tech (GT) have recently begun the GT Smart Energy
   Campus initiative, which combines campus energy metering data with
   physics-based modeling and simulation to create an integrated analysis
   environment for campus energy. The environment consists of a digital
   representation of campus, which supports situational awareness, as well
   as a virtual test bed for analyzing emerging energy technologies and
   future scenarios. The first year of the initiative has focused on
   evaluating campus energy metering data using visual analytics and
   statistical analysis techniques. Data analysis is presented as having
   value for two main uses: (1) as attention-directing information to help
   system operators diagnose anomalies and (2) as a precursor to modeling
   and simulation (M\&S) in future phases of the Smart Energy Campus
   initiative. The environment is explained using the initial study scoping
   of the campus thermal energy generation and distribution systems.
   Furthermore, a modeling and simulation approach leveraging the Modelica
   M\&S language is described, and preliminary results in using it to
   represent the campus chilled water system are presented.}},

Abstract = {{At a fundamental level, the thermo-mechanical response of metals in
   dynamic deformation processes such as machining is governed by
   dislocation processes and associated microstructure evolution. However,
   the most commonly used material constitutive models in machining are
   phenomenological (e.g. Johnson-Cook) or semi-phenomenological (e.g.
   Zerilli-Armstrong) and do not explicitly account for the dependence of
   material flow stress on dislocation and microstructure evolution
   processes in a unified manner. The fidelity of machining simulation
   models is dependent on the amount of micro-scale physics captured in the
   development of the material constitutive law, microstructure evolution
   law(s), and the unifying scheme integrating microstructure evolution
   into the constitutive law. This paper presents a unified material
   modeling approach that explicitly accounts for dislocation and
   microstructure evolution processes underlying the finite deformation
   process. The corresponding evolution laws are formulated and integrated
   into the constitutive model, which is derived from thermal activation
   theory and is an additive decomposition of athermal and thermal
   components of flow stress representing the effects of long-range and
   short-range obstacles to dislocation motion, respectively. The unified
   scheme is implemented as a user-defined subroutine in the AdvantEdge
   (TM) software (Third Wave Systems LLC) and used to simulate the
   orthogonal cutting of OFHC copper.}},

Abstract = {{The ease of entering a car is one of the important ergonomic factors
   that car manufacturers consider during the process of car design. This
   has motivated many researchers to investigate factors that affect
   discomfort during ingress. The patterns of motion during ingress may be
   related to discomfort, but the analysis of motion is challenging. In
   this paper, a modeling framework is proposed to use the motions of body
   landmarks to predict subjectively reported discomfort during ingress.
   Foot trajectories are used to identify a set of trials with a consistent
   right-leg-first strategy. The trajectories from 20 landmarks on the
   limbs and torso are parameterized using B-spline basis functions. Two
   group selection methods, group nonnegative garrote (GNNG) and stepwise
   group selection (SGS), are used to filter and identify the trajectories
   that are important for prediction. Finally, a classification and
   prediction model is built using support vector machine (SVM). The
   performance of the proposed framework is then evaluated against simpler,
   more common prediction models.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud-based manufacturing (CBM), also referred to as cloud
   manufacturing, has the potential to allow manufacturing enterprises to
   be rapidly scaled up and down by crowdsourcing manufacturing tasks or
   sub-tasks. To improve the efficiency of the crowdsourcing process, the
   material flow of CBM systems needs to be managed so that several
   manufacturing processes can be executed simultaneously. Further, the
   scalability of manufacturing capacity in CBM needs to be designed,
   analyzed, and planned in response to rapidly changing market demands.
   The objective of this paper is to introduce a stochastic petri nets
   (SPNs)-based approach for modeling and analyzing the concurrency and
   synchronization of the material flow in CBM systems. The proposed
   approach is validated through a case study of a car suspension module.
   Our results have shown that the SPN-based approach helps analyze the
   structural and behavioral properties of a CBM system and verify
   manufacturing performance.}},

Abstract = {{Using grinding fluid is the most common strategy to generate cooling and
   lubrication during the grinding process. However, economic and
   environmental drawbacks have been noticed for conventional flood
   cooling. MQL, which is to apply minimum amount of lubricant directly
   into the contact zone, is an alternative to deal with those concerns. In
   order to advance the MQL technique into practical manufacturing
   situations, understanding of the process and evaluation of the
   performance is necessary. This paper presents the predictive modeling of
   MQL grinding force through considerations of boundary lubrication
   condition, single grit interaction, wheel topography, material
   properties, and dynamic effects. The friction coefficient was first
   calculated based on boundary lubrication theory. Subsequently, the
   single grit interaction is studied considering both chip formation and
   ploughing mechanisms. Then the undeformed chip thickness distribution
   and dynamic grit density has been calculated for extrapolating the
   single grit interaction to the whole wheel. Finally, the predicted
   tangential and normal forces were presented and compared to surface
   grinding experiment data.}},

   cost and complexity of error compensation while other redundancy based

   compensation methods for widely used linear analog circuits are
   developed in this research. Trial and error based compensation learning
   methods combined with the use of less than minimum distance codes are
   used for failure tolerance. This results in significant hardware savings
   over prior correction schemes with minimal increase in error correction
   latency. It is shown how dual failures in analog circuits, not possible

Abstract = {{It has been argued that a value-driven approach can potentially
   eliminate troubling issues that arise during the design process, such as
   cost and schedule overrun, by taking a holistic perspective on how
   individual design decisions impact high-level attributes of concern.
   However, value-driven approaches can be difficult to implement in
   practice, at least partly because supporting tools and methods have not
   yet been sufficiently developed. Additionally, due to the multitude of
   researchers investigating the concept of value, it can be difficult to
   unambiguously characterize what defines an effective value model.
   In this paper, we attempt to address these issues by first reviewing the
   literature to produce a clear and concise enumeration of the
   characteristics of effective value models. Next, a three-stage
   systematic method is presented as a tool to aid in the specification of
   value models. To demonstrate the use of the method, a case study is
   presented that investigates the conceptual design of a multiple-input
   multiple output hybrid energy system.}},

Abstract = {{A typical way of managing the inherent complexity of contemporary
   technical systems is to study them from different viewpoints. Such
   viewpoints are defined by a variety of factors, including the concerns
   of interest, level of abstraction, observers and context. Views
   conforming to these viewpoints are typically highly interrelated since
   the concerns addressed in the different viewpoints overlap semantically.
   Such overlaps can lead to inconsistencies. The challenge is to identify
   and resolve that is, manage such inconsistencies. This paper introduces
   an approach to identifying inconsistencies within the context of
   Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In current practice,
   inconsistencies are typically only discovered after long time intervals,
   e.g., during reviews. This can result in costly rework or even mission
   failure. Therefore, actively checking for inconsistencies, and doing so
   in a continuous fashion, can be valuable. We investigate the hypothesis
   that all models can be represented by graphs and that inconsistencies
   can be identified by means of pattern matching. We show that this
   process is equivalent to inferring inconsistencies by means of deductive
   reasoning. Finally, we present the results of a proof-of-concept
   implementation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Tradespace exploration supports the Systems Engineering Technical
   Management Process of Decision Analysis by identifying compromises,
   revealing opportunities, and communicating the impacts of decisions
   across a system's development lifecycle. Critical program decisions are
   made based on the outcomes of trades; trades being performed with
   multiple types and quantities of data coming out of tools and methods
   employing qualitative and quantitative analyses. Tradespace exploration
   for Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) is envisioned to coalesce
   pertinent information tuned to specific decision makers, at the
   appropriate time, presenting a holistic view of decision impacts on
   required system capabilities. This study provides an ERS view of
   tradespace exploration, which reveals that having a valid set of
   attributes, and an understanding of how a cross-section of tools can
   satisfy them, is insufficient - what is needed is a deeper understanding
   of how these tools are used and, more importantly, how they can be used
   when performing tradespace exploration in support of the Decision
   Analysis Process. Gaining this understanding will enable users to better
   assess if they possess the appropriate tradespace exploration tools. A
   holistic view of 81 candidate tradespace exploration tools is provided.
   This study seeks to address a fundamental aspect of tradespace
   exploration by assembling a ``best common practice{''} process for their
   requirements, identifying a set of attributes that defines an ideal
   tradespace exploration tool, and surveying existing tools that satisfy
   these attributes. In this way, a set of tools can be selected to enable
   the ERS tradespace vision on a particular project. A paradigm shift
   towards common tradespace methods, tools, cost models, and steps is
   emphasized. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Continued advances in next generation short-read sequencing technologies
   are increasing throughput and read lengths, while driving down the error
   rates, for example within 1\% for Illumina HiSeq reads. Moreover, the
   errors are not uniformly distributed in all reads, and a large
   percentage of reads are indeed error-free. Ability to predict such
   perfect reads can have significant impact on run-time complexity of
   applications.
   In this paper, we present a simple and fast k -spectrum analysis based
   method to identify error-free reads. Our experiments show that if around
   80\% of the reads in a dataset are perfect, then our method retains
   almost 99.9\% of them with more than 90\% precision rate. Though
   filtering out reads identified as erroneous by our method reduces the
   coverage by about 7\% on an average, coverage pattern across genome
   remains similar. The filtration process can be customized at several
   levels of stringency depending upon the downstream application need.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that the use of verbal encouragement strategies in
   education is able to maximize learning. This idea is derived from
   traditional classroom settings where teachers use a multitude of
   behavioral strategies to maintain the students' level of engagement.
   Motivated by these educational practices, we discuss the use of a
   Socially Interactive Robotic Tutor (SIRT) that incorporates a variety of
   verbal cues into multiple math learning scenarios. In this paper, we
   present the robotic tutor, the methods used to engage students in the
   learning scenario, and results from integrating the robotic tutor in the
   classroom environment. Results derived from 44 students engaging with
   SIRT during a tablet-based math test show that, when compared to
   non-interactive methods, verbal cues are able to increase and/or
   maintain student engagement regardless of student age and math content
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Machining processes such as turning are known for generating high
   strains, strain rates and temperatures. These mechanical and thermal
   loadings combined on the workpiece can affect the surface microstructure
   in the context of average grain sizes, texture. etc. Therefore a
   thorough understanding of these two competing phenomenon on the surface
   should be investigated to predict the surface microstructure and
   therefore mechanical properties. However more and more specific parts
   used in high frequency cyclic loading applications require not only an
   understanding of the surface but also the subsurface microstructure
   evolution in the context of deformation resistance and fatigue failure.
   The main scope of this paper is to investigate the thermal effects of a
   machining process on the subsurface grain size and hardness through a
   modelling approach. In this work, a physics-driven model to predict
   temperature profiles in turning is proposed. Based on the predicted
   results, a diffusion-based model to predict the average grain size
   growth in the subsurface is developed, subsequently the Hall-Petch
   phenomenological equation was used to predict the hardness evolution in
   the subsurface. To validate the predicted results, machining experiments
   were conducted for aerospace aluminum alloy AA-7075-T6. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The adoption of wireless sensing technology by the structural health
   monitoring community has shown advantages over traditional cable-based
   systems, such as convenient sensor installation and lower system cost in
   many applications. Recently, a new generation of wireless sensing
   platform, named Martlet, has been collaboratively developed by
   researchers at the University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, and Michigan
   Tech. Martlet adopts a Texas Instruments Piccolo microcontroller running
   up to 90 MHz clock frequency, which enables Martlet to support
   high-frequency data acquisition and high-speed onboard computation. The
   extensible design of the Martlet printed circuit boards allows
   convenient incorporation of various sensor boards. In order to obtain
   accurate acceleration data and meanwhile reduce the sensor cost, a new
   Martlet sensor board, named integrated accelerometer wing, is developed.
   The integrated accelerometer wing adopts a commercial-off-the-shelf MEMS
   (microelectromechanical systems) accelerometer and contains an onboard
   signal conditioner performing three basic functions, including mean
   shifting, anti-aliasing filtering and signal amplification. One distinct
   feature of the signal conditioner is the on-the-fly programmable cut-off
   frequency and amplification gain factor. To validate the performance of
   Martlet and the integrated accelerometer wing, experiments are carried
   out on a laboratory four-story aluminum shear-frame structure. The
   laboratory experiment results demonstrate that the performance of the
   wireless sensing system is comparable to that of cabled reference
   sensors. In addition, using data collected by wireless sensors,
   vibration modal properties of the structure are identified and finite
   element (FE) model updating is performed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nonlinear dynamic phenomena for frequency bandwidth
   enhancement in vibration-based energy harvesting has received growing
   attention over the last few years. Various designs have been studied to
   create Duffing oscillators usually by introducing magnetoelastic
   coupling. In such devices, magnetic forces are typically coupled with
   elastic beams involving ferromagnetic components to achieve a nonlinear
   restoring force of the monostable or bistable Duffing type. Other than
   the increased volume and structural complexity due to additional magnets
   and discrete components, these magnetoelastic piezoelectric energy
   harvesters are not suitable to use in various compact applications and
   in systems that are sensitive to magnetic fields. The M-shaped
   structural configuration studied in this work overcomes these issues due
   to the asymmetric stiffness nonlinearity created by a simple structural
   configuration composed of a bent spring steel beam with piezoelectric
   patches. The electro elastic dynamics of the Mshaped broadband
   piezoelectric energy harvester is governed by various interacting
   nonlinearities, such as the deliberately introduced stiffness
   nonlinearity of hardening type resulting from the substrate geometry,
   inherent elastic nonlinearities of softening type as well as hysteretic
   losses associated with piezoelectric patches, and other dissipative
   effects due to large velocities experienced in response to base
   excitation. A recently developed nonlinear non-conservative
   electroelastic modeling framework for the piezoelectric patches is
   combined with geometric nonlinearities of the M-shaped energy harvester
   to establish a nonlinear dissipative model of the electromechanically
   coupled system. Energy harvesting experiments for a set of resistors and
   base excitation levels are then performed to experimentally characterize
   the bandwidth enhancement using the M-shaped broadband piezoelectric
   energy harvester.}},

Abstract = {{Macro-fiber composite (MFC) actuators offer simple and scalable design,
   robustness, noiseless performance, strong electromechanical coupling,
   and particularly a balance between the actuation force and deformation
   capabilities, which is essential to effective and agile biomimetic
   locomotion. Recent efforts in our lab have shown that MFC bimorphs with
   polyester electrode sheets can successfully be employed for fish-like
   aquatic locomotion in both tethered and untethered operation. MFC
   swimmers can outperform other smart material-based counterparts, such as
   the compliant ionic polymer-metal composite based swimmers, in terms of
   swimming speed per body length. Cantilevered flaps made of MFC bimorphs
   with different aspect ratios can be employed for underwater actuation,
   sensing, and power generation, among other aquatic applications of
   direct and converse piezoelectric effects. In an effort to develop
   linearized electrohydroelastic models for such cantilevers, the present
   work investigates MFC bimorphs with three different aspect ratios. The
   MFCs used in this study use the 33-mode of piezoelectricity with
   interdigitated electrodes. Underwater dynamic actuation frequency
   response functions (FRFs) of the MFCs are defined as the tip velocity
   per actuation voltage (tip velocity FRF) and current consumption per
   actuation voltage (admittance FRF). The tip velocity and admittance FRFs
   are modeled analytically for in-air actuation and validated
   experimentally for all aspect ratios. Underwater tip velocity and
   admittance FRFs are then derived by combining their in-air counterparts
   with corrected hydrodynamic functions. The corrected hydrodynamic
   functions are also identified from aluminum cantilevers of similar
   aspect ratios. Both tip vibration and current consumption per voltage
   input are explored. The failure of Sader's hydrodynamic function for low
   length-to-width aspect ratios is shown. Very good correlation is
   observed between model simulations and experimental measurements using
   aspect ratio-dependent, corrected hydrodynamic function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to motion analysis for robotics in which
   a quantitative definition of ``style of motion{''} is used to classify
   movements. In particular, we present a method for generating a ``best
   match{''} signal for empirical data via a two stage optimal control
   formulation. The first stage consists of the generation of trajectories
   that mimic empirical data. In the second stage, an inverse problem is
   solved in order to obtain the ``stylistic parameters{''} that best
   recreate the empirical data. This method is amenable to human motion
   analysis in that it not only produces a matching trajectory but, in
   doing so, classifies its quality. This classification allows for the
   production of additional trajectories, between any two endpoints, in the
   same style as the empirical reference data. The method not only enables
   robotic mimicry of human style but can also provide insights into genres
   of stylized movement, equipping cyber-physical systems with a deeper
   interpretation of human movement.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation of combustion and emissions outcomes in diesel engines is
   often enhanced by accurate knowledge of the transient fuel delivery rate
   and flow characteristics of the injector nozzle. Important physical
   characteristics of these flows, including velocity profile and flow
   separation or cavitation effects, are difficult to measure directly, but
   can be characterized from a flow-averaged perspective through the
   measurement of nozzle flow coefficients, namely the discharge, velocity,
   and area contraction coefficients. Both the transient fuel mass flow
   rate and the flow-averaged nozzle coefficients can be found by measuring
   the mass and momentum flux of the fuel stream leaving the nozzle during
   injection through the application of an impingement technique, where
   fuel is sprayed onto the face of a transducer calibrated for force
   measurement in close proximity to the nozzle. While several published
   experiments have employed the spray impingement method to quantify
   rate-of-injection, the experimental setup and equipment selections vary
   widely and may contribute to disagreements in measured
   rate-of-injection. This paper identifies and provides estimates of
   measurement uncertainties that can arise when employing different
   experimental setups using the impingement method. It was observed that
   the impingement technique was sensitive to the design of the strike cap,
   specifically the contact area between the cap and transducer diaphragm,
   in addition to fuel temperature. Conversely, we observed that the
   impingement technique was relatively insensitive to angular and vertical
   misalignment, where the uncertainty can be estimated using control
   volume analysis. Transducer selection, specifically those with low
   acceleration sensitivity, high resonant frequency, and integrated
   electronics piezoelectric circuitry substantially reduce the noise in
   the measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic packaged devices are becoming increasingly smaller in size

   reliability. Warpage is one of the crucial factors for the
   thermo-mechanical reliability of electronic packages and warpage control
   becomes a more crucial process during the printed wiring board (PWB)
   fabrication and package assembly processes. This requirement
   necessitates more accurate methods of measuring warpage. The fringe
   projection methods are recent trends for measuring the warpage of chip
   packages, PWBs, and PWB assemblies because of their noncontact,
   full-field, and high-resolution measurement capabilities. This paper
   presents a comparison of two fringe projection methods: laser fringe
   projection (projection moire) and digital fringe projection.
   Experimental results show that digital fringe projection has higher
   practical resolution, and better accuracy and precision than laser
   fringe projection.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3D) stacking of semiconductor chips is an emerging
   technology which promises improved electrical performance including
   improved bandwidth, reduced wire interconnection lengths, and reduced
   signal delay. However, due to the higher power density per unit volume
   of the stacking, it poses great challenge for thermal management.
   Inter-tier microfluidic cooling with microgaps with surface area
   enhancements such as pin fins can potentially achieve superior thermal
   performance. As such, the hydraulic and thermal characteristics of this
   configuration over parametric ranges of practical interest are
   important. Conventional correlations developed in the literature for
   macropin fins show large errors for dense arrays of micropins.
   In this work, the hydraulic and thermal characteristics of a microgap
   with pin fin were investigated for a large range of Reynolds number (Re)
   based on pin fin diameter (D-p) by numerical modeling. The effects of
   the pin fin dimensions including diameter, transversal spacing,
   longitudinal spacing, height and Re on the friction factor (f) and
   colburn j factor were studied. Correlations of the f and j for dense
   arrays of micro pins are developed based on parametric runs over 22< Re
   <357, pin fin diameter of 100 mu m, pitch/ diameter ratios of 1.5
   similar to 2.25, and height/ diameter ratios of 1.5 similar to 2.25. The
   validity of the correlations is confirmed by experiments. Lastly, a
   parametric optimization was done and the thermal resistance of the
   microgap with 150 W heat generation is reduced by 28.5\% with the
   optimized dimensions for a given pumping power compared to an
   un-optimized pin fin configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors with an electric double-layer design have attracted
   great attention in the recent years because they are promising energy
   storage devices for a number of applications, particularly for portable
   electronics and electric automobiles. They utilize the interface between
   the electrode and the electrolyte to store energy, resulting in energy
   storage devices with high power density but low energy density compared
   to batteries. To improve the performance and reduce the cost,
   researchers have made significant progress in increasing energy density,
   electrode voltage, and cycle life. The increase of the energy density is
   considered to be achieved mainly by increasing the effective specific
   interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte. Various electrodes
   with porous structure have been attempted to increase the specific
   surface area. The increase of electrode voltage is realized primarily
   via the change of liquid electrolytes to gel, solid and composite ones.
   In this overview, they are summarized as solid-like electrolytes. This
   paper reviews the materials adopted and the processing methods developed
   for solid-like electrolytes, as well as the general characteristics of

Abstract = {{Significant cost reductions for solar photovoltaic systems can be

   on ASCE-7 codes created for buildings and do not fully account for wind
   reduction strategies. Numerical simulation is one of the tools that can
   be used to evaluate wind loads and improve system designs while
   maintaining reliability and durability. As a first order analysis, we
   have numerically simulated a solar photovoltaic panel as a flat plate
   with an aspect ratio of 0.5, which includes the simulation of turbulence
   experienced by panels. The flow is simulated using the incompressible
   Navier-Stokes equation and the turbulent process is simulated using k -
   epsilon model. The numerical model and boundary conditions are derived
   from similar experimental wind tunnel experiments. The aerodynamic force
   is calculated from the integration of the normal and tangential pressure
   forces. The result of the numerical simulation shows that the wind load
   on a solar panel can be successfully simulated numerically and the
   simulation data can be used to evaluate redesigns of the system,

Abstract = {{Condensing zeotropic mixtures have the potential to improve the
   thermodynamic performance of power generating, cooling, and heating
   systems. Further improvements can be realized by developing equipment
   using mini- and microchannels. However, it has been shown that the
   concentration gradients arising from the changing composition of the
   vapor and liquid phases during condensation introduce additional mass
   transfer resistances, degrading the overall heat transfer. Furthermore,
   the coupled heat and mass transfer in mixtures at this scale is not well
   understood. Results from experiments on condensation of ammonia/water
   mixtures at varying concentration (80-100\% NH3), mass flux (G = 50 -
   200 kg m(-2) S-1), and tube diameter (D = 0.98-2.16 mm) are reported
   here. Other researchers have reported an apparent heat transfer
   coefficient for zeotropic mixtures, which fails to explicitly account
   for mass transfer. The present work quantifies the liquid film heat
   transfer coefficient by accounting for mass transfer through a film
   model approach, which allows the relative significance of the vapor and

Abstract = {{The effect of structural anisotropy leading to anchor loss mismatch in
   micro-Hemispherical Resonator Gyros (micro-HRGs) is investigated by
   developing an anchor loss model based on finite element analysis.
   Worst-case lower bound estimates for the anchor loss component of the
   quality factor (Q) are found based on the computed frequency difference
   between a clamped support and a free support interface. The Young's
   modulus of the finite element model is varied in a 4 th - harmonic
   pattern in the circumferential direction of the micro-HRG, resulting in
   splitting of the Q and resonance frequency of the otherwise degenerate
   gyro wineglass mode pair, allowing prediction of the case drift
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic or electromagnetic shaping in resonators can form thin walled
   structures from pulverized materials. The technology is applicable to a
   wide variety of materials, particle shapes, and sizes. While radiation
   force models adequately capture the transport of particles towards the
   nodal surfaces where walls form the actual wall formation process
   involves complex particle-field and interparticle forces. A finite
   element computation is used along with pulsed laser particle image
   velocimetry for air movement, and particle tracking velocimetry for
   particle movement, to close the gap between predictions and
   measurements. Non-intrusive force measurement is attempted by deriving
   the acceleration field of particles, from velocity field data. Results
   are compared with particle acceleration computed from velocity
   calculations using the finite element code. The predicted acoustic
   velocity field from the standing wave pattern in the resonator, is
   compared with measurements. The difference between the computed particle
   velocity and the acoustic velocity is used to assess the relative roles
   of fluid dynamic drag and radiation forces on the acceleration of the
   particles. The measured particle acceleration does differ substantially
   and consistently from the computed values, showing the effect of the
   unmodeled near-field particle-field interaction forces.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a high quality and accurately manufactured surface is
   needed for micro channels for micro-TAS (micro-total analysis systems, a
   kind of MEMS technology) chips in medical fields. We demonstrated that
   the use of smaller machine tools is an effective method to reduce the
   environmental impact in the small parts manufacturing field. Then, in
   this report, we focus on magnetic polishing for micro channels with a
   ball-nose-shaped tool, integrating the end milling and polishing
   processes in a desktop-sized machine tool. The magnetic brush was formed
   by adhering a magnetic polishing paste, which was composed of abrasive
   grains (alumina, particle size 0.05 um), metallic particles (cast-iron,
   diameter 1 - 100 um), and solvating media (vegetal oil), to the tip
   (radius 2 mm) of the ball-nose-shaped tool, which was a permanent magnet
   and a prototype micro tool with a ball-nose end mill shape. We attempt
   to end mill and polish the surface of micro channels with a prototype
   magnetic tool and a desktop-sized machine tool. The quality of the
   machined surface is estimated with a high accuracy surface profile
   meter. As a result, it can be seen that the proposed method is effective

Abstract = {{Dynamic stall occurs on helicopter rotor blades, wind turbine blades,
   and even insect and bird wings. Although most studies on dynamic stall
   are conducted assuming two-dimensional behaviot; it has been shown that
   this phenomenon is highly three-dimensional. Recent studies of dynamic
   stall on a rotating blade of helicopter in forward flight and wind
   turbines in yaw have shown that the nature of the radial flow near the
   surface has first-order significance in the stalled flow field. Past
   literature suggests that the boundary layer over a rotating disk has
   been correlated to that over a swept wing. Drawing a similar parallel it
   is hypothesized that fundamental insights into dynamic stall may be
   derived from studying the boundary layer over a rotating blade in
   dynamic stall is similar to that over a rotating disk. Particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) is used to investigate the boundary layer development
   on a rotating disk. The first set of measurements was conducted using
   PIV with a micro lens attachment to the camera. Next, a microscope was
   used to conduct mu-PIV measurements. The measured radial velocity
   profiles show substantially higher radial jet peak velocities than the
   analytical solution for a mirror-smooth disk. This difference is
   narrowed down to the effect of surface roughness of the painted disk,
   representative of reality on rotor blades used in PIV This results in a
   much higher effective viscosity in the near-surface layer, contributing
   to additional radial flow, as seen from the centrifugal pump literature.
   However, the non dimensional radial velocity profile exhibits the
   expected self similar behavior at various radial locations.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous investigations have been conducted to extend adiabatic
   liquid-gas VOF flow solvers to include condensation phenomena by adding
   an energy equation and phase-change source terms. Some proposed
   phase-change models employ empirical rate parameters, or adapt heat
   transfer correlations, and thus must be tuned for specific applications.
   Generally applicable models have also been developed that rigorously
   resolve the phase-change process, but require interface reconstruction,
   significantly increasing computational cost and software complexity. In
   the present work, a simplified first-principles-based condensation model
   is developed, which forces interface-containing mesh cells to the
   equilibrium state. The operation on cells instead of complex interface
   surfaces enables the use of fast graph algorithms without
   reconstruction. The model is validated for horizontal film condensation,
   and converges to exact solutions with increasing mesh resolution.
   Agreement with established results is demonstrated for smooth and wavy
   falling-film condensation.}},

Abstract = {{Molten salt corrosion is a major concern in the pulp and paper industry
   because it limits recovery boiler efficiency by preventing increases in
   steam temperature. Alloys used in superheater tubes depend on the
   stability of the oxide film formed on the surface. Typically, the
   superheater temperature is kept below the first melting temperature of
   the deposits formed on the tube surface. If deposits melt at the
   surface, oxides with low solubility in deposit salts will tend to be
   more protective when the salt reaches equilibrium. The solubility of
   metal oxides (Al2O3, Fe2O3, Cr2O3, NiO, and SiO2) in molten superheater
   deposits was evaluated. The salt composition used was 73.9 wt\% Na2SO4,
   10.2 wt\% KCl, 11.5 wt\% Na2CO3, and 4.4 wt\% K2SO4. The solubility of
   NiO was found to be the least in this salt, followed by Fe2O3, Cr2O3,
   Al2O3, and SiO2. Cr2O3 and Al2O3 were found to have similar solubility.
   Pure metals as well as candidate alloys were also tested to quantify
   their relative corrosion behaviour in molten simulated superheater
   deposits. Nickel-based alloys performed much better than most iron-based
   stainless steels. However, Esshete 1250, an austenitic stainless steel
   with higher Mn and lower Ni content, showed very good resistance to
   molten salts even at 750 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumatic actuators possess several attractive qualities: high power and
   force density, potentially adaptable compliance, and clean, safe, and
   low cost actuation. However, control of pneumatic actuators has proven
   difficult, limited by inherent compliance of the actuator, nonlinear and
   discontinuous third order dynamics, and friction. Stiction and
   compliance lead to a sandwiched nonlinearity that causes stick-slip and
   can cause significant tracking error and even instability. A broadly
   applicable method of friction compensation is addition of a feedforward
   term updated from a friction estimate at each time step. Since pneumatic
   dynamics are slow, achievable compensation can be insufficient. In this
   work, friction is estimated over a prediction horizon and then input
   into a model-based predictive controller as an offset term, so that
   compensation is planned and optimal over the prediction horizon. The
   controller is tested in simulation. Results are compared to control
   using instantaneous compensation and are characterized based on
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A new, advanced patient transfer device is being developed for moving
   mobility limited patients, for example, from a wheelchair to a bed or a
   floor into a chair. Current market patient lift devices are antiquated
   and insufficient for customer needs, with only one actuated degree of
   freedom. The high power to size ratio of hydraulic actuation makes it
   suitable for moving larger, heavier patients.
   We have developed a prototype pump-controlled hydraulically actuated
   patient transfer device that is more maneuverable and agile, using
   multiple actuated degrees of freedom. We are also working toward
   developing a more intuitive and safe caretaker interface and control
   strategy. We have performed an extensive needs assessment; these are a
   few associated key design requirements relevant to this presented work.
   A compact package is needed for ease of maneuvering the patient around
   obstacles in an uncertain environment. The device is capable of
   producing large forces, so it is desirable for the controller to
   minimize any unintentional large external contact forces, or provide
   force feedback. In this system, the caretaker and device work together
   to maneuver a complex payload, a human body; the operator's mental
   workload must be minimized. With humans in the device workspace, safety
   and stability are necessary, including environment interactions.
   This new application presents several challenges related to the
   hydraulic control. First, we are using a separate bidirectional fixed
   displacement pump with a reversible brushed DC motor for each degree of
   freedom. The low level control involves obtaining desirable response
   from each motor-pump-actuator system, while compensating for significant
   static friction. At a higher level, we are testing several approaches to
   attain the desired intuitive control and desired dynamics, and minimize
   the operator workload. First, we are developing a coordinated control
   using a force input, such that the operator simply pushes on the device
   in the desired direction of motion. We are testing several different
   controllers to attain the desired dynamics. This paper presents the
   design of the machine, the proposed control structures as applied to
   this application, operator interface options, some preliminary results,
   and future work.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of rotation in a freestream on the drag, side force and
   torque of a generic helicopter rotor hub are studied using
   azimuth-resolved load measurements in a low speed wind tunnel. The hub
   is directly mounted to a stepper motor placed on a load cell, enabling
   extraction of all 6 load components with sufficiently high azimuthal
   resolution. The results confirm findings in the prior literature that
   rotation does not significantly increase hub drag in a freestream.
   However, the addition of a scissors linkage to the hub resulted in a 10
   percent increase in drag above the prior generic configuration, but
   reduces the amplitude of periodic drag variation. The side force was
   found to be highly unsteady depending on flow conditions, and its
   azimuth-averaged value can change sign with Reynolds number. The torque
   required to drive the hub increased with rotation speed and freestream
   speed, and is found to be of the same order as that expected from the
   drag difference between shanks on the advancing and retreating sides.
   The azimuth-resolved force and torque data suggests that transient
   torque values peak at certain portions of the azimuth that slightly lead
   those of highest drag. The total power demand attributed to the hub is
   still mostly due to drag. Scaling to vehicle flight speed and size
   should improve this approximation, unless interactions with pylons,
   nacelles or other components cause asymmetries sufficient to change the
   result. In addition to aerodynamic loads measurement, the unsteady wake
   of the rotating hub was measured using constant temperature anemometry
   technique. Wavelet transforms in addition to Fourier transforms are used
   to characterize the unsteady wake. A clear asymmetry is observed in the
   4/rev energy content of the hub wake.}},

Abstract = {{Slowed rotors are used to increase the cruise efficiency and
   maneuverability of rotorcraft at high speeds. Operation at high rotor
   advance ratios implies that the blades encounter reverse flow on the
   retreating side of the rotor disc. The resulting increased pitch link
   loads and bending moments could shorten component life. Previous studies
   have shown significant rotor blade pressure perturbations in the reverse
   flow region, which are not fully accounted for using current prediction
   methodologies. The hypothesis explored here is that the blade trailing
   edge in reverse flow produces a vortex similar to the leading edge
   vortex on a sharp-edged delta wing. The Polhamus model for delta wing
   lift is modified for use on yawed rotor blades. Lift, drag and pitching
   moment data acquired on a static yawed blade in reverse flow supports
   analytical results. Surface tuft flow visualization confirms the
   existence of an attached, span-wise vortex.}},

Abstract = {{With the explosive growth of the Internet traffic, data compression can
   be a powerful technique to improve the efficiency of data transfer in
   networks and consequently reduce the cost associated with the
   transmission of such data. Recently, we proposed a memory-assisted
   compression framework that utilizes the packet-level memorized context
   to reduce the inevitable redundancy in the universal compression of the
   payloads of the short-length network packets. In this paper, we
   investigate the practical aspects of implementing cluster-based
   memory-assisted compression and proposed a non-parametric clustering
   algorithm for training packet selection. We demonstrate that, when
   compression speed is not an issue, our proposed non-parametric
   clustering algorithm with Lite PAQ compression algorithm can achieve
   nearly 70\% traffic reduction on real data gathered from Internet
   traffic. We also explore the trade-off between the memory-assisted
   compression speed and performance using different clustering algorithms
   and compression methods.}},

Abstract = {{A novel dual-band antenna is investigated for wireless body area network
   (WBAN) applications. The design begins with a ring-shaped printed
   monopole antenna, operating in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
   (ISM) bands of 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz. To reduce the backward scattering
   wave towards the human body, the monopole antenna is set above a
   circular-shaped Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) structure. The
   configuration of the AMC-integrated antenna is low profile with a
   thickness of 3.7 mm and compact with the area of 102 X 102 mm(2). Due to
   introducing flexible substrate, it can be conformal to the human body.
   Simulated results show that the proposed antenna combined with AMC has
   an average gain of 11.8 dBi in lower band, 8 dBi in upper band, and the
   front-to-back ratio of 10 dB, when placed on the phantom. Compared to
   conventional monopole antennas, the radiation characteristics are
   improved, making it a good candidate for WBAN applications.}},

Abstract = {{Testing of RFID Tags is complicated by the fact that the RFID chips must
   be tested both before and after antenna attach. The test procedure prior
   to chip attach must ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that any
   defects in the chip that can cause failure after antenna attach are
   detected with very high failure coverage. The test procedure after
   antenna attach must ensure that no failures are injected into the system
   during the antenna attach procedure itself. In both cases, the metric of
   performance that the RFID system is assessed against, is the maximum
   distance between the tag reader and the RFID tag at which reliable
   communication is established between the two. Since RFID tags are
   extremely low cost, BIST techniques for both test procedures are
   developed for inductively coupled RFID tags (ISM Band of 13.56 MHz) that
   are ultra low cost and require minimal hardware overhead (to justify
   cost considerations). It is shown that high manufacturing failure
   coverage is achieved with very low BIST overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light communications (VLC) are motivated by the radio-frequency
   (RF) spectrum crunch and fast-growing solid-state lighting technology.
   VLC relies on white light emitting diodes (LEDs) to provide
   communication and illumination simultaneously. Simple two-level on-off
   keying (OOK) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) are supported in IEEE
   standard due to their compatibility with existing constant current LED
   drivers, but their low spectral efficiency have limited the achievable
   data rates of VLC. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has
   been applied to VLC due to its high spectral efficiency and ability to
   combat inter-symbol-interference (ISI). However, VLC-OFDM inherits the
   disadvantage of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) from RF-OFDM.
   Besides, the continuous magnitude of OFDM signals requires complicated
   mixed-signal digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and modification of LED
   drivers. We propose the use of delta-sigma modulators in visible light
   OFDM systems to convert continuous magnitude OFDM symbols into LED
   driver signals. The proposed system has the communication theory
   advantages of OFDM along with the practical analog and optical
   advantages of simple two level driver signals. Simulation results are
   provided to illustrate the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of Control (LOC) accidents are a major threat for aviation, and
   contribute the highest risk for fatalities in all aviation accidents.
   The major contributor to LOC accidents is pilot spatial disorientation
   (SD), which accounts for roughly 32\% of all LOC accidents. A pilot
   experiences SD during flight when he/she fails to sense correctly the
   motion, and/or attitude of the aircraft. In essence, the pilot's
   expectation of the aircraft's state deviates from reality. This
   deviation results from a number of underlying mechanisms of SD, such as
   distraction, failure to monitor flight instruments, and vestibular
   illusions. Previous researchers have developed computational models to
   understand those mechanisms. However, the models are limited in scope,
   as they do not model pilot expertise and have a small span of flight
   regimes to test with. This research proposes a new pilot model to
   predict the best-possible-pilot-expectation of the aircraft state given
   vestibular and visual cues. The proposed pilot model is in the form of a
   model-based observer (MBO), which provides the infrastructure needed to
   establish an expert pilot model. Experts are known to form an internal
   model of the operated system due to training/experience, which allows
   the expert to generate internal expectations of the system states.
   Pilot's internal expectations are enhanced by the presence of
   information fed through the pilot's sensory systems. The proposed pilot
   model integrates a continuous vestibular sensory model and a discrete
   visual-sampling sensory model to take account for the influence of the
   pilot's sensory system on his/her expectation of the aircraft state. The
   computational model serves to investigate the underlying mechanisms of
   SD during flight and provide a quantitative analysis tool to support
   flight deck and countermeasure designs.}},

   suggest growing demand for STEM professionals who can deftly navigate

   non-profit sectors. Yet even when high quality instructional
   interventions are developed and delivered, there often remain unanswered
   questions about their relative effectiveness. Valid and reliable
   assessment tools are sorely needed to better evaluate whether our
   students and practitioners not only have sufficient background
   understanding related to science and engineering ethics, but can apply
   this knowledge in real-world situations. This highly interactive panel
   session is organized around presentations from three complementary
   efforts to develop high quality assessment instruments focused on
   science and engineering ethics. Background details for each instrument
   will be provided, including sample questions that the audience will be

   mm-scale channel that models a segment of a high-performance, air-cooled
   heat-sink is characterized. The present investigation reports a novel
   approach to enhanced cooling without increasing the channel's
   characteristically low Reynolds number. Heat transport that is governed
   by the local heat transfer from the fin surface and by subsequent mixing
   with the core flow is significantly increased by deliberate shedding of
   unsteady small-scale vortices that are induced by the vibration of a
   miniature, planar self-oscillating reed. The present investigation
   focuses on the heat transfer and fluid mechanics that are associated
   with the small-scale motions induced by the reed. Performance
   enhancement by reed actuation is quantified in terms of increased power
   dissipation over a range of flow rates compared to the baseline flow in
   the absence of the reed. It is demonstrated that the channel's
   coefficient of performance can be increased by a factor of 4 while
   accounting for all the losses associated with the reed actuation.}},

   package density results in higher power density per unit volume of the
   package, which creates challenges for thermal management. Microfluidic
   cooling can potentially achieve superior thermal performance with
   surface area enhancements such as pin fins and could be a viable
   solution for many applications to the increasing power density in
   electronic packages.
   In this paper, we report on investigations of the impact of the
   microfluidic cooling technology on the system level performance of
   multicore architectures stacked in a 3D package. Specifically, we
   characterize the impact on leakage power dissipation over different pin
   fin configurations and its impact on overall system energy efficiency.
   We do so with a cycle-level application-driven full system simulation
   framework. The framework executes application binaries and operating
   system code and models coupled interactions among the i) application \&
   operating system code, ii) resulting thermal field, iii) leakage power,
   and v) microfluidic cooling. This provides the unique ability to assess
   the impact of microfluidics on computing system level metrics
   experienced by the applications such as energy per instruction. We
   illustrate and quantify improvements in energy efficiency of the
   applications, as well as increase in throughput due to micro fluidic
   cooling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on extracting cohesive zone modeling (CZM) parameters
   for ultra low-k (ULK) inter layer dielectric (ILD) layers present in
   back end of line stack (BEOL) of flip-chip (FC) semiconductor devices.
   Unlike other fracture-mechanics based approaches, CZM can simulate crack
   initiation and propagation at several locations. However, additional
   parameters need to be determined to enable cohesive zone (CZ) elements
   to reliably predict the failure region. In this paper, we present a
   methodology, combing fracture experiments and finite-element (FE)
   simulations to extract CZM parameters under mixed-mode loading
   conditions. Using load vs. displacement data from the double cantilever
   beam (DCB) test and four-point bend test (FPBT) experiments, we have
   characterized all the parameters necessary for CZM. The developed
   cohesive zone failure criteria can then be applied to interfaces in BEOL
   stack models to identify the locations of crack initiation and
   propagation.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptographically-Curated File System (CCFS) proposed in this work
   supports the adoption of Information-Centric Networking. CCFS utilizes
   content names that span trust boundaries, verify integrity, tolerate
   disruption, authenticate content, and provide non-repudiation.
   Irrespective of the ability to reach an authoritative host, CCFS
   provides secure access by binding a chain of trust into the content name
   itself. Curators cryptographically bind content to a name, which is a
   path through a series of objects that map human meaningful names to
   cryptographically strong content identifiers. CCFS serves as a network
   layer for storage systems unifying currently disparate storage
   technologies. The power of CCFS derives from file hashes and public keys
   used as a name with which to retrieve content and as a method of
   verifying that content. We present results from our prototype
   implementation. Our results show that the overhead associated with CCFS
   is not negligible, but also is not prohibitive.}},

Abstract = {{A massive transformation of the power grid is undergoing towards the
   smart grid concept. Devices such as smart meters, inverter interfaced
   power devices, energy storage, power electronics equipment, smart
   appliances and other controllable devices are being incorporated in the
   power grid. Thus, a need has emerged to be able to control, monitor, and
   exploit the benefits associated with these controllable devices. In this
   paper, an infrastructure for optimization, control, and operation of the
   power system is proposed to formulate an advanced energy management
   system (EMS). The proposed infrastructure allows for an accurate and
   fast monitoring and operating of the power system over the short time
   planning period. Basically, the concept of distributed monitoring and
   control via a hierarchical structure is used to achieve these goals. A
   communication infrastructure consisting of advanced metering devices,
   satellite receivers, and data concentrators (DC), is proposed to support
   the EMS functions of the future. The main enabling technologies that
   facilitate the implementation of the proposed infrastructure are: (a)
   new communication infrastructure and (b) distributed state estimation
   (DSE). The main function of the communication infrastructure is to
   gather the system synchronized and non-synchronized data, process them
   in Data Concentrators and create streaming data into the DSE. The DSE
   processes the data for the purpose of providing the real time model of
   the system at speeds of 60 times per seconds. The real time model
   provided by the DSE is used to perform the optimization and determine
   the controls for the power system in an autonomous fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, low-cost and low-power backscatter radio communicators
   utilize a switching mechanism for alternating the antenna load between
   two values. In this way, they achieve modulation by reflection of the RF
   waves induced at the communicator's antenna. For tags that employ a
   rectifier for wireless energy harvesting, a single transistor may switch
   between the matched harvester and a reflective load (an open or short).
   However, optimized backscatter communication occurs when switching
   between two reflective loads, ideally an open and a short. This
   prohibits the use of a harvester that requires a good matching (i.e. no
   reflections) and produces a tradeoff of either compromising
   communication performance or not employing a harvester. Although this
   may not pose a problem for commodity RFID tags that operate in short
   ranges and do not require high computational ability, it is a strong
   limitation for applications like wireless sensor networks that employ
   backscatter radio as a low-cost and low-power communication scheme. In
   this work, an RF front-end is designed, analyzed, and implemented, that
   overcomes the limitation of compromising communication performance when
   employing a harvester.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the
   capabilities of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and
   treatment of patients with peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its derivative diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET)
   are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following injury
   and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and
   histological analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each
   offered unique and interesting advantages related to the field. MRI
   offered the opportunity to visualize immune activity on the injured
   nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and DTI offered
   numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop
   statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the
   treatment phase by enabling more precise analgesic applications
   following surgery, and PET represents a novel method of assessing nerve
   injury through analysis of relative metabolism rates in injured and
   healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to enhance and extend the
   abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including innovative
   contrast agents, some of which enable multimodal imaging approaches and
   present opportunities for treatment application. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Natural markers are increasingly being adopted by the Augmented Reality
   (AR) community. These systems require several steps of data processing
   to be carried out with the aim of allowing a less parameterized image be
   recognized by the computer system. Among the possibilities for this task
   there are the proposals that employ interest points (or feature points).
   The steps needed to process the natural markers using interest points
   include the matching (usually between one image representation and the
   video stream). Even having these options well known in the community,
   try to minimize the processing time or improve the results in terms of
   accuracy of matching is especially important to the development of AR
   applications. In this paper, we discuss the results of three comparative
   studies that demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the
   algorithms FLANN and Brute Force when employed in the matching step of
   natural markers using interest points. As one of the results, we show
   that in some cases, the algorithm with most computational complexity can
   be the better choice.}},

   the constraint of the overall transmit power, minimizing the overall
   transmit power while guaranteeing the minimum spectral efficiency (SE)
   requirements, and maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under the
   constraints of minimum SE requirements and overall transmit power. We
   use sub-gradient iteration approach to solve the first two optimization
   problems and exploit fractional programming method to deal with the
   third one. Based on these design criteria, three power allocation
   algorithms are developed for the downlink multi-user DAS. Depending on
   application enviroments, we can use the first and second criteria to
   achieve the highest throughput and to save the most energy,
   respectively, while we can balance throughput and energy consumption
   using the third criterion.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless polarized-channel simulator is described that can generate a
   variety of polarized-channel impulse responses. The simulator is useful
   in the broad research area of polarization-utilizing wireless
   communication systems. The simulator relies on a geometrically based
   statistical model (GBSM) for polarized wide-band channels, and consists
   of three-dimensional (3-D) concentric scattering cylinders about the
   mobile station. It can be used to model a polarized wide-band cellular
   down-link channel. To the best of our knowledge, our polarized-channel
   simulator is the first such simulation model that can generate the
   time-variant channel impulse response of polarized wide-band wireless
   fading channels. The simulator utilizes previously reported geometrical
   theory and reference models for cross-polarization discrimination (XPD),
   and shows excellent agreement with the reference models, while
   considering only a finite number of scatterers both for good accuracy
   and manageable computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency ultrasonic imaging devices are widely used in minimally
   invasive catheter-based interventions especially in intravascular
   imaging, but there is still a need for more flexible devices with true
   3-D volumetric imaging capability in front of the catheter tip. Single
   chip capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays with
   on-chip CMOS electronics implementation provides great flexibility in
   designing array geometry and integrated front-end electronics. We have
   successfully implemented dual ring CMUT arrays for forward-looking

   designing more efficient and effective electromagnetic launcher
   components. Understanding the influence of sliding velocity, contact

   experiment is employed at Georgia Tech to study wear at sliding speeds
   and contact pressures in excess of 1,000 m/s and 100 MPa for a 6061-T6
   aluminum slider on a C110-H2 copper guider. Test results showed a
   transition from mild to severe wear took place at approximately 30.5 cm
   or 1,000 m/s, which corresponds to a mechanical heating rate of 100 x
   10(9) N/m.s. Aluminum deposition on the guiders was quantified using a
   white light interferometer and plotted as a function of position and
   velocity. A normalized wear rate model in the severe wear region was

Abstract = {{Active implantable medical devices (IMD) for the monitoring and

   study presents a series of MEMS-enabled biodegradable batteries
   comprising Mg anodes and Fe cathodes in a 0.1 M MgCl2 electrolyte. The
   anode was fabricated by electroplating Mg from a non-aqueous solution
   and passivated with either polycaprolactone or poly(glycerol-sebacate).
   Mg anodes coated with the biodegradable polymers hindered parasitic
   corrosion of the biodegradable anode and significantly enhanced the
   performance of the battery. The batteries demonstrated a capacity and
   power delivery capability of up to 0.7 mAh and 26 mu W, respectively,
   which are sufficient for powering MEMS-based IMD systems.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic nondestructive inspections of critical structural components
   are typically both expensive and time-consuming, contributing to high
   maintenance costs and undesirable downtime. Permanently mounted
   transducers that both generate and received guided waves are an
   alternative approach whereby plate-like structures are frequently
   monitored for changes. The sparse guided wave array (SGWA) is a
   configuration whereby simple, piezoelectric disks are spatially
   distributed on the structure. Such an array is efficient in that a
   relatively large area can be monitored with a small number of
   transducers. The performance of SGWA imaging algorithms is evaluated for
   a variety of damage scenarios, and the in situ transducers are then used
   as sources of guided waves for follow-up inspection of limited areas via
   wavefield imaging. Fatigue cracks in metallic plates and impact damage
   in composite plates are considered as well as several types of simulated
   damage. Fatigue cracks are highly directional scatterers, whereas impact
   damage exhibits complex scattering that is not always point-like; both
   situations affect imaging performance. Regardless of the imaging method,
   the results can be used to define a region of interest for follow-up
   inspection. Wavefield scans of this region are performed using multiple
   transducers as sources, and data are analyzed to verify detection of a
   scatterer and then to better locate and characterize it. Results
   demonstrate the advantages of the two guided wave methods and also
   illustrate potential issues with using simulated damage for performance
   assessment.}},

   individual array elements, enabling accurate modeling of arrays of
   single and multiple electrode CMUTs for different ultrasound modalities
   in a computationally efficient manner. Given the CMUT system
   description, the pressure at an arbitrary point in the immersion medium
   and individual membrane displacements are calculated in the time domain
   for transmit mode. In receive mode, the output electrical signals are
   calculated as if another ultrasound source is present in the immersion
   medium. Pulse-echo operation is considered as the transmit-receive mode
   where the incident field is generated by the image of the CMUT array
   itself. An example CMUT system consisting of a single circular membrane

Abstract = {{Higher transmit sensitivity and receive sensitivity at lower bias
   voltages would be achieved by CMUTs when their structure converges to an
   ideal parallel plate structure without an insulation layer. Using an
   insulation layer with high relative dielectric constant (high-K) helps
   achieving this goal with increased capacitance and large electric field
   in the vacuum gap. The effect of the insulation layer is more pronounced
   for high frequency, small gap CMUTs, where large pressures can be
   generated with smaller displacements. In this paper, we present a simple
   model for optimal insulation layer properties and significant
   improvement in both transmit and receive sensitivity by replacing the
   silicon nitride (SixNy) insulation layer with highK hafnium oxide (HfO2)
   for a low temperature CMUT-on-CMOS process. Experiments are performed on

   probes suffer from low SNR and limited penetration due to small active
   transducer area and frequency-dependent tissue attenuation. Although
   using signal averaging improves the SNR, it increases data collection
   time which degrades real time imaging performance. Temporally coded
   pulses emit high energy to the imaging medium and enhance SNR, using a
   suitable decoding procedure, without compromising frame rate. We
   previously demonstrated the volumetric imaging performance of a
   single-chip forward looking CMUT-on-CMOS system. In this study, we
   describe the implementation of temporal coding excitation in our
   single-chip system with reduced DC voltage levels and present the
   imaging results. A 2-cycle 13-bit Barker code was generated to encode a
   rectangular unipolar pulse waveform. 24-ns pulse width was chosen for
   maximum energy transfer to the system. Due to the limitation of internal
   pulsers, a 25-V pulse amplitude was used to produce the encoded
   excitation signal. The received signals were decoded by using spectrum
   inversion filtering. Imaging experiments were performed using a pig
   artery phantom immersed in water. The reconstructed 2D cross-sectional

Abstract = {{Designing Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) imaging catheters using 2D
   arrays with large number of elements is extremely challenging with
   standard interconnect and transducer technology. Using microbeamformers
   inside the catheter reduces the number of cables; however it requires
   complex front-end electronics which consumes considerable amount of real
   estate. By using the CMUT-on-CMOS technology, one can incorporate
   on-chip transmit electronics and efficiently optimize the 2D transducer
   array to use less number of active elements to reduce the number of
   cables by combining multiple channels on a single output cable. Reducing
   the number of cables with integrated electronics may provide a flexible
   catheter which can be used for 3D ICE imaging under MRI as well as
   X-Ray. In this study, we explore the design of the CMOS receiver circuit

Abstract = {{We present a method for the realistic simulation of tissue backscatter
   in the ultrasound simulation program Field II. The method, based on an
   application of the Rayleigh speckle model, is implemented as an
   additional convolution step which appropriately scales and filters RF
   data to match an arbitrary backscattering coefficient spectrum. We
   verify that the method accurately captures the statistics and
   frequency-dependent behavior of diffuse tissue by simulating a standard
   backscattering coefficient measurement for focused transducers. We
   provide an example of how this method can be used to create simulation
   phantoms for assessing tissue detectibility in low SNR applications.}},

Abstract = {{Patient care in intensive care units involves the combined
   administration of several drugs. Apart from the desired drug effect,
   often such drugs disturb other physiological functions of the patient.
   Control strategies based on nominal pharmacokinetic models cannot
   ideally embody interpatient and intrapatient variability. Moreover,
   exogenous and endogenous disturbances also alter physiological
   parameters of the patient which in turn affect the pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics of drugs. Such parameter variations directly influence
   the output drug effect. Thus, a direct adaptive controller that updates
   control gains in accordance to system uncertainty and system
   disturbances can account for interpatient and intrapatient variability.
   This paper proposes a direct adaptive disturbance rejection controller
   for the continuous infusion of multiple drugs that have interactive
   effects. As a case study, we investigate the closed-loop control of
   propofol infusion while considering the synergistic effect of
   remifentanil.}},

Abstract = {{Design of materials and devices by mimicking the fascinating systems
   found in nature, have enabled scientists to discover new techniques to
   treat diseases from diagnosis to therapeutic care. With the recent
   advances in nanomedicine, the length-scale of this design has further
   extended down into a nano-sized array. Inspired by the two natural
   assemblies found in nature; cellulose and collagen; we have designed a
   new class of green functional material with nano-sized arrangement. The
   fabricated material composed of collagen hydrogel reinforced by
   cellulose nanowhiskers in order to effectively enhance the rigidity of
   collagen and to better mimic the morphology and profile features existed
   in biological tissues. The biocompatibility of the hydrogel
   nanocomposite was also investigated by the invasion and proliferation of
   human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells around the materials at
   8 day of culture. We believe that our biomimeticallyengineered platform
   in this study could increase the biomedical applications of fully
   bio-based systems such as scaffolding in tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic Guided Vehicle System (AGVS) are the important equipments of
   Modern Material Flow System. In this paper, we propose the new fuzzy
   control optimisation of robust design for AGVS with fuzzy uncertainty.
   Fuzzy set theory is used to describe the bound of uncertainty. The
   desirable system performance is deterministic (assuring the bottom line)
   and also fuzzy (enhancing the cost consideration). The proposed control
   is deterministic and is not the usual if-then rules-based. The resulting
   controlled system is uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded
   proved via the Lyapunov minimax approach. A performance index (the
   combined cost, which includes average fuzzy system performance and
   control effort) is proposed based on the fuzzy information. The optimal
   design problem associated with the control can then be solved by
   minimizing the performance index. The unique closed-form optimal gain
   and the cost are explicitly shown. The resulting control design is
   systematic and is able to guarantee the deterministic performance as
   well as minimizing the cost.}},

Abstract = {{Automated processing of digital histopathology slides has the potential
   to streamline patient care and provide new tools for cancer
   classification and grading. Before automatic analysis is possible,
   quality control procedures are applied to ensure that each image can be
   read consistently. One important quality control step is color
   normalization of the slide image, which adjusts for color variances
   (batch-effects) caused by differences in stain preparation and image
   acquisition equipment. Color batch-effects affect color-based features
   and reduce the performance of supervised color segmentation algorithms
   on images acquired separately. To identify an optimal normalization
   technique for histopathological color segmentation applications, five
   color normalization algorithms were compared in this study using 204
   images from four image batches. Among the normalization methods, two
   global color normalization methods normalized colors from all stain
   simultaneously and three stain color normalization methods normalized
   colors from individual stains extracted using color deconvolution. Stain
   color normalization methods performed significantly better than global
   color normalization methods in 11 of 12 cross-batch experiments
   (p<0.05). Specifically, the stain color normalization method using
   k-means clustering was found to be the best choice because of high stain
   segmentation accuracy and low computational complexity.}},
