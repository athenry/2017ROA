Abstract = {{This paper presents a power-efficient implantable optogenetic interface
   using a wireless switched-capacitor based stimulating (SCS) system. The
   SCS efficiently charges storage capacitors directly from an inductive
   link and periodically discharges them into an array of micro-LEDs,
   providing high instantaneous power without affecting wireless link and
   system supply voltage. A custom-designed computer interface in LabVIEW
   environment wirelessly controls stimulation parameters through the
   inductive link, and an optrode array enables simultaneous neural
   recording along with optical stimulation. The 4-channel SCS system
   prototype has been implemented in a 0.35-mu m CMOS process and combined
   with the optrode array. In vivo experiments involving light-induced
   local field potentials verified the efficacy of the SCS system. An
   implantable version of the SCS system with flexible hermetic sealing is
   under development for chronic experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Different regions in the resting brain exhibit nonstationary functional
   connectivity (FC) over time. In this paper, a simple and efficient
   framework of clustering the variability in FC of a rat's brain at rest
   is proposed. This clustering process reveals areas that are always
   connected with a chosen region, called seed voxel, along with the areas
   exhibiting variability in the FC. This addresses an issue common to most
   dynamic FC analysis techniques, which is the assumption that the spatial
   extent of a given network remains constant over time. We increase the
   voxel size and reduce the spatial resolution to analyze variable FC of
   the whole resting brain. We hypothesize that the adjacent voxels in
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), just as in
   task-based fMRI, exhibit similar intensities, so they can be averaged to
   obtain larger voxels without any significant loss of information.
   Sliding window correlation is used to compute variable patterns of the
   rat's whole brain FC with the seed voxel in the sensorimotor cortex.
   These patterns are grouped based on their spatial similarities using
   binary transformed feature vectors in k-means clustering, not only
   revealing the variable and non-variable portions of FC in the resting
   brain but also detecting the extent of the variability of these
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Tracheal activity recognition can play an important role in continuous
   health monitoring for wearable systems and facilitate the advancement of
   personalized healthcare. Neck-worn systems provide access to a unique
   set of health-related data that other wearable devices simply cannot
   obtain. Activities including breathing, chewing, clearing the throat,
   coughing, swallowing, speech and even heartbeat can be recorded from
   around the neck. In this paper, we explore tracheal activity recognition
   using a combination of promising acoustic features from related work and
   apply simplistic classifiers including K-NN and Naive Bayes. For
   wearable systems in which low power consumption is of primary concern,
   we show that with a sub-optimal sampling rate of 16 kHz, we have
   achieved average classification results in the range of 86.6\% to 87.4\%
   using 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN and Naive Bayes. All classifiers obtained the
   highest recognition rate in the range of 97.2\% to 99.4\% for speech
   classification. This is promising to mitigate privacy concerns

Abstract = {{Clinical decision support systems use image processing and machine
   learning methods to objectively predict cancer in histopathological
   images. Integral to the development of machine learning classifiers is
   the ability to generalize from training data to unseen future data. A
   classification model's ability to accurately predict class label for new
   unseen data is measured by performance metrics, which also informs the
   classifier model selection process. Based on our research, commonly used
   metrics in literature (such as accuracy, ROC curve) do not accurately
   reflect the trained model's robustness. To the best of our knowledge, no
   research has been conducted to quantitatively compare performance
   metrics in the context of cancer prediction in histopathological images.
   In this paper, we evaluate various performance metrics and show that the
   Lift metric has the highest correlation between internal and external
   validation sets of a nested cross validation pipeline (R-2 = 0.57).
   Thus, we demonstrate that the Lift metric best generalizes classifier
   performance among the 23 metrics that were evaluated. Using the lift
   metric, we develop a classifier with a misclassification rate of 0.25
   (4-class classifier) for data that the model was not trained on
   (external validation).}},

   EnerCage-HC system can wirelessly power a mobile unit attached to a
   small animal subject and also track its behavior in real-time as it is
   housed inside a standard homecage. The EnerCage-HC system is equipped
   with one central and four overlapping slanted wire-wound coils (WWCs)
   with optimal geometries to form 3-and 4-coil power transmission links
   while operating at 13.56 MHz. Utilizing multi-coil links increases the
   power transfer efficiency (PTE) compared to conventional 2-coil links
   and also reduces the number of power amplifiers (PAs) to only one, which
   significantly reduces the system complexity, cost, and dissipated heat.
   A Microsoft Kinect installed 90 cm above the homecage localizes the

Abstract = {{We introduce the Spectrum-averaged Harmonic Path (SHAPA) algorithm for
   estimation of heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) with Impulse
   Radio Ultrawideband (IRUWB) radar. Periodic movement of human torso
   caused by respiration and heart beat induces fundamental frequencies and
   their harmonics at the respiration and heart rates. IR-UWB enables
   capture of these spectral components and frequency domain processing
   enables a low cost implementation. Most existing methods of identifying
   the fundamental component either in frequency or time domain to estimate
   the HR and/or RR lead to significant error if the fundamental is
   distorted or cancelled by interference. The SHAPA algorithm (1) takes
   advantage of the HR harmonics, where there is less interference, and (2)
   exploits the information in previous spectra to achieve more reliable
   and robust estimation of the fundamental frequency in the spectrum under
   consideration. Example experimental results for HR estimation
   demonstrate how our algorithm eliminates errors caused by interference
   and produces 16\% to 60\% more valid estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We present a system-on-a-chip (SoC) for use in high-frequency capacitive
   micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) imaging systems. This SoC
   consists of trans-impedance amplifiers (TIA), delay locked loop (DLL)
   based clock multiplier, quadrature sampler, and pulse width modulator
   (PWM). The SoC down converts RF echo signal to baseband by quadrature
   sampling which facilitates modulation. To send data through a 1.6 m wire
   in the catheter which has limited bandwidth and is vulnerable to noise,
   the SoC creates a pseudo-digital PWM signal which can be used for back
   telemetry or wireless readout of the RF data. In this implementation,
   using a 0.35-mu m std. CMOS process, the TIA and single-to-differential
   ( STD) converter had 45 MHz bandwidth, the quadrature sampler had 10.1
   dB conversion gain, and the PWM had 5-bit ENoB. Preliminary results
   verified front-end functionality, and the power consumption of a TIA,
   STD, quadrature sampler, PWM, and clock multiplier was 26 mW from a 3 V
   supply.}},

Abstract = {{The recent resurgence of ballistocardiogram (BCG) measurement and
   interpretation technologies has led to a wide range of powerful tools
   available for unobtrusively assessing mechanical aspects of
   cardiovascular health at home. Researchers have demonstrated a multitude
   of modern BCG measurement modalities, including beds, chairs, weighing
   scales, and wearable approaches. However, many modalities produce
   significant variations in the morphology of the measured BCG, creating
   confusion in the analysis and interpretation of the signals. This paper
   creates a framework for comparing wearable BCG measurements to whole
   body measurements-such as taken with a weighing scale system-to
   eventually allow the same analysis and interpretation tools that have
   been developed for whole body systems to be applied in the future to
   wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, it represents the first
   attempt to morphologically compare vertical acceleration recordings
   measured on different locations on the torso to whole body displacements
   measured by BCG instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{RNA-seq enables quantification of the human transcriptome. Estimation of
   gene expression is a fundamental issue in the analysis of RNA-seq data.
   However, there is an inherent ambiguity in distinguishing between genes
   with very low expression and experimental or transcriptional noise. We
   conducted an exploratory investigation of some factors that may affect
   gene expression calls. We observed that the distribution of reads that
   map to exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions are distinct. These
   distributions may provide useful insights into the behavior of gene
   expression noise. Moreover, we observed that these distributions are
   qualitatively similar between two sequence mapping algorithms. Finally,
   we examined the relationship between gene length and gene expression
   calls, and observed that they are correlated. This preliminary
   investigation is important for RNA-seq gene expression analysis because
   it may lead to more effective algorithms for distinguishing between true
   gene expression and experimental or transcriptional noise.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody-based drug delivery systems (ADDS) are established as the most
   promising therapeutic methods for the treatment of human cancers and
   other diseases. ADDS are composed of small molecules (antibodies) that
   selectively bind to receptors (antigens) expressed by the diseased
   cells. In this paper, the Molecular Communication (MC) paradigm, where
   the delivery of molecules is abstracted as the delivery of information,
   is extended to be applied to the design and engineering of ADDS. The
   authors have previously developed a straightforward framework for the
   modeling of Particulate Drug Delivery Systems (PDDS) using nano-sized
   molecules. Here, the specificities of antibody molecules are taken into
   account to provide an analytical model of ADDS transport. The inputs of
   the MC model of PDDS are the geometric properties of the antibodies and
   the topology of the blood vessels where they are propagated. Numerical
   results show that the analytical MC model is in good agreement with
   finite-element simulations, and that the anisotropy is an important
   factor influencing ADDS.}},

Abstract = {{The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of
   serious lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young
   children. RSV often causes increased airway resistance, clinically
   detected as wheezing by chest auscultation. In this disease, expiratory
   flows are significantly reduced due to the high resistance in patient's
   airway passages. A quantitative method for measuring resistance can have
   a great benefit to diagnosis and management of children with RSV
   infections as well as with other lung diseases. Airway resistance is
   defined as the lung pressure divided by the airflow. In this paper, we
   propose a method to quantify resistance through a simple, non-contact
   measurement of chest volume that can act as a surrogate measure of the
   lung pressure and volumetric airflow. We used depth data collected by a
   Microsoft Kinect camera for the measurement of the lung volume over
   time. In our experimentation, breathing through a number of plastic
   straws induced different airway resistances. For a standard spirometry
   test, our volume/flow estimation using Kinect showed strong correlation
   with the flow data collected by a commercially-available spirometer
   (five subjects, each performing 20 breathing trials, correlation
   coefficient = 0.88, with 95 \% confidence interval). As the number of
   straws decreased, emulating a higher airway obstruction, our algorithm
   was sufficient to distinguish between several levels of airway
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Pattern recognition in tissue biopsy images can assist in clinical
   diagnosis and identify relevant image characteristics linked with
   various biological characteristics. Although previous work suggests
   several informative imaging features for pattern recognition, there
   exists a semantic gap between characteristics of these features and
   pathologists' interpretation of histopathological images. To address
   this challenge, we develop a clinical decision support system for
   automated Fuhrman grading of renal carcinoma biopsy images. We extract
   1316 color, shape, texture and topology features and develop one vs. all
   models for four Fuhrman grades. Our models are highly accurate with
   90.4\% accuracy in a four-class prediction. Predictivity analysis
   suggests good generalization of the model development methodology
   through robustness to dataset sampling in cross-validation. We provide a
   semantic interpretation for the imaging features used in these models by
   linking features to pathologists' grading criteria. Our study identifies
   novel imaging features that are semantically linked to Fuhrman grading
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{As wind generation penetration increases in older power networks, a
   system becomes more vulnerable due to intermittency of the wind. It is
   desired to replace more conventional power with wind generation, but
   this may lead to overloaded lines as well as low voltage buses. In
   certain cases the power system may even collapses (i. e., no valid load
   flow solution exists). Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) devices
   can provide significant reactive power to ensure the voltage stability,
   but they should be optimally designed, for both their ratings and
   locations, because of their high costs of installation. Based on a
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, this paper introduces a
   general approach to determine the optimal location and sizing of the
   STATCOM devices for the power system with low-voltage buses or no valid
   load flow solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the voltage
   stability of the power system is achieved after the STATCOM devices are
   optimally placed, for all the potential stochastic output powers of the
   wind plants.}},

Abstract = {{Vision-based traffic surveillance systems are among the most reliable,
   inexpensive, and highly applicable methodologies for surveying traffic
   conditions. The implementation of these strategies, however, is limited
   under certain conditions, such as the presence of vehicle occlusions or
   poor illumination conditions that lead to either overcounted or
   under-counted traffic data. The proposed motion-based methodology is
   intended to overcome these limitations by using a new technique for
   full-body occlusion handling of vehicles. The methodology is based on
   five main steps: calibration, detection, tracking, counting, and
   occlusion handling. The proposed methodology was tested with various
   30-min videos and 452 preidentified cases of occlusion. Preliminary
   results indicated that the proposed methodology was reliable and robust
   in providing traffic density analysis. Future work may rely on the
   extension of the proposed methodology to deal with the detection of
   vehicles moving toward multiple directions.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008, the Georgia State Road and Tollway Authority and the Georgia
   Department of Transportation successfully applied to the U.S. Department
   of Transportation for seed funding under the Congestion Reduction
   Demonstration Program Grant to convert the congested I-85
   high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lane to a high-occupancy-toll (HOT) lane.
   The facility was converted into a HOT lane and opened on October 1,
   2011. This paper reports on the collection, processing, and filtering of
   the vehicle occupancy data and the factors that influenced vehicle
   occupancy along the I-85 corridor both before and after the conversion.
   The research effort used regression tree analysis techniques to identify
   data collector bias and then the effects of different factors such as
   season, data collection site, morning peak evening peak, and lane type
   on vehicle occupancy. The study found that vehicle occupancy data on
   Monday were different from those data collected on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
   and Thursdays. The study identified data collectors and sessions that
   had statistically different data from other sessions and filtered those
   data. The research effort then explored the factors affecting vehicle
   occupancy for the morning peak and the afternoon peak periods
   separately, given that related travel behavior characteristics were
   quite different. The research identified lane type (managed or
   general-purpose) as the most significant factor affecting occupancy,
   followed by pre- and post-conversion of the HOV lane to HOT lane. The
   study also found that average vehicle occupancy decreased after
   conversion of the HOV lane. On the basis of the results of this study,
   the vehicle occupancy data were aggregated into the center stations,
   north of the GA-316 region and south of the I-285 region. The vehicle
   occupancy data are currently being applied to evaluate person throughput
   along the corridor.}},

   Enhancing the Practice with Quality Evidence and Systematic
   Documentation}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2460}},
Pages = {{146-153}},
Abstract = {{Recent emphasis on performance-based approaches, reflected, for example,
   in the mandates of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century
   Act, provides opportunities for more rigorous approaches to collecting
   and using ``evidence{''} in transportation asset management (TAM). A
   strong evidence-based approach was founded on well-documented studies
   demonstrating failure or success following the implementation of an
   intervention. This study explored the use of evidence in TAM and
   performance-based decision making. The study's methodology included a
   review of evidence-based approaches from various fields, an ``evidence
   exchange{''} between transportation practitioners, and case studies
   providing examples of evidence in TAM. The study identified attributes
   of evidence-based approaches that could lend themselves to enhancing
   AASHTO's existing framework for TAM program advancement and asset
   management decision making. These attributes were used to (a) develop a
   formal hierarchy of evidence to be used in evidence-based decision
   making for TAM and (b) develop a documentation framework for TAM that
   can be applied at the project and program levels to ensure
   evidence-based decisions. The results of this work demonstrate for TAM
   practitioners what constitutes quality evidence, how it is gathered, and
   how it can be interpreted and used.}},

   Atlanta, Georgia}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2470}},
Pages = {{161-168}},
Abstract = {{The I-85 express lanes in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan region are
   among the newest high-occupancy-toll (HOT) facilities in the United
   States. This paper examines travelers' value of time and their
   willingness to pay for the I-85 express lanes, compares travel times and
   travel time reliability in the general purpose and HOT lanes, and
   discusses the benefits users gain from the facility. The study examined
   9 months of toll and travel time data for drivers who traversed the
   entire length of the express lane corridor during the morning and
   afternoon peak periods. Median values of travel time savings were \$36/h
   in the southbound morning peak period and \$26/h in the northbound
   afternoon peak period. The express lanes exhibited reliability benefits
   relative to the general-purpose lanes, but this study does not quantify
   the value of those benefits because of the lack of stated-preference
   data. The value that HOT lane users attributed to their time saved
   exceeded the time value obtained by using the average wage rate in the
   region. These results for the value of travel time were found to be
   similar to those for HOT lane implementations in other locations.}},

   Occupancy in Atlanta, Georgia}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2470}},
Pages = {{169-177}},
Abstract = {{In October 2011, Atlanta, Georgia, opened its first high-occupancy toll
   (HOT) lanes, which were converted from high-occupancy vehicle (HOV)
   lanes. In partnership with the Georgia Department of Transportation, the
   Georgia Institute of Technology established a research team to assess
   changes in vehicle throughput, vehicle occupancy, and passenger
   throughput associated with the I-85 HOV-to-HOT lane conversion. For the
   assessment of these measures, commuter bus ridership, which carries a
   significant portion of ridership, could not be collected through the
   applied efforts to collect field data. Moreover, the effects of
   ridership and vehicle throughput on vanpools, which also use the managed
   lanes, are unknown. The purpose of this research was to estimate the
   change in vehicle and person throughput of alternative modes before and
   after the HOV-to-HOT lane conversion. The results indicate that person
   throughput remained relatively stable for commuter buses, even with an
   increase in vehicle throughput. The vehicle throughput of vanpools was
   not substantial and increased slightly after the conversion. The
   commuter bus results were unexpected, as ridership was expected to
   increase because of the related travel time saving and reliability.
   Behavioral research is needed to understand the underlying effects of
   ridership to separate the underlying effects from external factors such
   as gas prices, travel times, employment, and others.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new and novel design of what is been named an
   Advanced Smart House Energy Management System. The physical system
   consists of a distribution transformer, the service drop and a
   residential house. The management system consists of an advanced
   infrastructure that exploits state of the art technologies such as
   Distributed State Estimation, smart appliances, electro-thermal models
   of important components, and optimization. The state estimation uses a
   physically based modeling approach for each component of the system;
   coupled with utilization of GPS synchronized measurements it provides
   the real time model of the system under consideration with a time tag
   that indicates the time at which the model was captured. This approach
   has two advantages: (a) it provides a high fidelity model of the
   transformer and residential house that is utilized for the management of
   the house loads and loading of the transformer, and (b) the model can be
   used with other similar models of residential house by upstream
   management systems that can construct the model of many residential
   loads by synthesizing the models of the house of identical time tags.
   The management of more than one house is beyond the scope of this paper.
   The proposed management system can perform advanced applications such as
   house peak load reduction as well as distribution transformer hot spot
   temperature drop. In addition, the proposed system facilitates the
   implementation of other state of the art application such as
   Setting-Less Protection, automation and integration of the system, and
   self-healing. This paper presents a simplified system with preliminary
   results. The simplified system is expected to be further developed to
   include all major parts of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly focuses on the real-time price forecasting in New York
   electricity market through random forest. Accurate forecasting is
   regarded as the most practical way to win power bid in today's highly

   forecasting methods, random forest, as a newly introduced method, will
   provide a price probability distribution, which will allow the users to

Abstract = {{This paper/panel proposes an integrated and seamless infrastructure for
   protection, control and operation of an electric power system that
   enables a seamless Dynamic Security Assessment. At the lower level of
   the infrastructure a dynamic state estimation of protection zones
   (individual components) operates continuously for the purpose of
   providing protection for the zone. This scheme simplifies the protection
   approach for the zone by not requiring coordination with other
   protection zones. The scheme provides the real time dynamic model of the
   zone as well as the real time operating conditions. The scheme is
   ideally fitted in the most recent automation schemes for substations
   based on merging units and process bus with GPS synchronization - in
   this case the implementation is as simple as connecting a computing
   device (PC or relay) to the process bus. An object oriented approach has
   been implemented which provides the dynamic state and model estimate of
   each protection zone (individual component) in a standard syntax and
   format. The component dynamic state and model estimate is referenced to
   UTC time. At the substation, synthesis of all components of the same UTC
   time stamp provides the substation state estimate. This task is
   performed each cycle (60 times per second for 60 Hz systems and 50 times
   per second for 50 Hz systems) and the substation state estimate is
   transmitted to the control center. At the control center synthesis of
   all substation state estimates of the same UTC time stamp provides the
   system wide state estimate (system wide real time model). This approach
   provides the real time model of the system at speeds of 60 times per
   second and latency in the order of one cycle. The paper describes the
   use of the real time model for dynamic security assessment in a seamless
   way. The DSA can be performed with the system wide real time model or
   for problems that tend to be local in nature, as the voltage/VAR control
   problem tends to be, the described infrastructure can provide the model
   of a subsystem (system of interest) and an equivalent of the rest of the
   system at the boundaries of the subsystem. Examples will be provided.}},

Abstract = {{Chargeable electric vehicles are projected to gain increasing market
   share becoming a significant load in distribution systems. An
   un-controlled charging of a large number of electric vehicles can
   potentially lead to problems in distribution circuits including low
   voltage levels and component overloads. These problems can be avoided by
   implementing a vehicle charging control scheme. This paper proposes a
   particle-swarm optimization-based method to centrally control vehicle
   charging on a neighborhood level. Vehicle charging is scheduled
   day-ahead for a given distribution system area while minimizing the
   total charging cost subject to grid and vehicle constraints. The
   proposed computationally efficient algorithm reduces the charging cost
   while enforcing voltage or line flow limits applying linear
   sensitivities. We demonstrate the method in a model of a real meshed
   121-bus, 57-vehicle European low voltage distribution system.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing penetration of distributed energy sources in distribution
   grids introduces new challenges, including regulation of voltages in the
   distribution system, particularly voltage rise issues in cases of low
   load and high generation. This paper proposes a methodology to achieve
   cooperation between the inverters that interface the DG units to the
   grid, so that the voltages across all the nodes of the distribution
   system maintain an acceptable profile. Each node in the distribution
   system acts as an agent, measuring its deviation from nominal voltage.
   Subsequently, all the nodes engage in a multi-agent consensus algorithm,
   to share their measurements. The algorithm is decentralized, and each
   node needs to communicate exclusively with its neighboring nodes.
   Utilizing the feedback of the observed total deviation of all the nodes
   from their desired voltage, each inverter adjusts its local reactive
   power injection, through a local I controller. Control design of this
   local controller is also discussed in this work. Simulation results for
   the IEEE 123node test feeder verify that the approach results in
   significantly improved voltage profile compared to the unity power
   factor control and it addresses the issue of voltage rise in the
   distribution grid by utilizing each unit's reactive power margin.}},

   This locational information improves the speed and accuracy of the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel time-variant load model based on data-mining
   of a historical smart meter database. As part of the ongoing smart grid
   transformation, smart meters have been widely installed producing

   critical needs for distribution system operations and planning
   applications is enhanced modeling of the load, in particular, its
   dependence on the voltage. Under the typical smart meter recording
   resolution (15-minutes), the load's P-V and Q-V properties are buried in
   the spontaneous load changes caused by random customer behaviors. To
   overcome this, the concept of load condition is introduced and data
   mining techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and K-subspace are
   implemented. The proposed model is tested on a large database for the
   Georgia Tech campus, and the results demonstrate that the new model

Abstract = {{Modern microprocessor pipelines experience timing uncertainties due to
   manufacturing process variations, thermal variations, supply voltage
   droop and data-dependent path delays. This leads to power and/or
   performance inefficiencies in current timing guardbanding methods
   especially when pipeline stages are operating well under their critical
   path timing constraints due to the temporal characteristics of input
   data. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive pipeline design that
   automatically adjusts to timing variations, thus reducing/eliminating
   the need for design guardbanding. Each pipeline stage is equipped with
   an activity completion sensor that determines switching activity
   completion in the respective pipeline stage with a very high probability
   of correctness. The switching activity completion detection is used to
   trigger handoff of data from one pipeline stage to another. The pipeline
   is equipped with low overhead back-up error resilient circuits to handle
   incorrect (but infrequent) completion sensing and continue forward
   progress. Such a scheme enables time lending between pipeline stages,
   thus allowing correct pipeline computations at a lower voltage/higher
   clock frequency as compared to fully synchronous designs. Simulations
   and layout generated results from extracted netlists of pipelined
   arithmetic designs show 32.52\% improvement in throughput at same supply
   voltage or 18\% lesser power for the same throughput over conventional
   fully synchronous design incorporating worst-case safety margins.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{3141-3175}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting the most appropriate
   model, amongst a given collection of mixture models, to describe
   datasets likely drawn from mixture of distributions. The proposed method
   consists of finding the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLEs) of
   the various models in competition, using the Expectation-Maximization
   (EM) type algorithms, and subsequently estimating, for every model, a
   statistical distance to the true model based on the empirical cumulative
   distribution function (cdf) of the original dataset and the QMLE-fitted
   cdf. To evaluate the goodness of fit, a new metric, the Integrated
   Cumulative Error (ICE) is proposed and compared with other existing
   metrics for accuracy of detecting the appropriate model. We state, under
   mild conditions, that our estimator of the ICE distance converges at the
   rate root n? in probability along with the consistency of our model
   selection procedure (ability to detect asymptotically the right model).
   The ICE criterion shows, over a set of benchmark examples, numerically
   improved performance from the existing distance-based criteria in

Abstract = {{Damage to membranes during operation and the consequential loss of
   process integrity are prevalent problems in membrane-based separation
   processes, particularly in water and wastewater treatment where ensuring
   product water quality is essential. We herein present an innovative
   method of healing compromised polymeric membranes without requiring the
   knowledge of damage location and the disassembly of a system. This in
   situ healing method involves preferential blocking of a damaged site
   using chitosan agglomerates and subsequent cross-linking with
   glutaraldehyde to form a sturdy plug. Results of this proof-of-concept
   study suggest that a sample ultrafiltration membrane with severe
   physical damage could recover its nearly original performance in terms
   of water permeability (96\%) and solute/particle rejection (87-100\%) by
   the healing process.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectrification is one of the most common effects in our daily
   life, but it is usually taken as a negative effect with very limited
   positive applications. Here, we invented a triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG) based on organic materials that is used to convert mechanical
   energy into electricity. The TENG is based on the conjunction of
   triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, and it utilizes the
   most common materials available in our daily life, such as papers,
   fabrics, PTFE, PDMS, Al, PVC etc. In this short review, we first
   introduce the four most fundamental modes of TENG, based on which a
   range of applications have been demonstrated. The area power density
   reaches 1200 W m(-2), volume density reaches 490 kW m(-3), and an energy
   conversion efficiency of similar to 50-85\% has been demonstrated. The
   TENG can be applied to harvest all kinds of mechanical energy that is
   available in our daily life, such as human motion, walking, vibration,
   mechanical triggering, rotation energy, wind, a moving automobile,
   flowing water, rain drops, tide and ocean waves. Therefore, it is a new
   paradigm for energy harvesting. Furthermore, TENG can be a sensor that
   directly converts a mechanical triggering into a self-generated electric
   signal for detection of motion, vibration, mechanical stimuli, physical
   touching, and biological movement. After a summary of TENG for
   micro-scale energy harvesting, mega-scale energy harvesting, and
   self-powered systems, we will present a set of questions that need to be
   discussed and explored for applications of the TENG. Lastly, since the
   energy conversion efficiencies for each mode can be different although
   the materials are the same, depending on the triggering conditions and
   design geometry. But one common factor that determines the performance
   of all the TENGs is the charge density on the two surfaces, the
   saturation value of which may independent of the triggering
   configurations of the TENG. Therefore, the triboelectric charge density
   or the relative charge density in reference to a standard material (such
   as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) can be taken as a measuring matrix
   for characterizing the performance of the material for the TENG.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect and dispose of buried mines requires effective
   means by which to discriminate between hazardous targets and benign
   clutter. In that regard, wide-band electromagnetic induction (EMI)
   sensors have shown significant promise in their ability to classify
   buried metallic objects based on their response to illumination by a
   time-varying magnetic field. A target's scattered response may be
   expressed compactly in its magnetic polarizability dyadic, a form that
   describes the reaction of the scatterer to an arbitrary magnetic field.
   The magnetic polarizability dyadic may be written in terms of the eddy
   currents that are induced in the target. The method described in this
   paper uses a scalar stream function as a basis for the eddy currents
   that are induced in the target. This approach is powerful since the
   solenoidality of the current density is enforced trivially and its
   boundary conditions may be enforced elegantly. By setting up the eddy
   current equation as a generalized eigenvalue problem we arrive at a
   modal decomposition of the polarizability dyadic.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous-wave electromagnetic induction systems used for subsurface
   sensing often employ separate transmit and receive coils. In these
   systems, it is desirable to have zero mutual coupling between the
   transmit and receive coils and for the coils to have maximum sensitivity
   at a specific location. A representation of a pair of coils as stream
   functions on planar surfaces is created, and then a method of optimizing
   these stream functions for minimum mutual coupling and maximum
   sensitivity using a convex solver is developed. A pair of coils is
   optimized for varying amounts of dissipated power and stored energy, and
   the solutions are categorized. The sensitivity of the optimized coils is
   then compared to other common coil types.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors are commonly used to detect and
   locate buried metallic objects such as landmines, but they are capable
   of extracting much more information about objects, e.g., location and
   magnetic polarizability. Recent research has led to an effective
   inversion method to extract target orientation by finding the tensor
   representation of the target {[}1-3]. The ``tensor amplitude{''}
   extraction techniques also have an important capability that has not
   been fully examined until now, and that is the ease with which they can
   be used with a variety of EMI sensor geometries. This paper will examine
   how making slight alterations to an existing sensor geometry can
   dramatically increase its effectiveness, while still using the ``tensor
   amplitude{''} extraction to accurately and efficiently determine the
   unknown parameters of a metallic object.}},

Abstract = {{Although energy in vibrations is often vast, the electrostatic force
   with which tiny variable capacitors draw power from motion is miniscule,
   so output power is low. Thankfully, extracting energy at higher voltages
   generates more power because the electrical damping force that impedes
   motion to draw power is stronger. Clamping the transducer to a battery
   is convenient in this respect, but limiting because battery voltages are
   low. Using a capacitor to clamp the transducer to a higher voltage is
   better, but only to the extent that capacitance keeps that voltage from
   reaching the breakdown level of the switches. In fact, when neglecting
   parasitic power losses in the switches and the controller, a grounded
   clamping capacitor can yield up to 100\% of the theoretical maximum
   power, and up to 87\% with 2.5 nF, 15-V switches, and a 3.3-V battery
   from a 30-250-pF transducer at 27.6 Hz. Under similar conditions, this
   paper also shows that battery-clamped and asynchronous and stacked
   capacitor-clamped systems generate 4\%, 17\%, and 53\%.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting using cantilevered piezoelectric beam
   has been extensively studied over the last decade. In this study, as an
   alternative to resonant piezoelectric cantilevers, we studied multiple
   patch-based piezoelectric energy harvesting from multiple vibration
   modes of thin plates. Analytical electroelastic model of the multiple
   patch-based piezoelectric harvesters attached on a thin plate is
   provided based on distributed-parameter modeling approach for series and
   parallel configurations of the patches. An experimental setup is built
   with series-configuration of double patch-based harvesters attached on
   the surfaces of all-four-edges clamped (CCCC) rectangular aluminum
   plate. Analytical simulations and experimental validations of power
   generation of the harvesters are performed in a case study. The
   experimental and analytical frequency response functions (FRF) relating
   voltage output and vibration response to force input are obtained. The
   analytical model is validated by comparing analytical and experimental
   FRFs for a wide range of resistive electrical boundary conditions. The
   harvested power output across the various resistive loads is explored
   with a focus on the first four modes of the aluminum plate. Experimental
   and analytical results are shown to be in agreement for multiple
   patch-based piezoelectric energy harvesting from multiple vibration

Abstract = {{Vibration-to-electricity conversion has been heavily researched over the
   last decade with the ultimate goal of enabling self-powered small
   electronic components to use in wireless applications ranging from
   medical implants to structural health monitoring sensors. Regardless of
   the transduction mechanism used in transforming vibrational energy into
   electricity, the existing research efforts have mostly focused on
   deterministic or stochastic harvesting of direct vibrational energy
   available at a fixed location in space. Such an approach is convenient
   to design and employ linear and nonlinear vibration-based energy
   harvesters, such as base-excited cantilevers with piezoelectric
   laminates. Although the harvesting of local vibrations using linear and
   nonlinear devices has been well studied, there has been little effort to
   investigate power extraction from elastic waves propagating in host
   structures to gain a fundamental understanding of power flow and to best
   exploit not only standing but also traveling wave energy. This paper
   explores the problem of piezoelectric energy harvesting from
   one-dimensional bending waves involving propagating and evanescent
   components with a focus on infinitely long thin beams. A pair of
   electroded piezoelectric patches is implemented as the energy harvesting
   interface connected to a complex electrical load. An analytical modeling
   framework is given in order to relate the harvested power to incoming
   wave in the presence of a generalized resistive-reactive circuit.
   Effects of energy harvesting on the global wave dynamics as well as
   individual propagating and evanescent wave components are investigated
   with an emphasis on the wavelength matching concept. The electrical
   loading conditions for maximum power and efficiency are identified for
   several special cases in the low frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{A hydraulic pressure energy harvester (HPEH) device, which utilizes a
   housing to isolate a piezoelectric stack from the hydraulic fluid via a
   mechanical interface, generates power by converting the dynamic pressure
   within the system into electricity. Prior work developed an HPEH device
   capable of generating 2187 microWatts from an 85 kPa pressure ripple
   amplitude using a 1387 mm(3) stack. A new generation of HPEH produced
   157 microWatts at the test conditions of 18 MPa static pressure and 394
   kPa root-mean-square pressure amplitude using a 50 mm3 stack, thus
   increasing the power produced per volume of piezoelectric stack
   principally due to the higher dynamic pressure input. The stack and
   housing design implemented on this new prototype device yield a compact,
   high-pressure hydraulic pressure energy harvester designed to withstand
   35 MPa. The device, which is less than a 2.54 cm in length as compared
   to a 5.3 cm length of a previous HPEH, was statically tested up to 21.9
   MPa and dynamically tested up to 19 MPa with 400 kPa root-mean-square
   dynamic pressure amplitude. An inductor was included in the load circuit
   in parallel with the stack and the load resistance to increase the power
   output of the device. A previously developed electromechanical power
   output model for this device that predicts the power output given the
   dynamic pressure ripple amplitude is compared to the power results. The
   power extracted from this device would be sufficient to meet the
   proposed applications of the device, which is to power sensor nodes in
   hydraulic systems.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a fusion approach to spoken language recognition by combining
   multiple tokenizers with phone and speech attribute models trained on a
   collection of multilingual corpora with different front-end features.
   The speech attribute models are trained with bottleneck features
   extracted from deep neural networks while the phone models are trained
   with temporal patterns neural network features. By exploiting different
   combinations of front-end features, fundamental speech units and
   tokenization models, we demonstrate that speech attribute units are
   complementary to phone units and produce enhanced performances when they
   are combined with conventional phone based tokenizers. Tested on the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology 2009 language recognition
   evaluation task, leveraged upon diversity in system combination, we find
   that speech attribute recognition followed by language modeling achieves
   an additional average relative equal error rate reduction of more than

Abstract = {{A novel spoken keyword search grammar representation framework is
   proposed to combine the advantages of conventional keyword-filler based
   keyword search (KWS) and the LVCSR-based KWS systems. The proposed
   grammar representation allows keyword search systems to be flexible on
   keyword target settings as in the LVCSR-based keyword search. In
   low-resource scenarios it also provides the system with the ability to
   achieve high keyword detection accuracies as in the keyword-filler based
   KWS systems and to attain a low false alarm rate inherent in the
   LVCSR-based KWS systems. In this paper the proposed grammar is realized
   in three ways by modifying the language models used in LVCSR-based KWS.
   Tested on the evalpart1 data of the IARPA Babel OpenKWS13 Vietnamese
   tasks, experimental results indicate that the combined approaches
   achieve a significant ATWV improvement of more than 50\% relatively
   (from 0.2093 to 0.3287) on the limited-language-pack task, while a 20\%

Abstract = {{We present a domain specific process to enable the verification of
   observer-based fault detection software. Observer-based fault detection
   systems, like control systems, yield invariant properties of quadratic
   types. These quadratic invariants express both safety properties of the
   software, such as the boundedness of the states, and correctness
   properties, such as the absence of false alarms from the fault detector.
   We seek to leverage these quadratic invariants, in an automated way, for
   the formal verification of the fault detection software. The approach,
   named the credible autocoding framework, can be characterized as
   autocoding with proofs. The process starts with the fault detector
   model, along with its safety and correctness properties, all expressed
   formally in a synchronous modeling environment such as Simulink. The
   model is then transformed by a prototype credible autocoder into both
   code and analyzable annotations for the code. We demonstrate the
   credible autocoding process on a running example of an output observer
   fault detector for a 3 degree-of-freedom helicopter control system.}},

   models in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) setting with constrained

   linearizations of the nonlinear closed-loop gain scheduled reference
   system, using convex optimization tools. This approach guarantees
   stability of the closed-loop gain scheduled reference model. Adaptive
   state feedback control architecture is then developed, and its stability
   is proven for the case with constrained control inputs. The resulting
   closed-loop system is shown to have bounded solutions with bounded
   tracking error, with the proposed stable gain scheduled reference model.
   Sufficient conditions for ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system
   are derived. A semi-global stability result is proved with respect to
   the level of saturation for open-loop unstable plants while the
   stability result is shown to be global for open-loop stable plants.
   Simulation results show that the developed adaptive controller can be
   used effectively to control a degraded turboshaft engine for large

Abstract = {{The consideration of nonsmooth Lyapunov functions for proving stability
   of feedback discontinuous systems is an important extension to classical
   stability theory since there exist nonsmooth dynamical systems whose
   equilibria cannot be proved to be stable using standard continuously
   differentiable Lyapunov function theory. For dynamical systems with
   continuously differentiable flows, the concept of smooth control
   Lyapunov functions was developed by Artstein to show the existence of a
   feedback stabilizing controller. A constructive feedback control law
   based on a universal construction of smooth control Lyapunov functions
   was given by Sontag. Even though a stabilizing continuous feedback
   controller guarantees the existence of a smooth control Lyapunov
   function, many systems that possess smooth control Lyapunov functions do
   not necessarily admit a continuous stabilizing feedback controller.
   However, the existence of a control Lyapunov function allows for the
   design of a stabilizing feedback controller that admits Filippov and
   Krasovskii closed-loop system solutions. In this paper, we develop a
   constructive feedback control law for discontinuous dynamical systems
   based on the existence of a nonsmooth control Lyapunov function defined
   in the sense of generalized Clarke gradients and set-valued Lie
   derivatives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a new model reference adaptive control approach for
   uncertain systems with gain scheduled reference models in a multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) setting. Specifically, adaptive state feedback for
   output tracking control problem of MIMO nonlinear systems is studied and
   gain scheduled reference model system is used for generating desired
   state trajectories. Using convex optimization tools a single Lyapunov
   matrix is computed for multiple linearizations near equilibrium and
   non-equilibrium points of the nonlinear closed loop gain scheduled
   reference system. This approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop
   gain scheduled system. Adaptive state feedback control scheme is then
   developed, and its stability is proven. The resulting closed-loop system
   is shown to have bounded solutions with bounded tracking error, with the
   proposed stable gain scheduled reference model. Simulation results show
   that the developed adaptive controller can be used effectively to
   control a degraded turboshaft engine for large thrust commands, with
   guaranteed stability and proper tracking performance.}},

   Course), Control of Mobile Robots, we flipped the classroom in a senior
   robotics and controls class at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The
   students participated in the MOOC and came to class prepared to solve
   controls problems on robots. Key to this experience was not only the
   delivery of theoretical concepts via the MOOC, but also a
   hardware/software platform that provided a learning environment where
   exploratory, practical tinkering was grounded in solid theory. This
   paper reports on the findings of the flipped classroom experiment, as
   well as discusses why this classroom format is ideal for controls

   the driven base. A manual tracking experiment compared tracking
   performance and subjective difficulty using both new and conventional

   shared between the lane-tracking steering assist system and the driver.
   The performance of both controllers and interconnections is compared and

Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithmic technique for optimal mode scheduling
   in switched-mode dynamical systems under the constraint of a minimum
   dwell time. The technique is based on an optimal control formulation of
   the problem and on narrowing the optimality gap associated with the
   maximum principle. It consists of the following four successive steps:
   (i) solving the relaxed optimal control problem; (ii) approximating the
   relaxed solution by a switched-mode control; (iii) modifying the
   switched-mode schedule to incorporate the dwell-time constraints; and
   (iv) improving on the solution obtained in (iii) by further modifying
   the switching times of the modes. The main innovations of the paper are
   in the incorporation of the dwell-time constraints in step (iii), and in
   combining all four steps in a coherent framework. Despite the growing

   general-purpose algorithms which address dwell-time constraints. This
   paper presents an initial study of our proposed approach and
   demonstrates its efficacy via simulation examples while deferring

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in robotics applications is dealing with
   inaccurate sensor data. Specifically, for a group of mobile robots the
   measurement of the exact location of the other robots relative to a
   particular robot is often inaccurate due to sensor uncertainty or
   detrimental environmental conditions. In this paper, we address the
   consensus problem for a group of agent robots with uncertain interagent
   communication. Measurement uncertainty is characterized by balls of
   radius r centered at the neighboring agents exact locations. We show
   that the agents reach an almost consensus state and converge to a
   time-varying ball of radius r and include an analysis approach to the
   problem based on set-valued analysis. Finally, several illustrative
   numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the
   proposed set-valued consensus protocol framework.}},

   In this paper, the optimal linear and nonlinear control problem is
   extended to address a weaker version of closed-loop stability, namely,
   semistability, which involves convergent trajectories and Lyapunov
   stable equilibria and which is of paramount importance for consensus
   control of network dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that the
   optimal semistable state-feedback controller can be solved using a form
   of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman conditions that does not require the

   forward invariant sets (RFIS). The smallest RFIS provides the least
   conservative estimate of system performance under perturbations.
   However, computation of the smallest RFIS through brute force search can
   be a difficult task. We develop a novel algorithm to find the smallest
   RFIS for two-dimensional systems subjected to bounded additive
   perturbations. The algorithm leverages path planning algorithms to
   produce an approximation of the boundary of the smallest RFIS. The
   algorithm is mathematically justified, and simulation results are
   provided showing that the proposed algorithm can be used to find an RFIS
   that is very close to the smallest RFIS. The amount of computation is
   effectively reduced. Hence the algorithm may be generalized to higher
   dimensional systems with generic perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed Resources in the Smart Grid, such as Distributed Generation
   (DG) and Responsive Loads (RL) are capable of providing a wide range of
   ancilliary services, if properly coordinated. However, because of their
   large numbers and distributed nature, using a fully centralized
   communication structure to achieve coordination can be prohibitive, due
   to scale and cost. Decentralized approaches based on multi-agent systems
   theory have been proposed and are focused on linear consensus algorithms
   that asymptotically converge to a cooperative solution. In this paper,
   an alternative approach, which converges in a finite number of steps is
   formulated. The protocol is based on linear iterative updates and known
   observability results from graph structured linear systems. Here, the
   protocol is also modified to address a generalized cooperation problem
   in the context of DG/ RL coordination. Furthermore, the protocol is
   modified to reduce the number of operations per step, ensuring that it
   is applicable to a large scale grid, which is usually the case in
   practice. The applicability of the approach is verified through
   simulations, for the case of grid voltage support through Distributed
   Generation.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have reported enhancing the thermal conductivity of
   semi-crystalline polymers through mechanical stretching, but practical
   application of this process has proven difficult. Here we demonstrate
   the application of enhanced thermal conductivity in a purely amorphous
   polymer for a thermal interface material (TIM) without conductive
   fillers. Many polymer-based TIMs contain carbon fillers to enhance the
   thermal conductivity, however the TIMs reported herein are comprised
   solely of polymer nanotubes. The conjugated polymer polythiophene (Pth)
   is electropolymerized in nanotemplates to produce arrays of vertically
   aligned nanotubes, which adhere well to opposing substrates through van
   der Waals forces. We find that the total thermal resistances of the
   Pth-TIMs are a strong function of height with some dependence on bonding
   pressure, yet independent of applied pressure after bonding.
   Photoacoustic measurements show that the total thermal resistance of the
   TIMs ranges from 9.8 +/- 3.8 to 155 +/- 32 mm(2)-K/W depending on the
   array height and bonding pressure. Estimates of the component
   resistances indicate that the majority of the resistance is in the
   contact between the nanotube free tips and the opposing quartz
   substrate. These Pth-TIMs demonstrate that enhanced thermal conductivity
   polymers can be suitable for heat transfer materials without thermally
   conductive fillers.}},

Abstract = {{We study the equilibrium and dynamic behavior of liquid crystals (LCs)
   under dc and ac electric field using a mesoscopic simulation technique,
   Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). We quantify the reorientation of LC
   molecules and the change in their anisotropic character under external
   perturbation by an order parameter. We find that the electric field
   magnitude has to be above a critical value to initiate the reorientation
   of the director of the LC system along the applied electric field, which
   is consistent with the experimental observations. The response time of
   the reorientation process decreases as the magnitude of the electric
   increases for the de fields. The effect of ac field frequency on the
   order parameter is correlated with the field amplitude. The cyclic
   variation in the order parameter follows the ac field when the
   oscillation period is greater than the response time of the system and
   the amplitude is greater than the critical value. Results suggest that
   the DPD technique can provide important insights in to the dynamic
   behavior of LC system under both dc and ac electric fields. This
   technique can further be applied to examine the properties of colloidal
   LCs which can be very useful for many practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Forests comprised of nominally vertically aligned carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs), having outstanding thermal and mechanical properties, are
   excellent candidates for thermal interface materials (TIMs). However,
   the thermal performance of CNT forest TIMs has been limited by the
   presence of high thermal contact resistances at the CNT tip interface.
   The high thermal contact resistance at the CNT tip interface stems from
   two sources: (1) the relatively weak van der Waals type bonding, which
   impedes phonon transport, and (2) low contact area. In this work we will
   show that common solvents, such as water, can be applied to the CNT
   forest to increase the contact area and reduce the contact resistance by
   an average of 75\%. Specifically, there are two likely mechanisms that
   can increase the contact area when a CNT forest is wet with a fluid and
   compressed in an interface. The first is relaxing the van der Waals
   interactions between contacting CNTs within the forest, consequently
   decreasing the stiffness of the forest and allowing it to better conform
   to the opposing surface. The second is the pulling of CNT tips through
   capillary interactions into contact with the opposing surface as the
   solvent evaporates. By measuring the thermal resistance of CNT TIMs
   before and after soaking in variety of solvents the capacity of each
   mechanism for reducing the contact resistance is explored.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have a relatively simple, rugged
   construction compared to HAWTs. However, vertical-axis wind turbines
   have numerous challenges that may hinder their performance. For instance
   they are strongly affected by dynamic stall at low tip speed ratios. A
   significant part of the kinetic energy contained in the oncoming wind is
   lost in swirl and vortices. As a result, VAWTs have a lower power
   production and efficiency compared to HAWTs. In an effort to alleviate
   the adverse effects of dynamic stall phenomena, the present study
   explores the use of two-element airfoils. A comparative study of single
   element and dual element VAWT configurations for representative VAWT
   turbines is given. The benefits of dual-element configurations are
   analyzed through a detailed flow visualization study of the single and
   two-element VAWT configurations at various azimuthal locations for a
   representative tip speed ratio. Analysis of these qualitative phenomena
   is complemented by a discussion on quantitative data for torque, surface
   pressure distributions, and airloads.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to the ultimate integration and miniaturization of
   MEMS-based 3-D magnetic components involves embedding the volume of the
   magnetic structures within the volume of the silicon wafer itself,
   exploiting microfabricated windings to create current paths, and
   utilizing embedded magnetic cores within the limited footprint of these
   components to boost the magnetic performance. However, this embedding
   approach imposes volumetric and microfabrication constraints that
   require an unusual magnetic component optimization methodology compared
   to wire-wound inductors and PCB inductors. These constraints dictate
   embedded toroidal inductors with non-overlapping windings and thin
   magnetic cores, and impose additional limitations on inductor design
   parameters such as pattern resolution, the number of winding turns and
   winding thickness; these constraints complicate the trade-offs to be
   made in designing core-integrated inductors. A design methodology
   encompassing these constraints is therefore needed. For a targeted
   inductance value within a given footprint, our design methodology
   addresses an inductor with a maximized quality factor based on the
   trade-offs between copper loss and core loss. To illustrate this
   methodology, siliconembedded inductors with iron powder cores are
   designed and fabricated; a quality factor of 24 is achieved at 30 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new post-fault modulation strategy is proposed to
   operate the direct matrix converter (MC) as close as possible to its
   desired normal operating under an open-switch fault condition. The
   proposed strategy determines the switching states of the eight, out of
   the nine, remaining healthy switches of the converter, to generate the
   reference voltage. The corresponding duty cycles of the determined
   switching states are calculated by formulating a nonlinear optimization
   problem that aims at minimization of the error between the desired
   reference voltage and the voltage generated by the switching states. The
   solution to the nonlinear optimization problem is obtained based on the
   Karush-Khun-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Performance of the proposed
   modulation strategy, based on time-domain simulation studies in the
   MATLAB/Simulink software environment, is evaluated and experimentally
   verified. Compared to the existing strategies, the proposed strategy
   provides a superior performance in terms of the output power quality for
   the MC operating under an open-circuit switch fault condition.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in system loads and in levels of penetration of renewable
   energy, together with limited investment in transmission infrastructure,
   are fostering the need for a smarter and more dynamically controllable
   grid. FACTs devices can be used to dynamically control the grid and more
   efficiently route power and thus mitigate these stresses, but such
   devices are either too complicated and expensive for implementation or
   incapable of independently controlling active and reactive power. A
   Controllable Network Transformer (CNT), has a fractionally-rated, direct
   ac/ac converter, and was introduced as a simpler and more cost-effective
   solution to realize dynamic power control between two areas. The CNT
   utilizes the Dual Virtual Quadrature Sources (DVQS) technique to change
   both the line voltage amplitude and phase angle, thus enabling a dynamic
   power control; however, the control variables defined in this technique
   have a coupling effect between controlling active and reactive power. To
   overcome this coupling limitation, a fully decoupled closed-loop
   controller for a CNT to achieve independent active and reactive power
   control is derived and tested in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Large scale Potts model Monte Carlo simulation was carried on
   3-dimensional square lattices of 100 3 and 200 3 sizes using the
   Metropolis algorithm to study grain growth behavior. Simulations were
   carried out to investigate both growth kinetics as well as the Zener
   limit in two-phase polycrystals inhibited in growth by second phase
   particles of single-voxel size. Initially the matrices were run to
   10,000 Monte Carlo steps (MCS) to check the growth kinetics in both
   single phase and two-phase poly-crystals. Grain growth exponent values
   obtained as a result have shown to be highest (similar to 0.4) for
   mono-phase materials while the value decreases with addition of second
   phase particles. Subsequently the matrices were run to stagnation in the
   presence of second phase particles of volume fractions ranging from
   0.001 to 0.1. Results obtained have shown a cube root dependence of the
   limiting grain size over the particle volume fraction thus reinforcing
   earlier 3D simulation efforts. It was observed that there was not much
   difference in the values of either growth kinetics or the Zener limit
   between 100(3) and 200(3) sized matrices, although the results improved

Abstract = {{The recently developed consistent spatial homogenization method in
   neutron transport theory is based on basis functions in spatial and
   angular domains and spatial rehomogenization to correct for the core

   phase space resolution and accuracy. In this article, an efficient
   version of the method is developed that also simplifies implementation
   and memory requirements for data handling in multidimensional
   geometries. This is done by (1) replacing the Fourier series with
   B-spline basis functions for the spatial domain; (2) truncating the
   angular expansion to first order, and (3) developing a source iteration
   method to replace the original local fixed-source transport method for
   on-the-fly rehomogenization. The new method is tested in a 1D benchmark
   problem characteristic of pressurized water reactors with mixed oxide
   fuel. The method is found to be very accurate and more efficient than

Title = {{Impact of Mitral Valve Geometry on Hemodynamic Efficacy of Surgical
   Repair in Secondary Mitral Regurgitation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEART VALVE DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: Mitral valve geometry is significantly
   altered secondary to left ventricular remodeling in non-ischemic and
   ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies. Since the extent of remodeling and
   asymmetry of dilatation of the ventricle differ significantly between
   individual patients, the valve geometry and tethering also differ. The
   study aim was to determine if mitral valve geometry has an impact on the
   efficacy of surgical repairs to eliminate regurgitation and restore
   valve closure in a validated experimental model.
   Methods: Porcine mitral valves (n =8) were studied in a pulsatile heart
   simulator, in which the mitral valve geometry can be precisely altered
   and controlled throughout the experiment. Baseline hemodynamics for each
   valve were measured (Control), and the valves were tethered in two
   distinct ways: annular dilatation with 7 mm apical papillary muscle (PM)
   displacement (Tether 1, symmetric), and annular dilatation with 7 mm
   apical, 7 mm posterior and 7 mm lateral PM displacement (Tether 2,
   asymmetric). Mitral annuloplasty was performed on each valve (Annular
   Repair), succeeded by anterior leaflet secondary chordal cutting
   (Sub-annular Repair). The efficacy of each repair in the setting of a
   given valve geometry was quantified by measuring the changes in mitral
   regurgitation (MR), leaflet coaptation length, tethering height and
   area.
   Results: At baseline, none of the valves was regurgitant. Significant
   leaflet tethering was measured in Tether 2 over Tether 1, but both
   groups were significantly higher compared to baseline (60.9 +/- 31 mm(2)
   for Control versus 129.7 +/- 28.4 mm(2) for Tether 1 versus 186.4 +/-
   36.3 mm(2) for Tether 2). Consequently, the MR fraction was higher in
   Tether 2 group (23.0 +/- 5.7\%) than in Tether 1 (10.5 +/- 5.5\%).
   Mitral annuloplasty reduced MR in both groups, but remnant regurgitation
   after the repair was higher in Tether 2. After chordal cutting a similar
   trend was observed with trace regurgitation in Tether 1 group at 3.6 +/-
   2.8\%, in comparison to 18.6 +/- 4.2\% in the Tether 2 group.
   Conclusion: In this experimental model, the tethering geometry of the
   mitral valve impacts the valve hemo dynamics after annuloplasty and
   chordal cutting. The quantitative assessment of valve geometry may help
   in tailoring a repair to the specific tethering pattern.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multi-phase sub-harmonic injection locking
   technique to significantly extend the locking range of a multi-phase
   injection locking oscillator (ILO). Leveraging this technique, a
   scalable and cascadable ``active frequency multiplier{''} chain
   architecture is proposed, which achieves THz signal generation from a
   low mm-wave frequency tone. We also propose a multi-ring topology to
   facilitate the design and the high-frequency routing. As a
   proof-of-concept, a cascaded 3-stage 3-phase 2nd-order sub-harmonic ILO
   chain is implemented in a SiGe BiCMOS process. It achieves 504 GHz
   signal generation from a 42 GHz tone with a 4.4\% frequency tuning
   range, which is the largest tuning range among all the reported Si-based
   THz harmonic oscillator sources at the 0.5 THz band.}},

Abstract = {{In the past two decades, major advances have been made in the clinical
   evaluation and treatment of valvular heart disease owing to the advent
   of noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities. In clinical practice,
   valvular disease evaluation is typically performed on two-dimensional
   (2D) images, even though most imaging modalities offer three-dimensional
   (3D) volumetric, time-resolved data. Such 3D data offer researchers the
   possibility to reconstruct the 3Dgeometry of heart valves at a
   patient-specific level. When these data are integrated with
   computational models, native heart valve biomechanical function can be
   investigated, and preoperative planning tools can be developed. In this
   review, we outline the advances in valve geometry reconstruction, tissue
   property modeling, and loading and boundary definitions for the purpose
   of realistic computational structural analysis of cardiac valve function
   and intervention.}},

Abstract = {{We review the development of virtual tests for high-temperature ceramic

   understanding the relationship between the microstructure of

   combine advanced experiments and theories to address physical,
   mathematical, and engineering aspects of material definition and failure
   prediction. Key new experiments include surface image correlation
   methods and synchrotron-based, micrometer-resolution 3D imaging, both
   executed at temperatures exceeding 1,500 degrees C. Computational
   methods include new probabilistic algorithms for generating stochastic
   virtual specimens, as well as a new augmented finite element method that
   deals efficiently with arbitrary systems of crack initiation,
   bifurcation, and coalescence in heterogeneous materials. Conceptual
   advances include the use of topology to characterize stochastic
   microstructures. We discuss the challenge of predicting the probability
   of an extreme failure event in a computationally tractable manner while

Abstract = {{This research studies a substructure model updating approach. Requiring
   modal testing data from only part of a large structure (i.e. a
   substructure), finite element model parameters for the substructure can
   be updated. Prior to updating, Craig-Bampton transform is adopted to
   condense the entire structural model into the substructure (currently
   being instrumented and to be updated) and the residual structure. Finite
   element model of the substructure remains at high resolution, while
   dynamic behavior of the residual structure is approximated using only a
   limited number of dominant mode shapes. To update the condensed
   structural model, physical parameters in the substructure and modal
   parameters of the residual structure are chosen as optimization
   variables; minimization of the modal dynamic residual is chosen as the
   optimization objective. An iterative linearization procedure is adopted
   for efficiently solving the optimization problem. The proposed
   substructure model updating approach is validated through numerical
   simulation with two plane structures.}},

Abstract = {{Computing elementary functions on large arrays is an essential part of
   many machine learning and signal processing algorithms. Since the
   introduction of floating-point computations in mainstream processors,
   table lookups, division, square root, and piecewise approximations were
   essential components of elementary functions implementations. However,
   we suggest that these operations can not deliver high throughput on
   modern processors, and argue that algorithms which rely only on
   multiplication, addition, and integer operations would achieve higher
   performance. We propose 4 design principles for high-throughput
   elementary functions and suggest how to apply them to implementation of
   log, exp, sin, and tan functions. We evaluate the performance and
   accuracy of the new algorithms on three recent x86 microarchitectures
   and demonstrate that they compare favorably to previously published
   research and vendor-optimized libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed a framework called memory-assisted compression
   that learns the statistical properties of the sequence-generating server
   at intermediate network nodes and then leverages the learnt models to
   overcome the inevitable redundancy (overhead) in the universal
   compression of the payloads of the short-length network packets. In this
   paper, we prove that when the content-generating server is comprised of
   a mixture of parametric sources, label-based clustering of the data to
   their original sequence-generating models from the mixture is optimal
   almost surely as it achieves the mixture entropy (which is the lower
   bound on the average codeword length). Motivated by this result, we
   present a K-means clustering technique as the proof of concept to
   demonstrate the benefits of memory-assisted compression performance.
   Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach by
   matching the expected improvements predicted by theory on man-made
   mixture sources. Finally, the benefits of the cluster-based
   memory-assisted compression are validated on real data traffic traces
   demonstrating more than 50\% traffic reduction on average in data

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed wireless network compression via memory-enabled
   overhearing helpers as an endeavor to reduce the traffic load on the
   wireless gateway via elimination of the redundant data in the network.
   In this setup, each memory-enabled helper overhears the data packets
   previously sent by the wireless gateway to various mobile clients within
   its coverage and uses them toward forming a model about the content of
   the packets from the traffic. The resulting model is then used as side
   information by the wireless network compression module in a two-part
   code to reduce the overall cost of delivering a packet to a client over
   links with asymmetric cost (where the helper-client link is far less
   costly than the gateway-client link). One main challenge in this
   scenario is the fact that memory-enabled overhearing helpers do not
   receive all of the sequences sent to the mobile clients (as there is no
   feedback in place in the overhearing link), resulting in mismatched side
   information between the encoder (i.e., gateway) and the helper. In this
   paper, we present an information theoretic formulation for the
   mismatched side information problem. We study this problem in the
   context of universal lossless compression and derive bounds on the
   average minimax redundancy of encoding each packet. Our results also
   lead to construction of coding schemes for the mismatched side
   information using two-part codes.}},

Title = {{High-pressure Sapphire Cell for Phase Equilibria Measurements of
   CO2/Organic/Water Systems}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The high pressure sapphire cell apparatus was constructed to visually
   determine the composition of multiphase systems without physical
   sampling. Specifically, the sapphire cell enables visual data collection
   from multiple loadings to solve a set of material balances to precisely
   determine phase composition. Ternary phase diagrams can then be
   established to determine the proportion of each component in each phase
   at a given condition. In principle, any ternary system can be studied
   although ternary systems (gas-liquid-liquid) are the specific examples
   discussed herein. For instance, the ternary THF-Water-CO2 system was
   studied at 25 and 40 degrees C and is described herein. Of key
   importance, this technique does not require sampling. Circumventing the
   possible disturbance of the system equilibrium upon sampling, inherent
   measurement errors, and technical difficulties of physically sampling
   under pressure is a significant benefit of this technique. Perhaps as
   important, the sapphire cell also enables the direct visual observation
   of the phase behavior. In fact, as the CO2 pressure is increased, the
   homogeneous THF-Water solution phase splits at about 2 MPa. With this
   technique, it was possible to easily and clearly observe the cloud point
   and determine the composition of the newly formed phases as a function
   of pressure.
   The data acquired with the sapphire cell technique can be used for many
   applications. In our case, we measured swelling and composition for
   tunable solvents, like gas-expanded liquids, gas-expanded ionic liquids
   and Organic Aqueous Tunable Systems (OATS) (1-4). For the latest system,
   OATS, the high-pressure sapphire cell enabled the study of (1) phase
   behavior as a function of pressure and temperature, (2) composition of
   each phase (gas-liquid-liquid) as a function of pressure and temperature
   and (3) catalyst partitioning in the two liquid phases as a function of
   pressure and composition. Finally, the sapphire cell is an especially
   effective tool to gather accurate and reproducible measurements in a
   timely fashion.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2450}},
Pages = {{52-61}},
Abstract = {{High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes use dynamic pricing to manage demand for
   lane use and to maintain acceptable traffic flow and traffic speeds.
   However, minimum occupancy and toll payment requirements raise potential
   socioeconomic questions concerning disparate negative effects across
   demographic groups. The objective of this study was to improve the
   knowledge about socioeconomic aspects of congestion pricing by using the
   I-85 high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) to HOT conversion in Atlanta, Georgia,
   as a case study. To evaluate the effects across user groups, more than
   1.5 million license plate records were collected during a 2-year period,
   1 year before and 1 year after the conversion. Analyses compared
   collected records with state motor vehicle registration databases to
   identify the vehicles and link census block group level and marketing
   household level socioeconomic attributes. In addition, results of a
   2-day travel diary survey conducted by Volpe 6 months before and 6
   months after the conversion were assessed. This study used all three
   sources of data in parallel to undertake a socioeconomic evaluation of
   the HOV-to-HOT conversion. Whereas previous studies were built on only
   one data source with significantly smaller sample sizes, the use of
   three distinctive sources of socioeconomic data and an exceptionally
   large sample size advanced the understanding of the potential
   socioeconomic effects of managed lanes. Furthermore, with the noted
   advantages and disadvantages of these data sources, this study provided
   valuable insight for general demographic analysts.}},

Title = {{Lane Bias Issues in Work Zone Travel Time Measurement and Reporting}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{78-87}},
Abstract = {{Work zones are a major source of nonrecurrent congestion. Because travel
   time is harder to predict in nonrecurrent congestion, accurately
   measured real-time information on travel time in and around work zones
   is a critical component of traveler information systems. State
   departments of transportation have been seeking to provide more accurate
   travel time information in and around work zones. This study
   investigated the accuracy of technologies for the collection of work
   zone travel time data and identified bias in resulting travel times by
   comparing the data with manually collected travel times. Two
   technologies that provided direct measurement of travel times, Bluetooth
   and automatic license plate recognition, were selected for evaluation.
   The two systems were deployed in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and the
   travel time data from both were compared with travel time data collected
   via manual license plate matching from observational data. Although the
   selected technologies reported reasonably accurate travel time data in
   free-flow conditions, their travel times were found to be significantly
   biased toward the slower travel times or the nearest lanes during
   congested traffic conditions. This paper discusses the issue of bias and
   presents recommendations for future implementations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a denoising method aimed at restoring images corrupted by

   distribution of the residual to fit a given target noise distribution.
   The residual distribution constraint constitutes the key novelty behind
   our approach. The restored image is efficiently computed by the
   constrained minimization of an energy functional using an Alternating

Abstract = {{Two local computational strategies for modeling elastic wave
   propagation, namely the Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) and
   Cellular Automata for Elastodynamics (CAFE), are compared and contrasted
   in analyzing bulk waves in two-dimensional nonlinear media. Each
   strategy formulates the problem from the perspective of a cell and its
   local interactions with other cells, leading to robust treatments of
   anisotropy, heterogeneity, and nonlinearity. The local approach also
   enables straight-forward parallelization on high performance computing
   clusters. While the two share a common local perspective, they differ in
   two major respects. The first is that CAFE employs both rectangular and
   triangular cells, while LISA considers only rectangular. The second is
   that LISA appeared much earlier than CAFE (early 1990's versus late
   2000's), and as such has been developed to a much greater degree with a
   multitude of material models, cell-to-cell interactions, loading
   possibilities, and boundary treatments. A hybrid approach which combines
   the two is of great interest since the non-uniform mesh capability of
   the CAFE triangular cell can be readily coupled to LISA's rectangular
   grids, taking advantage of the built-in LISA features on the uniform
   portion of the domain. For linear material domains, the hybrid
   implementation appears straight-forward since both methods have been
   shown to recover the same equations in the rectangular case. For
   nonlinear material domains, the formulations cannot be put into a
   one-to-one correspondence, and hybrid implementation may be more
   problematic. This paper addresses these differences by first presenting
   the underlying formulations, and then computing results for growth of a
   second harmonic in an introduced bulk pressure wave. Rectangular cells
   are used in both LISA and CAFE. Results from both approaches are
   compared to an approximate, analytical solution based on a two-scale
   field representation. Differences in the LISA and CAFE computed
   solutions are discussed and recommendations are made for a follow-on
   hybrid implementation.}},

   naturally results from time and spatial discretization present in a
   numerical model of mechanical continuum. Although discretization itself
   makes possible to model wave propagation in structures with complicated
   geometries and made of different materials, it inevitably causes
   simulation errors when improper time and length scales are chosen for
   the simulations domains. Therefore, by definition, any characteristic
   parameter for spatial and time resolution must create limitations on
   maximal wavenumber and frequency for a numerical model. It should be
   however noted that expected increase of the model quality and its
   functionality in terms of affordable wavenumbers, frequencies and speeds
   should not be achieved merely by denser mesh and reduced time
   integration step. The computational cost would be simply unacceptable.
   The authors present a nonlocal finite difference scheme with the
   coefficients calculated applying a Fourier series, which allows for
   considerable reduction of numerical dispersion. There are presented the
   results of analyses for 2D models, with isotropic and anisotropic
   materials, fulfilling the planar stress state. Reduced numerical
   dispersion is shown in the dispersion surfaces for longitudinal and
   shear waves propagating for different directions with respect to the
   mesh orientation and without dramatic increase of required number of
   nonlocal interactions. A case with the propagation of longitudinal wave
   in composite material is studied with given referential solution of the
   initial value problem for verification of the time-domain outcomes. The
   work gives a perspective of modeling of any type of real material
   dispersion according to measurements and with assumed accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic inspection of aerospace structures, while essential for
   ensuring their safety, incurs significant costs over a structure's life
   and also can result in significant loss of service. Structural health
   monitoring (SHM), which is also referred to as in situ nondestructive
   evaluation (NDE), offers the promise of more frequent assessments of
   structural integrity with little or no loss of service; however, such
   systems are not in common use. Here we consider a combined SHM and NDE
   approach to inspection of composite, plate-like components where the SHM
   system detects sites of possible damage and the follow-up NDE method
   utilizes the in situ SHM sensors to facilitate the inspection. The
   specific SHM approach considered is that of a sparse guided wave array
   using simple transducers that are spatially distributed on the
   structure. The NDE approach is non-contact guided wavefield imaging
   whereby one or more of the SHM transducers is used as a source and full
   wavefield data are recorded over the area of interest. This method has
   the advantage over conventional ultrasonic methods of being non-contact
   and requiring minimal surface preparation. Sparse array and wavefield
   data from a composite specimen with simulated sites of damage are
   presented here to illustrate the concept. Damage is simulated via
   glued-on steel plate pieces at multiple locations, and localization is
   performed using delay-and-sum imaging. A small, single site of simulated
   damage is well-localized, whereas larger and multiple sites of damage
   are not; however, their presence is readily detected. The follow-up
   wavefield imaging using a single sparse array transducer as a source is
   able to not only locate the sites of damage, but is able to provide a
   reasonable estimate of their sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the wave propagation characteristics of
   two-dimensional (2D) magneto-elastic kagome lattices, periodic lattices
   governed by a combination of elastic and magnetic forces. These
   structures demonstrate the ability to undergo large topological and sti
   ff ness changes, which allows for dramatic changes in wave propagation
   characteristics. The analysis is conducted using a lumped mass system of
   magnetic particles with both translational and rotational degrees of
   freedom. Particles within the lattice interact through axial and
   torsional elastic forces as well as magnetic forces. Instabilities
   caused by the highly nonlinear distance-dependent characteristics of
   magnetic interactions are exploited in combination with particle contact
   to bring about the desired changes in the topology and sti ff ness of
   the lattices. The result is multiple stable lattice con fi gurations
   with very di ff erent properties. The propagation of plane waves is
   predicted by applying Bloch theorem to lattice unit cells with
   linearized interactions. The propagation of plane waves in these
   lattices before and after topological changes is compared, and large di

Abstract = {{The effects of turning on the gradients of micro-texture and grain size
   of Al alloy 7075 processed by turning is studied. Analytical models
   based on Boussinesq equation and stress/force transformation, predict
   that the equivalent von-Mises stress penetrate almost 1 mm below the
   machined surface with a maximum of 1400 MPa. The induced temperature
   below the surface is and reaches up to 240 degrees C. As a result of
   deformation below the machined surface, the grains below the surface
   show a preferred grain shape orientation different from the grains in
   the central region. The normalized population of (121) plane increases
   at the machined surface compared to the central part of the sample.
   Orientation distribution functions reveal that at the central part of
   the sample, the material is mostly randomly oriented and the closest
   texture component is the recrystallized texture. On the other hand, the
   strongest texture attribute at the machined surface is beta-fiber
   torsion. The average grain size shows a 10\% decreases moving away from
   center while below the machined surface there is a 50\% increase in the
   average grain size. This can be due to the grain growth caused by higher
   temperatures right below the machining tool. The reported results
   provide a toolset to determine the final properties of the material
   after machining in addition to providing means to more accurately
   describing the machining mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of tumor margins during surgical resection remains a
   challenging task. A complete removal of malignant tissue and
   conservation of healthy tissue is important for the preservation of
   organ function, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Visual
   inspection and palpation is not sufficient for discriminating between
   malignant and normal tissue types. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)
   technology has the potential to noninvasively delineate surgical tumor
   margin and can be used as an intra-operative visual aid tool. Since
   histological images provide the ground truth of cancer margins, it is
   necessary to warp the cancer regions in ex vivo histological images back
   to in vivo hyperspectral images in order to validate the tumor margins
   detected by HSI and to optimize the imaging parameters. In this paper,
   principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract the principle
   component bands of the HSI images, which is then used to register HSI
   images with the corresponding histological image. Affine registration is
   chosen to model the global transformation. A B-spline free form
   deformation (FFD) method is used to model the local non-rigid
   deformation. Registration experiment was performed on animal
   hyperspectral and histological images. Experimental results from animals
   demonstrated the feasibility of the hyperspectral imaging method for
   cancer margin detection.}},

Abstract = {{The orientation of cardiac fibers affects the anatomical, mechanical,
   and electrophysiological properties of the heart. Although
   echocardiography is the most common imaging modality in clinical cardiac
   examination, it can only provide the cardiac geometry or motion
   information without cardiac fiber orientations. If the patient's cardiac
   fiber orientations can be mapped to his/her echocardiography images in
   clinical examinations, it may provide quantitative measures for
   diagnosis, personalized modeling, and image-guided cardiac therapies.
   Therefore, this project addresses the feasibility of mapping
   personalized cardiac fiber orientations to three-dimensional (3D)
   ultrasound image volumes. First, the geometry of the heart extracted
   from the MRI is translated to 3D ultrasound by rigid and deformable
   registration. Deformation fields between both geometries from MRI and
   ultrasound are obtained after registration. Three different deformable
   registration methods were utilized for the MRI-ultrasound registration.
   Finally, the cardiac fiber orientations imaged by DTI are mapped to
   ultrasound volumes based on the extracted deformation fields. Moreover,
   this study also demonstrated the ability to simulate electricity
   activations during the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) process.
   The proposed method has been validated in two rat hearts and three
   canine hearts. After MRI/ultrasound image registration, the Dice
   similarity scores were more than 90\% and the corresponding target
   errors were less than 0.25 mm. This proposed approach can provide
   cardiac fiber orientations to ultrasound images and can have a variety
   of potential applications in cardiac imaging.}},

Abstract = {{A complementary numerical and experimental study was carried out to
   investigate the response of the water surface in an open-channel flow
   through different forms of bridge openings. Experiments were conducted
   in Cardiff University's hydraulics laboratory in a 10 m long and 30 cm
   wide tilting flume into different forms of bridge structures were
   placed. The flow through the openings is characterized by very strong
   variation of the water surface including undular hydraulic jumps. Water
   surface measurements were carried out using a point gage and the
   experimental data are used to validate the free surface algorithm of an
   in-house Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) code. The employed two-phase LES
   code is based on finite differences in staggered arrangement and
   includes a level-set algorithm that separates the phases of air and
   water. The LES code is able to reproduce very well the free-surface
   response to local separation, flow acceleration, recirculation and
   attachment and as well as the hydraulic jumps which forms both for the
   free flow case and the overtopping model bridge case.}},

Abstract = {{Free-Space optical communication is expected to revolutionize the
   deep-space communication by providing the high bandwidth data support
   for future solar and planetary exploration missions. Due to the cost and
   up-gradation constraints, an earth-based receiver seems to be a viable
   option. A large telescope acting as an optical antenna is required at
   the receiver end to support the reasonable data rates (at least in 10s
   of Mbps range). An array of smaller telescopes connected to fabricate a
   larger photon-collecting aperture is an attractive architecture. In this
   research, performance analyses of different array architectures are
   evaluated for a deep-space interplanetary optical communication link
   between Mars and Earth with an objective to find a lower bound on the
   number and sizes of individual telescopes in the array receiver. The
   achievable data rates are calculated for opposition and conjunction
   phases of Mars-Earth orbit. Various deleterious factors, such as
   background noise and atmospheric turbulence are also modeled in the
   simulations. Total aperture size of various array architectures are kept
   at 10 m. The comparison of results for different array architectures
   show that the performance of a receiver employing an array comprising of
   135 telescopes with 0.86 m aperture diameter each is almost equivalent
   to a single telescope with 10 m aperture diameter. Further, if the
   diameter is reduced below this limit, the performance degradation is
   substantial.}},

Abstract = {{This tesearch investigated how targeted marketing (TM) data could be

   comparison of an Atlanta, Georgia, sample with census data. The most
   recent household travel survey conducted by the Atlanta Regional
   Commission was compared with census data; both weighted and unweighted
   survey data were used. Results showed that the distributions of
   socio-demographic variables were similar, particularly for age, gender,
   household income, and the presence of children. The largest
   discrepancies between TM data and census data were associated with
   educational attainment and ethnicity; however, these discrepancies were
   comparable to those observed in the household travel survey.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a single
   machine subject to stochastic breakdowns, where jobs have to be
   restarted if preemptions occur because of breakdowns. The breakdown
   process of the machine is independent of the jobs processed on the
   machine. The processing times required to complete the jobs are
   constants if no breakdown occurs. The machine uptimes are independently
   and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are subject to a uniform
   distribution. It is proved that the Longest Processing Time first (LPT)
   rule minimizes the expected makespan. For the large-scale problem, it is
   also showed that the Shortest Processing Time first (SPT) rule is
   optimal to minimize the expected total completion times of all jobs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a floating gate Ion Sensitive Field Effect
   Transistor (ISFET) to monitor the activity of breast cancer cells. We
   use an ISFET to monitor the change in pH of the cell culture media and
   to observe the apoptosis of the breast cancer cells when treated with
   staurosporine. Since ISFETs suffer from inherent mismatch and drift in
   the threshold voltage, predominantly caused due to accumulation of ions
   on the surface of the gate, we have integrated a floating gate ISFET to
   calibrate the device. Floating gate ISFETs have been used to program the
   threshold voltage of the device either by hot electron injection,
   Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and UV to remove charges. In this work we use
   hot electron injection to precisely program the device and tunneling as
   a global erase. This enables us to precisely record the changes in pH.
   These floating gate devices have been fabricated in 0.5 mu m CMOS
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Machining complex thin-walled components, such as compressor disks and
   casings in aircraft engines, is a challenging task because distributed
   deformation and vibration renders poor precision and quality in final
   products. However, the harsh working conditions such as cutting fluids
   hinder workpiece vibration monitoring, not to mention investigation into
   the vibration principle during cutting. Aiming to decouple and quantify
   the effects of multiple cutting process parameters on thin-walled part
   vibration, this paper employs a plate dynamic model for an annular
   workpiece under constraints emulating those of a two-sided turning
   machine. Therefore, a boundary value problem is formulated and the
   solution procedure is presented in details. With modal analysis, the
   dynamic model is numerically verified with finite element analysis
   (FEA). Also, an eddy-current sensing approach is provided as a simple
   yet practical method for vibration measurement. Experiments are carried
   out to justify the proposed method and validate the stability of
   eddy-current sensing under the harsh environmental condition.}},

   performance and reliability of the final products. This algorithm, which
   takes advantages of the flexible division of three-dimensional space to
   deal with the spatial distribution of the thermal field, is built upon
   physical laws to derive the governing equations in state-space
   representation that facilitates the reconstruction and control of the

   Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates) are illustrated to highlight the
   effectiveness and usefulness of the FSDA for real-time modeling and

   application, the FSDA is evaluated numerically, which consistently
   agrees well with results computed using commercial finite-element
   analysis software, confirming its ability to obtain accurate results

Abstract = {{Rigid bodies are often connected by compliant elements. In the designs
   of these compliant mechanisms, actuators can be embedded in the rigid
   bodies to control the beam deformation. Motivated by the need to
   visualize the deformed beam shape of a flexible mobile-sensing node
   (FMN) mechanism in real-time operation to aid its human-guided
   navigation, this paper presents a discrete curvature-based beam model
   (CBM) taking into account the dynamics of the connecting rigid-body
   wheel assemblies in modeling the FMN and its solution as a function of
   path lengths. The wheel assemblies provide input forces to manipulate
   the bending/twisting of the compliant beam. With experimentally measured
   magnetic forces/torques contributed by the magnetic adhesion between the
   FMN and ferrous surface on which the FMN moves, the computational model
   with dynamic forces of the wheel assemblies as system inputs in global
   coordinates has been applied to develop a strategy to guide a
   magnetic-wheeled FMN crossing a change-of-plane corner in tight space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design concept and operational principle of a
   magnetic scanning system for controlling the continuous motion of its
   maximum magnetic flux density (MFD) in a plane at high speed using an

   points are controlled for stimulation, actuating or sensing, the
   synthetized MFD field of the EM array is accurately controlled between
   adjacent EMs for displaying high-resolution patterns with a relatively
   small number of EMs. The theory for generating the synthetized MFD that
   has the Gaussian function properties and three design criteria
   evaluating its performance as well as the algorithm for implementing it
   on the 2D EM-array are detailed; both 1D and 2D basic units for line and
   area scanning are considered. Results agree well with analytically
   derived exact solutions. Two illustrative application examples are given
   to demonstrate the applications of an EM array for magnetically
   reconstructing a cross-road sign pattern, and for generating a moving

   visual cues called corner bases, which expands zero-dimensional corner
   points to two-dimensional microstructures. These corner bases are then
   fused together by the functionalized elastica energy imposed upon an
   admissible phase field. The optimal phase field segments the visual
   field into disjoint connected components, which are further fused via a
   simple connectivity principle to construct both foreground illusory
   shapes and background occluded shapes. Robust and efficient numerical
   schemes are developed, and several generic examples are presented.

Abstract = {{Harnessing the computational capabilities of dynamical systems has
   attracted the attention of scientists and engineers form varied
   technical disciplines over decades. The time evolution of coupled,
   non-linear synchronous oscillatory systems has led to active research in
   understanding their dynamical properties and exploring their
   applications in brain-inspired, neuromorphic computational models. In
   this paper we present the realization of coupled and scalable
   relaxation-oscillators utilizing the metal-insulator-metal transition of
   vanadium-dioxide (VO2) thin films. We demonstrate the potential use of
   such a system in pattern recognition, as one possible computational

Abstract = {{We conducted a microbenchmarking study of the time, energy, and power of
   computation and memory access on several existing platforms. These
   platforms represent candidate compute-node building blocks of future
   high-performance computing systems. Our analysis uses the ``energy
   roofline{''} model, developed in prior work, which we extend in two
   ways. First, we improve the model's accuracy by accounting for power
   caps, basic memory hierarchy access costs, and measurement of random
   memory access patterns. Secondly, we empirically evaluate server-,
   mini-, and mobile-class platforms that span a range of compute and power
   characteristics. Our study includes a dozen such platforms, including
   x86 (both conventional and Xeon Phi), ARM, GPU, and hybrid (AMD APU and
   other SoC) processors. These data and our model analytically
   characterize the range of algorithmic regimes where we might prefer one
   building block to others. It suggests critical values of arithmetic
   intensity around which some systems may switch from being more to less
   time-and energy-efficient than others; it further suggests how, with
   respect to intensity, operations should be throttled to meet a power
   cap. We hope our methods can help make debates about the relative merits
   of these and other systems more quantitative, analytical, and
   insightful.}},

Abstract = {{Architecture simulation for GPGPU kernels can take a significant amount
   of time, especially for large-scale GPGPU kernels. This paper presents
   TBPoint, an infrastructure based on profiling-based sampling for GPGPU
   kernels to reduce the cycle-level simulation time. Compared to existing
   approaches, TBPoint provides a flexible and architecture-independent way
   to take samples. For the evaluated 12 kernels, the geometric means of
   sampling errors of TBPoint, Ideal-Simpoint, and random sampling are
   0.47\%, 1.74\%, and 7.95\%, respectively, while the geometric means of
   the total sample size of TBPoint, Ideal-Simpoint, and random sampling
   are 2.6\%, 5.4\%, and 10\%, respectively. TBPoint narrows the speed gap
   between hardware and GPGPU simulators, enabling more and more
   large-scale GPGPU kernels to be analyzed using detailed timing

Abstract = {{Hartree-Fock (HF) or self-consistent field (SCF) calculations are widely
   used in quantum chemistry, and are the starting point for accurate
   electronic correlation methods. Existing algorithms and software,
   however, may fail to scale for large numbers of cores of a distributed
   machine, particularly in the simulation of moderately-sized molecules.
   In existing codes, HF calculations are divided into tasks. Fine-grained
   tasks are better for load balance, but coarse-grained tasks require less
   communication. In this paper, we present a new parallelization of HF
   calculations that addresses this trade-off: we use fine-grained tasks to
   balance the computation among large numbers of cores, but we also use a
   scheme to assign tasks to processes to reduce communication. We
   specifically focus on the distributed construction of the Fock matrix
   arising in the HF algorithm, and describe the data access patterns in
   detail. For our test molecules, our implementation shows better
   scalability than NWChem for constructing the Fock matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations with hydrodynamic
   interactions utilize 3n x 3n dense mobility matrices, where n is the
   number of simulated particles. This limits the size of BD simulations,
   particularly on accelerators with low memory capacities. In this paper,
   we formulate a matrix-free algorithm for BD simulations, allowing us to
   scale to very large numbers of particles while also being efficient for
   small numbers of particles. We discuss the implementation of this method
   for multicore and manycore architectures, as well as a hybrid
   implementation that splits the workload between CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi
   coprocessors. For 10,000 particles, the limit of the conventional
   algorithm on a 32 GB system, the matrix-free algorithm is 35 times
   faster than the conventional matrix-based algorithm. We show numerical
   tests for the matrix-free algorithm up to 500,000 particles. For large
   systems, our hybrid implementation using two Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors
   achieves a speedup of over 3.5x compared to the CPU-only case. Our
   optimizations also make the matrix-free algorithm faster than the
   conventional dense matrix algorithm on as few as 1000 particles.}},

Abstract = {{Construction of whole-genome networks from large-scale gene expression
   data is an important problem in systems biology. While several
   techniques have been developed, most cannot handle network
   reconstruction at the whole-genome scale, and the few that can, require
   large clusters. In this paper, we present a solution on the Intel (R)
   Xeon Phi (TM) coprocessor, taking advantage of its multi-level
   parallelism including many x86-based cores, multiple threads per core,
   and vector processing units. We also present a solution on the Intel (R)
   Xeon (R) processor. Our solution is based on TINGe, a fast parallel
   network reconstruction technique that uses mutual information and
   permutation testing for assessing statistical significance. We
   demonstrate the first ever inference of a plant whole genome regulatory
   network on a single chip by constructing a 15,575 gene network of the
   plant Arabidopsis thaliana from 3,137 microarray experiments in only 22
   minutes. In addition, our optimization for parallelizing mutual
   information computation on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor holds out
   lessons that are applicable to other domains.}},

Abstract = {{Finding approximately conserved sequences, called motifs, across
   multiple DNA or protein sequences is an important problem in
   computational biology. In this paper, we consider the (l, d) motif
   search problem of identifying one or more motifs of length l present in
   at least q of the n given sequences, with each occurrence differing from
   the motif in at most d substitutions. The problem is known to be
   NP-hard, and the largest solved instance reported to date is (26, 11).
   We propose a novel algorithm for the (l, d) motif search problem using
   streaming execution over a large set of Non-deterministic Finite
   Automata (NFA). This solution is designed to take advantage of the
   Micron Automata Processor, a new technology close to deployment that can
   simultaneously execute multiple NFA in parallel. We estimate the
   run-time for the (39, 18) and (40, 17) problem instances using the
   resources available within a single Automata Processor board. In
   addition to solving larger instances of the (l, d) motif search problem,
   the paper serves as a useful guide to solving problems using this new
   accelerator technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a latch-less pipeline architecture for spintronic
   circuits and quantifies the impact of pipeline depth and width on the
   error rate caused by thermal noise. This paper focuses on concatenable
   spin logic (CSL) even though the proposed architecture and error rate
   estimation approach can be applied to any spintronic logic that use
   magnetic moment of nanomagnets as the computational state variable. The
   latch-less pipeline architecture takes advantage of the non-volatility
   of nanomagnets and eliminates the need for the extra switches that are
   necessary in CMOS circuits to latch data at the beginning and end of
   each pipeline stage. However, choosing a pipeline clock rate requires
   knowing the circuit delay of a single stage. It is shown that the delay
   of a magnet can best be represented as a gamma distribution, and thus,
   in order to achieve a 10(-4) error rate with a single switch, the clock
   period will need to be approximately 120\% greater the average delay of
   a single device. This variation tax can be reduced to under 35\% for a
   circuit with 10 switches connected in series, or it can exceed 145\% if
   the switches are connected in parallel (depth=1).}},

   with multiple single-antenna amplify-and-forward (AF) relays is
   demonstrated for the first time in a realistic indoor environment with a
   commercial software radio platform, using OFDM. Good trend
   correspondence is observed between the averaged error rate results of
   experiment and simulation, when zero forcing (ZF) detection is employed
   and a simple constraint on the average power per relay is used. The
   challenges of relaying a regenerated digital header and simply amplified
   spatially multiplexed payload are discussed. It is proven theoretically
   that the effect of the growth of the number of fixed-gain relays is to
   bring the destination into the location of the relays. For the case of
   variable gain, subject to a per-node average power constraint, the
   destination is also brought asymptotically closer, but not as close as
   the fixed-gain. However, the gap is approximately closed by allowing
   relays to deactivate if their gain exceeds a threshold.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method for how interfering MIMO links might
   transmit more effectively in a random access network. We assume perfect
   transmitter-side channel state information, zero-forcing pre-coding to
   guarantee no interference on links that have already won access, and
   zero-forcing receiver processing at the still-contending links to
   suppress interference from the links that have already won. We define an
   effectiveness metric, the Instantaneous Equivalent SNR Percentile
   (IESP), in which the Equivalent SNR is the SNR of a
   single-input-single-output (SISO) link that would have the same capacity
   of a MIMO link after its interference constraints have been met and the
   IESP is the percentile of the Equivalent SNR, assuming independent
   Rayleigh fading. We propose that fairness among heterogeneous contending
   links be realized by giving the shorter contention window to the link
   with the higher IESP based on its own distribution, enabling links with
   few antennas to compete with links that have many antennas. Through
   simulation of the sum capacity of the winning set of links, the proposed
   contention window design is shown to provide a higher sum capacity than
   contention based on equal-sized windows.}},

Abstract = {{Duty cycling (DC) has been proven to be an efficient mechanism to reduce
   energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). On the other
   hand, cooperative transmission (CT) enables longer range transmission to
   hop over an energy-hole node, resulting in more balanced energy
   consumption among nodes. In the literature, there exist few CT MAC
   protocols for DC operated WSNs and these protocols rely on fixed cycle
   length. In this paper, we propose a novel variable cycle length
   protocol, namely asynchronous cooperative transmission medium access
   control (ACT-MAC), which contains both features of reducing the
   unnecessary idle listening by DC and mitigating the energy-hole by
   making use of CT. The proposed protocol employs a pseudo random sequence
   (PRS) generator to produce the variable length cycles. Numerical results
   show the ACT-MAC protocol's superiority over the existing protocols in
   terms of network longevity and the energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Improvements in detecting weak targets from a small radar platform must
   come through increased temporal integration, i.e., extending the time
   over which target samples are coherently integrated. Conventional
   single-channel radar assumes a linear-phase signal model that is only
   accurate over a short dwell time for typical target motion. Over an
   extended dwell, the target signal includes multiple nonlinear phase
   components, each of whose effects become significant at different times
   during the dwell. An algorithm is presented that develops a multiphase
   signal model in multiple stages based on these times. A modification of
   the proposed approach improves the signal model for the most challenging
   targets. When used as the detection filter, the multiphase signal model
   yields near optimal performance over an extended dwell time for a wide
   range of target parameters. Typical improvement in output
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a 500 ms dwell is 12-13 dB over
   conventional processing.}},

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been previously explored as a part of
   cell-based therapies for the repair of damaged cartilage. Current MSC
   chondrogenic differentiation strategies employ large pellets; however,
   we have developed a technique to form small MSC aggregates (500-1,000
   cells) that can reduce transport barriers while maintaining a
   multicellular structure analogous to cartilaginous condensations. The
   objective of this study was to examine the effects of incorporating
   chondroitin sulfate methacrylate (CSMA) microparticles (MPs) within
   small MSC spheroids cultured in the presence of transforming growth
   factor (TGF)-beta(1) on chondrogenesis. Spheroids with MPs induced
   earlier increases in collagen II and aggrecan gene expression
   (chondrogenic markers) than spheroids without MPs, although no large
   differences in immunostaining for these matrix molecules were observed
   by day 21 between these groups. Collagen I and X were also detected in
   the extracellular matrix (ECM) of all spheroids by immunostaining.
   Interestingly, histology revealed that CSMA MPs clustered together near
   the center of the MSC spheroids and induced circumferential alignment of
   cells and ECM around the material core. This study demonstrates the use
   of CSMA materials to further examine the effects of matrix molecules on
   MSC phenotype as well as potentially direct differentiation in a more
   spatially controlled manner that better mimics the architecture of
   specific musculoskeletal tissues. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the polytope method for factoring sparse bivariate
   polynomials over finite fields, and address the bottleneck arising from
   solving the Hensel lifting equations using the sparse distributed
   polynomial representation. We revise the analysis when polynomials are
   represented as such, which reveals how performing the polynomial
   multiplications and ensuing additions in separate (serialised) phases
   causes the Hensel lifting phase to suffer from poor work, space, and I/O
   complexity, and hinges on the size of the intermediary output, as size
   is defined in the sparse distributed representation. We propose to
   overlap all polynomial arithmetic in one Hensel lifting step using a MAX
   priority queue. The overlapping approach adapts not only to the growth
   in the degree of the input polynomial but also to irregularities in the
   sparsity of intermediary output. It also results in evading expression
   swell and reducing the overall work and space complexity by an order of
   magnitude. When the priority queue is implemented as a cache-oblivious
   data structure, the overlapping approach achieves an order of magnitude
   improvement in I/O over the serialised approach, even when the latter is
   using cache efficient structures to assist in polynomial multiplications
   and additions. We present empirical results for the polytope method
   using a max-heap implementation of the global priority queue, which
   demonstrate extremely superior performance, and specifically against
   Magma, for sufficiently sparse input polynomials of very high degrees.}},

   Third-party developers can offer services if an agency openly shares
   real-time data, but these individuals are volunteers whose priorities
   and deadlines may not be the same as the agency's. As a result, few
   cities have full app portfolios that cover all smartphone platforms.
   This paper presents the OneBusAway multi-region project, a collaborative
   effort that is enabling the rapid expansion of native mobile transit
   apps to new cities. OneBusAway is an open-source transit information
   system that has provided real-time transit services to the Puget Sound
   (Washington) area since 2008. The new OneBusAway multi-region feature
   expands the coverage of the existing Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, and
   Windows 8 apps for OneBusAway to new cities, including Tampa and
   Atlanta. The multi-region system architecture, collaborative design and
   development process, and lessons learned from this ground-breaking
   project are discussed. The fundamental shift from proprietary to
   open-source software in the transit industry that has made this type of
   project possible also is examined.}},

Abstract = {{Exposed geomembranes are subjected to thermal cycles of relatively high
   amplitude. In the present study, the behavior of exposed geomembranes on
   inclined planes subjected to thermal cycles was investigated using
   experimental and numerical methods. Experimental results corroborated
   the emergence of thermally-driven displacement accumulation, or
   ratcheting, which was inversely proportional to the static factor of
   safety. The complementary numerical study considered the thermo-elastic
   membrane properties, constant temperature change amplitude, and an
   elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive model with a critical elastic
   threshold displacement for the membrane-soil interface. Results show
   that thermally-induced ratcheting displacements increased as the static
   factor of safety decreased, in agreement with experimental observations,
   and as the ratio between the unconstrained thermal elongation of the
   geomembrane and the critical elastic interface displacement increased.}},

Abstract = {{BCI (brain computer interface) technology relies on the accurate
   identification of key anatomical areas to place sensors for effective
   biofeedback control or monitoring. In motor control applications, these
   challenges can include identifying brain areas that respond considerably
   differently to resting state versus limb motion tasks or real motion
   versus imaginary motion. The eLORETA (exact low resolution brain
   electromagnetic tomography) source localization algorithm is a potent
   technique to pinpoint cortical areas using brain signals but it has not
   yet been applied for motor control applications. In a pilot study, we
   analyzed human EEG (electroencephalography) during real and imagined
   movements of upper and lower limbs using the eLORETA algorithm after
   computing eight selected spectral EEG measures. For certain tasks and
   movement types, we observed statistically significant differences
   (p<0.001) in spectral measures. Subsequently, we performed pattern
   classification to discern real vs. imaginary movement in the eLORETA
   brain areas as a proof of principle for BCI uses.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of people worldwide suffer with recurrent epileptic seizures
   that often require hospitalized intracranial electroencephalography
   (iEEG) for diagnosing their seizure onset zone (SOZ) for surgical
   therapy. The standard diagnostic procedures for the brain signals rely
   on time-consuming human review of data via visual analysis. This study
   investigates whether modulation spectrum measures, with further study,
   could provide a quantitative algorithmic approach to reliably identify
   the SOZ for a patient and reduce or eliminate the burden of manual iEEG
   review. In a pilot dataset of four patients (one seizure per person), we
   analyzed human iEEG before, during, and after their seizure from signals
   inside and outside their clinically annotated SOZ to observe changes in
   49 modulation spectrum measures. Regarding electrode location effects
   (i.e., inside vs. outside SOZ), we observed statistically significant
   differences (p < 0.001) in modulation measures at certain
   cross-frequency bins (e.g., delta:gamma bandwidths) with high effect
   size (g >= 0.80) for some patients. For seizure state effects, we
   observed significant differences with high effect size in many measures
   across almost all cross-frequency bins between various pairings of
   seizure states (e.g., during vs. before) for all patients. We concluded
   that the modulation spectrum had potential in quantifying SOZ and
   seizure states for diagnostic purposes and in understanding the effect
   of seizures on brain networks.}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},

Pages = {{828-836}},
Abstract = {{Sediments experience mineral dissolution in most natural settings, and
   as a result of engineered processes such as carbon dioxide injection.
   The consequences of mineral dissolution are studied using the
   three-dimensional discrete-element method by gradually dissolving
   randomly distributed soluble grains in a laterally constrained cell
   under constant vertical stress. Either additional vertical load under
   zero lateral strain or shear loading are applied after dissolution.
   Results show that dissolution is accompanied by global horizontal stress
   change, increase in vertical displacement and porosity, and decrease in
   coordination number. Post-dissolution, sediments are more compressible;
   shear loading encounters a diminished peak strength and reduced dilative
   tendency in sediments that experienced dissolution; however, all
   specimens evolve towards a common `critical state' strength and sediment
   fabric at a large strain (in the absence of reprecipitation, changes in
   grain shape, or changes in grain size distribution). The analysis of
   micromechanical parameters shows that the total number of contacts
   decreases during dissolution and remaining contacts carry higher forces.
   Higher granular interlocking hinders settlement and leads to the
   development of higher fabric and force anisotropy during dissolution.
   Granular arching effectively resists vertical displacement around
   dissolving grains, a honeycomb fabric emerges and the specimen gains a
   higher porosity during dissolution. Overall, the extent of dissolution
   (soluble fraction) and the level of particle interlocking/angularity
   define the evolution of micro-and macro-scale parameters during
   dissolution and its response to subsequent loading.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{1891-1908}},
Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely
   adopted in modern wireless communication systems due to its robustness
   against the frequency selectivity of wireless channels. For coherent
   detection, channel estimation is essential for receiver design. Channel
   estimation is also necessary for diversity combining or interference
   suppression where there are multiple receive antennas. In this paper, we
   will present a survey on channel estimation for OFDM. This survey will
   first review traditional channel estimation approaches based on channel
   frequency response (CFR). Parametric model (PM)-based channel
   estimation, which is particularly suitable for sparse channels, will be
   also investigated in this survey. Following the success of turbo codes
   and low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, iterative processing has been
   widely adopted in the design of receivers, and iterative channel
   estimation has received a lot of attention since that time. Iterative
   channel estimation will be emphasized in this survey as the emerging
   iterative receiver improves system performance significantly. The
   combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and OFDM has been
   widely accepted in modern communication systems, and channel estimation
   in MIMO-OFDM systems will also be addressed in this survey. Open issues
   and future work are discussed at the end of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Analog circuits are sensitive to signal aggressions and power supply
   noise, crosstalk coupling and alpha particle strikes can cause
   significant degradation of circuit's SNR. This research proposes a novel
   approach to real-time transient error and induced noise cancellation in
   linear analog circuits using analog checksums. It is based on the use of
   state space representations of analog filters and is a significant
   advancement over prior research that addressed only hard parametric
   deviations. A key innovation is the use of less than minimum distance
   checksum codes for error detection and correction using real-time
   learning of the likely source of transient errors and noise within the
   analog circuit. By running a simple hardware-directed search algorithm,
   the circuit ``learns{''} how best to compensate for the injected signal
   disturbances with low overhead under the assumption that the source of
   the injected errors/noise and the error/noise statistics are stationary
   over time. Successful simulations and preliminary experimental results
   demonstrate almost complete compensation of injected noise, therefore
   validating the proposal.}},

   degrees C for 1.5 h. Furthermore, the rGO wrapped on the surface of Cu
   particles could transfer the two-dimensional rGO nano-sheets into
   three-dimensional (3D) networks. The Cu@rGO particles with 3D structure

Title = {{Use of monolithic silicon carbide aerogel as a reusable support for

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{109}},
Pages = {{64193-64199}},
Abstract = {{Monolithic silicon carbide aerogel (MSiCA) was firstly used as a
   reusable support to develop a novel CO2 adsorbent, i.e. amine
   functionalized monolithic silicon carbide aerogel (AFMSiCA). Used or
   exhausted AFMSiCA was separated, treated and re-functionalized by amine
   to form RF-MSiCA. CO2 capture performance of the resulting adsorbents
   was investigated in a 1\% CO2 flow stream. The results revealed that CO2
   adsorption capacities of AFMSiCA at different temperatures ranging from
   25 to 75 degrees C showed little change, indicating that the resulting
   adsorbent is well-adapted to temperature. The adsorption rate is
   affected by the combined effect of CO2 adsorption and desorption.
   Benefiting from the highly unique properties of the aerogel (e. g. high
   surface area and large pore volume), MSiCA-based adsorbents are dynamic
   in their CO2 adsorption process. MSiCA could be readily recovered and
   reused at least 12 times without significant loss of CO2 adsorption
   performance. The resulting adsorbents presented good stability during
   cyclic adsorption-regeneration tests. MSiCA is exceptional in practical
   application for CO2 capture due to its excellent reusability and the
   regenerability of its amine functionalized counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Multimerization of biomolecules is essential for biological function and
   thus there is a need for sensitive biochemical assays that determine
   whether a molecule associates with one or more other molecules in the

   simple yet versatile method for the identification of physiologically
   important receptor dimerization events induced by a ligand.
   Bioresponsive hydrogel microparticles (microgels) conjugated with a
   receptor, Glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb alpha), display large changes in
   optical (microscopic) appearance under conditions known for to promote
   thrombin-induced GPIb alpha dimerization. In support of X-ray crystal
   structures, we identify that one thrombin molecule associates with two
   GPIb alpha moieties, which may play a role in efficient hemostatic
   function by increasing local concentration of GPIba on platelet
   surfaces. This microgel assay could provide a new way of studying
   important physiological and pathological mechanisms related to receptor
   dimerization and/or clustering.}},

   relies only on the temporal variations of the power spectrum across the
   decoded frames. We validate our proposed quality measure by testing it
   on a variety of HEVC coded videos subject to network losses. Our
   simulation results show that the proposed model accurately captures

Abstract = {{Recovering static signals from compressed measurements is an important
   problem that has been extensively studied in modern signal processing.
   However, only recently have methods been proposed to tackle the problem
   of recovering a time-varying sequence from streaming online compressed
   measurements. In this paper, we study the capacity of the standard
   iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to perform this task in
   real-time. In previous work, ISTA has been shown to recover static
   sparse signals. The present paper demonstrates its ability to perform
   this recovery online in the dynamical setting where measurements are
   constantly streaming. Our analysis shows that the l(2)-distance between
   the output and the target signal decays according to a linear rate, and
   is supported by simulations on synthetic and real data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of estimating the positions of nodes in
   a mobile network over time, when pre-surveyed anchor nodes are not
   available. We do this by employing both inter-node range measurements
   and odometry data. Both types of measurement data are applied within the
   multidimensional scaling paradigm, which maps pairwise dissimilarity
   values into node coordinates. The mathematical treatment is presented,
   along with several advantages of our proposed approach. We demonstrate
   its performance through simulation across various parameter values.
   Further, we show the performance using real range and odometry data
   gathered from our CSOT mobile robot testbed.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid growth of emerging medical applications such as e-health and
   tele-medicine requires fast, low cost, and often lossless access to
   massive amount of medical images and data over bandlimited channels. In
   this paper, we first show that significant amount of correlation and
   redundancy exist across different medical images. Such a correlation can
   be utilized to achieve better compression, and consequently less storage
   and less communication overhead on the network. We propose a novel
   memory-assisted compression technique, as a learning-based universal
   coding, which can be used to complement any existing algorithm to
   further eliminate redundancies across images. The approach is motivated
   by the fact that, often in medical applications, massive amount of
   correlated images from the same family are available as training data
   for learning the dependencies and deriving appropriate reference models.
   Such models can then be used for compression of any new image from the
   same family. In particular, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
   applied on a set of images from training data to form the required
   reference models. The proposed memory-assisted compression allows each
   image to be processed independently of other images, and hence allows
   individual image access and transmission. Experimental results on Xray
   images show that the proposed algorithm achieves 20\% improvement over
   and above traditional lossless image compression methods reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning framework to
   directly maximize mean average precision (MAP) which is a key
   performance metric in many multi-class classification tasks.
   Conventional classifiers based on support vector machines cannot be
   easily adopted to optimize the MAP metric. On the other hand,
   classifiers based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been
   shown to deliver a great discrimination capability in automatic speech
   recognition and image classification as well. However, DNNs are usually
   optimized with the minimum cross entropy criterion. In contrast to most
   conventional classification methods, our proposed approach can be
   formulated to embed DNNs and MAP into the objective function to be
   optimized during training. The combination of the proposed maximum MAP
   (MMAP) technique and DNNs introduces nonlinearity to the linear
   discriminant function (LDF) in order to increase the flexibility and
   discriminant power of the original MFoM-trained LDF based classifiers.
   Tested on both automatic image annotation and audio event
   classification, the experimental results show consistent improvements of
   MAP on both datasets when compared with other state-of-the-art
   classifiers without using MMAP.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the robust off-grid recovery of the compressed signals

   to this problem and its dual problem are proposed and discussed. A
   method based on dual certification to detect the support set is
   introduced and proved to be effective. As a specific case, the target
   signal is further assumed to have unknown line spectrum. Then the
   problem is also an estimation of a low dimensional subspace which is
   indexed by continuous parameters, yet the dimension itself is unknown.
   Under these presumptions, the squared-error of the reconstruction is
   derived. Finally, numerical experiments are demonstrated in such case to
   validate the effectiveness of the method and the plausibility of the

   faults features. Considering geological constraints of faults, false
   features are removed using a double-threshold method. Then, we get an
   initial fault line by connecting the remaining faults features. In the
   last stage, by incorporating the discontinuity information from step
   one, we tweak the initial fault line to obtain more accurate and

Abstract = {{Residual stress is a key factor that influences the reliability,
   precision, and life of final products. Earlier studies have alluded to
   the fact that the grinding process is usually the source of a tensile
   residual stress on the part surface, while there exists a temperature
   level commonly referred to as the onset tensile temperature beyond which
   the tensile profile of residual stresses starts to be generated. In this
   paper, a physics-based model is proposed to predict the onset
   temperature as a function of residual stress on an analytical and
   quantitative basis. The predictive model is based on the temperature
   distribution function using a moving heat source approach. Then, the
   thermal stresses are calculated analytically using Timoshenko thermal
   stress theory {[}1] followed by an elastic-plastic relaxation condition
   imposed on these stresses, thus leading to the resulting residual
   stresses. The model-predicted results have been experimentally validated
   using data of the grinding of AISI52100 hardened steel with subsequent
   X-ray and Neutron diffraction measurements. The model was shown to
   predict the residual stress profile under given process conditions and
   material properties, therefore providing an analytical tool for grinding
   process planning and optimization based on the understanding of onset
   tensile temperature for control of tensile residual stresses. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Due to their representative power, structural descriptions have gained a
   great interest in the community working on graphics recognition. Indeed,
   graph based representations have successful been used for isolated
   symbol recognition. New challenges in this research field have focused
   on symbol recognition, symbol spotting or symbol based indexing of
   technical drawing.
   When they are based on structural descriptions, these tasks can be
   expressed by means of a subgraph isomorphism search. Indeed, it consists
   in locating the instance of a pattern graph representing a symbol in a
   target graph representing the whole document image. However, there is a
   lack of publicly available datasets allowing to evaluate the performance
   of subgraph isomorphism approaches in presence of noisy data.
   In this paper, we present five datasets that can be used to evaluate the
   performance of algorithms on several tasks involving subgraph
   isomorphism. Four of these datasets have been synthetically generated
   and allow to evaluate the search of a single instance of the pattern
   with or without perturbed labels. The fifth dataset corresponds to the
   structural description of architectural plans and allows to evaluate the
   search of multiple occurrences of the pattern. These datasets are made
   available for download. We also propose several measures to qualify each
   of the tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Covalently bonded graphene oxide/polyurethane (GO/PU) composites with
   significant reinforcement and thermally healable properties were
   developed via in situ polymerization based on Diels-Alder (DA)
   chemistry. The PU prepolymer was prepared with GO, 4,4-diphenylmethane
   diisocyanate, and poly(tetramethylene glycol) and blocked by using
   furfuryl alcohol firstly. Then the prepolymer was crosslinked by using
   bifunctional maleimide via DA chemistry. SEM shows that the GO was
   dispersed uniformly in the PU matrix. The DA and retro-DA reactions were
   characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   differential scanning calorimetry separately. Tensile tests showed that
   with the incorporation of 0.1 wt\% of GO, the tensile modulus of GO/PU
   composites increased from 9.80 MPa to 21.95 MPa, and the tensile
   strength and elongation at break of the GO/PU composites increased by
   more than 367\% and 210\%, respectively. Furthermore, the composites had
   thermally healable ability which was inspected by using an atomic force
   microscope and the strain-stress test. The healing efficiency of 78\% on
   average was achieved which was determined by the recovery of breaking
   stress and a healing mechanism was tentatively proposed. Therefore, the
   covalently bonded self-healing GO/PU composites could be used as smart
   materials and structural materials.}},

Abstract = {{The design of bug-free and safe medical device software is challenging,
   especially in complex implantable devices that control and actuate
   organs who's response is not fully understood. Safety recalls of
   pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators between 1990 and
   2000 affected over 600,000 devices. Of these, 200,000 or 41\%, were due
   to firmware issues that continue to increase in frequency. According to
   the FDA, software failures resulted in 24\% of all medical device
   recalls in 2011. There is currently no formal methodology or open
   experimental platform to test and verify the correct operation of
   medical-device software within the closed-loop context of the patient.
   The goal of this effort is to develop the foundations of modeling,
   synthesis and development of verified medical device software and
   systems from verified closed-loop models of the device and organ(s). Our
   research spans both implantable medical devices such as cardiac
   pacemakers and physiological control systems such as drug infusion pumps
   which have multiple networked medical systems. These devices are
   physically connected to the body and exert direct control over the
   physiology and safety of the patient. The focus of this effort is on (a)
   Extending current binary safety properties to quantitative verification;
   (b) Development of patient-specific models and therapies; (c)
   Multi-scale modeling of complex physiological phenomena and
   compositional reasoning across a range of model abstractions and
   refinements; and (d) Bridging the formal reasoning and automated
   generation of safe and effective software for future medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide with a
   high mortality rate, and the identification of new biomarkers and
   targets for this disease is greatly needed. Here we present evidence
   that microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 7 domain-containing protein 3
   (Mdp3) is highly expressed in clinical samples and cell lines of breast
   cancer. The expression of Mdp3 correlates with clinicopathological
   parameters indicating breast cancer malignancy. In addition, Mdp3
   promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and motility in vitro and
   stimulates breast cancer growth and metastasis in mice. Mechanistic
   studies reveal that.-tubulin interacts with and recruits Mdp3 to the
   centrosome and that the centrosomal localization of Mdp3 is required for
   its activity to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and motility.
   These findings suggest a critical role for Mdp3 in the growth and
   metastasis of breast cancer and may have important implications for the
   management of this disease.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud-based manufacturing (CBM), also referred to as cloud
   manufacturing, is a form of decentralized and networked manufacturing
   evolving from other relevant manufacturing systems such as web- and
   agent-based manufacturing. An ongoing debate on CBM in the research
   community revolves around several aspects such as definitions, key
   characteristics, computing architectures, programming models, file
   systems, operational processes, information and communication models,
   and new business models pertaining to CBM. One question, in particular,
   has often been raised: Is cloud-based manufacturing a new paradigm, or
   is it just old wine in new bottles? Based on the discussion of the key
   characteristics of CBM, the derivation of requirements that an ideal CBM
   system should satisfy, and a thorough comparison between CBM and other
   relevant manufacturing systems, we provide supporting evidence that
   allows us to conclude that CBM is definitely a new paradigm that will
   revolutionize manufacturing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.}},

   the evening with cooler temperatures and lower in the afternoon with
   warmer temperatures, a trend opposite to the gas-phase amines.
   Concentrations of aerosol-phase primary amines measured with Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) from micron and submicron
   particles were 2 orders of magnitude higher than the gas-phase amines.
   These results indicate that gas to particle conversion is one of the
   major processes that control the ambient amine concentrations at this
   forest site. Temperature dependencies of C3-amines and ammonia also
   imply reversible processes of evaporation of these nitrogen-containing
   compounds from soil surfaces in daytime and deposition to soil surfaces
   at nighttime. During the transported biomass burning plume events,
   various amines (C1-C6) appeared at the pptv level, indicating that
   biomass burning is a substantial source of amines in the southeastern
   US. At the moderately polluted Kent site, there were higher
   concentrations of C1- to C6-amines (pptv to tens of pptv) and ammonia
   (up to 6 ppbv). C1- to C3-amines and ammonia were well correlated with
   the ambient temperature. C4- to C6-amines showed frequent spikes during
   the nighttime, suggesting that they were emitted from local sources.
   These abundant amines and ammonia may in part explain the frequent new
   particle formation events reported from Kent. Higher amine
   concentrations measured at the polluted site than at the rural forested
   site highlight the importance of constraining anthropogenic emission
   sources of amines.}},

Title = {{Hollow nanocubes made of Ag-Au alloys for SERS detection with
   sensitivity of 10(-8) M for melamine}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we transformed Ag nanocubes into Ag-Au hollow nanocubes
   with a continuous shell of Ag-Au alloy on the surface and some remaining
   pure Ag in the interior. Upon the removal of the pure Ag with aqueous
   H2O2 from inside of Ag-Au hollow nanocubes, we obtained Ag-Au nanoboxes.
   Next, we systematically evaluated the SERS properties of the hollow
   nanocubes and nanoboxes by benchmarking against the Ag nanocubes. In one
   study, we collected the SERS spectra of 1,4-benzenedithiol (1,4-BDT)
   adsorbed on the surfaces of the nanoparticles when the samples were
   prepared using 1,4-BDT solutions with different concentrations. Our
   results showed that both the hollow nanocubes and nanoboxes exhibited
   considerably stronger SERS activity than the original Ag nanocubes. In
   particular, the remaining pure Ag inside the hollow nanocubes made a
   significant contribution to achieve SERS detection with sensitivity of
   10(-11) M for 1,4-BDT. We further demonstrated their capability for the
   SERS detection of melamine at 10(-8) M, a concentration considerably
   lower than the tolerance level of 1 ppm in infant formula. Moreover, we
   showed that the hollow nanocubes or nanoboxes with Ag-Au alloy shells on
   the surfaces were more stable compared to Ag nanocubes in an oxidative
   environment such as a solution containing an oxidant and/or halide ions.
   Taken together, these Ag-Au alloy nanostructures are good candidates for
   a trace detection of biological and chemical analytes by SERS.}},

Booktitle = {{MATERIALS FOR BIOFUELS}},
Series = {{Materials and Energy}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{267-293}},
Abstract = {{In this chapter, the compatibility of metals and alloys with different
   biofuels is discussed. As the use of renewable biofuels becomes more and
   more widespread, issues of material compatibility with these biofuels
   arise. Corrosion behavior of industrial metals and alloys, such as
   carbon and stainless steels, is well understood in traditional fossil
   fuel environments, and methods of mitigating and preventing corrosion of
   steel tanks, pipes, engine parts, and other items have been developed.
   When the environment in contact with these metal surfaces is changed
   from fossil fuel to biofuel, the nature of the metal-environment
   interaction can change, leading to corrosion or degradation of expensive
   industrial equipment, sometimes leading to catastrophic failures.
   Failures of steel tanks and pipes have been attributed to stress
   corrosion cracking caused by ethanol fuels. Research has shown that
   corrosion and cracking of steels in fuel grade ethanol (FGE) are mostly
   caused by minor chemical constituents and impurities within the fuels.
   Specifically, water and oxygen contained in FGE play large roles in
   their corrosivity. Similarly, pyrolysis oil or bio-oil fuels produced
   from biomass are significantly more corrosive compared to traditional
   fuels. As-produced pyrolysis oils contain a substantial amount of
   oxygen, primarily as component of water, carboxylic acids, phenols,
   ketones and aldehydes. Depending on the biomass sources, production
   processes, and resulting chemical constituents, bio-oils can be
   significantly more corrosive than fossil fuels. Extent and type of
   corrosion in different biofuels depend on their chemical constituents
   and other factors. Water, found in all biofuels as an impurity, plays an
   important role in their overall corrosivity. It is necessary to
   understand the detrimental interactions of new and existing biofuels
   with industrial materials so that existing fuel infrastructure and
   equipment in contact with these fuels can be properly maintained and new
   structures can be designed with appropriate materials. Known mechanisms
   of material-biofuel interactions for FGE and pyrolysis oil fuels are
   discussed in this chapter.}},

   covering a significant portion of parameter space. We have grounded our

Abstract = {{Native cell-material interactions occur on materials differing in their
   structural composition, chemistry, and physical compliance. While the
   last two decades have shown the importance of traction forces during
   cell-material interactions, they have been almost exclusively presented
   on purely elastic in vitro materials. Yet, most bodily tissue materials
   exhibit some level of viscoelasticity, which could play an important
   role in how cells sense and transduce tractions. To expand the realm of
   cell traction measurements and to encompass all materials from elastic
   to viscoelastic, this paper presents a general, and comprehensive
   approach for quantifying 3D cell tractions in viscoelastic materials.
   This methodology includes the experimental characterization of the
   time-dependent material properties for any viscoelastic material with
   the subsequent mathematical implementation of the determined material
   model into a 3D traction force microscopy (3D TFM) framework. Utilizing
   this new 3D viscoelastic TFM (3D VTFM) approach, we quantify the
   influence of viscosity on the overall material traction calculations and
   quantify the error associated with omitting time-dependent material
   effects, as is the case for all other TFM formulations. We anticipate
   that the 3D VTFM technique will open up new avenues of cell-material
   investigations on even more physiologically relevant time-dependent
   materials including collagen and fibrin gels.}},

Title = {{Temperature memory effect in amorphous shape memory polymers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{9423-9432}},
Abstract = {{Temperature memory effect (TME) refers to the ability of shape memory
   polymers (SMPs) to memorize the temperature at which pre-deformation was
   conducted. In the past few years, this TME was experimentally
   demonstrated by comparing the applied programming temperature (T-d) with
   a characteristic recovery temperature (T-c), which corresponds to either
   the maximum recovery stress or free recovery speed. In these
   well-designed experiments, Tc was observed to be close to T-d, which is
   consistent with the intuitive understanding of `memorization'. However,
   since the polymer recovery behavior has been proved to be strongly
   dependent on various programming and recovery conditions, a new question
   that whether T-c is always equal to T-d in any thermo-temporal
   conditions remains to be addressed. In this paper, we answered this
   question by examining the free recovery profile of an acrylate based
   amorphous SMP. The recovery T-c, which is the temperature with the
   maximum recovery speed, versus the recovery temperature is shown to be
   strongly dependent on both programming and recovery conditions. Their
   detailed influence could be explained by using the reduced time. During
   a thermomechanical working cycle of SMPs, in addition to the T-d, any
   other thermo-temporal conditions, such as the holding time (t(h)),
   cooling rate, recovery heating rate (q), etc., can affect the observed
   T-c by changing the reduced programming or recovery time. In this
   manner, the relationship between T-c and T-d is not uniquely determined.
   Besides, the TME in SMPs can only be achieved within a given temperature
   range. Both onset and offset of this temperature range are shown to be
   influenced by the programming history, but are independent of the
   recovery conditions.}},

Title = {{A review of hybrid-electric energy management and its inclusion in
   vehicle sizing}},
Journal = {{AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{550-557}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine state-of-the-art in
   hybrid-electric propulsion system modeling and suggest new methodologies
   for sizing such advanced concepts. Many entities are involved in the
   modelling and design of hybrid electric aircraft; however, the highly
   multidisciplinary nature of the problem means that most tools focus
   heavily on one discipline and over simplify others to keep the analysis
   reasonable in scope. Correctly sizing a hybrid-electric system requires
   knowledge of aircraft and engine performance along with a working
   knowledge of electrical and energy storage systems. The difficulty is
   compounded by the multi-timescale dynamic nature of the problem.
   Furthermore, the choice of energy management in a hybrid electric system
   presents multiple degrees of freedom, which means the aircraft sizing
   problem now becomes not just a root-finding exercise, but also a
   constrained optimization problem.
   Design/methodology/approach - The hybrid electric vehicle sizing problem
   can be sub-divided into three areas: modelling methods/fidelity, energy
   management and optimization technique. The literature is reviewed to
   find desirable characteristics and features of each area. Subsequently,
   a new process for sizing a new hybrid electric aircraft is proposed by
   synthesizing techniques from model predictive control and detailed
   conceptual design modelling. Elements from model predictive control and
   concurrent optimization are combined to formulate a new structure for
   the optimization of the sizing and energy management of future aircraft.
   Findings - While the example optimization formulation provided is
   specific to a hybrid electric concept, the proposed structure is general
   enough to be adapted to any vehicle concept which contains multiple
   degrees of control freedom that can be optimized continuously throughout
   a mission.
   Originality/value - The proposed technique is novel in its application
   of model predictive control to the conceptual design phase.}},

   revisited}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2345-2357}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we postulate, implement and evaluate modifications to the
   ``population-splitting{''} concept, introduced by Nenes and Seinfeld
   (2003), for calculation of water-condensation rates in
   droplet-activation parameterizations. The population-splitting
   approximation consists of dividing the population of growing droplets
   into two categories: those that experience significant growth after
   exposed to a supersaturation larger than their critical supersaturation,
   and those that do not grow much larger than their critical diameter. The
   modifications introduced here lead to an improved accuracy and precision
   of the parameterization-derived maximum supersaturation, s(max), and
   droplet-number concentration, N-d, as determined by comparing against
   those of detailed numerical simulations of the activation process. A
   numerical computation of the first-order derivatives partial derivative
   N-d/partial derivative chi(j) of the parameterized N-d to input
   variables chi(j) was performed and compared against the corresponding
   parcel-model-derived sensitivities, providing a thorough evaluation of
   the impacts of the introduced modifications in the parameterization
   ability to respond to aerosol characteristics. An evaluation of the
   parameterization computation of Nd and smax against detailed numerical
   simulations of the activation process showed a relative error of -6.0\%
   +/- 6.2\% for s(max), and -2.7\% +/- 4.8\% for N-d, which represents a
   considerable reduction in prediction bias when compared to earlier
   versions of the parameterization. The proposed modifications require
   only minor changes for their numerical implementation in existing codes
   based on the population-splitting concept.}},

Abstract = {{Selective cell ablation can be used to identify neuronal functions in
   multicellular model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. The
   optogenetic tool KillerRed facilitates selective ablation by enabling
   light-activated damage of cell or subcellular components in a temporally
   and spatially precise manner. However, the use of KillerRed requires
   stimulating (5 min(-1) h), culturing (similar to 24 h) and imaging
   (often repeatedly) a large number of individual animals. Current manual
   manipulation methods are limited by their time-consuming,
   labor-intensive nature, and their usage of anesthetics. To facilitate
   large-scale selective ablation, culturing, and repetitive imaging, we
   developed a densely-packed multi-channel device and used it to perform
   high-throughput neuronal ablation on KillerRed-expressing animals. The
   ability to load worms in identical locations with high loading
   efficiency allows us to ablate selected neurons in multiple worms
   simultaneously. Our device also enables continuous observation of
   animals for 24 h following KillerRed activation, and allows the animals
   to be recovered for behavioural assays. We expect this multi-channel
   device to facilitate a broad range of long-term imaging and selective
   illumination experiments in neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Offshore wind power production is an attractive clean energy option, but
   the difficulty of access can lead to expensive and rare opportunities
   for maintenance. As part of the Structural Health and Prognostics
   Management (SHPM) project at Sandia National Laboratories, smart loads
   management (controls) are investigated for their potential to increase
   the fatigue life of offshore wind turbine rotor blades. Derating refers
   to altering the rotor angular speed and blade pitch to limit power
   production and loads on the rotor blades. High-fidelity analysis
   techniques like 3D finite element modeling (FEM) should be used
   alongside beam models of wind turbine blades to characterize these
   control strategies in terms of their effect to mitigate fatigue damage
   and extend life of turbine blades. This study will consider a commonly
   encountered damage type for wind turbine blades, the trailing edge
   disbond, and show how FEM can be used to quantify the effect of
   operations and control strategies designed to extend the fatigue life of
   damaged blades. The Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) will be used
   to post-process the displacement and stress results to provide estimates
   of damage severity/criticality and provide a means to estimate the
   fatigue life under a given operations and control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{With the sustained growth of dissolving pulp demand all over the world,
   the search for alternative bamboo materials has come into focus in China
   due to the shortage of wood and the abundance of bamboo resources. In
   this study, to obtain updated information concerning green bamboo
   growing in southeastern China and to develop its processing technologies
   for dissolving pulp, the fiber morphology, chemical composition,
   elemental composition, degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose, and
   crystallinity index (Crl) of cellulose were investigated. The
   experimental results show that green bamboo has potential for use as
   dissolving pulp because it has a lower Runkel ratio and fines content
   than moso bamboo, and a much lower lignin content and similar
   alpha-cellulose and hemicellulose contents compared to softwoods and
   hardwoods. Compared to the cortex and culm, the node had the shortest
   fibers and more than 30\% of fines, the highest content of extractives
   and lignin, and the lowest alpha-cellulose content. As a result, a
   de-knotting operation prior to cooking can contribute to the production
   of high-grade dissolving pulp. The DP and Crl of cellulose from the node
   were much lower than that of cellulose from the culm and cortex.
   Moreover, green bamboo had the high content of ash, primarily
   distributed in the cortex. The concentration of Si was 4487 ppm in the
   cortex, nearly five times higher than that in the culm and node.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of CaCl2, MgCl2, FeCI3, NaCI, and AlCl3 on the solubility of
   lignin in the prehydrolysis kraft black liquor of Masson pine were
   studied using a focused-beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) instrument

   effects on the coagulation or solubility of lignin in the prehydrolysis
   kraft black liquor at high effective alkalinity. However, CaCl2, MgCl2,
   and FeCI3 have significant effects on the solubility of lignin in the
   black liquor. According to the reduction rate of UV absorbance, the
   effects of these chloride salts on the black liquor lignin solubility at
   high alkali content were as follows: AlCl3 approximate to

Journal = {{CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{4257-4281}},
Abstract = {{Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are complex biomolecules that
   are known to facilitate patterning of axonal direction and cell
   migration during the early growth and development phase of the mammalian
   central nervous system (CNS). In adults, they continue to control
   neuronal plasticity as major constituents of the ``peri-neuronal
   nets{''} (PNNs) that surround adult CNS neurons. CSPGs are also
   barrier-forming molecules that are selectively upregulated by invading
   reactive astroglia after injury to the CNS, and are responsible for the
   active repulsion of regenerating neurons post-injury. Recent evidence
   however suggests that the diverse sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side
   chains attached to CSPGs are key components that play paradoxical roles
   in influencing nerve regeneration post-injury to the CNS. Sulfated GAG
   repeats attached to the CSPG core protein help mediate cell migration,
   neuritogenesis, axonal pathfinding, and axonal repulsion by directly
   trapping and presenting a whole host of growth factors to cells locally,
   or by binding to specific membrane bound proteins on the cell surface to
   influence cellular function. In this review, we will present the current
   gamut of interventional strategies used to bridge CNS deficits, and
   discuss the potential advantages of using sulfated GAG based
   biomaterials to facilitate the repair and regeneration of the injured
   CNS.}},

Pages = {{195-207}},
Abstract = {{RiboVision is a visualization and analysis tool for the simultaneous
   display of multiple layers of diverse information on primary (1D),
   secondary (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) structures of ribosomes. The
   ribosome is a macromolecular complex containing ribosomal RNA and
   ribosomal proteins and is a key component of life responsible for the
   synthesis of proteins in all living organisms. RiboVision is intended
   for rapid retrieval, analysis, filtering, and display of a variety of
   ribosomal data. Preloaded information includes 1D, 2D, and 3D structures
   augmented by base-pairing, base-stacking, and other molecular
   interactions. RiboVision is preloaded with rRNA secondary structures,
   rRNA domains and helical structures, phylogeny, crystallographic thermal
   factors, etc. RiboVision contains structures of ribosomal proteins and a
   database of their molecular interactions with rRNA. RiboVision contains
   preloaded structures and data for two bacterial ribosomes (Thermus
   thermophilus and Escherichia coli), one archaeal ribosome (Haloarcula
   marismortui), and three eukaryotic ribosomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens). RiboVision revealed several
   major discrepancies between the 2D and 3D structures of the rRNAs of the
   small and large subunits (SSU and LSU). Revised structures mapped with a
   variety of data are available in RiboVision as well as in a public
   gallery (http://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RibosomeGallery). RiboVision
   is designed to allow users to distill complex data quickly and to easily
   generate publication-quality images of data mapped onto secondary
   structures. Users can readily import and analyze their own data in the
   context of other work. This package allows users to import and map data
   from CSV files directly onto 1D, 2D, and 3D levels of structure.
   RiboVision has features in rough analogy with web-based map services
   capable of seamlessly switching the type of data displayed and the
   resolution or magnification of the display. RiboVision is available at
   http://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RiboVision.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-encapsulated SiO2 hybrids (SiO2@RGO) were
   fabricated from the thermal reduction of electrostatically assembled
   SiO2@GO hybrids. Then, epoxy composites, filled with SiO2, SiO2@GO and
   SiO2@RGO hybrids, were prepared by a solvent-free curing process, and
   their thermal, dielectric and thermo-mechanical properties were
   investigated and compared. In the SiO2@RGO/epoxy composites, the
   mono-dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles are firmly embedded in the thin layer
   of RGO nanosheets, forming unique core-shell nanostructures that
   effectively prevent the aggregation of RGO nanosheets in the polymer
   matrix, construct conductive pathways at the particle-polymer interface
   and afford the epoxy composites with outstanding thermo-mechanical
   properties. The dielectric properties of the SiO2@RGO/epoxy composites
   exhibit a typical percolation transition near 0.174 vol\% for RGO (20
   wt\% of SiO2@RGO hybrids), where the dielectric constant could reach
   77.23 at 1 kHz, which is 22 times that of the neat epoxy resin. Upon
   further increase of the loading content, the gradual contact of the
   filler particles leads to the formation of interfacial continuous
   conductive networks, and both the thermal conductivity and dielectric
   constant of the composites show a dramatic increase. With a filler
   loading of 40 wt\% SiO2@RGO (0.373 vol\% for RGO), a thermal
   conductivity of 0.452 W m(-1) K-1 is obtained, which is two times larger
   than that of neat epoxy. In addition, SiO2@RGO/epoxy composites reveal
   significantly decreased coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and
   increased glass transition temperature (T-g). We believe this special
   core-shell SiO2@RGO structure, with its inner mechanically enhanced
   inorganic particles and outer interfacial conductive phase, could make
   full use of the enhancement effect of different components and thus
   endow the polymer composites with outstanding properties overall.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to develop a new high-performance CO2
   sorbent with a simple method. A new CO2 aerogel sorbent was synthesized
   by using one-pot wet gel or sorbent precursor preparation, and
   supercritical drying (SCD). The performance of the aerogel sorbent
   prepared with SCD, A-SCD, is much better than that prepared with ambient
   pressure drying (APD). The highest CO2 sorption capacity achieved with
   the new sorbent in 1\% CO2 flow stream within 20 min is 4.51 mmol g(-1),
   much higher than its state-of-art counterparts even with a 10\% CO2 gas
   mixture which is favorable to increase in CO2 sorption capacity of any
   given sorbent. According to XPS data, the theoretical equilibrium CO2
   sorption capacity of the A-SCD is 7.99 mmol g(-1). The characterization
   results of N-2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and zeta potential
   measurements used for the first time in CO2 research demonstrate that
   the pore structure and surface N concentration of the sorbent are
   significantly improved because of the use of SCD. The sorbent
   preparation method is inspiring and its resulting sorbent is exceptional
   in capacity and regenerability.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on the design of surface acoustic wave strain sensing
   devices based on a Fourier approach. A patterned sensing surface acts as
   a narrow band filter for surface acoustic waves. The center frequencies
   vary as functions of the amount of strain present in the sensing area,
   and can be thus used to estimate the surface strain. The design of the
   sensing pattern in the Fourier space allows the selection of multiple
   sensing frequencies and for their shifting characteristics to be related
   to the three components of strain, i.e. two normal and one shear. The
   result is a surface acoustic wave strain gauge that acts as a strain
   rosette. The design procedure formulates the problem in the wavenumber
   domain, whereby the radiation characteristics of the sensing surface in
   response to an incident broadband surface wave are selected to ensure
   sensitivity to all three strain components. The concept is first
   illustrated for a one-dimensional pattern, whose radiation
   characteristics are governed by a simple, scalar, grating equation. The
   design approach is then extended to a two-dimensional pattern to
   demonstrate the ability to simultaneously measure all three surface
   strain components. The rosette-like operation of the considered strain
   sensor is demonstrated through numerical simulations conducted on an
   elastic surface subjected to a pre-imposed strain state. Eventually, the
   multi-band filtering properties of the proposed sensor patterning are
   evaluated experimentally by means of a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer
   (SLDV).}},

Title = {{The AeroCom evaluation and intercomparison of organic aerosol in global
   models}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{10845-10895}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the current status of global modeling of the
   organic aerosol (OA) in the troposphere and analyzes the differences
   between models as well as between models and observations. Thirty-one
   global chemistry transport models (CTMs) and general circulation models
   (GCMs) have participated in this intercomparison, in the framework of
   AeroCom phase II. The simulation of OA varies greatly between models in
   terms of the magnitude of primary emissions, secondary OA (SOA)
   formation, the number of OA species used (2 to 62), the complexity of OA
   parameterizations (gas-particle partitioning, chemical aging, multiphase
   chemistry, aerosol microphysics), and the OA physical, chemical and
   optical properties. The diversity of the global OA simulation results
   has increased since earlier AeroCom experiments, mainly due to the
   increasing complexity of the SOA parameterization in models, and the
   implementation of new, highly uncertain, OA sources. Diversity of over
   one order of magnitude exists in the modeled vertical distribution of OA
   concentrations that deserves a dedicated future study. Furthermore,
   although the OA/OC ratio depends on OA sources and atmospheric
   processing, and is important for model evaluation against OA and OC
   observations, it is resolved only by a few global models.
   The median global primary OA (POA) source strength is 56 Tg a(-1) (range
   34-144 Tg a(-1)) and the median SOA source strength (natural and
   anthropogenic) is 19 Tg a(-1) (range 13-121 Tg a(-1)). Among the models
   that take into account the semi-volatile SOA nature, the median source
   is calculated to be 51 Tg a(-1) (range 16-121 Tg a(-1)), much larger
   than the median value of the models that calculate SOA in a more
   simplistic way (19 Tg a(-1); range 13-20 Tg a(-1), with one model at 37
   Tg a(-1)). The median atmospheric burden of OA is 1.4 Tg (24 models in
   the range of 0.6-2.0 Tg and 4 between 2.0 and 3.8 Tg), with a median OA
   lifetime of 5.4 days (range 3.8-9.6 days). In models that reported both
   OA and sulfate burdens, the median value of the OA/sulfate burden ratio
   is calculated to be 0.77; 13 models calculate a ratio lower than 1, and
   9 models higher than 1. For 26 models that reported OA deposition
   fluxes, the median wet removal is 70 Tg a(-1) (range 28-209 Tg a(-1)),
   which is on average 85\% of the total OA deposition.
   Fine aerosol organic carbon (OC) and OA observations from continuous
   monitoring networks and individual field campaigns have been used for
   model evaluation. At urban locations, the model-observation comparison
   indicates missing knowledge on anthropogenic OA sources, both strength
   and seasonality. The combined model-measurements analysis suggests the
   existence of increased OA levels during summer due to biogenic SOA
   formation over large areas of the USA that can be of the same order of
   magnitude as the POA, even at urban locations, and contribute to the
   measured urban seasonal pattern.
   Global models are able to simulate the high secondary character of OA
   observed in the atmosphere as a result of SOA formation and POA aging,
   although the amount of OA present in the atmosphere remains largely
   underestimated, with a mean normalized bias (MNB) equal to -0.62 (-0.51)
   based on the comparison against OC (OA) urban data of all models at the
   surface, -0.15 (+0.51) when compared with remote measurements, and -0.30
   for marine locations with OC data. The mean temporal correlations across
   all stations are low when compared with OC (OA) measurements: 0.47
   (0.52) for urban stations, 0.39 (0.37) for remote stations, and 0.25 for
   marine stations with OC data. The combination of high (negative) MNB and
   higher correlation at urban stations when compared with the low MNB and
   lower correlation at remote sites suggests that knowledge about the
   processes that govern aerosol processing, transport and removal, on top
   of their sources, is important at the remote stations. There is no clear
   change in model skill with increasing model complexity with regard to OC
   or OA mass concentration. However, the complexity is needed in models in
   order to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural OA as needed for
   climate mitigation, and to calculate the impact of OA on climate
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we designed a distance metric as DCJ-Indel-Exemplar
   distance to estimate the dissimilarity between two genomes with unequal
   contents (with gene insertions/deletions (Indels) and duplications).
   Based on the aforementioned distance metric, we proposed the
   DCJ-Indel-Exemplar median problem, to find a median genome that minimize
   the DCJ-Indel-Exemplar distance between this genome and the given three
   genomes. We adapted Lin-Kernighan (LK) heuristic to calculate the median
   quickly by utilizing the features of adequate sub-graph decomposition
   and search space reduction technologies. Experimental results on
   simulated gene order data indicate that our distance estimator can
   closely estimate the real number of rearrangement events; while compared
   with the exact solver using equal content genomes, our median solver can
   get very accurate results as well. More importantly, our median solver
   can deal with Indels and duplications and generates results very close
   to the synthetic cumulative number of evolutionary events.}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal dissolution is one of the major causes of capacity and
   power fade in lithium-ion batteries employing transition metal oxides in
   the positive electrode. Accelerated testing was accomplished by
   introducing transition-metal salts in the electrolyte in order to study
   the effects of dissolution on performance. It is shown that metal
   dissolution causes a reduction in capacity and cycle stability in full
   cells. The SEI layer resistance in the negative electrode of full cells
   increases with increasing concentration of transition metal salts. The
   growth of the SEI layer is non-uniform and is believed to be caused by
   the reduction of transition metal species in the negative electrode
   leading to an increase in inorganic component of the SEI layer. (C) The

Abstract = {{A phase-field model, accounting for large elasto-plastic deformation, is
   developed to study the evolution of phase, morphology and stress in
   crystalline silicon (Si) electrodes upon lithium (Li) insertion. The Li
   concentration profiles and deformation geometries are co-evolved by
   solving a set of coupled phase-field and mechanics equations using the
   finite element method. The present phase-field model is validated in
   comparison with a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion model of
   lithiation in Si electrodes. It is shown that as the lithiation
   proceeds, the hoop stress changes from the initial compression to
   tension in the surface layer of the Si electrode, which may explain the
   surface cracking observed in experiments. The present phase-field model
   is generally applicable to high-capacity electrode systems undergoing
   both phase change and large elasto-plastic deformation. (C) The

Abstract = {{Pulverization is a major cause of the capacity fade and poor cyclability
   of Sn-based anodes in lithium-ion batteries. We study the structural
   evolution of Sn nanoparticles during electrochemical
   lithiation-delithiation cycling by in situ transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The beta-Sn nanoparticles in the size range of 79-526
   nm are lithiated to the crystal Li22Sn5 phase via a two-step mechanism,
   and no cracking or fracture, is observed, distinct from the
   lithiation-induced fracture in micron-sized Sn particles. Lithiation can
   induce the aggregation of small Sn nanoparticles with diameter in tens
   of nanometers, while delithiation can lead to the pulverization of large
   Sn nanoparticles. Similarly, the aggregation and pulverization of Sit
   nanoparticles are also observed daring sodiation and desodiation,
   respectively. The delithiation/desodiation induced pulverization of Sn
   nanoparticles is attributed to the high dealloying rate that results in
   cracks and voids in dealloyed Sn anodes. Based on our in situ TEM
   results, a size-dependent ` pulverization mechanism of Sn particles is
   proposed. Our work advances the mechanistic understanding of the
   pulverization and degradation mechanisms of Sn particle-based electrodes
   in Li-ion batteries. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{The possibility of novel nanocomposite materials with dramatically
   improved properties requires fundamental studies of interactions. Full
   elucidation of these concepts will allow the tailoring of such systems
   for particular applications. Using near-edge X-ray absorption fine
   structure spectroscopy, we investigated interactions in electrospun
   poly(dimethylsiloxane)-poly(methyl methacrylate)-multiwall carbon
   nanotube composites. This paper describes these interactions through a
   building-block model, addresses their dependence upon filler size, and
   discusses electrospinning as an alignment solution. Though alignment of
   filler and polymeric chains was not observed spectrally, SEM imaging
   confirmed uniaxial carbon nanotube alignment in composite fibres.
   Spectra acquired at different incidence angles revealed differences in
   energy and intensity of resonances, suggesting conformational
   configurations. These differences were more significant in composites
   with larger nanofiller. This supported proposed models of CH-p
   interactions and hydrogen bonding as adhesion mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Influence of stoichiometry on the glass transition and bond exchange
   reactions in epoxy thermoset polymers}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{89}},
Pages = {{48682-48690}},
Abstract = {{Thermally malleable polymers which undergo covalent bond exchange
   reactions (BERs) have been shown to be able to rearrange their network
   topology at high temperatures without impairing the network integrity.
   At low temperatures, the BERs are so sluggish that the materials behave
   like traditional thermosetting polymers. In this paper, we demonstrated
   that the temperature dependent BER rate could be tuned by adjusting the
   stoichiometry of monomers. As the ratio of hard segments in the epoxy
   thermoset network is increased, the material's glass transition
   temperature (T-g) is increased, with a corresponding increase in the
   temperature required to achieve a given stress relaxation rate. The
   material stress relaxation behavior was studied from both a theoretical
   and experimental point of view. Based on the kinetics of BERs, we
   derived the detailed expression of stress relaxation time, which reveals
   an Arrhenius type dependency of material relaxation behavior on the
   applied temperature. Subsequently, from the experimental stress
   relaxation curves, we determined the energy barrier for the BERs in
   different networks. With the T-g being elevated from 30.3 degrees C to
   63.0 degrees C, the BER energy barrier is linearly increased from 68.2
   kJ mol(-1) to 97.3 kJ mol(-1). Such a correlation between these two
   thermomechanical behaviors provides an additional design parameter
   (beyond catalyst choice) which can aid in achieving highly tunable
   service conditions for practical engineering applications of thermally
   malleable thermosets.}},

   The inner star-like PtBA blocks were hydrolyzed into poly(acrylic acid)
   (PAA), yielding star-like CNBP-capped PAA (i.e., star-like PAA-CNBP).
   The starlike polymers were characterized by gel permeation

   narrow size distribution, as well as being examined by proton nuclear
   magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

Abstract = {{The proliferation of cloud computing over the past several years has led
   to a variety of new use cases and enabling technologies for enterprise
   and consumer applications. Increased reliance on cloud-based platforms
   has also necessitated an increased emphasis on securing the services and
   data hosted within those platforms. From a security standpoint, an
   advantage of cloud platforms over traditional production networks is
   that they have a dynamic, mutable structure that can change as a result
   of a variety of factors, so reconnaissance on the part of an attacker is
   far less predictable. In this work, we propose a novel technique that
   leverages the amorphous nature of cloud architectures to deceive and
   redirect potential intruders with decoy assets implanted among
   production hosts. In this way, attackers encounter and probe decoys that
   lead them to reveal their motives and cause them to be less likely to
   compromise their intended target, particularly once they have revealed
   their tactics against decoy assets. We show that our technique, after
   having been exposed to live traffic for approximately one month,
   detected 1,255 highly malicious hosts and was able to divert 97.5\% of
   malicious traffic from these hosts. This traffic would have otherwise
   reached production hosts and potentially led to compromise.}},

Abstract = {{To provide constant channel conditions for a great deal of distributed
   wireless sensors, magneto-inductive (MI) propagation technique suggests
   an attractive facilitation of underground sensor networks (USNs) for
   MI-USNs. However, to put this MI method into practice, a reliable and
   efficient data transportation is a must to fulfill a pre-defined level
   of quality of service (QoS). In this paper, a complete study is first
   given for the different communication functionalities from physical to
   network layers as well as the QoS requirements of applications. Rather
   than adopting the currently layered approach, a two-phase cross-layer
   protocol, called Xlayer, is then proposed to deliver statistical QoS
   guarantees and obtain both optimal energy savings and throughput gain
   concurrently. Simulation results conform that Xlayer achieves
   significant energy savings, high throughput efficiency, and dependable
   MI communication, thus facilitating a new design paradigm for MI-USNs.}},

Abstract = {{The regenerator, typically a microporous structure that is subject to
   periodic flow of a cryogenic fluid, is a critical component of pulse
   tube or Stirling cryocoolers, which are widely used for high-demand
   aerospace and defense applications. In this investigation, experiments
   were conducted in which steady and oscillatory flows of helium were
   imposed on ErPr rare-Earth regenerator filler material and mass flow and
   pressure drop data were recorded under ambient temperature conditions. A
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD)- assisted method was applied for the
   analysis and interpretation of the experimental data. The permeability
   and inertial coefficients that lead to agreement between the
   experimental data and computational simulations were iteratively

Abstract = {{Stirling-type pulse tube cryocoolers (PTC) are often selected for
   cryogenic cooling applications for their robustness and mechanical
   simplicity, having no moving parts at the cold end of the cooler.
   Originally designed for space applications, increased terrestrial use in
   tactical applications as well as ground testing of space systems has
   revealed that some PTCs exhibit sensitivity to gravitational
   orientation, often losing significant cooling performance unless
   situated with the cold end pointing downward. Previous investigations
   have indicated that some coolers exhibit sensitivity while others do
   not; however, a reliable method of predicting the level of sensitivity
   during the design process has not been developed. We have utilized 3-D
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to predict the percent of cooling
   capacity lost as a result of off-axis operation. The computational model
   has been validated experimentally on a number of coolers to enhance
   confidence in the method used.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{15}},
Abstract = {{We present a new approach to automatic training of a eukaryotic ab
   initio gene finding algorithm. With the advent of Next-Generation
   Sequencing, automatic training has become paramount, allowing genome
   annotation pipelines to keep pace with the speed of genome sequencing.
   Earlier we developed GeneMark-ES, currently the only gene finding
   algorithm for eukaryotic genomes that performs automatic training in
   unsupervised ab initio mode. The new algorithm, GeneMark-ET augments
   GeneMark-ES with a novel method that integrates RNA-Seq read alignments
   into the self-training procedure. Use of `assembled' RNA-Seq transcripts
   is far from trivial; significant error rate of assembly was revealed in
   recent assessments. We demonstrated in computational experiments that
   the proposed method of incorporation of `unassembled' RNA-Seq reads
   improves the accuracy of gene prediction; particularly, for the 1.3 GB
   genome of Aedes aegypti the mean value of prediction Sensitivity and
   Specificity at the gene level increased over GeneMark-ES by 24.5\%. In
   the current surge of genomic data when the need for accurate sequence
   annotation is higher than ever, GeneMark-ET will be a valuable addition
   to the narrow arsenal of automatic gene prediction tools.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the optimization of a hollow fiber contactor operated
   in a rapid temperature swing adsorption (RTSA) mode for CO2 capture from
   flue gas. A hollow fiber contactor enables rapid heat and mass transfer
   and an efficient heat integration whereby parasitic loads on power
   plants can be reduced significantly compared to the traditional thermal
   swing adsorption processes. In this paper we employ a dynamic
   optimization strategy to predict the optimal operating conditions of a
   hollow fiber RTSA process for different process design objectives. The
   objective function considered was to maximize the feed throughput of the
   process with constraints for the required CO2 purity and recovery.
   Furthermore, the external heat and cold utilities must be minimized. The
   optimization requires a dynamic heat integration i.e. redistributing the
   hot and cold stream outlet between different parts of a cycle which is
   challenging and unconventional. This has been performed using a binary
   decision variable which switches the outlet water stream between hot and
   cold tanks. We also show that a multi-objective optimization approach
   can be employed to determine the optimal trade-off between heat duty and
   process throughput. Optimization was performed using a single
   discretization approach within gPROMS.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the supply allocation problem, using a Stackelberg
   game, for an established timberlands supply chain with an additional
   decision of a new biorefinery investment. In a timberlands system,
   harvester and manufacturer decision makers have separate objectives to
   maximize their respective profits. This interaction is represented with
   a turn based Stackelberg game. The harvesters make its decisions first
   on the quantity harvested, and the manufacturers make their decisions on
   how much to utilize. This game is represented in a bilevel mathematical
   programming model. The novel feature of this paper's bilevel formulation
   is the inclusion of parametric uncertainty in a two stage model. The
   first stage problem involves logistical decisions around biorefinery
   investments, such as location and capacity, while the second stage
   problem is a bilevel timberlands model with parameter uncertainty.
   Studying this problem formulation revealed interesting insight
   concerning solving multiperiod problems with bilevel stages as well as
   decision maker behavior for the timberlands model.}},

Title = {{Presentation modality of glycoconjugates modulates dendritic cell
   phenotype}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{1426-1439}},
Abstract = {{The comparative dendritic cell (DC) response to glycoconjugates
   presented in soluble, phagocytosable, or non-phagocytosable display
   modalities is poorly understood. This is particularly problematic, as
   the probing of immobilized glycans presented on the surface of
   microarrays is a common screen for potential candidates for glycan-based
   therapeutics. However, the assumption that carbohydrate-protein
   interactions on a flat surface can be translatable to development of
   efficacious therapies, such as vaccines, which are delivered in soluble
   or phagocytosable particles, has not been validated. Thus, a preliminary
   investigation was performed in which mannose or glucose was conjugated
   to cationized bovine serum albumin and presented to DCs in soluble,
   phagocytosable, or non-phagocytosable display modalities. The functional
   DC response to the glycoconjugates was assessed via a high throughput
   assay. Dendritic cell phenotypic outcomes were placed into a
   multivariate, general linear model (GLM) and shown to be statistically
   different amongst display modalities when comparing similar surface
   areas. The GLM showed that glycoconjugates that were adsorbed to wells
   were the most pro-inflammatory while soluble conjugates were the least.
   DC interactions with mannose conjugates were found to be calcium
   dependent and could be inhibited via anti-DC-SIGN antibodies. The
   results of this study aim to resolve conflicts in reports from multiple
   laboratories showing differential DC profiles in response to similar, if
   not identical, ligands delivered via different modalities. Additionally,
   this study begins to bridge the gap between microarray binding data and
   functional cell responses by highlighting the phenotypes induced from
   adsorbed glycoconjugates as compared to those in solution or displayed
   on microparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Reported here is a method of thermal treatment to enhance the barrier
   properties of membranes made from Cellulose Nano Fibrils (CNFs). CNF
   membranes of 75 +/- 5 mu m thickness were prepared by evaporation of
   water from a suspension of CNFs. This was followed by thermal treatment
   at different temperatures (100 degrees C, 125 degrees C, 150 degrees C,
   and 175 degrees C) for 3 hours and subsequent conditioning at 23 degrees
   C and 50\% relative humidity for 24 hours. Increasing thermal treatment
   temperature correlated with enhanced barrier properties; the oxygen and
   water vapor permeability decreased by 25 fold and 2 fold respectively
   after treatment at 175 degrees C. The reduction in permeability was
   attributed to an increase in crystallinity, reduction of the inter
   fibril space or porosity, and increase in hydrophobicity. These effects
   were also demonstrated to be analogous to hornification of cellulose
   fibers.}},

Title = {{Codon Swapping of Zinc Finger Nucleases Confers Expression in Primary
   Cells and In Vivo from a Single Lentiviral Vector}},
Journal = {{CURRENT GENE THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{365-376}},
Abstract = {{Background: Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are promising tools for genome
   editing for biotechnological as well as therapeutic purposes. Delivery
   remains a major issue impeding targeted genome modification. Lentiviral
   vectors are highly efficient for delivering transgenes into cell lines,
   primary cells and into organs, such as the liver. However, the reverse
   transcription of lentiviral vectors leads to recombination of homologous
   sequences, as found between and within ZFN monomers.
   Methods: We used a codon swapping strategy to both drastically disrupt
   sequence identity between ZFN monomers and to reduce sequence repeats
   within a monomer sequence. We constructed lentiviral vectors encoding
   codon-swapped ZFNs or unmodified ZFNs from a single mRNA transcript.
   Cell lines, primary hepatocytes and newborn rats were used to evaluate
   the efficacy of integrative-competent (ICLV) and integrative-deficient
   (IDLV) lentiviral vectors to deliver ZFNs into target cells.
   Results: We reduced total identity between ZFN monomers from 90.9\% to
   61.4\% and showed that a single ICLV allowed efficient expression of
   functional ZFNs targeting the rat UGT1A1 gene after codon-swapping,
   leading to much higher ZFN activity in cell lines (up to 7-fold increase
   compared to unmodified ZFNs and 60\% activity in C6 cells), as compared
   to plasmid transfection or a single ICLV encoding unmodified ZFN
   monomers. Off-target analysis located several active sites for the
   5-finger UGT1A1-ZFNs. Furthermore, we reported for the first time
   successful ZFN-induced targeted DNA double-strand breaks in primary
   cells (hepatocytes) and in vivo (liver) after delivery of a single IDLV
   encoding two ZFNs.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate that a codon-swapping approach
   allowed a single lentiviral vector to efficiently express ZFNs and
   should stimulate the use of this viral platform for ZFN-mediated genome
   editing of primary cells, for both ex vivo or in vivo applications.}},

Title = {{Hierarchical porous carbon aerogel derived from bagasse for high

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{12120-12129}},
Abstract = {{Renewable, cost-effective and eco-friendly electrode materials have
   attracted much attention in the energy conversion and storage fields.
   Bagasse, the waste product from sugarcane that mainly contains cellulose
   derivatives, can be a promising candidate to manufacture supercapacitor
   electrode materials. This study demonstrates the fabrication and
   characterization of highly porous carbon aerogels by using bagasse as a
   raw material. Macro and mesoporous carbon was first prepared by
   carbonizing the freeze-dried bagasse aerogel; consequently, microporous
   structure was created on the walls of the mesoporous carbon by chemical
   activation. Interestingly, it was observed that the specific surface
   area, the pore size and distribution of the hierarchical porous carbon
   were affected by the activation temperature. In order to evaluate the
   ability of the hierarchical porous carbon towards the supercapacitor
   electrode performance, solid state symmetric supercapacitors were
   assembled, and a comparable high specific capacitance of 142.1 F g(-1)
   at a discharge current density of 0.5 A g(-1) was demonstrated. The
   fabricated solid state supercapacitor displayed excellent capacitance
   retention of 93.9\% over 5000 cycles. The high energy storage ability of
   the hierarchical porous carbon was attributed to the specially designed
   pore structures, i.e., co-existence of the micropores and mesopores.
   This research has demonstrated that utilization of sustainable
   biopolymers as the raw materials for high performance supercapacitor
   electrode materials is an effective way to fabricate low-cost energy
   storage devices.}},

Title = {{Demonstrating a Bottom-Up Framework for Evaluating Energy and Emissions
   Performance of Electric Rail Transit Options}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2428}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Abstract = {{Current frameworks for analyzing emissions performance of public
   transportation systems use top-down approaches that can often provide
   useful information at the network level but can be uninformative at the
   project level at which the influence of route and vehicle
   characteristics can significantly impact emission profiles of candidate
   transit options. This paper describes an alternative bottom-up framework
   that uses second-by-second travel activity data to estimate total power
   consumption and related emissions for propulsion purposes with
   application to electric rail transit systems. The model was developed
   and calibrated with data from Portland, Oregon, and was supplemented
   with activity data from Chicago, Illinois. The results showed a
   predicted 1\% to 8\% difference in expected power consumption relative
   to estimates derived from the national transit database. In addition,
   the results highlighted how the speed profile, configuration of the
   train in number of cars, and mix of power generation sources could
   significantly vary emissions performance across different service
   routes. The developed framework can serve as an important tool for a
   transit planner or policy maker to evaluate the emissions performance of
   electric rail transit options. This framework has the advantage of
   relevance at both the network and project levels. At the project level,
   users can easily perform detailed sensitivity analysis on aspects of
   transit services such as vehicle and fuel technologies, passenger
   loading profiles, train size, and track profile. This framework gives
   transportation planners a flexible and efficient tool for emissions
   performance analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive health monitoring of structural components will require the
   development of advanced sensing techniques capable of providing
   quantitative information on the damage state of structural materials. By
   focusing on nonlinear acoustic techniques, it is possible to measure
   absolute, strength based material parameters that can then be coupled
   with uncertainty models to enable accurate and quantitative life
   prediction. Starting at the material level, this review will present
   current research that involves a combination of sensing techniques and
   physics-based models to characterize damage in metallic materials. In
   metals, these nonlinear ultrasonic measurements can sense material
   state, before the formation of micro-and macro-cracks. Typically, cracks
   of a measurable size appear quite late in a component's total life,
   while the material's integrity in terms of toughness and strength
   gradually decreases due to the microplasticity (dislocations) and
   associated change in the material's microstructure. This review focuses
   on second harmonic generation techniques. Since these nonlinear acoustic
   techniques are acoustic wave based, component interrogation can be
   performed with bulk, surface and guided waves using the same underlying
   material physics; these nonlinear ultrasonic techniques provide results
   which are independent of the wave type used. Recent physics-based models
   consider the evolution of damage due to dislocations, slip bands,
   interstitials, and precipitates in the lattice structure, which can lead
   to localized damage.}},

Abstract = {{A well-known damage detection paradigm is the use of ultrasonic guided
   waves that are generated and recorded by a spatially-distributed array
   of piezoelectric transducers. This type of configuration is capable of
   interrogating a defect from a variety of angles and over a large region
   of interest by analyzing all pairwise transducer signals. By subtracting
   prerecorded baseline signals, differential signals are obtained that can
   be analyzed for the purpose of detecting, locating, and characterizing
   newly-introduced scatterers. Typical analysis techniques such as
   delay-and-sum imaging have the ability to detect flaws, but their
   performance is limited, especially when the potential scatterers may
   have high directionality or introduce phase shifts. Signal envelopes are
   frequently used to avoid the problem of unknown phase shifts, which
   further reduces performance. The sparsity-based technique described here
   uses a different approach, where each potential damage location has its
   own generic linear scattering model that allows for unknown variations
   in amplitude and phase between each transducer pair. The differential
   signals are then assumed to be a linear combination of a small number of
   these models, and an image is generated using a block-sparse
   reconstruction algorithm that splits the signals into location-based
   components. Results are presented for experimental data. The images
   exhibit smaller spot size and fewer artifacts than those obtained via
   delay-and-sum imaging, provided the model is reasonably well-matched to
   the data.}},

Abstract = {{A common practice in guided wave structural health monitoring is
   collecting measurements from a transducer array using the pitch-catch
   method. Among different array configurations, the spatially distributed
   array provides a cost-effective solution for rapid interrogation of
   large, plate-like structures. Several guided wave imaging techniques
   have been proposed and successfully demonstrated for damage detection
   and localization. However, the performance of these imaging methods can
   be compromised by a mismatch between a particular transducer array
   geometry and the scattering characteristics of a defect of interest.
   This study proposes a method, which is based upon estimating scattering
   matrices, to quantify the ability of a specific array geometry to
   interrogate a scatterer. Several array geometries are evaluated using
   this method, and a Monte Carlo simulation is then performed to vary the
   transducer locations to find the array geometry that is best matched to
   a specific directional scatterer. The efficacy of the proposed method is
   evaluated experimentally by introducing notches of different
   orientations and locations on an aluminum plate specimen that is
   instrumented with a spatially distributed array.}},

Abstract = {{Laser ultrasonic NDT technique has drawn a lot of interests recently in
   various application areas. All advantages of traditional ultrasonic
   technique are inherited with additional non-contact and broadband
   generation characteristics. The principle of this NDT technique is using
   laser to generate broadband ultrasounds and then investigating the
   effect of any structural feature under inspection on the ultrasonic wave
   propagation. However, there are various structural features present in
   test samples, which will cause reflections of ultrasounds from different
   directions. Another important source of reflection is the sample
   boundaries. All these reflections usually are not directly related to
   the structural feature under inspection and will obscure the
   interactions with the real structural feature of interest. In order to
   highlight the real informative components in the received ultrasonic
   signals, it is desirable to remove useless reflection components and
   other signal components from received signals. This work proposed a 3-D
   fast Fourier transform(FFT) based algorithm to effectively remove
   useless signal components in laser ultrasonic signals. The
   implementation of the algorithm was demonstrated by processing an
   imaging signal from inspecting a ball grid array(BGA) chip using laser
   ultrasonic technique. The small chip dimension led to quick and strong
   reflections from four boundaries in acquired signals. The proposed
   method was proven to be able to effectively remove reflections and
   useless signal components and leave only the direct incident waves,
   which would make it easy to investigate the interaction between
   ultrasonic wave propagation and potential solder bump defects. The
   proposed method is a general signal processing method, which is not
   limited to the laser ultrasonic NDT technique.}},

Abstract = {{Laser/EMAT ultrasonic technique has attracted more and more interests in
   weld quality inspection because of its non-destructive and non-contact
   characteristics. When ultrasonic techniques are used to detect welds
   joining relative thin plates, the dominant ultrasonic waves present in
   the plates are Lamb waves, which propagate all through the thickness.
   Traditional Time of Flight(ToF) method loses its power. The broadband
   nature of laser excited ultrasound plus dispersive and multi-modal
   characteristic of Lamb waves make the EMAT acquired signals very
   complicated in this situation. Challenge rises in interpreting the
   received signals and establishing relationship between signal feature
   and weld quality. In this paper, the laser/EMAT ultrasonic technique was
   applied in a C-scan manner to record full wave propagation field over an
   area close to the weld. Then the effect of weld defect on the
   propagation field of Lamb waves was studied visually by watching an
   movie resulted from the recorded signals. This method was proved to be
   effective to detect the presence of hidden defect in the weld. Discrete
   wavelet transform(DWT) was applied to characterize the acquired
   ultrasonic signals and ideal band-pass filter was used to isolate wave
   components most sensitive to the weld defect. Different interactions
   with the weld defect were observed for different wave components. Thus
   this C-Scan method, combined with DWT and ideal band-pass filter, proved
   to be an effective methodology to experimentally study interactions of
   various laser excited Lamb Wave components with weld defect. In this
   work, the method was demonstrated by inspecting a hidden local
   incomplete penetration in weld. In fact, this method can be applied to
   study Lamb Wave interactions with any type of structural inconsistency.
   This work also proposed a ideal filtered based method to effectively
   reduce the total experimental time.}},

Abstract = {{In modern surface mount packaging technologies, such as flip chips, chip
   scale packages, and ball grid arrays(BGA), chips are attached to the
   substrates/printed wiring board (PWB) using solder bump
   interconnections. The quality of solder bumps between the chips and the
   substrate/board is difficult to inspect. Laser
   ultrasonic-interferometric technique was proved to be a promising
   approach for solder bump inspection because of its noncontact and
   nondestructive characteristics. Different indicators extracted from
   received signals have been used to predict the potential defects, such
   as correlation coefficient, error ratio, frequency shifting, etc.
   However, the fundamental understanding of the chip behavior under laser
   ultrasonic inspection is still missing. Specifically, it is not sure
   whether the laser interferometer detected out-of-plane displacements
   were due to wave propagation or structural vibration when the chip was
   excited by pulsed laser. Plus, it is found that the received signals are
   chip dependent. Both challenges impede the interpretation of acquired
   signals. In this paper, a C-scan method was proposed to study the
   underlying phenomenon during laser ultrasonic inspection. The full chip
   was inspected. The response of the chip under laser excitation was
   visualized in a movie resulted from acquired signals. Specifically, a
   BGA chip was investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
   method. By characterizing signals using discrete wavelet transform(DWT),
   both ultrasonic wave propagation and vibration were observed. Separation
   of them was successfully achieved using ideal band-pass filter and
   visualized in resultant movies, too. The observed ultrasonic waves were
   characterized and their respective speeds were measured by applying 2-D
   FFT. The C-scan method, combined with different digital signal
   processing techniques, was proved to be an very effective methodology to
   learn the behavior of chips under laser excitation. This general
   procedure can be applied to any unknown chip before inspection. A wealth
   of information can be provided by this learning procedure, which greatly
   benefits the interpretation of inspection signals afterwards.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of numerical analyses carried out for 2D
   models of aluminum plates undergoing crack propagation. Different types
   of numerical analyses were performed to show the area of applicability
   of a non-local discrete formulation of mechanical continua for NDE and
   QNDE. The authors' interests dealt with: Lamb wave propagation, higher
   harmonics generation, the phenomenon of clapping, and wave generation
   and its propagation for growing crack. In the first case a 2D model
   allowed to find the displacements for the vertical cross-section along
   the direction of wave propagation and therefore assess its disturbance
   when introducing a notch. In-plane components of the displacements were
   considered for the latter 3 cases, in turn. The above cases and
   elaborated non-local numerical models were discussed in terms of
   detection of propagating crack. Apart from theoretical aspects of the
   presented work, the obtained results seem to be of great importance for
   improvement of experiments in terms of sensor distribution and required
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{A harmonic acoustic tone burst propagating through an elastic solid with
   quadratic nonlinearity produces not only a parallel burst of second
   harmonic but also an often neglected quasi-static pulse associated with
   the acoustic radiation-induced eigenstrain. Although initial analytical
   and experimental studies by Yost and Cantrell suggested that the pulse
   might have a right-angled triangular shape with the peak displacement at
   the leading edge being proportional to the length of the tone burst,
   more recent theoretical, analytical, numerical, and experimental studies
   proved that the pulse has a flat-top shape and the peak displacement is
   proportional to the propagation length. In this paper, analytical and
   numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate two types of
   finite-size effects. First, the finite axial dimension of the specimen
   cannot be simply accounted for by a linear reflection coefficient that
   neglects the nonlinear interaction between the combined incident and
   reflected fields. Second, the quasistatic pulse generated by a
   transducer of finite aperture suffers more severe divergence than both
   the fundamental and second harmonic pulses generated by the same
   transducer. These finite-size effects can make the top of the
   quasi-static pulse sloped rather than flat and therefore must be taken
   into consideration in the interpretation of experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear mixing of two collinear, initially monochromatic, Rayleigh
   waves propagating in the same direction in an isotropic, nonlinear
   elastic solid is investigated analytically. A system of coupled ordinary
   differential equations is derived based on the Lagrange equations of the
   second kind to predict the evolution of the higher harmonic and
   combination frequency components of the fundamentals waves. Numerical
   results show that the energy transfer is larger for higher frequencies,
   and that the oscillation of the energy between the different frequency
   components depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of the fundamental
   waves. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the horizontal velocity
   component can form a shock wave while the vertical velocity component
   can form a pulse. The occurrence of these effects is independent of the
   specific fundamental frequencies and amplitudes that are mixed. However,
   the nonlinear interaction is more efficient when the mixing frequencies
   are close to each other which increases both effects. The analytical
   model is then extended by implementing diffraction effects in the
   parabolic approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear ultrasonic waves have shown to be sensitive to various
   microstructural changes in metals including coherent precipitates; these
   precipitates introduce a strain field in the lattice structure. The
   thermal aging of certain alloy steels leads to the formation of coherent
   precipitates, which pin dislocations and contribute to the generation of
   a second harmonic component. A precipitate hardenable material namely
   17-4 PH stainless steel is thermally treated in this research to obtain
   different precipitation stages, and then the influence of precipitates
   on the acoustic nonlinearity parameter is assessed. Conclusions about
   the microstrucutural changes in the material are drawn based on the
   results from a nonlinear Rayleigh surface wave measurement and
   complementary thermo-electric power, hardness and ultrasonic velocity
   measurements. The results show that the nonlinear parameter is sensitive
   to coherent precipitates in the material and moreover that precipitation
   characteristics can be characterized based on the obtained experimental

Abstract = {{The presence of reactive aggregates combined with sufficient moisture
   and concentration of alkalis are the three basic requirements for damage
   due alkali-silica reaction (ASR) gel formation and expansion in
   concrete. For health-monitoring of concrete structures, and in order to
   investigate the potential for detecting ASR gel formation in existing
   structures, one potential technique involves studying changes in the
   temporal complex dielectric constant of concrete structures. In this
   paper, a microwave nondestructive testing approach is proposed which
   involves soaking two hardened mortar samples and measuring the change in
   their temporal complex dielectric constant in order to distinguish
   between the sample containing ASR gel and the one devoid of it. Part of
   the free water becomes bound in the sample containing ASR gel and since
   a portion of the microcracks in this sample contain ASR gel, the rate of
   evaporation of water of the two samples is expected to be different. The
   complex dielectric constant of the samples is significantly dependent
   upon the volumetric level and movement (in and out of the samples) of
   free water. Therefore, studying the relative different temporal rate of
   change in this parameter is expected to yield information about the
   presence or absence of ASR gel.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials and thus
   assessment of damage in concrete structures is of the utmost importance
   from both a safety point of view and a financial point of view. Of
   particular interest are surface opening cracks that extend through the
   concrete cover, as this can expose the steel reinforcement bars
   underneath and induce corrosion in them. This corrosion can lead to
   significant subsequent damage in concrete such as cracking and
   delamination of the cover concrete as well as rust staining on the
   surface of concrete. Concrete beams are designed and constructed in such
   a way to provide crack depths up to around 13 cm. Two different types of
   measurements are made in-situ to estimate depths of real surface cracks
   (as opposed to saw-cut notches) after unloading: one based on the
   impact-echo method and the other one based on the diffuse ultrasonic
   method. These measurements are compared to the crack depth visually
   observed on the sides of the beams. Discussions are given as to the
   advantages and disadvantages of each method.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of concrete to the environment leads to changes in composition,
   microstructure, and properties; these effects often start from the
   surface of a concrete structure. A specific, widespread environmental
   effect is carbonation, where carbon dioxide penetrates the surface of
   concrete and reacts with calcium hydroxide that is a product of Portland
   cement hydration in concrete. Carbonation is of interest not only
   because it can lead to the initiation of reinforcement corrosion, but
   also carbon is increasingly used during curing to alter the surface
   properties of cement-based materials as a method to `` sink{''} carbon
   in cement-based materials. Nonlinear Rayleigh surface wave measurements
   are performed on uncarbonated and carbonated concrete samples to assess
   any mechanical changes induced by carbonation,. In order to minimize the
   effects of contact conditions, the generated signals are detected by a
   noncontact air-coupled transducer (100 kHz) at locations along the
   propagation axis. The nonlinearity parameter, beta is used to
   quantitatively characterize the degree of carbonation. To more
   accurately analyze the data, corrections are made for the effects of
   attenuation and diffraction. A comparison between the carbonated and
   uncarbonated samples demonstrates that pores and micro-cracks are
   affected by the carbonation product and these significantly change the
   measured nonlinearity parameter.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that liquid coupling agents used to couple an
   ultrasonic transducer to a solid specimen cause a number of problems
   including inconsistency in results and slowness of the inspection.
   Especially when the specimen surface is rough such as those in-field
   concrete structures, the long surface preparation time that it takes to
   polish every single point of inspection makes it impractical to apply
   the traditional contact methods to the inspection of these structures.
   To address this issue, a fully noncontact air-coupled measurement setup
   in mid and high ultrasonic frequencies (50-150 kHz) is presented. The
   setup generates and detects bulk and Rayleigh surface waves in this
   frequency range with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   which enables performing a fast scan with a small number of signal
   averages. Using this setup, ultrasonic velocity and attenuation in a
   concrete specimen are measured. Also the possibility to detect
   discontinuities such as steel reinforcement bars or cracks in a concrete
   sample is explored.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear generation currently accounts for roughly 20\% of the US
   baseload power generation. Yet, many US nuclear plants are entering
   their first period of life extension and older plants are currently
   undergoing assessment of technical basis to operate beyond 60 years.
   This means that critical components, such as the reactor pressure vessel
   (RPV), will be exposed to higher levels of radiation than they were
   originally intended to withstand. Radiation damage in reactor pressure
   vessel steels causes microstructural changes such as vacancy clusters,
   precipitates, dislocations, and interstitial loops that leave the
   material in an embrittled state. The development of a nondestructive
   evaluation technique to characterize the effect of radiation exposure on
   the properties of the RPV would allow estimation of the remaining
   integrity of the RPV with time. Recent research has shown that nonlinear
   ultrasound is sensitive to radiation damage. The physical effect
   monitored by nonlinear ultrasonic techniques is the generation of higher
   harmonic frequencies in an initially monochromatic ultrasonic wave,
   arising from the interaction of the ultrasonic wave with microstructural
   features such as dislocations, precipitates, and their combinations.
   Current findings relating the measured acoustic nonlinearity parameter
   to increasing levels of neutron fluence for different representative RPV
   materials are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Angle-beam ultrasonic testing is a common practical technique used for
   nondestructive evaluation to detect, locate, and characterize a variety
   of material defects and damage. Greater understanding of the both the
   incident wavefield produced by an angle-beam transducer and the
   subsequent scattering from a variety of defects and geometrical features
   is anticipated to increase the reliability of data interpretation. The
   focus of this paper is on acquiring and analyzing propagating waves from
   angle-beam transducers in simple, defect-free plates as a first step in
   the development of methods for flaw characterization. Unlike guided
   waves, which excite the plate throughout its thickness, angle-beam bulk
   waves bounce back and forth between the plate surfaces, resulting in the
   well-known multiple ``skips{''} or ``V-paths.{''} The experimental setup
   consists of a laser vibrometer mounted on an XYZ scanning stage, which
   is programmed to move point-to-point on a rectilinear grid to acquire
   waveform data. Although laser vibrometry is now routinely used to record
   guided waves for which the frequency content is below 1 MHz, it is more
   challenging to acquire higher frequency bulk waves in the 1-10 MHz
   range. Signals are recorded on the surface of an aluminum plate that
   were generated from a 5 MHz, 65 degrees refracted angle, shear wave
   transducer-wedge combination. Data are analyzed directly in the x-t
   domain, via a slant stack Radon transform in the tau-p (offset
   time-slowness) domain, and via a 2-D Fourier transform in the omega-k
   domain, thereby enabling identification of specific arrivals and modes.
   Results compare well to those expected from a simple ray tracing
   analysis except for the unexpected presence of a strong Rayleigh wave.}},

Title = {{Accessibility of Communication Technology and the Rider Experience Case
   Study of Saint Louis, Missouri, Metro}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2415}},
Pages = {{118-126}},
Abstract = {{Real-time information (RTI) informing transit riders about transit
   schedules, next bus or train arrivals, and service alerts is
   increasingly available, particularly through Internet-enabled smartphone
   applications. Alternative technologies, such as interactive voice
   response and mobile-based websites, can also provide this information.
   Currently, the extent of communication technology use by transit riders
   is largely unknown. Paired with an investigation of cellular phone use
   by transit riders and the general American population, an analysis of
   Saint Louis, Missouri, Metro's onboard survey data was conducted to
   examine riders' communication technology use and to determine how this
   use may affect rider experience and ridership-generating potential.
   Additional analyses identified specific demographic groups that would
   benefit from supplemental technology methods more conducive to their
   particular information accessibility. Results showed that communication
   technology use had risen substantially in recent years and that Metro
   riders who used smartphones or text messaging reported significantly
   higher levels of satisfaction with service factors, such as the ability
   to make transfer connections and personal security at transit centers.
   Specific demographic groups (e.g., riders older than 40 years of age)
   were less likely to own smartphones, and therefore computer-based
   websites and interactive voice responses might be the best supplementary
   alternatives for those groups. The current study emphasizes the growing
   need for RTI applications in the transit industry and suggests that
   development of enhanced communication methodologies can positively
   affect the rider experience. Furthermore, differences in individual
   technology accessibility call for RTI application development that
   mirrors the unique characteristics of its ridership.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between nanoparticles (NPs) and DNA plays an important
   role in the genotoxicity of NPs, and it is imperative to characterize
   the nano/DNA interactions and explore the underlying chemical
   mechanisms. In this chapter, we demonstrated systematic experimental
   approaches based on atomic force microscope (AFM), coupled with modeling
   computation to probe the binding activity of NPs with DNA and the
   putative genotoxicity. Using quantum dots (QDs) as a model NP, we
   examined the binding kinetics, binding isotherm, binding specificity,
   and binding mechanisms of NPs to DNA with the application of AFM. We
   further assessed the binding affinity between NPs and DNA by calculating
   their interaction energy on the basis of
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) models. The modeling results of
   binding affinity were validated by the NPs/DNA binding images
   experimentally derived by AFM. The investigation of the relationship
   between the binding affinity of five NPs ((QDs (+), QDs (-), silver NPs,
   hematite NPs, and gold NPs) for DNA with their inhibition effects on DNA
   replication indicated that NPs with a high binding affinity for DNA
   molecules exhibited higher inhibition on DNA replication. The
   methodology employed in this study can be extended to study the
   interaction of other NPs with DNA, which is anticipated to benefit the
   future design of safe NPs, as well as the toxicological investigations
   of NPs.}},

Abstract = {{As an important factor for long-term jitter in clock synthesis and
   distribution, reference spurs result from circuit mismatch and nonlinear
   effects that induce periodic perturbations in phase-locked loops (PLLs).
   In this paper, a PLL with built-in static phase offset (SPO) detector
   and charge pump current trimming for self-calibration circuits is
   proposed. By adjusting the charge pump current ratio determined by an
   SPO detector, minimum and maximum improvements of 12dB and 22.99dB in
   reference spur suppression can be achieved. The best improvement reduces
   the integrated jitter by 10\% over a 10kHz to 10MHz bandwidth. The
   technique is demonstrated for a PLL output frequency from 400 MHz to 1
   GHz. The ring oscillator based PLL is designed with 200 KHz bandwidth
   and 70 degree phase margin. Measurement results from chips across
   different corners are provided to verify the calibration technique.}},

Abstract = {{Decision makers are often required to make decisions with incomplete
   information. In order to design decision support systems (DSSs) to
   assist decision makers in these situations, it is essential to
   understand why and how decision makers select their strategies. This
   paper presents a simulation which examines the impact of incomplete
   information on the effort and accuracy of decision strategies. The
   current study evaluates two strategies: a normative-rational strategy
   (multi-attribute utility theory, MAUT) and a psychological heuristic
   (take-the-best, TTB). Under conditions of full (i. e., complete)
   information, the simulation is able to replicate previous studies
   showing that psychological heuristics perform as well as
   normative-rational methods with lower effort requirements. Under
   conditions of incomplete information, the simulation showed that
   psychological heuristics retain their high accuracy with low effort
   whereas the normative-rational strategies decrease in accuracy and still
   require high effort. Since decision makers' strategy selection is known
   to be contingent upon many decision scenario contexts such as
   information availability, this simulation study provides direct links as
   to how decision making strategies are affected by different levels of
   information availability -supporting and expanding upon prior empirical
   and simulation studies.}},

   data, predicting probable future locations, and repositioning sensors or
   retargeting requests for information in order to reacquire the vehicle.
   An overview of the envisioned system is described that includes image
   processing algorithms to detect and recapture the vehicle from live
   image data, a computational framework to predict probable vehicle
   locations at future points in time, and a power aware data distribution
   management system to disseminate data and requests for information over

   other two were alumina brazed to copper (Samples 3 \& 4). The filler
   metal composition for each sample was as follows: Sample 1 consisted of
   Cu-96\%, and Ti-4\%; Sample 2 consisted of Ag-70\%, Cu-26\%, and Ti-4\%;
   Sample 3 consisted of Cu-85\%, Ti-10\%, and Co-5\%; and Sample 4
   consisted of Cu-55\%, Ti-40\%, and Co-5\%. The phase transformations

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease, affecting
   over 33\% of people over 65 years old. The patho-physiology of OA is
   complex and manifested by changes at the molecular, cellular, and tissue
   levels. High resolution, three-dimensional (3D) imaging methods provide
   the opportunity to quantitatively assess changes in the morphology and
   composition of multiple articular joint tissues in small animal models.
   Two of the main imaging modalities used in research to examine articular
   tissue changes are magnetic resonance imaging MRI and micro-computed
   tomography (mu CT). MRI is the clinical gold standard for assessment of
   joint inflammation and damage associated with arthritis. mu CT imaging,
   which relies on a material's ability to attenuate X-rays, provides very
   high resolution 3D images and increased contrast between bone and soft
   tissue. This chapter explains in detail the uses and limitations of MRI
   and mu CT with respect to imaging cartilage in OA. Other imaging
   modalities, such as ultrasound imaging, vascular imaging, reactive
   oxygen species imaging, two-photon laser scanning microscopy and atomic
   force microscopy, are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect and dispose of buried mines requires effective
   means by which to discriminate between hazardous targets and benign
   clutter. In that regard, wide-band electromagnetic induction (EMI)
   sensors have shown significant promise in their ability to classify
   buried metallic objects based on their response to illumination by a
   time-varying magnetic field. A target's scattered response may be
   expressed compactly in its magnetic polarizability dyadic, a form that
   describes the reaction of the scatterer to an arbitrary magnetic field.
   More specifically, a singularity expansion of the polarizability dyadic
   has been shown to allow for robust target discrimination. Eddy currents
   in a 2D surface may be expressed using a scalar stream function, an
   approach which is powerful since the solenoidality of the current
   density is enforced trivially. Using this formulation, it is possible to
   arrive at a modal eigenvalue expansion for the magnetic polarizability
   that is in the form of the singularity expansion.}},

   This placement is desirable for packaging reasons, but it makes
   achieving minimal mutual coupling between the two coils difficult. An

   for both minimum mutual coupling and maximum on-axis sensitivity is
   demonstrated, and then this procedure is used to create a pair of
   double-sided, non-uniformly wound spiral coils, which improve upon
   previous coils by making the transmit coil resistance uniform. The
   effects of capacitive loading within the coils are explored, and results

Abstract = {{A broadband arbitrary polarization antenna system for ground penetrating
   radar applications is modified to improve its performance. The antenna
   system uses four, crossed, resistive-vee dipole (RVD) antennas operating
   bistaticly to measure the simultaneous transmission and reception of
   multiple polarizations. The RVD has low self clutter, low radar cross
   section and wideband performance. The RVD is a linearly polarized
   antenna, but other polarizations can he synthesized through the use of
   two orthogonal RVDs to transmit or receive orthogonal field components.
   The antenna system is able to distinguish rotationally symmetric and
   linear targets with its ability to transmit and receive both senses of
   circular polarization. For example, linear targets such as wires or
   pipes can be identified by even scattering of both senses of circular
   polarization. The RVDs in the previous RVD-based CP (circularly
   polarized) antenna were not designed for CP synthesis. The shape and
   resistive profile of the FWD were modified to improve dual CP
   performance. The design of the FWD was optimized through simulation to
   improve CP synthesis and forward gain, while maintaining low self
   clutter, low radar cross section, and wide bandwidth. Additional
   simulations demonstrate that the improvements to the FWD may help to
   correctly discriminate targets based on their geometries.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL}},

Volume = {{87}},

Pages = {{2383-2397}},
Abstract = {{Although adaptive control theory offers mathematical tools to achieve
   system performance without excessive reliance on dynamical system
   models, its applications to safety-critical systems can be limited due
   to poor transient performance and robustness. In this paper, we develop
   an adaptive control architecture to achieve stabilisation and command
   following of uncertain dynamical systems with improved transient
   performance. Our framework consists of a new reference system and an
   adaptive controller. The proposed reference system captures a desired
   closed-loop dynamical system behaviour modified by a mismatch term
   representing the high-frequency content between the uncertain dynamical
   system and this reference system, i.e., the system error. In particular,
   this mismatch term allows the frequency content of the system error
   dynamics to be limited, which is used to drive the adaptive controller.
   It is shown that this key feature of our framework yields fast
   adaptation without incurring high-frequency oscillations in the
   transient performance. We further show the effects of design parameters
   on the system performance, analyse closeness of the uncertain dynamical
   system to the unmodified (ideal) reference system, discuss robustness of
   the proposed approach with respect to time-varying uncertainties and
   disturbances, and make connections to gradient minimisation and
   classical control theory. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate
   the efficacy of the proposed architecture.}},

   2-chloropyridine) with phenylboronic acid using Pd(TPP)(2)Cl-2/K3PO4 in
   acetonitrile-water biphasic solvent systems under a CO2 or a N-2
   atmosphere is discussed. It was observed that 2-halo-4-aminopyridine
   produced quantitative yields of coupled products under a CO2 atmosphere
   while the yields for the 2-halopyridines were poor. In contrast, the
   yields of coupled products for the 2-halopyridines substrates were
   quantitative under a N-2 atmosphere while only poor yields were realized
   for the 2-halo-4-aminopyridines under the same conditions. Evidence is
   presented which suggests that the presence of CO2 alters the pH of the
   aqueous phase of the reaction system and the accompanying efficiency of
   the coupling process. Using a series of buffers to adjust the pH of the
   aqueous phase, the pH dependence associated with the efficiency of the
   coupling process is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the development of a two-moment cloud microphysics
   scheme within version 5 of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System
   (GEOS-5). The scheme includes the implementation of a comprehensive
   stratiform microphysics module, a new cloud coverage scheme that allows
   ice supersaturation, and a new microphysics module embedded within the
   moist convection parameterization of GEOS-5. Comprehensive physically
   based descriptions of ice nucleation, including homogeneous and
   heterogeneous freezing, and liquid droplet activation are implemented to
   describe the formation of cloud particles in stratiform clouds and
   convective cumulus. The effect of preexisting ice crystals on the
   formation of cirrus clouds is also accounted for. A new parameterization
   of the subgrid-scale vertical velocity distribution accounting for
   turbulence and gravity wave motion is also implemented. The new
   microphysics significantly improves the representation of liquid water
   and ice in GEOS-5. Evaluation of the model against satellite retrievals
   and in situ observations shows agreement of the simulated droplet and
   ice crystal effective radius, the ice mass mixing ratio and number
   concentration, and the relative humidity with respect to ice. When using
   the new microphysics, the fraction of condensate that remains as liquid
   follows a sigmoidal dependency with temperature, which is in agreement
   with observations and which fundamentally differs from the linear
   increase assumed in most models. The performance of the new microphysics
   in reproducing the observed total cloud fraction, longwave and shortwave
   cloud forcing, and total precipitation is similar to the operational
   version of GEOS-5 and in agreement with satellite retrievals. The new
   microphysics tends to underestimate the coverage of persistent low-level
   stratocumulus. Sensitivity studies showed that the simulated cloud
   properties are robust to moderate variation in cloud microphysical
   parameters. Significant sensitivity remains to variation in the
   dispersion of the ice crystal size distribution and the critical size
   for ice autoconversion. Despite these issues, the implementation of the
   new microphysics leads to a considerably improved and more realistic
   representation of cloud processes in GEOS-5, and allows the linkage of
   cloud properties to aerosol emissions.}},

Pages = {{2044-2055}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a sliding mode control architecture to control
   lung volume and minute ventilation in the presence of modelling system
   uncertainties. Since the applied input pressure to the lungs is, in
   general, nonnegative and cannot be arbitrarily large, as not to damage
   the lungs, a sliding mode control with bounded nonnegative control
   inputs is proposed. The controller only uses output information (i. e.,
   the total volume of the lungs) and automatically adjusts the applied
   input pressure so that the system is able to track a given reference
   signal in the presence of parameter uncertainty (i. e., modelling
   uncertainty of the lung resistances and lung compliances) and system
   disturbances. Controllers for both matched and unmatched uncertainties
   are presented. Specifically, a Lyapunov-based approach is presented for
   the stability analysis of the system and the proposed control framework
   is applied to a two-compartment lung model to show the efficacy of the
   proposed control method.}},

Title = {{Effects of MnSO4 on microstructure and electrical resistance properties
   of electroless Ni-P thin-films and its application in embedded resistor
   inside PCB}},
Journal = {{CIRCUIT WORLD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{45-52}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Nickel phosphorus (Ni-P) thin-films have been electrolessly
   deposited in an acid-plating bath with the addition of manganese sulfate
   monohydrate (MSM) to achieve higher resistance for the application of
   embedded resistor with value beyond 10 K Omega. As this material is
   being used for fabricating embedded resistors under the addition of MSM,
   its resistance properties including effects of MSM concentration and
   plating time on resistances, temperature coefficient of resistance
   (TCR), and resistance tolerance of embedded resistor were investigated.
   The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The structure of fabricated Ni-P film was
   detected by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). The properties of substrate, including the
   surface morphologies, glass transition process and boundary of copper
   pad and substrate surface, were performed by SEM, dynamic mechanical
   analysis and optical microscope, respectively. The resistance tolerances
   of embedded resistors were elaborated from the cases of Ni-P thin-film
   resistance tolerance and the size effects of resistors, respectively.
   Findings - The fabricated film was found to be constructed with numerous
   Ni-P amorphous nanoparticles, which was believed to be the reason of
   increasing thin-film resistance. The Ni-P thin-films presented over one
   magnitude order of resistance increasing in the case of MSM
   concentration varied from 0 to 40 g/L. For the case of TCRs, Ni-P
   thin-films deposited with 20 g/L MSM exhibited low TCRs of within +/-
   100 ppm/degrees C Before TR at temperature elevating from 40 to 160
   degrees C, indicating that this Ni-P thin-film belongs to the constant
   TCR materials according to the military standard. For the tolerance of
   embedded resistor, the tolerance contributed by Ni-P thin-film was
   obtained to be 9.8 percent, whereas the geometry tolerances were in the
   range of 0-20 percent according to the geometries of embedded resistor.
   Originality/value - For Ni-P thin-film without MSM, its low resistance
   with around 100 ohm/sq. limit the values of resistor few KV and
   restricted its widespread application of embedded resistor with higher
   resistance beyond 10 K Omega. The authors introduced MnSO4 in Ni-P
   electroless plating process to improve the low resistance of Ni-P
   thin-film. The resistance was increased over one order of magnitude
   after added with 40 g/L MnSO4. Due to the specific structure, as this
   material is being used for fabricating embedded resistors, the
   electrical properties and its application properties to verify its
   appliance in embedded resistor were systematically investigated by means
   of SEM, TEM, XRD characterizations, TCRs, resistance tolerance analysis,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Examples of blends of carbazole- and bis(oxadiazole) benzene-based
   side-chain polymers have recently been reported to be efficient host
   materials for phosphorescent emitters in organic light-emitting diodes.
   Here, the properties and performance of a physical blend of

   benzene side chains are compared to those of random and block copolymers
   of the corresponding triscarbazole- and

   in which the blend is used a host for Ir(ppy)(3) are significantly more
   efficient than those based on copolymers. Differential scanning
   calorimetry and solid-state NMR data show that there is no macroscale
   separation between the two polymers in the blend. The NMR data suggest
   that there are significant differences in the dimensionality and
   characteristic length of nanoscale domain structures in the block
   copolymer and the blend. Use of Ir(pppy)(3) in place of Ir(ppy)(3) leads
   to even more efficient light-emitting diodes, with external quantum

   N,N'-dihexyl-5,5',6,6'-tetracyanoisoindigo, and
   N,N'-dihexyl-5,5',6,6'-tetracyanothienoisoindigo have been synthesised
   in moderate yields by the reaction of corresponding di and tetrabromo
   species with CuCN, with microwave heating leading to higher yields and
   fewer side products for the tetrasubstituted species. Di- and tetracyano
   substitution anodically shifts the molecular reduction potential
   relative to the unsubstituted cores by ca. 0.4 and 0.8 V, respectively,
   with the resultant values for the tetracyano derivatives (-0.58 to -0.67
   V vs. FeCp2+/0) suggesting the possibility of air-stable electron
   transport. All the synthesised cyano derivatives operate in n-channel
   OFETs, while the tetrabromothienoisoindigo derivative functions in a
   p-channel transistor. The tetracyanothienoisoindigo derivative exhibits
   the highest field-effect electron mobility values - up to 0.04 and 0.09
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in spin-coated and inkjet-printed devices respectively -
   and OFETs incorporating this compound have been shown to operate in air

Abstract = {{This experimental study is conducted as a part of a Department of Energy
   funded SunShot project titled ``High Temperature Falling Particle
   Receiver{''}. In this concept, solid particles are heated by
   concentrated sunlight to very high temperatures to the point that they
   can become a suitable heat source for various thermal power and
   thermochemical cycles. Furthermore, one of the great advantages of this
   concept is the ability to store thermal energy in the solid particles at
   relatively low cost. However, an important feature of any Particle Heat
   Receiver (PHR) system is the particle to fluid heat exchanger (PFHXer),
   which is the interface between the solar energy system and the thermal
   power or chemical system. In order to create this system material data
   is needed for the design and optimization of this PFHXer.
   This study focuses on the heat transfer properties of particulates to
   solid surfaces. The particulates will be evaluated for three grain sizes
   of sand and two grain sizes of proppants. These two materials will be
   tested at one, five and ten millimetres per second in order to see how
   the various flow rates, which will be required for different loads, will
   affect the heat transfer coefficient. Finally the heat transfer
   coefficient will also be evaluated for both finned and non-finned heat
   exchangers to see the effect that changes in the surface geometry and
   surface area have on the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer
   coefficient will help determine the appropriate material that will be
   used in the PHR system.
   An experimental procedure is under development by Georgia Institute of
   Technology to examine the heat transfer coefficient. To accurately
   characterize the size distribution of the materials, the material will
   be placed through a sifting unit. Afterwards the material will be placed
   into the testing apparatus. The main components of the testing apparatus
   consist of the Old's Elevator which is used to move the sand and the
   PFHXer. The PFHXer is made up of the constant head plenum and the
   heating box. The constant head plenum allows for a constant particulate
   head and uniform flow. The heating unit is made up of eight electric
   cartridge heaters. These heaters act as the non-finned tubed heaters and
   through the use of a metal casing can also be changed into finned tubed
   heaters. By running the system to steady and state and measuring the
   surface, inlet and outlet temperatures the heat transfer coefficient can
   be calculated. (C) 2013 C. Nguyen. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{68}},
Pages = {{35852-35861}},
Abstract = {{We use density functional theory and the atomistic Green's function
   method (AGF) to study the effect of bonding on phonon transmission and
   thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at the interface of metals (Au, Cu,
   and Ti) and single layer graphene (SLG)/multi-layer graphene (MLG). Our
   analysis shows that the TBC across Ti/SLG/Ti interfaces (similar to 500
   MW m(-2) K-1) is significantly larger than the TBC across Cu/SLG/Cu
   (similar to 10 MW m(-2) K-1) and Au/SLG/Au (similar to 7 MW m(-2) K-1)
   interfaces. However, the TBC across Ti/MLG/Ti (similar to 40 MW m(-2)
   K-1) is an order of magnitude lower compared to TBC at the Ti/SLG/Ti
   interface, whereas the TBC at Cu/MLG/Cu and Au/MLG/Au interfaces are
   similar to those of Cu/SLG/Cu and Au/SLG/Au, respectively. We find that
   this substantial decrease in TBC at the Ti/MLG/Ti interface is a result
   of phonon mismatch between the graphene layer bonded to Ti and the
   non-bonded graphene layers. The effect of number of graphene layers on
   TBC at Cu/MLG/Cu and Au/MLG/Au interfaces is relatively insignificant
   because of the weak interactions at these metal/graphene interfaces. It
   was observed that the moderate attenuation of Ti/C bonding strength can
   enhance the phonon coupling between the graphene layers bonded to Ti and
   non-bonded graphene layers, and can increase the TBC across Ti/MLG/Ti by
   similar to 100\%. This impact of interfacial bonding strength on TBC at
   metal/MLG interfaces, predicted by AGF calculations, is further
   confirmed by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations which show
   the transition of thermal transport mechanism from metal/graphene
   dominated resistance to graphene/graphene dominated resistance as the
   metal/graphene bonding strength increases in the metal/MLG/metal
   structure.}},

   Transit Time on Logistics Costs}},

Pages = {{63-73}},
Abstract = {{This paper shows that ignoring bimodality and lognormality in transit
   time distributions can cause large increases in the logistic costs of
   maritime transportation. Bimodal and lognormal transit time
   distributions are observed to be of moderate frequency (approximately
   17\%) but high impact in the volume of shipment carried (approximately
   85\%) in these lanes. Ignoring and assuming incorrect distribution of
   transit time can have dramatic implications on the safety stock levels
   and reorder points and hence inventory cost incurred by the shipper. To
   display the incorrectness of such assumptions, the paper compares the
   typical approach of using a deterministic value (Case 1) for transit
   time and Hadley-Whitin (1963) with normal approximation (Case 2) to the
   authors' simulation and empirical analysis on bimodal and lognormal
   transit time distributions (Case 3). This paper further explores how the
   shipper should optimally manage inventory in the parameters of transit
   time distribution and critical ratio (or the service level of the
   shipper). Specifically, different regions are defined by the transit
   time distribution parameters and critical ratios that determine the
   magnitude of relative cost differences when the three cases are
   compared.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new transformative manufacturing methodology for
   free-form machining. An experimental prototype machine is constructed to
   levitate and rotate an object attached with sharp edges, which act as a
   cutter for the purpose of performing machining processes. This device
   aims to lead to a technological breakthrough, overcoming the limitation
   of the workpiece features, and achieve greater free-form machining
   capability. The construction of curved holes and interior surfaces are
   constrained by the geometry of the machine tool. The proposed concept
   creates a new device that uses a magnetic field generator as a base. It
   is loaded with a constant power imposing a vertical physical force to
   balance gravity and stabilize the cutting tool. With the uniqueness of a
   preferred orientation between the tool and the base, a rotating surface
   placed below the base permits the rotation of the cutting tool in order
   to achieve desired tool rotation speed. A smooth and controlled cut is
   achieved on a soft material. The result shows the feasibility of the
   device to achieve similar outcomes as a machine tool.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals who have impairments in their motor skills typically engage
   in rehabilitation protocols to improve the recovery of their motor
   functions. In general, engaging in physical therapy can be tedious and
   difficult, which can result in demotivating the individual. This is
   especially true for children who are more susceptible to frustration.
   Thus, different virtual reality environments and play therapy systems
   have been developed with the goal of increasing the motivation of
   individuals engaged in physical therapy. However, although previously
   developed systems have proven to be effective for the general
   population, the majority of these systems are not focused on engaging
   children. Given this motivation, we discuss two technologies that have
   been shown to positively engage children who are undergoing physical
   therapy. The first is called the Super Pop VR (TM) game; a virtual
   reality environment that not only increases the child's motivation to
   continue with his/her therapy exercises, but also provides feedback and
   tracking of patient performance during game play. The second technology
   integrates robotics into the virtual gaming scenario through social
   engagement in order to further maintain the child's attention when
   engaged with the system. Results from preliminary studies with
   typically-developing children have shown their effectiveness. In this
   chapter, we discuss the functions and advantages of these technologies,
   and their potential for being integrated into the child's intervention
   protocol.}},

Title = {{Incorporation of advanced aerosol activation treatments into CESM/CAM5:
   model evaluation and impacts on aerosol indirect effects}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{7485-7497}},
Abstract = {{One of the greatest sources of uncertainty in the science of
   anthropogenic climate change is from aerosol-cloud interactions. The
   activation of aerosols into cloud droplets is a direct microphysical
   linkage between aerosols and clouds; parameterizations of this process
   link aerosol with cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and the resulting
   indirect effects. Small differences between parameterizations can have a
   large impact on the spatiotemporal distributions of activated aerosols
   and the resulting cloud properties. In this work, we incorporate a
   series of aerosol activation schemes into the Community Atmosphere Model
   version 5.1.1 within the Community Earth System Model version 1.0.5
   (CESM/CAM5) which include factors such as insoluble aerosol adsorption
   and giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation kinetics to
   understand their individual impacts on global-scale cloud droplet number
   concentration (CDNC). Compared to the existing activation scheme in
   CESM/CAM5, this series of activation schemes increase the computation
   time by similar to 10\% but leads to predicted CDNC in better agreement
   with satellite-derived/in situ values in many regions with high CDNC but
   in worse agreement for some regions with low CDNC. Large percentage
   changes in predicted CDNC occur over desert and oceanic regions, owing
   to the enhanced activation of dust from insoluble aerosol adsorption and
   reduced activation of sea spray aerosol after accounting for giant CCN
   activation kinetics. Comparison of CESM/CAM5 predictions against
   satellite-derived cloud optical thickness and liquid water path shows
   that the up-dated activation schemes generally improve the low biases.
   Globally, the incorporation of all updated schemes leads to an average
   increase in column CDNC of 150\% and an increase (more negative) in
   shortwave cloud forcing of 12 \%. With the improvement of
   model-predicted CDNCs and better agreement with most satellite-derived
   cloud properties in many regions, the inclusion of these aerosol
   activation processes should result in better predictions of radiative
   forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic responses of liquid oxygen (LOX) droplet vaporization and
   combustion to externally imposed pressure oscillations in high-pressure
   hydrogen and water environments are studied systematically. Both
   subcritical and supercritical conditions are considered, under a broad
   range of pressures at 10-200 atm. A unified treatment of general fluid
   thermodynamics and a self-consistent numerical method are developed to
   treat the droplet behaviors over the entire fluid thermodynamic regime.
   Results are correlated with the instantaneous value of the liquid-phase
   thermal diffusion time normalized by the oscillation frequency,
   fR(2)/alpha(l). The magnitudes of the vaporization and combustion
   response functions increase with increasing ambient pressure. The
   magnitude of the combustion response function is much smaller than its
   corresponding gasification response due to the damping effect associated
   with vapor accumulation near the droplet surface. Significant difference
   exists between hydrogen/oxygen and hydrocarbon/air systems in terms of
   the cut-off and resonant values in the characteristic frequency

   Multiple-Input-Single-Output Links}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Cooperative transmission (CT) is an effective technique to achieve
   spatial diversity in fading environments, where spatially separated
   wireless nodes collaborate to form a virtual antenna array or virtual
   multiple-input-multiple-output (VMISO) link. Many authors model the path
   loss of the VMISO link as though the elements in the virtual antenna
   array are colocated, even though they are spread out. In this paper, we
   show that the spreading causes a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) penalty of
   up to 3 dB. Moreover, in the high SNR regime, we show that the
   performance degradation caused by the path-loss disparity can be
   characterized equivalently by log-normal distribution. We use these two
   observations to propose a new CT link model, expressed in closed form as
   an outage probability based on the log-normal shadowing model. The
   quality of the model is evaluated by a statistical test based on
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov method.}},

Title = {{Effect of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metal Salts on Suppression of
   Lithium Dendrites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{D418-D424}},
Abstract = {{Lithium dendrites are needle-like structures that form during the
   electrodeposition of lithium metal. These whiskers complicate the use of
   lithium metal as an anode in lithium batteries because they can puncture
   the separator and short circuit the battery. In addition, the large
   surface area and poor adhesion of the deposit contributes to loss of
   coulombic efficiency. The effect of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions
   on the morphology of electrodeposited lithium metal has been studied.
   Varying concentrations of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions were
   added to a 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)
   trimethylbutylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (N-1114-TFSI)
   electrolyte. Lithium metal was electrodeposited from each electrolyte
   and examined ex-situ by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Alkali metal
   ions, with the exception of sodium, had little or no effect on the
   deposited lithium morphology. However, alkaline earth metal ions at 0.05
   M concentration significantly reduced the occurrence of dendrites. When
   the concentration of the alkaline earth metal ions was increased to 0.1
   M, dendrites were completely eliminated and lithium was deposited in a
   sphere-like morphology. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
   showed that no alkaline earth metals were found in the sphere-like
   deposits, suggesting that dendrite mitigation occurred through an
   adsorption mechanism. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All

Title = {{Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids
   Mixed with Carbon Nanotubes: A Spectroscopic Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{H481-H486}},
Abstract = {{We studied imidazolium-based ionic liquids mixed with multiwall carbon
   nanotubes using impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance.
   The results show a percolation threshold below 1 wt\% of carbon
   nanotubes, which, due to their high dispersibility in imidazolium-based
   ionic liquids, is 3- to 8-fold lower than the percolation threshold for
   carbon nanotubes in typical organic solvents. The addition of carbon
   nanotubes appears to polarize their interface with imidazolium-based
   ionic liquids and increases the diffusion coefficient of the anions up
   to 35\%, which is likely due to weak van der Waals interactions between
   the carbon nanotube walls and the cations. These effects produce a 3- to
   5-fold increase in electrical conductivity of the electrolyte mixture,
   at carbon nanotube concentrations that are under the threshold for
   percolation. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS: This is an

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{1183}},
Pages = {{327-354}},
Abstract = {{The injection of computer-simulated conductances through the dynamic
   clamp technique has allowed researchers to probe the intercellular and
   intracellular dynamics of cardiac and neuronal systems with great
   precision. By coupling computational models to biological systems,
   dynamic clamp has become a proven tool in electrophysiology with many
   applications, such as generating hybrid networks in neurons or
   simulating channelopathies in cardiomyocytes. While its applications are
   broad, the approach is straightforward: synthesizing traditional patch
   clamp, computational modeling, and closed-loop feedback control to
   simulate a cellular conductance. Here, we present two example
   applications: artificial blocking of the inward rectifier potassium
   current in a cardiomyocyte and coupling of a biological neuron to a
   virtual neuron through a virtual synapse. The design and implementation
   of the necessary software to administer these dynamic clamp experiments
   can be difficult. In this chapter, we provide an overview of designing
   and implementing a dynamic clamp experiment using the Real-Time
   eXperiment Interface (RTXI), an open-source software system tailored for
   real-time biological experiments. We present two ways to achieve this
   using RTXI's modular format, through the creation of a custom user-made
   module and through existing modules found in RTXI's online library.}},

Title = {{Intercomparison of an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) with
   ambient fine aerosol measurements in downtown Atlanta, Georgia}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1929-1941}},
Abstract = {{Currently, there are a limited number of field studies that evaluate the
   long-term performance of the Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation
   Monitor (ACSM) against established monitoring networks. In this study,
   we present seasonal intercomparisons of the ACSM with collocated fine
   aerosol (PM2.5) measurements at the Southeastern Aerosol Research and
   Characterization (SEARCH) Jefferson Street (JST) site near downtown
   Atlanta, GA, during 2011-2012. Intercomparison of two collocated ACSMs
   resulted in strong correlations (r(2) > 0.8) for all chemical species,
   except chloride (r(2) = 0.21) indicating that ACSM instruments are
   capable of stable and reproducible operation. In general, speciated ACSM
   mass concentrations correlate well (r(2) > 0.7) with the filter-adjusted
   continuous measurements from JST, although the correlation for nitrate
   is weaker (r(2) = 0.55) in summer. Correlations of the ACSM NR-PM1
   (non-refractory particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than
   or equal to 1 m) plus elemental carbon (EC) with tapered element
   oscillating microbalance (TEOM) PM2.5 and Federal Reference Method (FRM)
   PM1 mass are strong with r(2) > 0.7 and r(2) > 0.8, respectively.
   Discrepancies might be attributed to evaporative losses of semi-volatile
   species from the filter measurements used to adjust the collocated
   continuous measurements. This suggests that adjusting the ambient
   aerosol continuous measurements with results from filter analysis
   introduced additional bias to the measurements. We also recommend to
   calibrate the ambient aerosol monitoring instruments using aerosol
   standards rather than gas-phase standards. The fitting approach for ACSM
   relative ionization for sulfate was shown to improve the comparisons
   between ACSM and collocated measurements in the absence of calibrated
   values, suggesting the importance of adding sulfate calibration into the
   ACSM calibration routine.}},

Abstract = {{Population increase and socio-economic mobility has escalated the water
   demand for various purposes and has put stress on existing water
   resources across the world, in particular in arid and semi-arid regions.
   Hence, managing the optimum use of water resources is a crucial issue

   more efficiently in various sectors. This chapter presents an
   optimization analysis to determine monthly operating rules for the
   Doroudzan Reservoir located in southern Iran. Different strategies under
   limited water availability conditions have been analyzed by running an
   optimization model based on observed and synthetic inflow data, and the
   performance indicators of each strategy are presented. Each strategy
   includes a minimum requirement release in the optimization process and
   results in a specific operation policy. In this study, LINGO is applied
   to determine optimum operational parameters and the synthetic inflows
   are generated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The results
   demonstrated that the applied methods could efficiently optimize the
   current operational policy of an existing reservoir in a

   irradiation of low pressure mercury lamp (lambda = 254 nm, 12 W). The
   photodegradation rate of TCNM was found to increase with increasing the
   concentration of nitrate ions, chloride ions, humic acid, pH, and light
   intensity. The photodegradation of TCNM was examined at pH 6.0 with
   initial concentrations (C-0) of TCNM at 10.0-200.0 mu g/L. The overall
   rate of degradation of TCNM was modeled using a pseudofirst-order rate
   law. Finally, the proposed mechanism involved in the photodegradation of
   TCNM was also discussed by analysis. Results of this study can
   contribute to the development of new source control strategies for

Abstract = {{Controversial discussions on causality have been present in ancient
   philosophy since the days of Aristotle. Despite the use of this concept
   in numerous subjects, there is no consensus on the definition of
   causality and its possible mathematization. Many authors have analyzed
   the relation between causes and effects; the predominant school of
   thought reduces causation to a physical relation (either deterministic
   or probabilistic) between two events. The distinction between causes and
   consequences is not always clear and meaningful as different ``layers of
   understanding{''} may be applied to the notion of causality. From this
   point of view the cause-effect implication relation can be thought of as
   a first level representation of causation. By ``double-clicking{''} the
   link between events, the in-depth layers of causality surface, allowing
   a better comprehension and distinction of the causality nature. It is
   then important to understand how causality can be incorporated in an
   accident model. Several accident models have been recently employed to
   interpret different contributing factors to an adverse event and to help
   improve our chances on accident prevention. However, accident models do
   not focus on the nature of the causal relationship. The causal
   relationship is always limited to `` cause(s) imply effect(s){''}, but
   it is never analyzed as to understand the mechanism that lead to such
   implication. Our language in itself is limited in the ways of describing
   causal relationships. We will see how the application of the effective
   metaphor of Agonist and Antagonist actions from the Force Dynamics
   framework will help analyzing the roles of different actors along the
   chain of causation. The use of this metaphor, enhanced by the
   introduction of the Inverse Agonist concept, will provide new insights
   on the interactions among those actors and will yield the insightful
   idea of primitives of causality. These primitives will be primal and
   fundamental notions at the base of a more general concept of causation.
   We illustrate the use of primitives of causality through an accident
   example, and we highlight the absence of relevant antagonist and inverse
   agonist actions that failed to block and de-escalate the accident
   sequence respectively. We argue that the primitives of causality here
   introduced allow a deeper understanding of causal mechanisms involved in
   system accidents and provide a richer basis for conceiving and
   articulating accident prevention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Defense-in-depth has been a hallmark of safety studies for over fifty
   years. Recognized under various names across different industries, it is
   considered a general strategy or philosophy for achieving system safety
   in complex systems. In this work a novel safety strategy, termed
   observability-in-depth, is introduced as an essential complement to
   defense-in-depth, specifically addressing two common criticisms moved to
   defense-in-depth, namely: 1) that it can render systems more opaque to
   those who manage/operate them, leaving them blind to the possibility of
   hazard escalation; 2) that weaknesses in the barriers will always exist,
   or that the barriers cannot be made extensive enough to cover every
   possible accident trajectory (leading to the inability to a
   defense-in-breadth safety strategy in practice). Observability-in-depth
   can be thought of as the set of provisions designed into the system and
   its operation, which enables real-time monitoring and identification of
   hazardous states and accident pathogens, as well as lurking adverse
   conditions before they have an opportunity to manifest themselves. The
   ``depth{''} qualifier of observability has a causal and temporal
   dimension, as it characterizes the ability to identify adverse states
   and conditions as far upstream as possible in an accident sequence. In
   this paper we develop various aspects of observability-in-depth,
   including a formal mathematical definition, and we examine its relevance
   as a connection between different safety communities. We then argue that
   observability-in-depth provides an opportunity to conceive of a dynamic
   defense-in-depth safety strategy in which defensive resources, safety
   barriers and others, are prioritized and allocated dynamically in
   response to emerging of risks, as well as real-time monitoring and
   identifications of adverse conditions. We believe that the concept of
   observability-in-depth can help expand the intellectual toolkit of
   safety practitioners and researchers, and that these concepts offer a
   rich basis and many fruitful venues for further research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents analytical modeling and case studies of broadband
   and band-limited random vibration energy harvesting using a piezoceramic
   patch attached on a thin plate. The literature of vibration-based energy
   harvesting has been mostly focused on resonant cantilevered structures.
   However, cantilevered beam-type harvesters have limited broadband
   vibration energy harvesting capabilities unless they are combined with a
   nonlinear component. Moreover, cantilever arrangements cannot always be
   mounted on thin structures (which are basic components of marine,
   aerospace, and ground transportation systems) without significantly
   affecting the host system's design and overall dynamics. A patch-based
   piezoelectric energy harvester structurally integrated to a thin plate
   can be a proper alternative to using resonant cantilevers for harvesting
   energy from thin structures. Besides, plate-like structures have more
   number of vibration modes compared to beam structures, offering better
   broadband performance characteristics. In this paper, we present
   analytical modelling of patch-based piezoelectric energy harvester
   attached on a thin plate for random vibrations. The analytical model is
   based on electromechanically-coupled distributed-parameter formulation
   and validated by comparing the electromechanical frequency response
   functions (FRFs) with experimental results. Example case studies are

Abstract = {{Negative capacitance shunt damping is an effective broadband method for
   attenuating flexural vibration. However, proper selection of the
   location of the piezoelectric patches on a structure to maximize
   reduction has been an ongoing question in the field. Acoustic black
   holes are a recently developed concept to reduce vibrations on thin
   vibrating structures. By engineering the geometric or material
   properties of these thin structures, it is possible to minimize the
   reflected wave by gradually reducing the wave speed. However, the
   flexural wave speed cannot be reduced to zero on a realized structure.
   Therefore, when acoustic black holes are implemented, some of the
   incident wave energy is reflected because the wave speed must be
   truncated. Similarly due to the reduction in wave speed, the transverse
   velocity significantly increases within the acoustic black hole. It is
   therefore possible to add piezoelectric transducers to acoustic black
   hole regions on a structure to utilize negative capacitance shunt
   damping to address both of these issues. Consequently, the transducers
   are placed in the locations where the greatest control can be made and
   the reflected waves can be attenuated. The combination of negative
   capacitance shunt damping with acoustic black holes shows increased
   suppression of vibration over shunt damping alone.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has demonstrated efficient transformation of structure-borne
   propagating waves into low-power electricity using metamaterial-inspired
   mirror configurations. Elastoacoustic waves (i) originating from a point
   source and (ii) arriving as plane waves have been successfully focused
   on a piezoelectric energy harvester using elliptical and parabolic
   mirror concepts, respectively. Our present work investigates the spatial
   optimization of a piezoelectric energy harvester domain weakly coupled
   to a thin plate housing an elastoacoustic mirror (or lens). Mirrors
   considered include elliptical arrangements of periodic stubs, and an
   elliptical arrangement of continuous material. Spatial and temporal
   transformation of the wave propagation field into the
   frequency-wavenumber domain is performed in order to identify the
   wavenumber content inside the mirror. A frequency-domain
   root-mean-square (RMS) evaluation is then applied to the transformed
   field in order to extract the preferred propagation directions.
   Computational modeling and experimental testing are employed to quantify
   performance enhancement of the presented approach. Specifically,
   dramatic enhancement of the harvested power output is reported by
   patterned electroding of a rectangular PVDF harvester in the elliptical

Abstract = {{There has been growing interest in enabling wireless health and usage
   monitoring for rotorcraft applications, such as helicopter rotor
   systems. Large dynamic loads and acceleration fluctuations available in
   these environments make the implementation of vibration-based
   piezoelectric energy harvesters a very promising choice. However, such
   extreme loads transmitted to the harvester can also be detrimental to
   piezoelectric laminates and overall system reliability. Particularly
   flexible resonant cantilever configurations tuned to match the dominant
   excitation frequency can be subject to very large deformations and
   failure of brittle piezoelectric laminates due to excessive bending
   stresses at the root of the harvester. Design of resonant piezoelectric
   energy harvesters for use in these environments require nonlinear
   electroelastic dynamic modeling and strength-based analysis to maximize
   the power output while ensuring that the harvester is still functional.
   This paper presents a mathematical framework to design and analyze the
   dynamics of nonlinear flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters under
   large base acceleration levels. A strength-based limit is imposed to
   design the piezoelectric energy harvester with a proof mass while
   accounting for material, geometric, and dissipative nonlinearities, with
   a focus on two demonstrative case studies having the same linear
   fundamental resonance frequency but different overhang length and proof
   mass values. Experiments are conducted at different excitation levels
   for validation of the nonlinear design approach proposed in this work.
   The case studies in this work reveal that harvesters exhibiting similar
   behavior and power generation performance at low excitation levels (e.g.
   less than 0.1g) can have totally different strength-imposed performance
   limitations under high excitations (e.g. above 1g). Nonlinear modeling
   and strength-based design is necessary for such excitation levels
   especially when using resonant cantilevers with no geometric constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Inherent nonlinearities of piezoelectric materials are inevitably
   pronounced in various engineering applications such as sensing,
   actuation, their combined applications for vibration control, and most
   recently, energy harvesting from dynamical systems. The existing
   literature focusing on the dynamics of electroelastic structures made of
   piezoelectric materials have explored such nonlinearities in a
   disconnected way for the separate problems of mechanical and electrical
   excitation such that nonlinear resonance trends have been assumed to be
   due to different additional terms in constitutive equations by different
   researchers. Similar manifestations of softening nonlinearities have
   been attributed to purely elastic nonlinear terms, coupling
   nonlinearities, hysteresis, or a combination of these effects, by
   various authors. However, a reliable nonlinear constitutive equation for
   a given piezoelectric material is expected to be rather unique and valid
   regardless of the application, e. g. energy harvesting, sensing, or
   actuation. A systematic approach focusing on the two-way coupling can
   result in a sound mathematical framework. To this end, the present work
   investigates the nonlinear dynamic behavior of a bimorph piezoelectric
   cantilever under low-to-high mechanical and electrical excitation levels
   in energy harvesting, sensing, and actuation. A physical model is
   proposed including both ferroelastic hysteresis, stiffness, and
   electromechanical coupling nonlinearities. A lumped parameter
   electroelastic model is developed by accounting for these nonlinearities
   to analyze the primary resonance of a cantilever using the method of
   harmonic balance. Strong agreement between the model and experimental
   investigation is found, providing solid evidence that the the dominant
   source of observed softening nonlinear effects in geometrically linear
   piezolectric cantilever beams is well represented by a quadratic term
   resulting from ferroelastic hysteresis. Electromechanical coupling and
   cubic softening nonlinearities are observed to become effective only
   near the physical limits of the brittle and stiff bimorph cantilever
   used in the experiments, revealing that the quadratic nonlinearity
   associated with hysteresis has the primary role in nonlinear
   nonconservative dynamic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting has been heavily researched over the
   last decade to enable self-powered small electronic components for
   wireless applications in various disciplines ranging from biomedical to
   civil engineering. The existing research efforts in this
   interdisciplinary field have mostly focused on the harvesting of
   deterministic or stochastic vibrational energy available at a fixed
   position in space. Such an approach is convenient to design and employ
   linear and nonlinear vibration-based energy harvesters, such as
   base-excited cantilevers with piezoelectric laminates. However,
   persistent vibrations at a fixed frequency and spatial point, or
   standing wave patterns, are rather simplified representations of ambient
   vibrational energy. As an alternative to energy harvesting from
   spatially localized vibrations and standing wave patterns, this work
   presents an investigation into the harvesting of one-dimensional bending
   waves in infinite beams. The focus is placed on the use of piezoelectric
   patches bonded to a thin and long beam and employed to transform the
   incoming wave energy into usable electricity while minimizing the
   traveling waves reflected and transmitted from the harvester domain. To
   this end, performance enhancement by wavelength matching,
   resistive-inductive circuits, and a localized obstacle are explored.

Abstract = {{This paper develops a smart hybrid rotary damper using a re-centering
   smart shape memory alloy (SMA) material as well as conventional
   energy-dissipating metallic plates that are easy to be replaced. The
   ends of the SMA and steel plates are inserted in the hinge. When the
   damper rotates, all the plates bend, providing energy dissipating and
   re-centering characteristics. Such smart hybrid rotary dampers can be
   installed in structures to mitigate structural responses and to
   re-center automatically. The damaged energy-dissipating plates can be
   easily replaced promptly after an external excitation, reducing repair
   time and costs. An OpenSEES model of a smart hybrid rotary was
   established and calibrated to reproduce the realistic behavior measured
   from a full-scale experimental test. Furthermore, the seismic
   performance of a 3-story moment resisting model building with smart
   hybrid rotary dampers designed for downtown Los Angeles was also
   evaluated in the OpenSEES structural analysis software. Such a smart
   moment resisting frame exhibits perfect residual roof displacement,
   0.006{''}, extremely smaller than 18.04{''} for the conventional moment
   resisting frame subjected to a 2500 year return period ground motion for
   the downtown LA area (an amplified factor of 1.15 on Kobe earthquake).
   The smart hybrid rotary dampers are also applied into an eccentric
   braced steel frame, which combines a moment frame system and a bracing
   system. The results illustrate that adding smart hybrid rotaries in this
   braced system not only completely restores the building after an
   external excitation, but also significantly reduces peak interstory
   drifts.}},

Abstract = {{Negative tone resists based on cross-linking via epoxide/cationic
   polymerization have a variety of potential advantages over more
   traditional positive tone resists based on photoacid catalyzed
   deprotection including low outgassing, intrinsic diffusion control, and
   improved pattern collapse performance through the higher modulus
   provided by a cross-linked network. Based on the promising baseline
   performance achieved previously in simple negative tone systems composed
   only of an epoxide functionalized molecular glass and a photoacid
   generator, a series of different methods and additives that can be used
   to control the extent and rate of cross-linking in such systems have
   been developed and are reported here which allow for even further
   improvement in resist performance. Simple addition of base quencher, as
   is used in conventional chemically amplified resists, is ineffective in
   these systems because the patterning reaction mechanism is different.
   Any control method must work by modifying the extent and rate of
   cationic polymerization of epoxides. By adding molecules containing
   phenolic OH groups to such an epoxide resist, one can slow the extent of
   cross-linking due to introduction of an additional reaction pathway and
   often a concomitant increase in the resist resin glass transition
   temperature. Generalized additives similar to base quencher were also
   developed based on the addition of strong nucleophiles such as
   triphenylphosphine which act essentially as chain termination agents.
   This approach allows for improved resolution and LER in negative tone
   epoxide resist systems. A more superior additive was developed that can
   be described as a photodecomposable nucleophile (PDN). The unexposed PDN
   acts similarly to the strong nucleophile additives in that it terminates
   chain propagation. Upon exposure, the PDN can act like a chain transfer
   agent or an additional initiator, but no longer has the effect of
   completely terminating chain propagation. This approach allows for high
   levels of control in the nominally unexposed regions of the resist, but
   maintains high efficiency of cross-linking in the most highly exposed
   regions. One particular implementation of a PDN used in this study is
   the blending of a PAG (i.e. triphenylsulfonium triflate, TPS-Tf) with a
   more nucleophilic anion that plays the role of a PDN, with the common
   and highly effective, non-nucleophilic PAG that is conventionally used
   in epoxide photopolymerizations (i.e. triphenylsulfonium
   hexafluoroantimonate, TPS-SbF6). Addition of only a few percent of
   TPS-Tf to a baseline epoxide resist formulation shows a 5-10 nm
   improvement in ultimate resolution and a reduction in LER to around 65\%
   as compared to the baseline resist without the PDN additive while only
   incurring a moderate increase in imaging dose. By modulating the amount
   of the different polymerization control additives, the performance of a
   particular epoxide resist was improved from a resolution of greater than
   30 nm half pitch and an LER of around 9 nm to a resolution of similar to
   20 nm half pitch, with an LER of around 4 nm, and a sensitivity of 18
   mJ/cm(2). By increasing the additive loading even further, the
   resolution was improved to similar to 18 nm half pitch, although with an
   increase in imaging dose to 39 mJ/cm(2).}},

Abstract = {{A resist imaging design that utilizes photoacid inhibition of cationic
   polymerization and cross-linking during a post-exposure bake step has
   been studied. The key to the design approach is the use of two different
   polymerization catalysts/initiators: (1) a photoacid produced from a
   photoacid generator (PAG) upon exposure of the resist that can result in
   polymerization and cross-linking of the resist matrix and (2) a thermal
   cross-linking catalyst (TCC) designed to thermally catalyze
   epoxide-phenol cross-linking. The TCC can be chosen from a variety of
   compounds such as triphenylphosphine (TPP) or imidazole. When only one
   of these catalysts (e. g TPP or photoacid) is present in an epoxide and
   phenol containing resist matrix, it will individually catalyze
   cross-linking. When they are present together, they effectively quench
   one another and little to no cross-linking occurs. This approach can be
   used to switch the tone of a resist from negative (photoacid catalyzed)
   to positive (TCC catalyzed and photoacid inhibited). The effect of the
   ratio of TCC:PAG was examined and the optimal ratio for positive tone
   behavior was determined. Resist contrast can be modified by optimization
   of epoxide: phenol ratio in the formulation. Dual tone behavior with
   positive tone at low dose and negative tone at higher doses can be
   observed in certain formulation conditions. Initial EUV patterning shows
   poor results, but the source of the poor imaging is not yet understood.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers
   (BCPs) introduces a series of engineering challenges that have not been
   completely addressed in previous block copolymer and lithography
   studies. One of the required innovations for further DSA development and
   implementation is the accurate simulation of specific block copolymer
   chemistries and their interactions with interfaces. Many of the BCP
   simulation tools developed so far have limitations or difficulty in
   terms of matching many of the common issues found in experimental BCP
   systems such as polydispersity and different statistical segment
   lengths. One of the potentially most important issues is the fact that
   real BCPs often have block energy and/or density asymmetry, meaning that
   each block has a different homopolymer density and/or cohesive energy
   density (CED). A simulation of BCP behavior and DSA processes based on
   molecular dynamics (MD) of coarse-grained polymer chains has been
   developed that can independently parameterize and control the density
   and CED of each block to more accurately match the asymmetry found in
   experimental BCPs. This model was used to study the effect of block
   asymmetry on the order-disorder transition (ODT), domain scaling, and
   self-assembly of thin films of BCPs. BCPs whose blocks each have a
   different density show deviations from the mean-field ODT coexistence
   curve, exhibiting an order-disorder transition or co-existence curve
   that is asymmetric with shifts and tilts in the direction of majority
   highest density block. This impact of density and cohesive energy
   differences diblock copolymers on their phase behavior can explain some
   of the unexpected shapes found experimentally in BCP ODT curves.
   Asymmetry in the BCP block energy or density does not appear to have a
   significant effect on domain scaling behavior compared to the mean-field
   estimates. Self-assembly of thin films of BCPs with mismatches in CED
   shows significant deviations in the expected morphologies from ones
   simulated using equivalent densities and cohesive energy densities. The
   lowest CED block has a strong propensity to segregate to and ``wet{''}
   the free interface at the top of the film because it has the lowest
   energy penalty for the loss of interactions with other chains at the
   free surface relative to the bulk. This gives rise to an effective
   ``skinning{''} of the film by the lowest CED block for almost the entire
   potential range of underlayer compositions and film thicknesses. Such
   materials will be extremely difficult to successfully pattern transfer
   for a lithographically useful process because they will not form
   vertically aligned morphologies through the entire film thickness. This
   CED mismatch also gives rise to a large number of non-bulk morphologies
   and deviations from bulk behavior including changing
   vertical-to-horizontal morphologies through film depth, compression and
   expansion of domain sizes to match film thickness dimensions, and island
   and hole formation among others. Increasing the chi N value can
   potentially suppress some of these non-idealities due to CED asymmetry,
   but the required chi N to overcome these issues will differ from polymer
   to polymer depending on the magnitude of the CED asymmetry.}},

Abstract = {{Chemoepitaxy is often used to induce pattern density multiplication in
   the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) by using a
   chemically patterned guiding underlayer. This underlayer is often viewed
   as being a flat underlayer composed of a pinning stripe region and a
   neutral stripe region, where the pinning stripe is a region highly
   preferential to one phase of the BCP and the neutral stripe is a region
   that is slightly preferential to the other phase of the BCP that is not
   attracted by the pinning stripe. However, in producing these
   chemoepitaxial patterns, it is likely that unexpected topography might
   be introduced into the system, which may adversely affect the ability
   for the underlayer to guide the phase separation of the BCP film, and
   may deform any resulting lamellae. The current work presented in this
   paper explores the effect that topography in these chemoepitaxial
   underlayers has on the alignment of the BCP film. These underlayer
   effects have been evaluated using detailed mesoscale molecular dynamics

Abstract = {{Pattern density multiplication using directed self-assembly (DSA) of
   block copolymers (BCPs) is a technique capable of producing patterns
   with small pitches utilizing guiding template patterns printed as larger
   feature sizes and pitches. One method for achieving this density
   multiplication is to utilize chemoepitaxy based on a guiding underlayer
   that is nominally topographically flat but which is composed of a
   pinning region, or stripe if referring to lamellae, which will
   chemically prefer one microphase of the BCP, as well as a second region
   that is often referred to as ``neutral{''} to both phases of the BCP. In
   most conceptions of such a chemoepitaxial approach for alignment of
   lamellae patterns, the pinning stripe is typically the width of a single
   lamellae of the phase separated BCP, while the neutral stripe is some
   odd number of lamellae widths. In this work, detailed simulation studies
   have been performed to elucidate the effects of variables such as
   guiding stripe size, chemical composition of the neutral stripes, and
   small topography on the process window of DSA pitch sub-division
   patterning processes. A simple but novel technique has been developed
   and utilized to quantify the level of alignment of a simulated BCP film
   to an underlying guiding pattern. Such process windows and lithographic
   parameters have been studied for different pitch sub-division conditions
   including 1: 3 and 1: 5 pinning stripe: neutral stripe width ratios. It
   is found that the center of the processing window occurs at a
   composition of the ``neutral stripe{''} such that it is slightly to
   somewhat strongly preferential to the type of polymer of opposite type
   to that attracted by the pinning stripe, and that this ideal ``neutral
   stripe{''} composition becomes more neutral as the density
   multiplication increases.}},

Abstract = {{Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a promising
   method for producing the sub-20nm features required for future
   semiconductor device scaling, but many questions still surround the
   issue of defect levels in DSA processes. Knowledge of the free energy
   associated with a defect is critical to estimating the limiting
   equilibrium defect density that may be achievable in such a process. In
   this work, a coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) model is used to
   study the free energy of a dislocation pair defect via thermodynamic
   integration. MD models with realistic potentials allow for more accurate
   simulations of the inherent polymer behavior without the need to guess
   modes of molecular movement and without oversimplifying atomic
   interactions. The free energy of such a defect as a function of the
   Flory-Huggins parameter (chi) and the total degree of polymerization (N)
   for the block copolymer is also calculated. It is found that high pitch
   multiplying underlayers do not show significant decreases in defect free
   energy relative to a simple pitch doubling underlayer. It is also found
   that chi N is not the best descriptor for correlating defect free energy
   since simultaneous variation in chain length (N) and chi value while
   maintaining a constant chi N product produces significantly different
   defect free energies. Instead, the defect free energy seems to be
   directly correlated to the chi value of the diblock copolymer used. This
   means that as higher chi systems are produced and utilized for DSA, the
   limiting defect level will likely decrease even though DSA processes may
   still operate at similar chi N values to achieve ever smaller feature
   sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Dissemination of medical information using mobile phones is still in a
   nascent stage because of their limited features - lack of penetration of
   mobile internet, small screen size etc. We present the design of a drug
   QA system that could be used for providing information about medicines
   over short message service (SMS). We begin with a survey of the drug
   information domain and classify the drug related queries into a set of
   predefined classes. Our system uses several natural language processing
   tools coupled with machine learning classification techniques to process
   drug information related queries. We focus on developing a natural
   language interface allowing the user to be flexible in phrasing their
   queries and attain an accuracy of 81\% in classifying the drug related
   questions. We conclude that it is feasible and cheap to deploy such a
   system to encourage the practice of evidence based medicine.}},

   developed with excellent lithographic, mechanical, and electrical

   based on well-studied, chemically amplified chemistry. The dielectric is
   composed of a polynorbornene backbone with pendent fluoroalcohol and
   tert-butyl ester functional groups. The effects of the photoacid
   generator and monomer ratio on lithographic, mechanical, and electrical
   properties are studied. The sensitivity (D-100 = 8.09 mJ/ cm (2)) and
   contrast (gamma >= 14.2) are an order of magnitude higher than existing
   positive tone dielectrics. The dielectric can be cross-linked via a
   Fischer esterification after patterning. For one monomer composition
   (60\% fluoroalcohol), the modulus and hardness were measured to be 2.91

Abstract = {{The improvements in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have been
   traditionally focused more on the functionality and sensitivity of
   devices. However, packaging of MEMS devices has become a bottleneck
   mainly due to a wide range of device dimensions and packages being
   device-specific. In this study, we present a low-cost, sacrificial
   polymer-based MEMS packaging using air-gaps. Air-gaps were fabricated
   with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) as the sacrificial material and
   Cyclotene 4026 (BCB) as the overcoat. BCB was found to provide excellent
   mechanical support for the air cavity during the decomposition of the
   sacrificial material at high temperature and after decomposition at room
   temperature. Initial results were found to be promising in terms of
   before-and-after resonant spectra changes, i.e. <0.1\% change in
   resonant frequency, and <5.2\% change in quality factor. Two possible
   schemes of air-gap MEMS packaging are presented: (i) air-gap structures
   with BCB overcoat cap, and (ii) air-gap structures without BCB overcoat
   cap. Both schemes utilize epoxy overmolding as the protective layer.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of pH on film properties is studied in epoxy-based
   polynorbornene dielectrics. During normal processing, the negative tone
   films exhibit a highly acidic pH prior to cure, whereas the positive
   tone films exhibit a neutral or basic pH. Films with the exposed photo
   acid generator were swelled with base to achieve a comparable pH to the
   positive tone material. Despite the contrast in film acidity, a peak
   modulus of 3.0 GPa at a 140 degrees C cure temperature was observed,
   declining to 2.4 GPa at 220 degrees C for both negative tone pH
   conditions. In a neutral pH positive tone material, crosslinking
   occurred with a bis(diazonaphthoquinone) (DNQ) acting as the
   cross-linker, providing a modulus of 4.0 GPa. When developed, DNQ-loaded
   films showed a decline in modulus to 2.6 GPa, likely due to the
   reactions of DNQ with aqueous base. An epoxy cross-linker added to the
   developed positive tone film helped crosslinking by inhibiting base
   uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Schemes for anisotropic grid adaptation for dynamic overset simulations
   are presented. These approaches permit adaptation over a periodic time
   window in a dynamic flowfield so that an accurate evolution of the
   unsteady wake may be obtained, as demonstrated on an unstructured flow
   solver. Unlike prior adaptive schemes, this approach permits grid
   adaptation to occur seamlessly across any number of grids that are
   overset, excluding only the boundary layer to avoid surface
   manipulations. A demonstration on a rotor/fuselage-interaction
   configuration includes correlations with time-averaged and instantaneous
   fuselage pressures, and wake trajectories. Additionally, the effects of
   modeling the flow as inviscid and turbulent are reported. The ability of
   the methodology to improve these predictions is confirmed, including a
   vortex/fuselage-impingement phenomenon that has before now not been
   captured by computational simulations. The adapted solutions exhibit
   dependency based on the choice of the feature to form the adaptation
   indicator, indicating that there is no single best practice for
   feature-based adaptation across the spectrum of rotorcraft applications.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous guided airdrop systems based on steerable ram-air parafoils
   rely on differential deflection of the canopy trailing edge for lateral
   control with very limited longitudinal control. This work explores an
   alternative method that achieves both lateral and longitudinal control
   by shifting the center of gravity of the payload relative to the canopy
   rigging attachments. A multibody simulation model is required to capture
   the complex motion associated with the flexible nature of the parafoil,
   payload, and rigging system and simulate the effects of both
   longitudinal and lateral shifting of the center of gravity. Simulation
   results show that longitudinal weight shift can be an effective means of
   providing airspeed and glide slope control, and lateral weight shift can
   be an effective means of providing turn rate control. Results
   demonstrate that, for both lateral and longitudinal control, spreading
   the attachment points of the rigging to the payload will cause the
   aircraft to be more sensitive to shifts in the payload center of
   gravity. It was also found that, for both lateral and longitudinal
   control, decreasing the vertical distance from the rigging attachments
   to the center of gravity on the payload causes the aircraft to be more
   sensitive to shifts in the payload center of gravity. Finally, dynamic
   results demonstrate that the forces and moments required to induce a
   weight shift in the payload will often cause an initial response in the
   opposite direction of the final steady-state response.}},

Abstract = {{It is challenging to assess new technology in complex, interdisciplinary
   integrated systems, such as air transportation systems. Conflicting
   disciplines and technologies are always involved in aerospace systems
   design processes. Multicriteria Decision Analysis techniques can help
   decision makers to effectively deal with such situations and make wise
   design decisions. There is a variety of existing methods; thus,
   selection of the most appropriate method is critical because the use of
   inappropriate methods is often the cause of misleading design decisions.
   In this paper, an appropriateness index is used to quantify the goodness
   of a method for solving the problem under consideration. This method
   selection approach is implemented and an intelligent knowledge-based
   system is developed consisting of a multicriteria decision analysis
   library storing widely used decision analysis methods and a knowledge
   base providing the information required for the method selection
   process. Furthermore, a new approach for uncertainty assessment in the
   decision analysis process is proposed in this study. This novel approach
   for uncertainty assessment can be used to aggregate input data from
   tools with different fidelity levels and is capable of propagating
   uncertainties in an assessment chain. A business aircraft evaluation
   problem is conducted as a proof of implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Integration is ubiquitous in systems development. Although much has been
   written about the need to explicitly characterize integration in the
   context of technology development and maturation, current technology
   readiness level evaluation methods do so implicitly or altogether
   incorrectly. It is argued that integration is an inherent subattribute
   of technology readiness and that technology readiness level descriptions
   hold some of the conceptual building blocks with which such an explicit
   characterization of integration may be constructed. To do so, the
   concept of integration in the context of technology maturation is
   elaborated on, drawn from well-established published work to generate
   characterizations of integration for each readiness level. These
   descriptions build upon fundamental concepts of systems integration such
   as system architectures, abstraction, interfaces, and interactions. The
   use of these generic descriptions to create specific ones for a
   representative emerging technology in aeronautics is illustrated.
   Lastly, the proposed approach is compared to prior work, and the case is
   made for the former's advantages in benchmarking integration for a
   current assumed technology readiness level and articulating integration
   goals for higher levels of technology readiness.}},

   particles by affecting the supersaturation ratio to form rod-like and
   sheet-like particles. The surfactant adsorbed on the particles changes
   the wettability, leading to the aggregation of the primary particles at
   the internal water-oil interface. Moreover, the adsorption can cause a
   higher level of impurity and defects in as-synthesized particles. This
   effect could be directly employed to fabricate heterojunction rectifier.}},

   permeability. The direct methanol-air single fuel cell test using 5 M
   methanol solution at 70 degrees C showed a higher maximum power density
   of 91 mW cm(-2) for the nanocomposite membrane, compared to 28 and 47 mW
   cm(-2) for unmodified Nafion (R). Hence, CWs could be considered as

Abstract = {{The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a minimally invasive, wireless, and

   disabilities to control their environments using tongue motion. TDS
   translates specific tongue gestures into commands by sensing the
   magnetic field created by a small magnetic tracer applied to the user's
   tongue. We have previously quantitatively evaluated the TDS for
   accessing computers and powered wheelchairs, demonstrating its
   usability. In this study, we focused on its qualitative evaluation by
   people with high-level spinal cord injury who each received a magnetic
   tongue piercing and used the TDS for 6 wk. We used two questionnaires,
   an after-scenario and a poststudy, designed to evaluate the
   tongue-piercing experience and the TDS usability compared with that of
   the sip-and-puff and the users' current ATs. After study completion,
   73\% of the participants were positive about keeping the magnetic
   tongue-barbell in order to use the TDS. All were satisfied with the TDS
   performance and most said that they were able to do more things using

Abstract = {{Designer nucleases have been successfully employed to modify the genomes
   of various model organisms and human cell types. While the specificity
   of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and RNA-guided endonucleases has been
   assessed to some extent, little data are available for transcription
   activator-like effector-based nucleases (TALENs). Here, we have
   engineered TALEN pairs targeting three human loci (CCR5, AAVS1 and
   IL2RG) and performed a detailed analysis of their activity, toxicity and
   specificity. The TALENs showed comparable activity to benchmark ZFNs,
   with allelic gene disruption frequencies of 15-30\% in human cells.
   Notably, TALEN expression was overall marked by a low cytotoxicity and
   the absence of cell cycle aberrations. Bioinformatics-based analysis of
   designer nuclease specificity confirmed partly substantial off-target
   activity of ZFNs targeting CCR5 and AAVS1 at six known and five novel
   sites, respectively. In contrast, only marginal off-target cleavage
   activity was detected at four out of 49 predicted off-target sites for
   CCR5- and AAVS1-specific TALENs. The rational design of a CCR5-specific
   TALEN pair decreased off-target activity at the closely related CCR2
   locus considerably, consistent with fewer genomic rearrangements between
   the two loci. In conclusion, our results link nuclease-associated
   toxicity to off-target cleavage activity and corroborate TALENs as a
   highly specific platform for future clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{CRISPR/Cas9 systems are a versatile tool for genome editing due to the
   highly efficient targeting of DNA sequences complementary to their RNA
   guide strands. However, it has been shown that RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease
   cleaves genomic DNA sequences containing mismatches to the guide strand.
   A better understanding of the CRISPR/Cas9 specificity is needed to
   minimize off-target cleavage in large mammalian genomes. Here we show
   that genomic sites could be cleaved by CRISPR/Cas9 systems when DNA
   sequences contain insertions ('DNA bulge') or deletions ('RNA bulge')
   compared to the RNA guide strand, and Cas9 nickases used for paired
   nicking can also tolerate bulges in one of the guide strands. Variants
   of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for four endogenous loci were used as
   model systems, and their cleavage activities were quantified at
   different positions with 1- to 5-bp bulges. We further investigated 114
   putative genomic off-target loci of 27 different sgRNAs and confirmed 15
   off-target sites, each harboring a single-base bulge and one to three
   mismatches to the guide strand. Our results strongly indicate the need
   to perform comprehensive off-target analysis related to DNA and sgRNA
   bulges in addition to base mismatches, and suggest specific guidelines
   for reducing potential off-target cleavage.}},

Abstract = {{Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a pseudo-three-dimensional x-ray
   imaging modality proposed to decrease the effect of tissue superposition
   present in mammography, potentially resulting in an increase in clinical
   performance for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Tissue
   classification in DBT images can be useful in risk assessment,
   computer-aided detection and radiation dosimetry, among other aspects.
   However, classifying breast tissue in DBT is a challenging problem
   because DBT images include complicated structures, image noise, and
   out-of-plane artifacts due to limited angular tomographic sampling. In
   this project, we propose an automatic method to classify fatty and
   glandular tissue in DBT images. First, the DBT images are pre-processed
   to enhance the tissue structures and to decrease image noise and
   artifacts. Second, a global smooth filter based on L0 gradient
   minimization is applied to eliminate detailed structures and enhance
   large-scale ones. Third, the similar structure regions are extracted and
   labeled by fuzzy C-means (FCM) classification. At the same time, the
   texture features are also calculated Finally, each region is classified
   into different tissue types based on both intensity and texture
   features. The proposed method is validated using five patient DBT images
   using manual segmentation as the gold standard The Dice scores and the
   confusion matrix are utilized to evaluate the classified results. The
   evaluation results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method
   for classifying breast glandular and fat tissue on DBT images.}},

Abstract = {{A facile one-step route was developed to synthesize crystalline CuGeO3
   nanowire/graphene composites (CGCs). Crystalline CuGeO3 nanowires were
   tightly covered and anchored by graphene sheets, forming a layered
   structure. Subsequently, CGCs were exploited as electrode materials for
   lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The reversible formation of Li2O buffer
   layer and elastic graphene sheets accommodated the volume change during
   the charge and discharge processes. CGC containing 37 wt\% graphene
   exhibited a superior electrochemical performance, that is, a remarkable
   reversible capacity (1265 mA h g(-1) for the first cycle), an
   outstanding cyclic performance (853 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles under a
   current density of 200 mA g(-1)), a high coulombic efficiency, and an
   excellent rate capability. Clearly, CGCs may stand out as a promising
   anode material for LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{A silicon wafer coated with cellulose was prepared to measure the
   deposition of stickies on fibers and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) suspension
   is prepared as the model compound. In addition, two methods, shear force
   and aeration, were used to induce the agglomeration and deposition of
   microstickies. The model surface was characterized by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle. The results
   from new methods were also compared with old methods of High-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) deposition and INGEDE (International Association of
   the Deinking Industry) Method 4. Although these methods have been used
   to predict the deposition of stickies onto the drying felt or other
   equipment, the deposition of stickies onto fibers can differ
   significantly due to the hydrophilic nature of the fibers. This is the
   first measurement method that could help to predict the deposition of
   stickies onto paper products, which has been shown to cause detrimental
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Packaged water treatment schemes represent a growing model for providing
   safer water in low-income settings, yet post-distribution
   recontamination of treated water may limit this approach. This study
   evaluates drinking water quality and household water handling practices
   in a floating village in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, through a pilot
   cross-sectional study of 108 households, approximately half of which
   used packaged water as the main household drinking water source. We
   hypothesized that households purchasing drinking water from local
   packaged water treatment plants would have microbiologically improved
   drinking water at the point of consumption. We found no meaningful
   difference in microbiological drinking water quality between households
   using packaged, treated water and those collecting water from other
   sources, including untreated surface water, however. Households' water
   storage and handling practices and home hygiene may have contributed to
   recontamination of drinking water. Further measures to protect water
   quality at the point-of-use may be required even if water is treated and
   packaged in narrow-mouthed containers.}},

Abstract = {{Significantly reducing the minimum temperature while maintaining maximum
   temperature of thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) cycles can reduce the life
   even when mechanical strain ranges are similar. This applies to in-phase
   (IP) and out-of-phase (OP) TMF cycles. This reduction in life has
   generally been attributed to a combination of changes in microstructure
   arising from aging and increases in the cyclic inelastic strain promoted
   by increases in the elastic modulus as the minimum cycle temperature is
   reduced. TMF cycles under both IP and OP conditions were conducted with
   maximum cycle temperatures within the 750-950 degrees C range and with
   minimum cycle temperatures of either 100 or 500 degrees C. A reduction
   in minimum temperature was observed to promote a decrease in TMF life by
   as much as a factor of ten for all TMF experiments. The reduction in TMF
   life is primarily controlled by increases in the inelastic strain range
   associated with increases in the elastic modulus that arise when the
   minimum temperature is reduced.}},

   reactive powder mixtures at similar to 50\% theoretical material density
   (TMD) is investigated for shock pressures up to 5 GPa to investigate the

   mixture. The shock adiabat is produced from instrumented parallel-plate
   gas-gun impact experiments on encapsulated powders using poly-vinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) stress gauges to measure the input and propagated
   stresses and wave speed in the powder. The shock compression regime is
   probed from crush-up to full density and onward to assess the potential
   onset of a shock-induced chemical reaction event in the powder mixture.
   A series of two-dimensional continuum meso-scale simulations on
   validated simulated microstructures are performed to predict the shock
   compression response and identify the meso-scale mechanics that are
   essential for reaction. The suitability of the synthetic microstructural
   representations is evaluated by comparing the experimental and predicted

Abstract = {{An existing high strain rate viscoplastic (HSRVP) model is extended to
   address single-crystal anisotropic, elastic-plastic material response
   and is implemented into a steady plastic wave formulation in the weak
   shock regime. The single-crystal HSRVP model tracks the nucleation,
   multiplication, annihilation, and trapping of dislocations, as well as
   thermally activated and phonon drag limited glide kinetics. The steady
   plastic wave formulation is used to model the elastic-plastic response
   with respect to a propagating longitudinal wave, and assumes that the
   magnitudes of quasi-transverse waves are negligible. This steady wave
   analysis does not require specification of artificial viscosity, which
   can give rise to spurious dissipative effects. The constitutive model
   and its numerical implementation are applied to single-crystal pure Al
   and results are compared with existing experimental data. Dislocation
   density evolution, lattice reorientation, and macroscopic velocity-time
   histories are tracked for different initial orientations subjected to
   varying peak shock pressures. Results suggest that initial material
   orientation can significantly influence microstructure evolution, which
   can be captured using the modified Taylor factor.}},

Abstract = {{The results of FE simulations are presented, correlating the continuum
   and mesoscale shock response of a particulate system with particle
   surface stresses-strains. The objective of this work is to gain insight
   into how the complex responses at the meso/sub-mesoscale manifest to
   quantities that could be experimentally measured without perturbing the
   material, informing the design of possible mesoscale diagnostics. Three
   simulation setups were analyzed. First, the normal plate impact of
   monolithic silica quartz for continuum comparison purposes. Second, the
   normal plate impact of a 2D representative volume element (RVE) of
   randomly packed disks. Third, the normal plate impact of a 3D RVE of
   randomly packed spheres. In each of the RVEs a small coupon
   corresponding to an assumed mesoscale ``sensor{''} was attached to the
   surface of a particle in the center of the RVE. Stress quantities from
   the sensor and existing continuum diagnostics were analyzed. The
   mesoscale quantities are highly heterogeneous and differ significantly
   from the continuum quantities. Difficulties regarding correlation of
   surface quantities to the average particle and system response are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The spall strength and Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) of aluminum alloy
   5083 (Al 5083) are compared for plates fabricated using equi-channel
   angular pressing (ECAP) and rolling. Al 5083 is a light-weight and
   strain-hardenable aluminum alloy used for armor plating in military
   transport vehicles, thus requiring the highest achievable spall strength
   and HEL. Materials that were processed by ECAP displayed a highly
   refined grain structure with little texture and a large degree of
   plastic deformation, whereas subsequent rolling resulted in a textured
   microstructure with both grains and inclusions aligning along the
   rolling direction. The spall behavior of Al 5083 was determined using
   plate-impact gas-gun experiments with rear free surface velocity
   measurements for a variety of processing conditions involving both ECAP
   and rolling. The spall strength and HEL increased from that of the
   as-received material after processing with ECAP. Subsequent rolling
   further increased the HEL but reduced the spall strength. Rolling also
   resulted in directional dependence of the spall strength, with the
   lowest spall strength occurring for impact through the plate thickness
   and highest spall strength in the rolling direction. The trends in the
   spall behavior correlate with the size and preferential alignment of
   manganese dispersoids and iron and silicon rich inclusions that are
   evolved during processing.}},

Title = {{Fine particulate matter source apportionment using a hybrid chemical

Abstract = {{A hybrid fine particulate matter (PM2.5) source apportionment approach
   based on a receptor model (RM) species balance and species specific
   source impacts from a chemical transport model (CTM) equipped with a
   sensitivity analysis tool is developed to provide physically and
   chemically consistent relationships between source emissions and
   receptor impacts. This hybrid approach enhances RM results by providing
   initial estimates of source impacts from a much larger number of sources
   than are typically used in RMs, and provides source-receptor
   relationships for secondary species. Further, the method addresses
   issues of source collinearities and accounts for emissions
   uncertainties. We apply this hybrid approach to conduct PM2.5 source
   apportionment at Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) sites across the US.
   Ambient PM2.5 concentrations at these receptor sites were apportioned to
   33 separate sources. Hybrid method results led to large changes of
   impacts from CTM estimates for sources such as dust, woodstoves, and
   other biomass-burning sources, but limited changes to others. The
   refinements reduced the differences between CTM-simulated and observed
   concentrations of individual PM2.5 species by over 98\% when using a
   weighted least-squares error minimization. The rankings of source
   impacts changed from the initial estimates, further demonstrating that
   CTM-only results should be evaluated with observations. Assessment with
   RM results at six US locations showed that the hybrid results differ
   somewhat from commonly resolved sources. The hybrid method also resolved
   sources that typical RM methods do not capture without extra measurement
   information for unique tracers. The method can be readily applied to
   large domains and long (such as multi-annual) time periods to provide
   source impact estimates for management- and health-related studies.}},

Title = {{Reactive uptake of N2O5 to internally mixed inorganic and organic
   particles: the role of organic carbon oxidation state and inferred
   organic phase separations}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5693-5707}},
Abstract = {{We measured N2O5 reactive uptake onto mixed organic/inorganic submicron
   particles using organic compounds with a variety of oxidation states
   (using mainly atomic O : C ratios as a proxy) and molecular weights. The
   organic mass fraction, organic molecular composition, and relative
   humidity (RH) were varied to assess their effects separately on the N2O5
   uptake coefficient, gamma(N2O5). At a constant RH, mixtures of organic
   components having an O : C < 0.5 with ammonium bisulfate significantly
   suppressed the uptake of N2O5(g) compared to pure ammonium bisulfate,
   even at small organic mass fractions (e.g., < 15\%). The effect of the
   organic component became less pronounced at higher RH. In general,
   highly oxygenated organic components (O : C > 0.8) had a smaller or even
   negligible impact on N2O5(g) uptake at all RHs probed; however, a few
   exceptions were observed. Notably, gamma(N2O5) for mixtures of ammonium
   bisulfate with polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG-300 (O : C = 0.56),
   decreased nearly linearly as the PEG mass fraction increased at constant
   RH until leveling off at the value measured for pure PEG. The response
   of gamma(N2O5) to increasing PEG mass fraction was similar to that
   measured on ambient atmospheric particles as a function of organic mass
   fraction. The effects of the organic mass fraction on gamma(N2O5), for
   mixtures having an O : C < similar to 0.8, were best described using a
   standard resistor model of reactive uptake assuming the particles had an
   RH-dependent inorganic core-organic shell morphology. This model
   suggests that the N2O5 diffusivity and/or solubility in the organic
   layer is up to a factor of 20 lower compared to aqueous solution
   particles, and that the diffusivity, solubility, and reactivity of N2O5
   within organic coatings and particles depend upon both RH and the
   molecular composition of the organic medium. We use these dependencies
   and ambient measurements of organic aerosol from the global aerosol mass
   spectrometry (AMS) database to show that the typical impact of organic
   aerosol components is to both uniformly decrease gamma(N2O5), by up to
   an order of magnitude depending on the RH, organic mass fraction, and O
   : C ratio, and to induce a stronger dependence of gamma(N2O5) upon RH
   compared to purely inorganic aqueous solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Ink-jet deposition enables more economic and scalable manufacturing than
   other additive techniques. Studying the interface dynamics of multiple
   droplet interaction is critical to understanding droplet deposition
   process and control of manufacturing results. However, little research
   progress has been reported because computational cost with commercial
   software packages prohibits 3D simulation of droplet impingement under
   relevant conditions. This paper presents an efficient numerical model
   based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method that enables simulation of
   multiple-droplet impingement in 3D. A lattice Boltzmann formulation is
   proposed to solve the governing equations of the phase-field model in
   commercial software COMSOL. A new set of wall boundary conditions for
   the lattice Boltzmann formulation has also been proposed based on
   conservation principles to ensure correct contact line dynamics. The
   simulation results of our model are compared with that of COMSOL and
   experimental data from literature. Results show our model has not only a
   significant speed improvement but also better accuracy than COMSOL. We
   have also demonstrated the capability of our numerical model for
   studying the interface evolution of multiple-droplet impingement.}},

Journal = {{NEMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{565-576}},
Abstract = {{The role of lignin and phenols in plant defence ranges from preformed
   characteristic to inducible physical and chemical response against
   nematode infection. Our study shows the involvement of lignin and
   phenols in the defence of two newly identified resistant banana (Musa)
   genotypes to burrowing nematode Radopholus similis infection. Results
   were compared with reference resistant and susceptible banana cultivars.
   Histochemical analysis of root cross sections showed a more extensive
   secondary cell wall lignification of vascular bundles in R.
   similis-infected plants than in the nematode non-infected plants.
   Increased extensive lignification was not associated with the cortex
   cells that are directly attacked by the nematode. This showed that the
   increased lignification is a general defence response to protect the
   vascular bundle from damage rather than resisting the nematode
   development and reproduction at the root cortex. Histochemical
   localisation showed no preformed phenolic cells in the cortex of the
   non-infected, R. similis-resistant and -susceptible Musa genotypes. By
   contrast, phenolic substances were the major constituents of the
   nematode-infected necrotic cells. Phenols and lignin contents were also
   quantitatively assayed. The Folin-Ciocalteu assay confirmed the increase
   in phenol content of nematode-infected root cells. Phenol content in
   nematode-infected plants was twice the amount of phenol content in
   nematode noninfected plants at 3 weeks after infection. This is possibly
   due to the biosynthesis or accumulation of secondary metabolites such as
   phenolic phytoalexins in the nematode infection sites of all the banana
   genotypes. This study clearly demonstrates that phenols and lignin play
   an important role in the defence mechanisms of Musa to R. similis
   infection.}},

Title = {{The effect of nitrogen doping on mercury oxidation/chemical adsorption
   on the CuCo2O4(110) surface: a molecular-level description}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{13508-13516}},
Abstract = {{Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the detailed
   mercury oxidation/chemical adsorption mechanisms on the N-doped
   CuCo2O4(110) surface are studied. The DFT calculations show that O-w
   (bonded with one Cu2+ ion and one Co3+ ion) is far more active than O-s
   (bonded with three Co3+ ions) and the mercury oxidation/chemical
   adsorption activation energy (E-a) on the virgin CuCo2O4(110) surface
   involving O-w is 0.85 eV. The physically adsorbed mercury overcomes the
   E-a and enters the energy well that plays an important role in mercury
   oxidation/chemical adsorption. Nitrogen doping can greatly increase the
   activity of Ow and decrease the activity of Os at the same time, which
   greatly affect the mercury oxidation/chemical adsorption abilities on
   the CuCo2O4(110) surface, and the Ea variation of mercury
   oxidation/chemical adsorption is as follows: 0.85 eV (virgin
   CuCo2O4(110)) -> 0.76 eV (one N-doped CuCo2O4(110)) -> 0.69 eV ( two
   N-doped CuCo2O4(110)) -> 0.48 eV ( three N-doped CuCo2O4(110)). In
   addition, N-doping can decrease the adsorption energy of mercury and
   mercuric oxide. The effect of N-doping on the bonding mechanism of
   mercury adsorption on the CuCo2O4(110) surface is analyzed by the local
   density of state (LDOS) and the natural bonding orbital (NBO). The
   calculation results correspond well to the experimental data.}},

Title = {{The Role of Thalamic Population Synchrony in the Emergence of Cortical
   Feature Selectivity}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In a wide range of studies, the emergence of orientation selectivity in
   primary visual cortex has been attributed to a complex interaction
   between feed-forward thalamic input and inhibitory mechanisms at the
   level of cortex. Although it is well known that layer 4 cortical neurons
   are highly sensitive to the timing of thalamic inputs, the role of the
   stimulus-driven timing of thalamic inputs in cortical orientation
   selectivity is not well understood. Here we show that the
   synchronization of thalamic firing contributes directly to the
   orientation tuned responses of primary visual cortex in a way that
   optimizes the stimulus information per cortical spike. From the recorded
   responses of geniculate X-cells in the anesthetized cat, we synthesized
   thalamic sub-populations that would likely serve as the synaptic input
   to a common layer 4 cortical neuron based on anatomical constraints. We
   used this synchronized input as the driving input to an
   integrate-and-fire model of cortical responses and demonstrated that the
   tuning properties match closely to those measured in primary visual
   cortex. By modulating the overall level of synchronization at the
   preferred orientation, we show that efficiency of information
   transmission in the cortex is maximized for levels of synchronization
   which match those reported in thalamic recordings in response to
   naturalistic stimuli, a property which is relatively invariant to the
   orientation tuning width. These findings indicate evidence for a more
   prominent role of the feed-forward thalamic input in cortical feature
   selectivity based on thalamic synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered nucleases have been used to generate many model organisms and
   show great promise for therapeutic genome editing. Current methods to
   evaluate the activity of these nucleases can be laborious and often are
   hampered by readouts with small signals and a significant amount of
   background noise. We present a simple method that utilizes the
   established single-strand annealing (SSA) assay coupled with a
   luciferase assay to generate a high-throughput analysis of nuclease
   activity. Luciferase reporters provide a higher signal and lower
   background levels than fluorescent reporters. We engineered a
   commercially available luciferase plasmid (pGL4.51, Promega) to generate
   a set of nuclease target plasmids that produce a high signal and
   activity that correlates well with in vitro data. The SSA luciferase
   assay can discriminate between nucleases that give similar signals with
   other nuclease activity assays. The target plasmid and nucleases are
   transfected into cells and are generally cultured for 2 days. Luciferase
   activity is quantified in the same cell culture plate-streamlining the
   process from transfection to assay. We have used this robust process to
   investigate the activity of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and
   transcription activated-like effector nucleases (TALENs).}},

Abstract = {{An entry, descent, and landing architecture capable of achieving Mars
   Science Laboratory-class landed accuracy (within 10 km of target) while
   delivering a Mars Exploration Rover-class payload to the surface of Mars

   Rover-class aeroshell with a rigid, annular drag skirt. Maximum vehicle
   diameter, including drag skirt, is limited to be compatible with current
   launch-vehicle fairings. A single drag-skirt jettison event is used to
   control range during entry. Three-degree-of-freedom trajectory
   simulation is used in conjunction with Monte Carlo techniques to assess
   the flight performance of the proposed architecture. Results indicate
   that landed accuracy is competitive with preflight Mars Science
   Laboratory estimates, and peak heat rate and integrated heat load are
   significantly reduced relative to the Mars Exploration Rover entry
   system. Modeling parachute descent within the onboard guidance algorithm
   is found to remove range error bias present at touchdown; the addition
   of a range-based parachute deploy trigger is found to significantly
   improve landed accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Drag-modulation flight control may provide a simple method for

   areas. Aerocapture using drag modulation at Titan is found to require
   large drag areas to limit peak heat rates to nonablative
   thermal-protection system limits or advanced lightweight ablators. The
   large gravity well and high peak heat rates experienced during
   aerocapture at Venus make drag-modulation flight control unattractive

Abstract = {{The Mars Science Laboratory contains an atmospheric data system that

   aerodynamics, and atmospheric profile. The number of sensors and their
   locations for the atmospheric data system can be optimized to increase
   the accuracy of the postflight reconstruction. Pressure-port placement
   optimization methodologies using the estimation residual and a surrogate
   of the observability matrix are presented, and the results of the
   optimization for Mars entry, descent, and landing vehicles are shown.
   The results of the optimization exhibited some sensor configurations
   that can improve upon the reconstruction performance of the Mars Science

   Epitaxial growth was performed by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition
   on a c-plane bulk AlN substrate at a growth temperature of similar to
   1130 degrees C. The wafer was fabricated into cleaved bars with a cavity
   length of similar to 1.45 mm and the lasing threshold was determined to
   be 297 kW/cm(2) under pulsed 193 nm ArF excimer laser excitation. A
   further similar to 20\% reduction in threshold pumping power density was
   observed with six pairs of SiO2/HfO2 distributed Bragg reflector
   deposited at the rear side of facets.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Some limitations of cochlear implants can be attributed to a
   restricted spectral representation of sound provided by contemporary
   electrode arrays. Microfabricated high-density thin film array (TFA)
   technology enables a greater density of stimulating sites and, thus, a
   more complete spectral representation. Previous pilot cadaveric studies
   have documented insertion characteristics, although not electrical
   characteristics.
   Study Design: Electrode evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing
   in a feline model.
   Methods: Six healthy, normal hearing cats were unilaterally deafened and
   implanted with a silicone coated TFA, measuring 27.8 x 0.4 x 80 mu m (L
   x W x H). Monopolar stimulation of single electrodes was used to evoke a
   triple peaked ABR. Thresholds to evoke a minimal ABR were determined.
   Results: All 6 cats underwent successful full insertion and activation.
   Thresholds to evoke minimal ABR's varied among implants ranging from 75
   to 450 mu A. Over the basal portion of the array, thresholds were either
   larger or unable to evoke an ABR.
   Conclusion: Two-thirds of the implants showed ABR's along the entire
   array, whereas the others evoked ABR's at the apical end and less
   robustly more basally. This may reflect increased distance of the
   electrodes from the modiolus, as the basal half of the array is narrower
   relative to the width of the scala. A tapered design to ensure array
   distance to modiolus is minimized may enable the basal half of the
   arrays to stimulate more consistently.}},

Abstract = {{The chemistry of graphene oxide (GO) and its response to external
   stimuli such as temperature and light are not well understood and only
   approximately controlled. This understanding is however crucial to
   enable future applications of the material that typically are subject to
   environmental conditions. The nature of the initial GO is also highly
   dependent on the preparation and the form of the initial carbon
   material. Here, we consider both standard GO made from oxidizing
   graphite and layered GO made from oxidizing epitaxial graphene on SiC,
   and examine their evolution under different stimuli. The effect of the
   solvent on the thermal evolution of standard GO in vacuum is first
   investigated. In situ infrared absorption measurements clearly show that
   the nature of the last solvent in contact with GO prior to deposition on
   a substrate for vacuum annealing studies substantially affect the
   chemical evolution of the material as GO is reduced. Second, the
   stability of GO derived from epitaxial graphene (on SiC) is examined as
   a function of time. We show that hydrogen, in the form of CH, is present
   after the Hummers process, and that hydrogen favors the reduction of
   epoxide groups and the formation of water molecules. Importantly, this
   transformation can take place at room temperature, albeit slowly
   (similar to one month). Finally, the chemical interaction (e. g.
   bonding) between GO layers in multilayer samples is examined with
   diffraction (XRD) methods, spectroscopic (IR, XPS, Raman) techniques,
   imaging (APF) and first principles modeling.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{869-882}},
Abstract = {{Necessary physical contact between an operator and a force feedback
   haptic device creates a coupled system consisting of human and machine.
   This contact, combined with the natural human tendency to increase arm
   stiffness to attempt to stabilize its motion, can reduce the stability
   of the system. This paper proposes a method to increase stability on
   demand while maintaining speed and performance. Operator arm stiffness
   is not directly measurable, so controllers cannot typically account for
   this issue. The causes of arm end-point stiffness are examined as
   related to system stability, and a method for estimating changes in arm
   stiffness based on arm muscle activity was designed to provide a robotic
   controller with additional information about the operator. This was
   accomplished using electromyograms ( EMGs) to measure muscle activities
   and estimating the level of arm stiffness, which was used to adjust the
   dynamic characteristics of an impedance controller. To support this
   design, the correlation between EMGs and arm stiffness was validated
   experimentally. Further experiments characterized the effects of the
   designed system on operator performance. This showed increased stability
   and faster, more accurate movements using the compensating system. Such
   a system could be used in many applications, including force assisting
   devices in industrial facilities.}},

   counters}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1377-1384}},
Abstract = {{The effect of inorganic semivolatile aerosol compounds on the cloud
   condensation nucleus (CCN) activity of aerosol particles was studied by
   using a computational model for a DMT-CCN counter, a cloud parcel model
   for condensation kinetics and experiments to quantify the modelled
   results. Concentrations of water vapour and semivolatiles as well as
   aerosol trajectories in the CCN column were calculated by a
   computational fluid dynamics model. These trajectories and vapour
   concentrations were then used as an input for the cloud parcel model to
   simulate mass transfer kinetics of water and semivolatiles between
   aerosol particles and the gas phase.
   Two different questions were studied: (1) how big a fraction of
   semivolatiles is evaporated from particles after entering but before
   particle activation in the DMT-CCN counter? (2) How much can the CCN
   activity be increased due to condensation of semivolatiles prior to the
   maximum water supersaturation in the case of high semivolatile
   concentration in the gas phase?
   Both experimental and modelling results show that the evaporation of
   ammonia and nitric acid from ammonium nitrate particles causes a 10 to
   15 nm decrease to the critical particle size in supersaturations between
   0.1\% and 0.7\%. On the other hand, the modelling results also show that
   condensation of nitric acid or similar vapour can increase the CCN
   activity of nonvolatile aerosol particles, but a very high gas phase
   concentration (as compared to typical ambient conditions) would be
   needed. Overall, it is more likely that the CCN activity of semivolatile
   aerosol is underestimated than overestimated in the measurements
   conducted in ambient conditions.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic calibration of a damage rock mechanics model}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{17-21}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Current practice in the calibration of damage models requires
   downscaling the effects of experimental observations from macro/meso to
   micro. This process introduces uncertainty that is seldom quantified to
   reflect the expert's confidence in the model predictions. A
   probabilistic calibration methodology can be introduced to overcome this
   problem. This paper shows a case study based on a damage rock mechanics
   model and triaxial experimental data on sandstone, where this approach
   is implemented to illustrate the impact of varying states of evidence
   (i.e. model complexity, experimental observations and expert's
   judgement) on the model predictions. The probabilistic calibration
   method relies on the use of the Bayesian paradigm to assimilate
   experimental observations into the probabilistic definition of the model
   parameters. Results of this approach can be encapsulated into a single
   probability distribution or posterior, which is later used to assess the
   model performance. The proposed approach shows the potential to improve
   current practice in risk analysis since it allows tracing of changes of
   the model performance for varying evidence conditions in
   damage-sensitive geostructures such as nuclear waste disposals,
   landfills, geothermal wells and unconventional oil and gas formations,
   among others.}},

Abstract = {{Operators and users interacting with computer environments often have to
   deal with multiple tasks at once, responding to each in series.
   Diagnostic automation, that is, automation that alerts users when and
   where to look, has been suggested to support the unique challenges of
   multiple task environments: activating tasks, switching between tasks,
   and tasks interfering with each other. Automation is not always
   reliable, however. Because of the common interaction with novel systems
   and the importance of training, the Simultaneous Task Environment
   Platform programa multiple-task environmentwas developed to understand
   the effects of experience on interaction with these automation-supported
   systems, as well as what strategies were developed. It was found that
   participants became more efficient with experience only when they
   interacted with higher reliability automation. Furthermore, the
   strategies participants developed focused on the differences between
   tasks and patterns across those tasks. Automated systems training should
   be sure to employ these findings.}},

Title = {{A study on the role of physical models in the mitigation of design
   fixation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{25-43}},
Abstract = {{Designers implement a variety of models and representations during the
   design process, yet little is known about the cognitive impacts of
   various representations. This study focuses on how physical models can
   assist novices in mitigating design fixation on undesirable features.
   During idea generation, designers tend to fixate on examples they
   encounter or on their own initial ideas. The first hypothesis states
   that designers tend to duplicate features of provided examples. The
   second hypothesis states that this fixation can be mitigated with
   appropriate warnings. The last hypothesis is that building and testing
   physical models can help designers in mitigating fixation. To
   investigate these theories, a quasi-experiment is conducted as part of a
   freshman class project. Students design, build and test stunt cars in
   three different experimental conditions, each receiving a different
   pictorial example: an effective example, a flawed example and a flawed
   example with warnings about the flaws. The results show that in all the
   conditions, designers duplicate undesirable features from their
   examples, even when they received warnings about the flawed features.
   Copying these flawed features creates more complicated and less
   effective designs. However, through the physical testing of their
   designs, participants identify and fix the design flaws. These results
   indicate that existing designs and experiences have the potential to
   limit innovation and that designers need to be trained with effective
   methods for mitigating design fixation. Building prototypes can help
   designers in identifying the flawed features and in reducing design
   fixation; hence, the use of physical models in engineering design needs
   to be encouraged.}},

Journal = {{NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-51}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate the use of impact acoustic
   signals to non-intrusively inspect rubber composite structures for the
   presence of internal cracks, such as those found in an automobile tyre.
   Theoretical contact dynamic models for both integral and defective
   rubber structures are developed based on Hertz's impact model, further
   modified for rubber composite materials. The model generates the
   prediction of major impact dynamic quantities, namely the maximum impact
   force, impact duration and contact deformation; such parameters are also
   theoretically proven to be correlated with the presence of internal
   cracks. The tyre structures are simplified into cubic rubber blocks, to
   mitigate complexity for analytical modelling. Both impact force and
   impact sound signals are measured experimentally, and extraction of
   useful features from both signals for defect identification is achieved.
   The impact force produces two direct measurements of theoretical impact
   dynamic quantities. A good correlation between these experimental
   discriminators and the theoretical dynamic quantities provide validation
   for the contact dynamics models. Defect discriminators extracted from
   the impact sound are dependent on both time-and frequency-domain
   analyses. All the discriminators are closely connected with the
   theoretical dynamic quantities and experimentally verified as good
   indicators of internal cracks in rubber composite structures.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun nanofiber meshes have emerged as a new generation of
   scaffold membranes possessing a number of features suitable for tissue
   regeneration. One of these features is the flexibility to modify their
   structure and composition to orchestrate specific cellular responses. In
   this study, we investigated the effects of nanofiber orientation and
   surface functionalization on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)
   migration and osteogenic differentiation. We used an in vitro model to
   examine hMSC migration into a cell-free zone on nanofiber meshes and
   mitomycin C treatment to assess the contribution of proliferation to the
   observed migration. Poly (epsilon-caprolactone) meshes with oriented
   topography were created by electrospinning aligned nanofibers on a
   rotating mandrel, while randomly oriented controls were collected on a
   stationary collector. Both aligned and random meshes were coated with a
   triple-helical, type I collagen-mimetic peptide, containing the
   glycine-phenylalanine-hydroxyproline-glycine-glutamate-arginine (GFOGER)
   motif. Our results indicate that nanofiber GFOGER peptide
   functionalization and orientation modulate cellular behavior,
   individually, and in combination. GFOGER significantly enhanced the
   migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs on
   nanofiber meshes. Aligned nanofiber meshes displayed increased cell
   migration along the direction of fiber orientation compared to random
   meshes; however, fiber alignment did not influence osteogenic
   differentiation. Compared to each other, GFOGER coating resulted in a
   higher proliferation-driven cell migration, whereas fiber orientation
   appeared to generate a larger direct migratory effect. This study
   demonstrates that peptide surface modification and topographical cues
   associated with fiber alignment can be used to direct cellular behavior
   on nanofiber mesh scaffolds, which may be exploited for tissue
   regeneration.}},

Pages = {{6844-6852}},
Abstract = {{Phase behaviors of a 21-arm star-like diblock copolymer in bulk and
   under confinement were explored by using the pseudo-spectral method of a
   self-consistent mean field theory. An asymmetrical phase diagram in bulk
   was constructed by comparing the free energy of different structures.
   The gyroid phase was found to possess a large phase region when the
   inner block in the star-like diblock copolymer has a small volume
   fraction, suggesting the propensity to form the gyroid phase under this
   condition. Combined with the early experimental work, a scaling law
   correlating the period of lamellae D-multiarms formed from multi-arm
   star-like block copolymers with the number of arms f was identified,
   that is, D-multiarms = D/f(1/2), where D is the period of a linear
   diblock copolymer with the same degree of polymerization N as a starlike
   diblock copolymer. The scaling law was also substantiated by the scaling
   theory. The bridging fraction of the lamellae formed in a star-like
   diblock copolymer was nearly 100\%, which is advantageous for improving
   its mechanical properties. Some interesting two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional morphologies were yielded under the cylindrical
   confinement, where a 3D double helix was found to be the most stable
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{By applying recirculating frequency shifter technology to generate
   optical comb as neighboring channels, we have experimentally
   investigated the interchannel nonlinear tolerance of 256-Gbit/s
   polarization-division multiplexing return-to-zero 16-ary quadrature
   amplitude modulation (PDM-RZ-16QAM) in a co-propagation with 32-Gbaud
   on-off keying, binary phase-shift keying, quadrature phase-shift keying
   (QPSK) signals in 792-km large-area fiber transmission system. The
   results show that the experimental back-to-back optical signal-to-noise
   ratio requirement of 256-Gbit/s (32-GBaud) PDM-RZ-16QAM signal is
   shifted by 4.8-dB penalty in comparison with the theoretical limits. The
   cross-phase modulation (XPM) tolerance for 256-Gbit/s PDM-RZ-16QAM in
   32-Gbaud phase-modulated neighboring channels is better than in 32-Gbaud
   intensity-modulated neighbors. Moreover, the performance of XPM
   tolerance for 256-Gbit/s PDM-RZ-16QAM in 32-Gbaud QPSK neighboring
   channels is the best among other kinds of modulation neighboring
   formats. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{The integration of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) in a microfluidic
   geometry can significantly enhance the power density of these cells,
   which would have more active bacteria per unit volume. Moreover,
   microfluidic MFCs can be operated in a continuous mode as opposed to the
   traditional batch-fed mode. Here we investigate the effect of fluid flow
   on the performance of microfluidic MFCs. The growth and the structure of
   the bacterial biofilm depend to a large extent on the shear stress of
   the flow. We report the existence of a range of flow rates for which
   MFCs can achieve maximum voltage output. When operated under these
   optimal conditions, the power density of our microfluidic MFC is about
   15 times that of a similar-size batch MFC. Furthermore, this optimum
   suggests a correlation between the behaviour of bacteria and fluid flow.}},

Abstract = {{The aerosol chemical composition in air masses affected by wildfires
   from the Greek islands of Chios, Euboea and Andros, the Dalmatian Coast
   and Sicily, during late summer of 2012 was characterized at the remote
   background site of Finokalia, Crete. Air masses were transported several
   hundreds of kilometers, arriving at the measurement station after
   approximately half a day of transport, mostly during nighttime. The
   chemical composition of the particulate matter was studied by different
   high-temporal-resolution instruments, including an aerosol chemical
   speciation monitor (ACSM) and a seven-wavelength aethalometer. Despite
   the large distance from emission and long atmospheric processing, a
   clear biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA) profile containing
   characteristic markers is derived from BC (black carbon) measurements
   and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the ACSM organic
   mass spectra. The ratio of fresh to aged BBOA decreases with increasing
   atmospheric processing time and BBOA components appear to be converted
   to oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). Given that the smoke was mainly
   transported overnight, it appears that the processing can take place in
   the dark. These results show that a significant fraction of the BBOA
   loses its characteristic AMS (aerosol mass spectrometry) signature and
   is transformed to OOA in less than a day. This implies that biomass
   burning can contribute almost half of the organic aerosol mass in the
   area during periods with significant fire influence.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol indirect effects in climate models strongly depend on the
   representation of the aerosol activation process. In this study, we
   assess the process-level differences across activation parameterizations
   that contribute to droplet number uncertainty by using the adjoints of
   the Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000) and Fountoukis and Nenes (2005) droplet
   activation parameterizations in the framework of the Community
   Atmospheric Model version 5.1 (CAM5.1). The adjoint sensitivities of N-d
   to relevant input parameters are used to (i) unravel the spatially
   resolved contribution of aerosol number, mass, and chemical composition
   to changes in N-d between present-day and pre-industrial simulations and
   (ii) identify the key variables responsible for the differences in Nd
   fields and aerosol indirect effect estimates when different activation
   schemes are used within the same modeling framework. The sensitivities
   are computed online at minimal computational cost. Changes in aerosol
   number and aerosol mass concentrations were found to contribute to N-d
   differences much more strongly than chemical composition effects. The
   main sources of discrepancy between the activation parameterizations
   considered were the treatment of the water uptake by coarse mode
   particles, and the sensitivity of the parameterized N-d accumulation
   mode aerosol geometric mean diameter. These two factors explain the
   different predictions of N-d over land and over oceans when these
   parameterizations are employed. Discrepancies in the sensitivity to
   aerosol size are responsible for an exaggerated response to aerosol
   volume changes over heavily polluted regions. Because these regions are
   collocated with areas of deep clouds, their impact on shortwave cloud
   forcing is amplified through liquid water path changes. The same
   framework is also utilized to efficiently explore droplet number
   uncertainty attributable to hygroscopicity parameter of organic aerosol
   (primary and secondary). Comparisons between the
   parameterization-derived sensitivities of droplet number against
   predictions with detailed numerical simulations of the activation
   process were performed to validate the physical consistency of the
   adjoint sensitivities.}},

Title = {{Inorganic salts interact with oxalic acid in submicron particles to form
   material with low hygroscopicity and volatility}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5205-5215}},
Abstract = {{Volatility and hygroscopicity are two key properties of organic aerosol
   components, and both are strongly related to chemical identity. While
   the hygroscopicities of pure salts, di-carboxylic acids (DCA), and DCA
   salts are known, the hygroscopicity of internal mixtures of these
   components, as they are typically found in the atmosphere, has not been
   fully characterized. Here we show that inorganic-organic component
   interactions typically not considered in atmospheric models can lead to
   very strongly bound metal-organic complexes and greatly affect aerosol
   volatility and hygroscopicity; in particular, the bi-dentate binding of
   DCA to soluble inorganic ions. We have studied the volatility of pure,
   dry organic salt particles and the hygroscopicity of internal mixtures
   of oxalic acid (OxA, the dominant DCA in the atmosphere) and a number of
   salts, both mono- and di-valent. The formation of very low volatility
   organic salts was confirmed, with minimal evaporation of oxalate salt
   particles below 75 A degrees C. Dramatic increases in the cloud
   condensation nuclei (CCN) activation diameter for particles with
   di-valent salts (e.g., CaCl2) and relatively small particle volume
   fractions of OxA indicate that standard volume additivity rules for
   hygroscopicity do not apply. Thus small organic compounds with high O :
   C ratios are capable of forming low-volatility and very low
   hygroscopicity particles. Given current knowledge of the formation
   mechanisms of OxA and M-Ox salts, surface enrichment of insoluble M-Ox
   salts is expected. The resulting formation of an insoluble coating of
   metal-oxalate salts can explain low-particle hygroscopicities. The
   formation of particles with a hard coating could offer an alternative
   explanation for observations of glass-like particles without the need
   for a phase transition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the ignition of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs)
   under conditions of non-shock loading. The analysis uses a recently
   developed ignition criterion {[}1] which is based on the quantification
   of the distributions of the sizes and temperatures of hotspots in
   loading events. This quantification is achieved by using a cohesive
   finite element method (CFEM) developed recently and the characterization
   by Tarver et al. {[}2] of the critical size-temperature threshold of
   hotspots required for chemical ignition of solid explosives.
   Calculations are performed on PBXs having monomodal grain size
   distributions with grain volume fractions varying between 0.72 and 0.90.
   The impact velocities considered vary between 100 and 200 ms(-1).
   Results show that the average distance between the hotspots is dependent
   on the grain volume fraction. As the grain volume fraction increases,
   the time to criticality (t(c)) decreases, signifying increases in the
   ignition sensitivity of PBX to impact loading. The
   microstructure-performance relations obtained can be used to design PBXs
   with tailored performance characteristics and safety envelopes.}},

Pages = {{17-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{High Altitude, Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft can achieve sustained,
   uninterrupted flight time if they use solar power. Wing morphing of
   solar powered HALE aircraft can significantly increase solar energy
   absorbency. An example of the kind of morphing considered in this paper
   requires the wings to fold so as to orient a solar panel to be hit more
   directly by the sun's rays at specific times of the day. An example of
   the kind of morphing considered in this paper requires the wings to fold
   so as to orient a solar panel that increases the absorption of solar
   energy by decreasing the angle of incidence of the solar radiation at
   specific times of the day. In this paper solar powered HALE flying wing
   aircraft are modeled with three beams with lockable hinge connections.
   Such aircraft are shown to be capable of morphing passively, following
   the sun by means of aerodynamic forces and engine thrusts. The analysis
   underlying NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability of HALE
   Aircraft), a computer program that is based on geometrically exact,
   fully intrinsic beam equations and a finite-state induced flow model,
   was extended to include the ability to simulate morphing of the aircraft
   into a ``Z{''} configuration. Because of. the ``long endurance{''}
   feature of HALE aircraft, such morphing needs to be done without relying
   on actuators and at as near zero energy cost as possible. The emphasis
   of this study is to substantially demonstrate the processes required to
   passively morph a flying wing into a Z-shaped configuration and back
   again. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Effects of multiple engine placement on flutter characteristics of a
   backswept flying wing resembling the HORTEN IV are investigated using
   the code NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability of HALE
   Aircraft). Four identical engines with defined mass, inertia, and
   angular momentum are placed in different locations along the span with
   different offsets from the elastic axis while fixing the location of the
   aircraft c.g. The aircraft experiences body freedom flutter along with
   non-oscillatory instabilities that originate from flight dynamics.
   Multiple engine placement increases flutter speed particularly when the
   engines are placed in the outboard portion of the wing (60-70\% span),
   forward of the elastic axis, while the lift to drag ratio is affected
   negligibly. The behavior of the sub- and supercritical eigenvalues is
   studied for two cases of engine placement. NATASHA captures a hump
   body-freedom flutter with low frequency for the clean wing case, which
   disappears as the engines are placed on the wings. In neither case is
   there any apparent coalescence between the unstable modes. NATASHA
   captures other non-oscillatory unstable roots with very small amplitude,
   apparently originating with flight dynamics. For the clean-wing case, in
   the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces, the regions of
   minimum kinetic energy density for the first and third bending modes are
   located around 60\% span. For the second mode, this kinetic energy
   density has local minima around the 20\% and 80\% span. The regions of
   minimum kinetic energy of these modes are in agreement with calculations
   that show a noticeable increase in flutter speed if engines are placed
   forward of the elastic axis at these regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Visual monitoring of construction worksites through the installation of
   surveillance cameras has become prevalent in the construction industry.
   These cameras also are useful for automatic observation of construction
   events and activities. This paper demonstrates the use of a surveillance

   workday. In particular, it seeks to demonstrate that the crane jib
   trajectory, together with known information regarding the site plans,
   provides sufficient information to infer the activity states of the
   crane. The jib angle trajectory is tracked by using two-dimensional to
   three-dimensional rigid pose tracking algorithms. The site plan
   information includes a process model for the activities and site layout
   information. A probabilistic graph model for crane activity is designed
   to process the track signals and recognize crane activity as belonging
   to one of two categories: concrete pouring and nonconcrete material
   movement. The experimental results from a construction surveillance
   camera show that crane activities are correctly identified.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidics provides exciting possibilities for miniaturized
   biosensors systems allowing for highly parallel automated high
   throughput tests to be performed. Detection of low concentrations of
   bacteria, viral particles and parasites in food samples is a challenging
   process. The capture of the target can be more effectively carried out
   with efficient mixing. We present a simple microfluidic system capable
   of controlled transport of rotating magnetic beads among soft magnetic
   patterns. Low aspect ratio NiFe discs (200 nm tall, diameter 3 mu m) are
   patterned onto a silicon wafer. A PDMS channel is bonded onto the wafer
   to create the microfluidic channel. An external permanent magnet
   attached to a motor provides a magnetic field, which can be rotated at
   different speeds while magnetizing the NiFe disks in the channel.
   Microbeads (Dynabeads M-280, Invitrogen) introduced into the channel
   with a syringe pump are trapped at the poles of the now magnetized soft
   magnetic discs. Rotation of the external permanent magnet induced
   magnetic poles in the soft magnetic discs which will in turn rotate the
   trapped microbeads. We have already demonstrated the capacity to capture
   particles from flow with rotating M-280 beads in this device.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to determine the strain field in one-dimensional (1D)
   photonic crystal (PC) involving high strain rate, high temperature
   around shock or ballistic impact is proposed. Transient strain sensing
   is important in aerospace and other structural health monitoring (SHM)
   applications. We consider a MEMS based smart sensor design with photonic
   crystal integrated on a silicon substrate for dynamic strain
   correlation. Deeply etched silicon rib waveguides with distributed Bragg
   reflectors are suitable candidates for miniaturization of sensing
   elements, replacing the conventional FBG. Main objective here is to
   investigate the effect of non-uniform strain localization on the sensor
   output. Computational analysis is done to determine the static and
   dynamic strain sensing characteristics of the 1D photonic crystal based
   sensor. The structure is designed and modeled using Finite Element
   Method. Dynamic localization of strain field is observed. The
   distributed strain field is used to calculated the PC waveguide
   response. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor is estimated to be 0.6
   pm/mu epsilon.}},

Abstract = {{A common problem in statistics is to compute sample vectors from a
   multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a given covariance
   matrix A. A canonical approach to the problem is to compute vectors of
   the form y = Sz, where S is the Cholesky factor or square root of A, and
   z is a standard normal vector. When A is large, such an approach becomes
   computationally expensive. This paper considers preconditioned Krylov
   subspace methods to perform this task. The Lanczos process provides a
   means to approximate A(1/2)z for any vector z from an m-dimensional
   Krylov subspace. The main contribution of this paper is to show how to
   enhance the convergence of the process via preconditioning. Both
   incomplete Cholesky preconditioners and approximate inverse
   preconditioners are discussed. It is argued that the latter class of
   preconditioners has an advantage in the context of sampling. Numerical
   tests, performed with stationary covariance matrices used to model
   Gaussian processes, illustrate the dramatic improvement in computation
   time that can result from preconditioning.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro differentiation of mouse and human stem cells into early T
   cells has been successfully demonstrated using artificial Notch
   signaling systems. However, generation of mature, antigen-specific,
   functional T cells, directly from human stem cells has remained elusive,
   except when using stromal coculture of stem cells retrovirally
   transfected with antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). Here we show
   that human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD34+CD38-/low
   hematopoietic stem cells can be successfully differentiated into
   functional, antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells without direct
   stromal coculture or retroviral TCR transfection. Surface-immobilized
   Notch ligands (DLL1) and stromal cell conditioned medium successfully
   induced the development of CD1a+CD7+ and CD4+CD8+ early T cells. These
   cells, upon continued culture with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or influenza-A
   virus M1 (GIL) epitope-loaded human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A{*}0201
   tetramers, resulted in the generation of a polyclonal population of
   CMV-specific or GIL-specific CD8+ T cells, respectively. Upon further
   activation with antigen-loaded target cells, these antigen-specific,
   stem cell-derived T cells exhibited cytolytic functionality,
   specifically CD107a surface mobilization, interferon gamma (IFNg)
   production, and Granzyme B secretion. Such scalable, in vitro generation
   of functional, antigen-specific T cells from human stem cells could
   eventually provide a readily available cell source for adoptive transfer
   immunotherapies and also allow better understanding of human T cell
   development. Stem Cells2014;32:93-104}},

   Time}},
Journal = {{ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{61-68}},
Abstract = {{Wheelchair cushions can be used for many hours every day. Like all
   devices, cushions degrade over time, losing the ability to provide
   adequate support. Little is known about the changes that cushions
   undergo after typical everyday use. This project was designed to monitor
   cushion performance over time with the objective to identify the most
   important factors that predict cushion degradation. Wheelchair users and
   their cushions were evaluated multiple times. Information was collected
   about participants' posture and activities, their cushions, and use of
   their cushions. Cushion performance was determined by measuring
   interface pressure using a buttock model. Data analysis proceeded in two
   steps. First, principal component analysis was run to reduce the number
   of variables. Second, multiple regression determined which variables
   influenced the interface pressure performance variables. Results
   indicated that user characteristics and the manner in which the cushion
   is used have a greater influence on cushion performance than the
   chronological age of the cushion. This result can be useful to
   clinicians who should query users about cushion use when investigating
   the need to replace a cushion. Finally, this information is applicable
   to policies that govern cushion replacement and indicted that wear on a
   cushion is not equivocal across users.}},

Title = {{Distributed Abnormal Activity Detection in Smart Environments}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The abnormal activity detection in smart environments has experienced
   increasing attention over years, due to its usefulness in pervasive
   applications. In order to meet the real-time needs and overcome the high
   costs and privacy issues, this paper proposes distributed abnormal
   activity detection approach (DetectingAct), which employs the computing
   and storage resources of simple and ubiquitous sensor nodes, to detect
   abnormal activity in smart environments equipped with wireless sensor
   networks (WSN). In DetectingAct, activity is defined as the combination
   of trajectory and duration, and abnormal activity is defined as the
   activity which deviates greater enough from those normal activities.
   DetectingAct works as follows. Firstly, DetectingAct finds the normal
   activity patterns through duration-dependent frequent pattern mining
   algorithm (DFPMA), which adopts unsupervised learning instead of
   supervised learning. Secondly, the distributed knowledge storage
   mechanism (DKSM) is introduced to store the mined patterns in each node.
   Then, the current triggered sensor adopts distributed abnormal activity
   detection algorithm (DAADA), in which the clustering analysis plays a
   critical role, to compare the present activity with normal activity
   patterns, by calculating the similarity between them. The feasibility,
   real-time property, and accuracy of the DetectingAct algorithm are
   evaluated using both simulation and real experiments case studies.}},

   validated using micro dynamometer and the deflection profile was

Abstract = {{All optical switching (AOS) applications require materials with a large
   nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) but relatively small linear and
   nonlinear absorption loss. The figure-of-merit (FOM), defined as the
   ratio between the real and imaginary parts of the second
   hyperpolarizability (gamma), is widely used to evaluate the operating
   efficiency of AOS materials. By using an essential-state model, we
   describe the general dispersion behavior of gamma of symmetric organic
   molecules and predict that the optimized wavelength range for a large
   FOM is near its linear absorption edge for cyanine-like dyes.
   Experimental studies are normally performed on organic solutes in
   solution which becomes problematic when the solvent nonlinearity
   dominates the total signal. This has been overcome using a Dual-arm
   Z-scan methodology to measure the solution and solvent simultaneously on
   two identical Z-scan arms and discriminating their small nonlinear
   signal difference. This technique significantly reduces the measurement
   uncertainty by correlating the excitation noise in both arms, leading to
   nearly an order-of-magnitude increase in sensitivity. Here we
   investigate the n(2) and two-photon absorption (2PA) spectra of several
   classes of cyanine-like organic molecules and find that the results for
   most molecules agree qualitatively and quantitatively with the
   essential-state model. Many cyanine-like molecules show a relatively
   small FOM due to the presence of large 2PA bands near the linear
   absorption edge; however, an exception is found for a thiopyrylium
   polymethine molecule of which the maximum FOM can be > 400, making it an
   excellent candidate for AOS.}},

Abstract = {{The biotransformation potential of three phytosterols (campesterol,
   stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol) under denitrifying, sulfate-reducing
   and fermentative/methanogenic conditions was assessed. Using a group
   contribution method, the standard Gibbs free energy of phytosterols was
   calculated and used to perform theoretical energetic calculations. The
   oxidation of phytosterols under aerobic, nitrate-reducing,
   sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions was determined to be
   energetically feasible. However, using semi-continuously fed cultures
   maintained at 20-22 degrees C over 16 weekly feeding cycles (112 days;
   retention time, 21 days), phytosterol removal was observed under
   nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing conditions, but not under
   fermentative/methanogenic conditions. Under sulfate-reducing conditions,
   stigmast-4-en-3-one was identified as an intermediate of phytosterol
   biotransformation, a reaction more likely carried out by
   dehydrogenases/isomerases, previously reported to act on cholesterol
   under both oxic and anoxic (denitrifying) conditions. Further study of
   the biotransformation of phytosterols under anoxic/anaerobic conditions
   is necessary to delineate the factors and conditions leading to enhanced
   phytosterol biodegradation and the development of effective biological
   treatment systems for the removal of phytosterols from pulp and paper
   wastewaters and other phytosterol-bearing waste streams.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose capsules with average outer and inner radii of approximately
   44 mu m and 29 mm respectively were prepared from cellulose dissolved in
   a mixture of lithium chloride and dimethylacetamide using a microfluidic
   flow focusing device (MFFD). The MFFD had three inlets where octane oil
   in a cellulose solution in silicone oil was used to produce a double
   emulsion containing a cellulose capsule. This technique enables the
   formation of capsules with a narrow size distribution which can be
   beneficial for drug delivery or controlled release capsules. In this
   respect, cellulose is a highly interesting material since it is known to
   cause no autoimmune reactions when used in contact with human tissue.
   Furthermore, by controlling the chemical properties of the cellulose, it
   is possible to trigger a swelling of the capsules and consequentially
   the release of an encapsulated substance, e. g. a model drug, when the
   capsule becomes exposed to an external stimulus. To demonstrate this,
   capsules were functionalized by carboxymethylation to be pH- responsive
   and to expand approximately 10\% when subjected to a change in pH from 3
   to 10. The diffusion constant of a model drug, a 4 kDa fluorescently
   labelled dextran, through the native capsule wall was estimated to be
   6.5 X 10(-14) m(2) s(-1) by fitting fluorescence intensity data to
   Fick's second law.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the impact of the processing methodology on
   nanocomposite thin films formed via blade casting versus spin coating on
   the electric breakdown strength and energy storage properties of BaTiO3
   nanoparticle/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)
   nanocomposites. Nanocomposite films containing 50\% volume loading of
   surface-modified BaTiO3 nanoparticles fabricated by the use of blade
   casting showed a denser and more uniform morphology, and larger polymer
   crystallite domains, relative to those obtained via spin coating. The
   improved morphology has resulted in an increase of up to 60\% in the
   breakdown strength and in energy density by a factor of similar to 2-3
   and for blade-cast vs. spin coated nanocomposite films containing 50 or
   120 nm BaTiO3 nanoparticles, yielding a maximum extractable energy
   density of 7 J cm(-3). We attribute the increase in energy density and
   dielectric breakdown strength to the effects of the improved uniformity
   and the formation of polymer nanocrystalline domains in the matrix, as
   shown by cross-sectional SEM and topological AFM images, and X-ray
   diffraction results. These results stress the importance of controlling
   nanoscale morphology for optimizing energy storage capacity of
   solution-processed nanocomposite thin films for pulsed power, gate
   dielectrics, and other thin-film power applications.}},

Title = {{Intra-articular injection of micronized dehydrated human amnion/chorion
   membrane attenuates osteoarthritis development}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Micronized dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane
   (mu-dHACM) is derived from donated human placentae and has
   anti-inflammatory, low immunogenic and anti-fibrotic properties. The
   objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the efficacy of
   mu-dHACM as a disease modifying intervention in a rat model of
   osteoarthritis (OA). It was hypothesized that intra-articular injection
   of mu-dHACM would attenuate OA progression.
   Methods: Lewis rats underwent medial meniscal transection (MMT) surgery
   to induce OA. Twenty four hours post-surgery, mu-dHACM or saline was
   injected intra-articularly into the rat joint. Na ve rats also received
   mu-dHACM injections. Microstructural changes in the tibial articular
   cartilage were assessed using equilibrium partitioning of an ionic
   contrast agent (EPIC-mu CT) at 21 days post-surgery. The joint was also
   evaluated histologically and synovial fluid was analyzed for
   inflammatory markers at 3 and 21 days post-surgery.
   Results: There was no measured baseline effect of mu-dHACM on cartilage
   in na ve animals. Histological staining of treated joints showed
   presence of mu-dHACM in the synovium along with local hypercellularity
   at 3 and 21 days post-surgery. In MMT animals, development of cartilage
   lesions at 21 days was prevented and number of partial erosions was
   significantly reduced by treatment with mu-dHACM. EPIC-mu CT analysis
   quantitatively showed that mu-dHACM reduced proteoglycan loss in MMT
   animals.
   Conclusions: mu-dHACM is rapidly sequestered in the synovial membrane
   following intra-articular injection and attenuates cartilage degradation
   in a rat OA model. These data suggest that intra-articular delivery of
   mu-dHACM may have a therapeutic effect on OA development.}},

Title = {{Empirical estimation of present-day Antarctic glacial isostatic

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{743-760}},
Abstract = {{This study explores an approach that simultaneously estimates Antarctic
   mass balance and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) through the
   combination of satellite gravity and altimetry data sets. The results
   improve upon previous efforts by incorporating a firn densification
   model to account for firn compaction and surface processes as well as
   reprocessed data sets over a slightly longer period of time. A range of
   different Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity models
   were evaluated and a new Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite
   (ICESat) surface height trend map computed using an overlapping
   footprint approach. When the GIA models created from the combination
   approach were compared to in situ GPS ground station displacements, the
   vertical rates estimated showed consistently better agreement than
   recent conventional GIA models. The new empirically derived GIA rates
   suggest the presence of strong uplift in the Amundsen Sea sector in West
   Antarctica (WA) and the Philippi/Denman sectors, as well as subsidence
   in large parts of East Antarctica (EA). The total GIA-related mass
   change estimates for the entire Antarctic ice sheet ranged from 53 to
   103 Gt yr(-1), depending on the GRACE solution used, with an estimated
   uncertainty of +/- 40 Gt yr(-1). Over the time frame February
   2003-October 2009, the corresponding ice mass change showed an average
   value of -100 +/- 44 Gt yr(-1) (EA: 5 +/- 38, WA: -105 +/- 22),
   consistent with other recent estimates in the literature, with regional
   mass loss mostly concentrated in WA. The refined approach presented in
   this study shows the contribution that such data combinations can make
   towards improving estimates of present-day GIA and ice mass change,
   particularly with respect to determining more reliable uncertainties.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{7509-7516}},
Abstract = {{A number of variables contribute to the electropolymerization, and the
   electrochemical properties, of electroactive polymers. However, few
   studies have attempted to acquire a unified understanding of the effects
   of all these variables, specifically as it relates to the capacitance of
   the material, as the number of experiments and resources required is
   large. Here, the effects of seven variables on the areal capacitance of
   the electropolymerized dimethyl derivative of
   poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Me-2) films are analyzed
   utilizing a fractional factorial design of experiments to reduce the
   number of experiments an order of magnitude. From this analysis,
   PProDOT-Me-2 films were electropolymerized from an optimal set of
   variables to reproducibly afford films displaying the highest
   capacitances observed within this study. Devices were assembled from the
   optimized conditions, and the capacitance, energy, and power densities
   are reported in a framework that allows for meaningful comparison and
   understanding relative to commercially available supercapacitors. The
   supercapacitors fabricated in this study show promise towards being
   integrated as power sources for low-power, lightweight and flexible
   organic electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, sulfur tolerance of a conventional Ni-yttria stabilized

   demonstrates stable performance in a sulfur-containing H-2 fuel over 500
   hours. In contrast, the bare Ni-YSZ anode without surface modification
   degrades drastically when exposed to the sulfur-containing H-2 fuel.
   This implies that the BZCYYb coating is an excellent catalyst for
   surface modification of the conventional Ni-YSZ anode. A single step
   infiltration of BZCYYb into the Ni-YSZ anode was sufficient to provide

Abstract = {{In the pursuit to develop enhanced technologies for cellular bioassays
   as well as understand single cell interactions with its underlying
   substrate, the field of biotechnology has extensively utilized
   lithographic techniques to spatially pattern proteins onto surfaces in
   user-defined geometries. Microcontact printing (mu CP) remains an
   incredibly useful patterning method due to its inexpensive nature,
   scalability, and the lack of considerable use of specialized clean room
   equipment. However, as new technologies emerge that necessitate various
   nano-sized areas of deposited proteins, traditional mu CP methods may
   not be able to supply users with the needed resolution size. Recently,
   our group developed a modified ``subtractive mu CP{''} method which
   still retains many of the benefits offered by conventional mu CP. Using
   this technique, we have been able to reach resolution sizes of
   fibronectin as small as 250 nm in largely spaced arrays for cell
   culture. In this communication, we present a detailed description of our
   subtractive mu CP procedure that expands on many of the little tips and
   tricks that together make this procedure an easy and effective method
   for controlling protein patterning.}},

Title = {{Spike Sorting by Joint Probabilistic Modeling of Neural Spike Trains and
   Waveforms}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This paper details a novel probabilistic method for automatic neural
   spike sorting which uses stochastic point process models of neural spike
   trains and parameterized action potential waveforms. A novel likelihood
   model for observed firing times as the aggregation of hidden neural
   spike trains is derived, as well as an iterative procedure for
   clustering the data and finding the parameters that maximize the
   likelihood. The method is executed and evaluated on both a fully labeled
   semiartificial dataset and a partially labeled real dataset of
   extracellular electric traces from rat hippocampus. In conditions of
   relatively high difficulty (i.e., with additive noise and with similar
   action potential waveform shapes for distinct neurons) the method
   achieves significant improvements in clustering performance over a
   baseline waveform-only Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering on the
   semiartificial set (1.98\% reduction in error rate) and outperforms both
   the GMM and a state-of-the-art method on the real dataset (5.04\%
   reduction in false positive + false negative errors). Finally, an
   empirical study of two free parameters for our method is performed on
   the semiartificial dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Caenorhabditis elegans is a widely used model organism to study
   development, aging and behavior. Many of these biological studies
   require staging a large number of worms to assay a synchronized
   population of animals. Conventional synchronization techniques such as
   manual picking, gravity stratification and chemical bleaching are
   labor-intensive and could perturb animals' physiology. Thus, there is a
   need for a simple inexpensive technology to sort a mixed population of
   worms based on their developmental stages with minimal perturbation.
   Here we demonstrate a simple but accurate and high-throughput technique
   to sort based on animal size, which correlates well with developmental
   stages. The device consists of an array of geometrically optimized
   pillars that act as a sieve to allow worms of specific sizes to rapidly
   move through. With optimized chamber heights, pillar spacing and driving
   pressures, these binary separation devices are capable of independently
   separating a mixture of worms at two different stages at average
   efficiency of around 95\%, and throughput of hundreds of worms per
   minute. In addition, when four devices are used sequentially, we
   demonstrate the ability to stratify a mixture of worms of all
   developmental stages with >85\% overall efficiency.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms and shape predictions of nematic disclination branching under
   conical confinement}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3245-3258}},
Abstract = {{Liquid crystals (LCs) are self-organizing anisotropic viscoelastic soft
   materials that flow like viscous liquids and display anisotropies like
   crystals. When a nematic liquid crystal is confined to a capillary tube
   with strong anchoring conditions, disclination defects of higher (+1)
   and lower (+1/2) topological charges can coexist, connected through a
   defect branch point. The shape of the +1/2 disclination lines emanating
   from the branch point are functions of confinement and bulk elasticity.
   Previous work shows that nematic liquid crystals under cylindrical
   confinement display a radial (one + 1 line)-to-planar polar (two + 1/2
   lines) defect texture transition through the nucleation and uniform
   motion of a disclination branch point. Here we present analysis, scaling
   and modeling based on a non-linear non-local nematic elastic equation
   that shows that a branch point also can be generated from disclinations
   in a liquid crystal confined to different conical geometries with
   homeotropic anchoring conditions. The cone aperture increases the
   bending stiffness but decreases the curvature of the disclination. These
   competing effects lead to a decrease in the total disclination
   curvature, increase in elastic energy and volume of the branching
   region. The results are summarized into power laws and integrated into a
   shape/energy diagram that reveals the effects of confinement and its
   gradient (cone angle) on disclination shape selection. These new
   findings are useful to assess the Frank elasticity of new nematic liquid
   crystals and to predict novel defect structures in complex confinement,
   including biological microfluidics and mesophase fiber spinning.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing forms a potential route towards economically
   viable production of cellular constructs for tissue engineering.
   Hydrogels are a suitable class of materials for cell delivery and 3D
   culture, but are generally unsuitable as construction materials.
   Gelatine-methacrylamide is an example of such a hydrogel system widely
   used in the field of tissue engineering, e.g. for cartilage and
   cardiovascular applications. Here we show that by the addition of gellan
   gum to gelatine-methacrylamide and tailoring salt concentrations,
   rheological properties such as pseudo-plasticity and yield stress can be
   optimised towards gel dispensing for additive manufacturing processes.
   In the hydrogel formulation, salt is partly substituted by mannose to
   obtain isotonicity and prevent a reduction in cell viability. With this,
   the potential of this new bioink for additive tissue manufacturing
   purposes is demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Iterative CT reconstruction via minimizing adaptively reweighted total
   variation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-240}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Iterative reconstruction via total variation (TV)
   minimization has demonstrated great successes in accurate CT imaging
   from under-sampled projections. When projections are further reduced,
   over-smoothing artifacts appear in the current reconstruction especially
   around the structure boundaries.
   OBJECTIVE: We propose a practical algorithm to improve TV-minimization
   based CT reconstruction on very few projection data.
   METHOD: Based on the theory of compressed sensing, the L-0 norm approach
   is more desirable to further reduce the projection views. To overcome
   the computational difficulty of the non-convex optimization of the L-0
   norm, we implement an adaptive weighting scheme to approximate the
   solution via a series of TV minimizations for practical use in CT
   reconstruction. The weight on TV is initialized as uniform ones, and is
   automatically changed based on the gradient of the reconstructed image
   from the previous iteration. The iteration stops when a small difference
   between the weighted TV values is observed on two consecutive
   reconstructed images.
   RESULTS: We evaluate the proposed algorithm on both a digital phantom
   and a physical phantom. Using 20 equiangular projections, our method
   reduces reconstruction errors in the conventional TV minimization by a
   factor of more than 5, with improved spatial resolution.
   CONCLUSIONS: By adaptively reweighting TV in iterative CT
   reconstruction, we successfully further reduce the projection number for
   the same or better image quality.}},

   of a growth factor (TGF-beta 1) that remains bioactive. This system can

Abstract = {{Wireless power, when coupled with miniaturized implantable electronics,
   has the potential to provide a solution to several challenges facing
   neuroscientists during basic and preclinical studies with freely
   behaving animals. The EnerCage system is one such solution as it allows
   for uninterrupted electrophysiology experiments over extended periods of
   time and vast experimental arenas, while eliminating the need for bulky
   battery payloads or tethering. It has a scalable array of overlapping
   planar spiral coils (PSCs) and three-axis magnetic sensors for focused
   wireless power transmission to devices on freely moving subjects. In
   this paper, we present the first fully functional EnerCage system, in
   which the number of PSC drivers and magnetic sensors was reduced to
   one-third of the number used in our previous design via multicoil
   coupling. The power transfer efficiency (PTE) has been improved to 5.6\%
   at a 120 mm coupling distance and a 48.5 mm lateral misalignment (worst
   case) between the transmitter (Tx) array and receiver (Rx) coils. The
   new EnerCage system is equipped with an Ethernet backbone, further
   supporting its modular/scalable architecture, which, in turn, allows
   experimental arenas with arbitrary shapes and dimensions. A set of
   experiments on a freely behaving rat were conducted by continuously
   delivering 20 mW to the electronics in the animal headstage for more
   than one hour in a powered 3538 cm(2) experimental area.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite solar cells have garnered great attention in recent years as
   promising high performance next-generation solar cells with long-term
   stability at low cost. Since the seminal work of Miyasaka and others in
   2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite-based
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has rapidly increased from 3.8\% to
   15\% over the past four years, exceeding the highest efficiency of
   conventional organic dye-sensitized DSSCs. Recently, the perovskite has
   been demonstrated to act successfully as an active layer in simple
   planar-heterojunction solar cells with no need of complex nanostructured
   DSSC architectures, leading to an attractively high PCE of 15.4\% at a
   competitive low manufacturing cost. In this Feature Article, we aim to
   review the recent impressive development in perovskite solar cells, and
   discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting perovskite

   the linear burning rate was also examined. For an equivalence ratio of
   0.71, the mixture exhibited a linear burning rate of 4.8cm/s at a
   pressure of 10.7MPa and a pressure exponent of 0.79. Three motors of
   internal diameters in the range of 1.91-7.62cm were studied. Grain
   configuration, nozzle throat diameter, and igniter strength were varied.
   The propellants were successfully ignited and combusted in each
   laboratory-scale motor, generating thrust levels above 992N in the
   7.62-cm-diam motor with a center-perforated grain configuration (7.62cm
   length) and an expansion ratio of 10. For the 7.62cm motor, combustion
   efficiency was 69\%, whereas the specific impulse efficiency was 64\%.
   Increased combustion efficiency and improved ease of ignition were
   observed at higher chamber pressures (greater than 8MPa).}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of energy into the discharge channel of a 4.5kW Hall
   effect thruster from the discharge plasma is investigated. An array of
   35 thermocouples is placed along the inner and outer walls of the
   discharge channel at a spatial resolution sufficient to enable multiple
   temperature measurement locations within the positive gradient portion
   of the radial magnetic field profile. Temperature profiles of the inner
   and outer discharge channels are measured at Hall effect thruster
   discharge power levels ranging from 0.63 to 2.83kW, which correspond to
   peak wall temperatures of 578-813K. The peak in the wall temperature
   profile occurs at nearly the same axial location as the peak in the wall
   radial magnetic field profile. The energy flux from the plasma to the
   channel walls varies between 0.1 and 90W/cm2 +/- 2\% for Hall effect
   thruster operating conditions from 0.63 to 2.83kW. Approximately 13 +/-
   2\% of the discharge power is deposited into the discharge channel wall
   at all Hall effect thruster operating conditions. The average power
   radiated from the boron nitride discharge channel to the surroundings is
   approximately 14+4/-2\% of the discharge power at all operating

Abstract = {{A miniature, ultra-low power, sensitive, microbridge-based thermal
   conductivity gas sensor has been developed. The batch fabrication of the
   sensors was realized by CMOS compatible processes and surface
   micromachining techniques. Doped polysilicon was used as the structural
   material of the bridge with critical dimension of 500 nm. A model of the
   microbridge was simulated in COMSOL that couples electrical and thermal
   physics together and includes minimal. simplifications. Modeling results
   shows that the majority of heat is transferred via conduction through
   the gas gap under the bridge. Heat loss from constant voltage
   application was observed to be a function of the thermal conductivity of
   the gas ambient, resulting in different magnitude of resistance change.
   Maximum temperature occurs at the center of the bridge and could be as
   high as 800 K. Modeling results coincide with experimental data in
   predicting resistance changes. The sensor was tested with nitrogen,
   carbon dioxide, and helium. The response of the sensor to the mixtures
   of helium fractions in nitrogen was tested. We demonstrated that the
   sensitivity for helium in nitrogen was 0.34 m Omega/ppm when operated at
   3.6 V supplies (at power level of 4.3 mW). With a Wheatstone bridge with
   ac excitation and a lock-in amplifier the sensor limit of detection was
   similar to 700 ppm helium in nitrogen. The stability of the sensor was
   excellent achieving over 30 billion measurements before failure. (C)

Title = {{DISTRIBUTED RANDOM CONVEX PROGRAMMING VIA CONSTRAINTS CONSENSUS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{629-662}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses distributed approaches for the solution of random
   convex programs (RCPs). RCPs are convex optimization problems with a
   (usually large) number N of randomly extracted constraints; they arise
   in several application areas, especially in the context of
   decision-making under uncertainty; see {[}G. C. Calafiore, SIAM J.
   Optim., 20 (2010), pp. 3427-3464; G. C. Calafiore and M. C. Campi, IEEE
   Trans. Automat. Control, 51 (2006), pp. 742-753]. We here consider a
   setup in which instances of the random constraints (the scenario) are
   not held by a single centralized processing unit, but are instead
   distributed among different nodes of a network. Each node ``sees{''}
   only a small subset of the constraints, and may communicate with
   neighbors. The objective is to make all nodes converge to the same
   solution as the centralized RCP problem. To this end, we develop two
   distributed algorithms that are variants of the constraints consensus
   algorithm {[}G. Notarstefano and F. Bullo, Proceedings of the 46th IEEE
   Conference on Decision and Control, New Orleans, LA, 2007, pp. 927-932;
   G. Notarstefano and F. Bullo, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 56 (2011),
   pp. 2247-2261]: the active constraints consensus algorithm, and the
   vertex constraints consensus (VCC) algorithm. We show that the active
   constraints consensus algorithm computes the overall optimal solution in
   finite time, and with almost surely bounded communication at each
   iteration of the algorithm. The VCC algorithm is instead tailored for
   the special case in which the constraint functions are convex also with
   respect to the uncertain parameters, and it computes the solution in a
   number of iterations bounded by the diameter of the communication graph.
   We further devise a variant of the VCC algorithm, namely quantized
   vertex constraints consensus (qVCC), to cope with the case in which
   communication bandwidth among processors is bounded. We discuss several
   applications of the proposed distributed techniques, including
   estimation, classification, and random model predictive control, and we
   present a numerical analysis of the performance of the proposed methods.
   As a complementary numerical result, we show that the parallel
   computation of the scenario solution using the active constraints
   consensus algorithm significantly outperforms its centralized
   equivalent.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial innovation of household-scale water treatment (HWT) devices
   is rapid in India, where unsafe drinking water contributes to the high
   burden of disease and death associated with diarrhoeal diseases.
   Performance testing data for novel devices are not publicly available
   and there has been no systematic attempt to independently verify
   manufacturer effectiveness claims. We purchased three gravity-driven HWT
   devices available on the Indian market to evaluate their performance in
   reducing bacteria, viruses, and protozoan surrogates in the laboratory
   according to World Health Organization testing protocols. Results
   indicated that technologies were moderately effective in reducing
   Escherichia coli (1.6-2.9 log(10)) and MS2 (1.4-2.8 log(10)), and less
   effective against Bacillus subtilis spores (0.73-2.2 log(10)) and 3 mu m
   microspheres (0.33-0.56 log(10)), as means over the testing period
   (750-4,000 l). Effectiveness declined sharply over the duration of
   testing for each device, suggesting that the manufacturer-specified
   effective lifespans were overestimated for all devices. Moderate
   variability was observed across challenge conditions intended to
   represent actual use conditions, but performance was not significantly
   different between challenge waters or ambient testing temperature. Our
   results suggest that these novel devices do not meet international
   minimum performance recommendations and that manufacturer effectiveness
   claims are misleading. Further technological innovation and regulation
   in this sector may serve to protect public health.}},

Abstract = {{Water at elevated temperatures (WET) can act simultaneously as reactant,
   solvent, and catalyst in reaction processes. WET has been successfully
   employed in the removal of protecting groups alleviating the need for
   added strong acids/bases, subsequent neutralization and waste salt

   common protecting groups such as tert-butyl carbamates (N-Boc) from 125
   to 150 degrees C, acetamide (N-Ac) at 275 degrees C and acetate esters
   (O-Ac) at 250 degrees C are reported for different model aryl compounds.
   In addition, high yields and selective deprotection of one protecting
   group in the presence of another by simply tuning the temperature is
   demonstrated. In order to gain further insights into reaction processes,
   the aqueous solubilities of several of the reactants, the kinetics and
   mechanisms associated with some of these reactions are also discussed.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Capillarity and both gas and water permeabilities change as a function
   of gas saturation. Typical trends established in the discipline of
   unsaturated soil behavior are used when simulating gas production from
   hydrate-bearing sediments. However, the evolution of gas saturation and
   water drainage in gas invasion (i.e., classical soil behavior) and gas
   nucleation (i.e., gas production) is inherently different: micromodel
   experimental results show that gas invasion forms a continuous flow path
   while gas nucleation forms isolated gas clusters. Complementary
   simulations conducted using tube networks explore the implications of
   the two different desaturation processes. In spite of their distinct
   morphological differences in fluid displacement, numerical results show
   that the computed capillarity-saturation curves are very similar in gas
   invasion and nucleation (the gas-water interface confronts similar pore
   throat size distribution in both cases); the relative water permeability
   trends are similar (the mean free path for water flow is not affected by
   the topology of the gas phase); and the relative gas permeability is
   slightly lower in nucleation (delayed percolation of initially isolated
   gas-filled pores that do not contribute to gas conductivity). Models
   developed for unsaturated sediments can be used for reservoir simulation
   in the context of gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments, with
   minor adjustments to accommodate a lower gas invasion pressure P-o and a
   higher gas percolation threshold.

   activity}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3576-3584}},
Abstract = {{By subjecting amorphous flower-like TiO2 to a facile hydrothermal
   synthesis in the presence of Sr2+, garden-like perovskite SrTiO3
   superstructures were achieved. The amorphous TiO2 was preformed using
   ZnO flowers as templates. Different three-dimensional SrTiO3
   architectures were coexisted in the garden, including SrTiO3 flowers
   composed of several hollow sword-shaped petals, many sheet-shaped petals
   or numerous flake-shaped petals, and SrTiO3 grass consisting of a number
   of long blades. These SrTiO3 superstructures were simultaneously grown
   on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. On the basis of a
   comprehensive study on the effects of growth time, temperature, initial
   concentrations of precursor, and pH, the formation of these various
   hierarchical architectures was attributed primarily to the dissolution
   of amorphous TiO2 and precipitation of perovskite crystals, followed by
   the Ostwald ripening process of perovskite nanocrystals and
   self-organization of perovskite building blocks. Interestingly, this
   approach can be readily extended to create other perovskite structures,
   including dendritic BaTiO3 and nest-like CaTiO3, as well as PbTiO3
   transformed from plate-like pyrochlore Pb2Ti2O6 after post-thermal
   treatment. Garden-like SrTiO3 superstructures showed a superior
   photocatalytic performance when compared to other as-prepared
   semiconductors and perovskite materials (i.e., ZnO, TiO2, BaTiO3, CaTiO3
   and PbTiO3), probably due to their intrinsic photocatalytic activity and
   special garden-like features with a coexistence of various structures
   that significantly facilitated the adsorption and diffusion of methyl
   blue (MB) molecules and oxygen species in the photochemical reaction of
   MB degradation.}},

   MoO3-g-C3N4 composite under visible light irradiation}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{13610-13619}},
Abstract = {{Novel Z-scheme type MoO3-g-C3N4 composites photocatalysts were prepared
   with a simple mixing-calcination method, and evaluated for their
   photodegradation activities of methyl orange (MO). The optimized
   MoO3-g-C3N4 photocatalyst shows a good activity with a kinetic constant
   of 0.0177 min(-1), 10.4 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Controlling
   various factors (MoO3-g-C3N4 amount, initial MO concentration, and pH
   value of MO solution) can lead to the enhancement of the photocatalytic
   activity of the composite. Only MoO3 and g-C3N4 are detected with X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
   spectra. N-2 adsorption and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
   (DRS) results suggest that the addition of MoO3 slightly affects the
   specific surface area and the photoabsorption performance. The
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of MoO3-g-C3N4 indicates a
   close contact between MoO3 and g-C3N4, which is beneficial to
   interparticle electron transfer. The high photocatalytic activity of
   MoO3-g-C3N4 is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of MoO3 and
   g-C3N4 in electron-hole pair separation via the charge migration between
   the two semiconductors. The charge transfer follows direct Z-scheme
   mechanism, which is proven by the reactive species trapping experiment
   and the (OH)-O-center dot-trapping photoluminescence spectra.}},

   oxide thin films and nanostructures by CSD, with special emphasis on
   nucleation and growth phenomena. The effects of choice of precursor

   methods to control ferroelectric thin film's microstructure, including
   phase content, texture, grain size and chemical homogeneity, are
   reviewed. Lastly, current CSD-based methods for processing of
   ferroelectric oxide nanostructures are presented with special
   consideration of the structural development, as well as advantages and
   shortcomings associated with each method. Lead zirconate-titanate,
   Pb(ZrxTi1-x) O-3 (PZT), and barium titanate, BaTiO3 (BT), are used

   inside a dense carbon matrix. The resulting KCs offer specific surface
   areas close to 2000 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volumes exceeding 3 cm(3)
   g(-1), resulting from their hierarchical pore structure. High micropore
   volumes of 0.39 cm(3) g(-1) are achieved in alumina-based KCs due to the
   enhanced carbon etching reaction being mainly responsible for the
   evolution of porosity. Mesopore sizes are uniform and precisely
   controllable over a wide range by the template particle dimensions. The
   possibility of directly recycling the process exhaust gases for the
   template synthesis and the use of renewable carbohydrates as the carbon
   source lead to a scalable and efficient alternative to classical
   hard-and soft templating approaches for the production of mesoporous and
   hierarchical carbon materials. Silica-and alumina-based Kroll-carbons
   are versatile electrode materials in electrochemical double-layer
   capacitors (EDLCs). Specific capacitances of up to 135 F g(-1) in an
   aqueous electrolyte (1 M sulfuric acid) and 174 F g(-1) in ionic liquid
   (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) are achieved when
   measured in a symmetric cell configuration up to voltages of 0.6 and 2.5
   V, respectively. 90\% of the capacitance can be utilized at high current
   densities (20 A g(-1)) and room temperature rendering Kroll-carbons as
   attractive materials for EDLC electrodes resulting in high capacities
   and high rate performance due to the combined presence of micro-and
   mesopores.}},

   metathesis method, and click reaction. The star-shaped PS-b-P3HT diblock
   copolymers covalently connected to a beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) core
   were composed of 21-arm coil-like PS inner blocks and rod-like
   conjugated polymer P3HT outer blocks with narrow molecular weight

   (FTIR) spectroscopy. The optical properties of star-shaped PS-b-P3HT
   were examined by UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL)
   measurements. In comparison to the linear P3HT, due to their compact
   structure and the introduction of PS blocks, the optical properties of
   21-arm, star-shaped PS-b-P3HT were altered. The star-shaped PS-b-P3HT

Abstract = {{Considering their significant impact on construction projects,
   scaffolding as part of the temporary facilities category in construction
   must be thoroughly designed, planned, procured, and managed. The current
   practices in planning and managing scaffolding though is often manual
   and reactive, especially when a construction project is already
   underway. Widespread results are code compliance problems, inefficiency,
   and waste of procuring and managing material for scaffolding systems. We
   developed a rule-based system that automatically plans scaffolding
   systems for pro-active management in Building Information Modeling
   (BIM). The scope of the presented work is limited to traditional pipe
   and board scaffolding systems. A rule was prepared based on the current
   practice of planning and installing scaffolding systems. Our
   computational algorithms automatically recognize geometric and
   non-geometric conditions in building models and produce a scaffolding
   system design which a practitioner can use in the field. We implemented
   our automated scaffolding system for a commercially-available BIM
   software and tested it in a case study project. The system thoroughly
   identified the locations in need of scaffolding and generated the
   corresponding scaffolding design in BIM. Further results show, the
   proposed approach successfully generated a scaffolding system-loaded BIM
   model that can be utilized in communication, billing of materials,
   scheduling simulation, and as a benchmark for accurate field
   installation and performance measurement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{1909-1927}},
Abstract = {{Southern Africa is a significant source region of atmospheric pollution,
   yet long-term data on pollutant concentrations and properties from this
   region are rather limited. A recently established atmospheric
   measurement station in South Africa, Welgegund, is strategically
   situated to capture regional background concentrations, as well as
   emissions from the major source regions in the interior of South Africa.
   We measured non-refractive submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) and black carbon
   over a one year period in Welgegund, and investigated the seasonal and
   diurnal patterns of aerosol concentration levels, chemical composition,
   acidity and oxidation level. Based on air mass back trajectories, four
   distinct source regions were determined for NR-PM1. Supporting data
   utilised in our analysis included particle number size distributions,
   aerosol absorption, trace gas concentrations, meteorological variables
   and the flux of carbon dioxide.
   The dominant submicron aerosol constituent during the dry season was
   organic aerosol, reflecting high contribution from savannah fires and
   other combustion sources. Organic aerosol concentrations were lower
   during the wet season, presumably due to wet deposition as well as
   reduced emissions from combustion sources. Sulfate concentrations were
   usually high and exceeded organic aerosol concentrations when air-masses
   were transported over regions containing major point sources. Sulfate
   and nitrate concentrations peaked when air masses passed over the
   industrial High-veld (iHV) area. In contrast, concentrations were much
   lower when air masses passed over the cleaner background (BG) areas. Air
   masses associated with the anti-cyclonic recirculation (ACBIC) source
   region contained largely aged OA.
   Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of aerosol mass spectra was
   used to characterise the organic aerosol (OA) properties. The factors
   identified were oxidized organic aerosols (OOA) and biomass burning
   organic aerosols (BBOA) in the dry season and low-volatile (LV-OOA) and
   semi-volatile (SV-OOA) organic aerosols in the wet season. The results
   highlight the importance of primary BBOA in the dry season, which
   represented 33\% of the total OA. Aerosol acidity and its potential
   impact on the evolution of OOA are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an adaptive smoothing spline with a piecewise-constant
   penalty function lambda(x), in which a univariate smoothing parameter A
   in the classic smoothing spline is converted into an adaptive
   multivariate parameter lambda. Choosing the optimal value of lambda is
   critical for obtaining desirable estimates. We propose to choose lambda
   by minimizing a multivariate version of the generalized cross
   -validation function; the resulting estimator is shown to be consistent
   and asymptotically optimal under some general conditions-i.e., the
   counterparts of the nice asymptotic properties of the generalized cross
   validation in the ordinary smoothing spline are still provable. This
   provides theoretical justification of adopting the multivariate version
   of the generalized cross validation principle in adaptive smoothing

Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets have recently been adopted by botmasters for
   their resiliency against take-down efforts. Besides being harder to take
   down, modern botnets tend to be stealthier in the way they perform
   malicious activities, making current detection approaches ineffective.
   In addition, the rapidly growing volume of network traffic calls for
   high scalability of detection systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
   scalable botnet detection system capable of detecting stealthy P2P
   botnets. Our system first identifies all hosts that are likely engaged
   in P2P communications. It then derives statistical fingerprints to
   profile P2P traffic and further distinguish between P2P botnet traffic
   and legitimate P2P traffic. The parallelized computation with bounded
   complexity makes scalability a built-in feature of our system. Extensive
   evaluation has demonstrated both high detection accuracy and great
   scalability of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging imaging modality for medical
   applications, especially in disease diagnosis and image-guided surgery.
   HSI acquires a three-dimensional dataset called hypercube, with two
   spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension. Spatially resolved
   spectral imaging obtained by HSI provides diagnostic information about
   the tissue physiology, morphology, and composition. This review paper
   presents an overview of the literature on medical hyperspectral imaging
   technology and its applications. The aim of the survey is threefold: an
   introduction for those new to the field, an overview for those working
   in the field, and a reference for those searching for literature on a
   specific application. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Abstract = {{Simulations of platinum oxidation in literature have yet to fully
   replicate an experimental cyclic voltammogram. In this manuscript a
   mechanism for platinum oxidation is proposed based upon the results of
   in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, where it was found that PtO2
   is present at longer hold times. A new method to quantify extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure data is presented, and the extent of oxidation
   is directly compared to electrochemical data. This comparison indicated
   that PtO2 was formed at the expense of an initial oxide species. From
   previous literature studies it can be concluded that the rate of
   platinum oxidation is not a function of only potential and coverage. To
   that end, the concept of a heterogeneous oxide layer was introduced into
   the model, whereby placeexchanged PtO2 structures of varying energy
   states are formed through a single transition state. This treatment
   allowed, for the first time, the simulation of the correct
   current-potential behavior at varying scan rates and upper potential
   limits.}},

Title = {{Poly(fluorene-co-thiophene)-based ionic transition-metal complex
   polymers for solar energy harvesting and storage applications}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2363-2369}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical
   properties of two poly(fluorene-co-thiophene)-based polymers featuring
   pendant Ru(II) polypyridyl-based ionic transition metal complexes. These
   systems combine long-lived excited states of the Ru(II) chromophores and
   the large optical cross-sections of the conjugated backbones,
   potentially allowing for polymer-assisted solar radiation-harvesting and
   storage functions via ultrafast energy and charge transfer processes.
   Modified azide-alkyne ``click{''} cycloaddition chemistry conditions are
   demonstrated as an effective approach to obtain quantitatively
   functionalized conjugated polymer-ionic transition metal complex
   assemblies. Introduction of variable fractions of electron-rich
   thiophene units into these architectures induces a bathochromic shift in
   the polyfluorene absorption maxima, while simultaneously stabilizing the
   oxidized states of the conjugated scaffolds, as determined by
   electrochemical and in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The
   hybrid assemblies exhibit ultrafast energy flow (700 fs to 4.8 ps) and
   photoinduced charge-separation (1.8-2.0 ps) between the conjugated
   backbone and the Ru(II) moieties. Notably, the chemical composition of
   the main-chain repeat unit determines the dominant pathway for decay of
   the conjugated backbone excited states with the fraction of electron
   transfer increasing from 25\% to 75\% upon incorporation of an
   additional thiophene heterocycle.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1423-1439}},
Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields were measured for cyclododecane,
   hexylcyclohexane, n-dodecane, and 2-methylundecane under high-NOx
   conditions, in which alkyl proxy radicals (RO2) react primarily with NO,
   and under low-NOx conditions, in which RO2 reacts primarily with HO2.
   Experiments were run until 95-100\% of the initial alkane had reacted.
   Particle wall loss was evaluated as two limiting cases using a new
   approach that requires only suspended particle number-size distribution
   data and accounts for size-dependent particle wall losses and
   condensation. SOA yield differed by a factor of 2 between the two
   limiting cases, but the same trends among alkane precursors were
   observed for both limiting cases. Vapor-phase wall losses were addressed
   through a modeling study and increased SOA yield uncertainty by
   approximately 30 \%. SOA yields were highest from cyclododecane under
   both NOx conditions. SOA yields ranged from 3.3 \% (dodecane, low-NOx
   conditions) to 160 \% (cyclododecane, high-NOx conditions). Under
   high-NOx conditions, SOA yields increased from 2-methylundecane <
   dodecane similar to hexylcyclohexane < cyclododecane, consistent with
   previous studies. Under low-NOx conditions, SOA yields increased from
   2-methylundecane similar to dodecane < hexylcyclohexane < cyclododecane.
   The presence of cyclization in the parent alkane structure increased SOA
   yields, whereas the presence of branch points decreased SOA yields due
   to increased vapor-phase fragmentation. Vapor-phase fragmentation was
   found to be more prevalent under high-NOx conditions than under low-NOx
   conditions. For different initial mixing ratios of the same alkane and
   same NOx conditions, SOA yield did not correlate with SOA mass
   throughout SOA growth, suggesting kinetically limited SOA growth for
   these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean models that are able to provide accurate and real-time prediction
   of ocean currents will improve the performance of glider navigation. In
   this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute a model for ocean
   currents at higher resolution than existing approaches. By focusing on a
   small area and incorporating measurements from multiple gliders, we are
   able to perform real-time computation of the model, which can be used to
   improve performance of underwater glider navigation in the ocean. Our
   model uses a lower resolution, larger scale dataset generated from
   existing models to initialize the computation. We have also demonstrated
   incorporating data streams from high frequency (HF) radar measurements
   of surface currents. Glider navigation performance using the proposed
   ocean currents model is demonstrated in a simulated flow field based on
   data collected off the coast of Georgia, USA.}},

   volumetrically illuminated channels}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This study estimates the spatial resolution and accuracy of dual-tracer
   fluorescence thermometry (DFT) for measuring water temperature fields in
   channels where the entire channel is illuminated as is typical in
   microfluidics. Temperature fields are measured in heated laminar
   Poiseuille flow through a 1 mm 2 channel. The working fluid, an aqueous
   solution of the temperature-sensitive fluorophores fluorescein (Fl) and
   sulforhodamine B (SrB), is volumetrically illuminated over the entire
   channel cross-section at a wavelength of 514 nm, and the temperature of
   the solution is estimated from images of the longer-wavelength
   fluorescence from Fl and SrB. These temperature data are compared with
   numerical simulations of the same flow where the heat transferred to the
   water is estimated from independent measurements of wall surface
   temperature to determine the accuracy and the spatial resolution of the
   DFT results. The results suggest that temperature measurements in the
   volumetrically illuminated channel are significantly corrupted by the
   fluorescence emissions from beyond the focal plane. A model based on the
   point spread function for an aberration-free lens is employed to
   estimate the effect of the background ``noise,'' i.e., the signal from
   beyond the object plane, on the accuracy of these DFT measurements. The
   results show that this background is about 30 times the signal from the
   focal plane. Further experiments where the channel is illuminated by a
   light sheet over about 40 \% of the channel cross-section give estimates
   of the water temperature field that are on average within about 0.3
   degrees C of the numerical predictions at an in-plane spatial resolution
   of 50 mu m. The model is used to estimate the signal-to-background ratio
   for this case, as well as for a variety of commercially available
   microscope objectives.}},

Title = {{Interactions between mesenchymal stem cells, adipocytes, and osteoblasts
   in a 3D tri-culture model of hyperglycemic conditions in the bone marrow
   microenvironment}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{324-337}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have found that uncontrolled diabetes and consequential
   hyperglycemic conditions can lead to an increased incidence of
   osteoporosis. Osteoblasts, adipocytes, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
   are all components of the bone marrow microenvironment and thus may have
   an effect on diabetes-related osteoporosis. However, few studies have
   investigated the influence of these three cell types on each other,
   especially in the context of hyperglycemia. Thus, we developed a
   hydrogel-based 3D culture platform engineered to allow live-cell
   retrieval in order to investigate the interactions between MSCs,
   osteoblasts, and adipocytes in mono-, co-, and tri-culture
   configurations under hyperglycemic conditions for 7 days of culture.
   Gene expression, histochemical analysis of differentiation markers, and
   cell viability were measured for all cell types, and MSC-laden hydrogels
   were degraded to retrieve cells to assess their colony-forming capacity.
   Multivariate models of gene expression data indicated that primary
   discrimination was dependent on the neighboring cell type, validating
   the need for co-culture configurations to study conditions modeling this
   disease state. MSC viability and clonogenicity were reduced when
   mono-and co-cultured with osteoblasts at high glucose levels. In
   contrast, MSCs showed no reduction of viability or clonogenicity when
   cultured with adipocytes under high glucose conditions, and the
   adipogenic gene expression indicates that cross-talk between MSCs and
   adipocytes may occur. Thus, our unique culture platform combined with
   post-culture multivariate analysis provided a novel insight into
   cellular interactions within the MSC microenvironment and highlights the
   necessity of multi-cellular culture systems for further investigation of
   complex pathologies such as diabetes and osteoporosis.}},

   efficiency}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{324-332}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Poor CO2 displacement efficiency can exacerbate hydro-chemo-mechanically
   coupled phenomena in CO2 storage reservoirs, increase the area affected
   by CO2 in the reservoir, and negatively impact the long-term geological
   storage of CO2. The injection of CO2 can be engineered using surfactants
   to improve displacement efficiency. Pendant and sessile drop tests show
   that a surfonic copolymer decreases the interfacial tension gamma(fl)
   and increases the contact angle theta under reservoir conditions. The
   combined changes in surface tension and contact angle have a pronounced
   effect on the capillary factor gamma(fl)-cos theta. Injection tests
   using micro-models and pore network simulations show that a smaller
   capillary factor transforms the displacement pattern and enhances the
   pore-scale sweep efficiency of CO2, surpassing 40\% in 2-D applications.

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1281-1293}},
Abstract = {{We report on the development of a vertical and transparent microfluidic
   chip for high-throughput phenotyping of Arabidopsis thaliana plants.
   Multiple Arabidopsis seeds can be germinated and grown hydroponically
   over more than two weeks in the chip, thus enabling large-scale and
   quantitative monitoring of plant phenotypes. The novel vertical
   arrangement of this microfluidic device not only allows for normal
   gravitropic growth of the plants but also, more importantly, makes it
   convenient to continuously monitor phenotypic changes in plants at the
   whole organismal level, including seed germination and root and shoot
   growth (hypocotyls, cotyledons, and leaves), as well as at the cellular
   level. We also developed a hydrodynamic trapping method to automatically
   place single seeds into seed holding sites of the device and to avoid
   potential damage to seeds that might occur during manual loading. We
   demonstrated general utility of this microfluidic device by showing
   clear visible phenotypes of the immutans mutant of Arabidopsis, and we
   also showed changes occurring during plant-pathogen interactions at
   different developmental stages. Arabidopsis plants grown in the device
   maintained normal morphological and physiological behaviour, and
   distinct phenotypic variations consistent with a priori data were
   observed via high-resolution images taken in real time. Moreover, the
   timeline for different developmental stages for plants grown in this
   device was highly comparable to growth using a conventional agar plate
   method. This prototype plant chip technology is expected to lead to the
   establishment of a powerful experimental and cost-effective framework
   for high-throughput and precise plant phenotyping.}},

   exchange reactions}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{10108-10117}},
Abstract = {{It was recently reported that thermally malleable polymers with bond
   exchange reactions (BERs) can rearrange their microscopic network
   topology without impairing the network integrity. Besides, two pieces of
   polymers were shown to be able to weld together upon heating without
   introducing additional monomers or chemicals on the interface, enabling
   thermoforming, self-healing, and reprocessing of the polymer, which has
   drawn significant interest in the study of this type of polymers. This
   new breakthrough also opens an avenue to recycle thermoset polymers that
   traditionally are very difficult to recycle. This paper experimentally
   studies the reprocessing and recycling ability of a thermoset polymer
   (an epoxy thermosetting network) with exchangeable bonds in a pulverous
   state. Due to the large surface area and small size of polymer
   particles, their handling, transportation, and storage can offer
   convenience in comparison with traditional polymer scrap in bulk form,
   which can advance their immediate industrial applications in thermoset
   recycling, structure rehabilitations and component rework. A detailed
   investigation was performed to study the effect of reprocessing
   conditions (such as time and pressure) on the material mechanical
   performance. The reprocessing routine was also repeated multiple times
   (representing multiple generations of recycling) to manufacture complex
   objects and to join two separate bulk polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The core requirements for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics necessitate
   low-cost, portability, easily integrated sample preparation, and quick
   measurement time. Frequency-shift based magnetic sensing is a
   measurement technique utilizing a complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integratedcircuit (IC) chip for
   magnetic label detection. The sensing scheme leverages the low-cost
   manufacturing of IC chips while demonstrating the potential for
   multiplexing capabilities. In this article, we present modifications to
   this scheme for POC viability. We introduce a handheld reusable reader
   and a disposable open-well cartridge for the detection of nucleic acids
   and antigens. The diagnostic system utilizes a novel ``magnetic
   freezing{''} technique to reduce measurement time, obviates baseline
   measurement before or during biological assay, and reduces sensor noise.
   We utilize these enhancements for the room temperature,
   amplification-free detection of a 31 base-pair DNA oligomer and the
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) protein. We have demonstrated reliable
   measurements down to 100 pM for the DNA assay and 1 pM for the protein.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma enhanced physical vapor depositions are extensively used to
   fabricate substrates for cell culture applications. One peculiarity of
   the plasma processes is the possibility to deposit thin films with
   reproducible chemical and physical properties. In the present work, a
   combinatorial plasma polymerization process was used to deposit thin
   carbon based films to promote cell adhesion, in the interest of testing
   cell proliferation as a function of the substrate chemical properties.
   Peculiarity of the combinatorial approach is the possibility to produce
   in just one deposition experiment, a set of surfaces of varying chemical
   moieties by changing the precursor composition. A full characterization
   of the chemical, physical and thermodynamic properties was performed for
   each set of the synthesized surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   was used to measure the concentration of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amine
   functional groups on the substrate surfaces. A perfect linear trend
   between polar groups' density and precursors' concentration was found.
   Further analyses reveled that also contact angles and the correspondent
   surface energies of all deposited thin films are linearly dependent on
   the precursor concentration. To test the influence of the surface
   composition on the cell adhesion and proliferation, two cancer cell
   lines were utilized. The cell viability was assessed after 24 h and 48 h
   of cell culture. Experiments show that we are able to control the cell
   adhesion and proliferation by properly changing the thin film deposition
   conditions i.e. the concentration and the kind of chemical moiety on the
   substrate surface. The results also highlight that physical and chemical
   factors of biomaterial surface, including surface hydrophobicity and
   free energy, chemical composition, and topography, can altered cell
   attachment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Texas City refinery accident: Case study in breakdown of
   defense-in-depth and violation of the safety-diagnosability principle in
   design}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{121-133}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In 2005 an explosion rocked the BP Texas City refinery, killing 15
   people and injuring 180. The company incurred direct and indirect
   financial losses on the order of billions of dollars for victims'
   compensation as well as significant property damage and loss of
   production. The internal BP accident investigation and the Chemical
   Safety Board investigation identified a number of factors that
   contributed to the accident. In this work, we first examine the accident
   pathogens or lurking adverse conditions at the refinery prior to the
   accident. We then analyze the sequence of events that led to the
   explosion, and we highlight some of the provisions for the
   implementation of defense-in-depth and their failures. Next we identify
   a fundamental failure mechanism in this accident, namely the absence of
   observability or ability to diagnose hazardous states in the operation
   of the refinery, in particular within the raffinate splitter tower and
   the blowdown drum of the isomerization unit. We propose a general
   safety-diagnosability principle for supporting accident prevention,
   which requires that all safety-degrading events or states that
   defense-in-depth is meant to protect against be diagnosable, and that
   breaches of safety barriers be unambiguously monitored and reported. The
   safety-diagnosability principle supports the development of a
   ``living{''} or online quantitative risk assessment, which in turn can
   help re-order risk priorities in real time based on emerging hazards,
   and re-allocate defensive resources. We argue that the
   safety-diagnosability principle is an essential ingredient for improving
   operators' situation awareness. Violation of the safety-diagnosability
   principle translates into a shrinking of the time window available for
   operators to understand an unfolding hazardous situation and intervene
   to abate it. Compliance with this new safety principle provides one way
   to improve operators' sensemaking and situation awareness and decrease
   the conditional probability that an accident will occur following an
   adverse initiating event. We suggest that defense-in-depth be augmented
   with this principle, without which it can degenerate into an ineffective
   defense-blind safety strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Students are a primary stakeholder in engineering Capstone Design
   courses, but the student voice risks being overlooked in discussions of
   Capstone Design pedagogy and development. While many engineering
   programs collect student feedback and performance data for accreditation
   purposes, the engineering education and engineering design literature
   provide few resources that capture student perspectives on Capstone
   Design, especially across multiple institutions. The 2012 Capstone
   Design Conference hosted two well-attended panel sessions called
   ``Student Reflections on Capstone Design{''} specifically to highlight
   student experiences in Capstone Design courses with industry-sponsored
   projects. Each panel featured four different panelists who had recently
   completed their Capstone Design courses, had worked with different
   industrial sponsors, and represented different institutions and
   engineering disciplines. The facilitator of each panel asked the same
   initial questions of the respective panelists and then opened the
   conversation to questions from the audience. Although the trajectory of
   the two panels varied, content analysis of the transcribed discussions
   revealed similar themes from both groups. This paper addresses the
   analysis methodology, emerging themes, and sample
   reflections/suggestions from the student panelists. Discussion of the
   themes and student comments provides a foundation of student
   perspectives to aid faculty and industry liaisons in strengthening the
   Capstone Design experience.}},

Abstract = {{Many U.S. cities use vehicle emissions testing programs to improve air
   quality by identifying gross polluting vehicles and requiring their
   owners to make emissions-related repairs. All vehicles that meet certain
   criteria must pass an emissions test as part of the vehicle registration
   process. States use different criteria to determine which vehicles must
   be tested; however, the equity impacts associated with various screening
   criteria are unknown. This is due to difficulties researchers have faced
   in linking vehicle and household characteristics. We investigate the
   relative influence of vehicle and household characteristics on emissions
   failures in Atlanta, Georgia, by linking its emissions testing database
   to a targeted marketing database; the latter contains information about
   vehicle owners. We use count and hurdle models to predict vehicle
   emissions failures. Our model finds a relationship between
   sociodemographic characteristics and emissions failures after
   controlling for vehicle characteristics; that is, given two identical
   vehicles, the one owned by a low-income or minority household is more
   likely to fail emissions. We use our model to investigate the impacts of
   different emissions testing policies by income and ethnic groups. (C)

Abstract = {{First-principle calculations are carried out to study the diffusion of
   Li ions in rutile structure RuO2, a material for positive electrodes in
   rechargeable Li ion batteries. The calculations focus on migration
   pathways and energy barriers for diffusion in Li-poor and Li-rich phases
   using the Nudged Elastic Band Method. Diffusion coefficients estimated
   based on calculated energy barriers are in good agreement with
   experimental values reported in the literature. The results confirm the
   anisotropic nature of diffusion of Li ions in one-dimensional c channels
   along the {[}001] crystalline direction of rutile RuO2 and show that Li
   diffusion in the Li-poor phase is faster than in the Li-rich phase. The
   findings of fast Li diffusion and feasible Li insertion at low
   temperatures in the host rutile RuO2 suggest this material is a good
   ionic conductor for Li transport. The finding also suggests possible
   means for enhancing the performance of RuO2-based electrode materials.

Abstract = {{Probably the most prominent expectation associated with systems biology
   is the computational support of personalized medicine and predictive
   health. At least some of this anticipated support is envisioned in the
   form of disease simulators that will take hundreds of personalized
   biomarker data as input and allow the physician to explore and optimize
   possible treatment regimens on a computer before the best treatment is
   applied to the actual patient in a custom-tailored manner. The key
   prerequisites for such simulators are mathematical and computational
   models that not only manage the input data and implement the general
   physiological and pathological principles of organ systems but also
   integrate the myriads of details that affect their functionality to a
   significant degree. Obviously, the construction of such models is an
   overwhelming task that suggests the long-term development of
   hierarchical or telescopic approaches representing the physiology of
   organs and their diseases, first coarsely and over time with increased
   granularity. This article illustrates the rudiments of such a strategy
   in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) of the lung. The starting point
   is a very simplistic, generic model of inflammation, which has been
   shown to capture the principles of infection, trauma, and sepsis
   surprisingly well. The adaptation of this model to CF contains as
   variables healthy and damaged cells, as well as different classes of
   interacting cytokines and infectious microbes that are affected by mucus
   formation, which is the hallmark symptom of the disease (Perez-Vilar and
   Boucher, 2004) {[}1). The simple model represents the overall dynamics
   of the disease progression, including so-called acute pulmonary
   exacerbations, quite well, but of course does not provide much detail
   regarding the specific processes underlying the disease. In order to
   launch the next level of modeling with finer granularity, it is
   desirable to determine which components of the coarse model contribute
   most to the disease dynamics. The article introduces for this purpose
   the concept of module gains or ModGains, which quantify the sensitivity
   of key disease variables in the higher-level system. In reality, these
   variables represent complex modules at the next level of granularity,
   and the computation of ModGains therefore allows an importance ranking
   of variables that should be replaced with more detailed models. The
   ``hot-swapping{''} of such detailed modules for former variables is
   greatly facilitated by the architecture and implementation of the
   overarching, coarse model structure, which is here formulated with
   methods of biochemical systems theory (BST). This article is part of a

Abstract = {{Propionic acid (PA) production with metabolically engineered
   Propionibacterium jensenii (pZGX04-gldA) was improved by integrating
   fed-batch culture with a two-stage pH control strategy in a 3-L
   fermenter. The following two-stage pH control strategy was used: the pH
   was controlled at 5.9 for 0-36 h and shifted to 6.5 after 36 h. The PA
   titer was increased to 21.43 g/L. On the basis of pH control, the
   influence of fed-batch culture on PA production was further investigated
   and the maximum PA production (34.62 g/L) was obtained when glycerol was
   fed at a constant rate of 3.33 mL/h from 60 to 132 h with an initial
   glycerol concentration of 25 g/L. Crude glycerol was then used to
   produce PA using the optimized strategies, and maximal PA production
   reached 37.26 g/L. The strategies may be useful for the production of PA
   by other propionibacteria species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: Our goal was to identify the cellular and molecular effects of
   2-ethylpyridine (2-EP, a component of cigarette smoke) on human retinal
   pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) in vitro. Materials and Methods:
   ARPE-19 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of 2-EP. Cell
   viability (CV) was measured by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay.
   Caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activities were measured by fluorochrome
   assays. The production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) was
   detected with a 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofl uorescein diacetate dye assay.
   The JC-1 assay was used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential
   (Delta Psi m). Mitochondrial redox potential was measured using a
   RedoxSensor Red kit and mitochondria were evaluated with Mitotracker
   dye. Results: Aft er 2-EP exposure, ARPE-19 cells showed significantly
   decreased CV, increased caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activities, elevated
   ROS/RNS levels, decreased Delta Psi m value and decreased redox
   fluorescence when compared with control samples. Conclusions: These
   results show that 2-EP treatment induced cell death by caspase-dependent
   apoptosis associated with an oxidative stress and mitochondrial
   dysfunction. These data represent a possible mechanism by which smoking
   contributes to age-related macular degeneration and other retinal
   diseases and identify mitochondria as a target for future therapeutic
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed to predict
   the penetration depth of a non-Newtonian fluid as it is directly coated

   of coating a non-Newtonian solution (black strap molasses) onto carbon
   paper (Toray 090) are conducted and the penetration depths are measured
   to validate the model. Preliminary results show that predicted and
   measured penetration depths follow the same trend; that is, as the
   coating speed increases the penetration depth decreases. However, the
   simulated penetration depths are found to be one to two times higher
   than measured values at low coating speeds. Even so, the results are
   considered reasonable, due to imposed simplifications and approximations
   of the CFD model and errors associated with the experiments and

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to investigate the feasibility of
   extending the velocity boundary during the slot die casting of a polymer
   film, by studying the dynamics of entrained bubbles as they transition

   relatively high viscosity non-Newtonian solution. A 2D computational
   fluid dynamics model, using ANSYS FLUENT 13.0 software, was developed to
   analyze this behavior. The volume of fluid method and enthalpy-porosity
   technique were used to track the air (i.e., entrained bubbles) and fluid
   phases and the solidification of the solution, respectively. It has been
   found that for this class of solution, bubbles that are entrained in the
   fluid phase will not diffuse out of the fluid due to the stresses formed
   during solidification. Thus, for relatively high viscosity non-Newtonian
   solution, the upper boundary of the casting window cannot be extended
   after a defect has originated in the film during the casting process.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of the wetting characteristics of a coating solution is a
   prerequisite of assuring the final quality of thin films manufactured by
   the slot die coating process. Because the maximum coating speed is
   limited by defects, such as air entrainment, which are directly related
   to film quality, an understanding of the coating limits is critical.
   Despite the existence of a vast body of literature to understand the
   occurrence of defects and the coating limits to produce defect-free
   films, the mechanism of air entrainment is still not well understood,
   especially for various classes of solutions. In this study, the shape of
   the upstream meniscus of a mildly shear thinning non-Newtonian coating
   bead has been studied both numerically and experimentally and
   subsequently linked to the air entrainment threshold. It has been found
   that the dynamic contact angle reaches its maximum value at the air
   entrainment threshold, primarily as a function of the capillary number.
   In addition, this work suggests that the onset of the dripping and air
   entrainment boundaries of solutions that follow the power law can be
   predicted based on the dynamic contact angle as a function of the
   consistency and power law indices.}},

Abstract = {{We report on semitransparent air-processed all-plastic solar cells,

   fullerene photoactive layer. The active layer and the top PEDOT:PSS
   electrode were prepared by sequential film-transfer lamination on
   polyethylenimine-modified PEDOT: PSS bottom electrodes. The transferring
   of films offers ease of layer patterning and the misalignment of defects
   in the different layers resulting from the additive film transfer
   lamination process yields high shunt resistance values of 10(8) ohm
   cm(2). Consequently, all-plastic solar cells fabricated with this
   process exhibit very low reverse bias dark current and can operate in
   the photovoltaic quadrant with light irradiance varying over five orders
   of magnitude. The analysis of the values of the open-circuit voltage as
   a function of light irradiance over that wide dynamic range points
   toward an ideality factor of n = 1.82 and a reverse saturation current

Abstract = {{Mapping the nucleation and 3D fault tip growth of the active Osaka-wan
   blind thrust provides an opportunity to asses how reactivated thrusts
   build slip from preexisting faults and the threat they pose as sources
   of large earthquakes. Analysis of folded growth strata, based on 2D
   trishear inverse modeling allows a range of best-fit models of the
   evolution of slip and propagation of the fault to be defined. The depth
   of the fault tip at 1200 ka varies between similar to 1.5-4.5 km,
   suggesting the fault grew upward from high in the crust, and that it is
   reactivated. From its onset at similar to 1500 ka, the fault grew
   rapidly along strike in similar to 300 ky, and upwards with a P/S ratio
   of 2.5-3.0, but variable fault slip in space and time. Shallower depths
   of the fault tip at initiation and thinner basin fill correlates with
   slower propagation with time, contradicting models that argue for
   sediments as inhibitors of fault growth. Results also suggest the
   displacement profile of the currently active thrust is offset from its
   predecessor, assuming shallower depths to the original fault correlate
   with greater displacement in its prior history. These results suggest
   reactivated faults may accrue slip differently than newly developed
   ones, based on the history of upward fault propagation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We have developed a three-channel microfluidic device with embedded
   chambers useful for the study of bacterial chemotaxis and sample
   processing. The device is capable of generating linear chemical
   gradients in the embedded chambers that are free of flow disturbances.
   These linear chemical gradients are established by diffusing a chemical
   through widely available nitrocellulose material that serves as a
   permeable membrane between the adjacent supply channels and embedded
   chambers. The generated gradients were confirmed by measuring the
   fluorescent molecules diffused through the source channel into the
   chamber on a fluorescence microscope. As the gradients were generated
   without through-flow, cell movement in the chambers is caused solely by
   the cells' random motility or chemotactic response up or down a chemical
   gradient and not interfered by fluid flow. A precise laser cutting
   technique was utilized to create the microfluidic design in the membrane
   layer. The advantages of this microfluidic design are (i) a rapid
   implementation of a static chemical gradient can be established; (ii)
   two chemoeffectors can be simultaneously studied and compared; (iii)
   multiple chambers can be used for a reproducible study; (iv) the design
   can be fabricated at a low cost. Using a Nikon Ti microscope, food borne
   pathogen E Coli O157 was observed in the microfluidic device to swim
   toward the attractant, L-aspartic acid (500 uM) and away from the
   repellent, NiCl2 (500 uM). The chemotactic responses to the chemicals
   were quantified using the cell population ratios in the chambers close
   to the source channel and the buffer channel respectively. (C) 2013 The

   diffusivity in turbulent mixing,{''} J. Fluid Mech. 716, R14 (2013)]

   5, 134 (1959)] for turbulent passive scalar fields with very strong
   diffusivity, decaying in the absence of any production mechanism. In
   particular, we confirmed the existence of the -17/3 power of the scalar
   spectral density in the so-called inertial-diffusive range. In the
   present paper, we consider the DNS of the same problem, but in the
   presence of a uniform mean gradient, which leads to the production of
   scalar fluctuations at (primarily) the large scales. For the parameters
   of the simulations, the presence of the mean gradient alters the physics
   of mixing fundamentally at low Peclet numbers. While the spectrum still
   follows a -17/3 power law in the inertial-diffusive range, the
   pre-factor is non-universal and depends on the magnitude of the mean
   scalar gradient. Spectral transfer is greatly reduced in comparison with
   those for moderately and weakly diffusive scalars, leading to several
   distinctive features such as the absence of dissipative anomaly and a
   new balance of terms in the spectral transfer equation for the scalar
   variance, differing from the case of zero gradient. We use the DNS
   results to present an alternative explanation for the observed scaling
   behavior, and discuss a few spectral characteristics in detail. (C) 2014

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1246-1263}},
Abstract = {{The recent interest in reconfigurable soft materials may lead to the
   next paradigm in the development of adaptive and actuating materials and
   structures. Actuating soft materials eventually can be precisely
   designed to show stimuli-sensing, multi-length scale actuation, tunable
   transport, programmed shape control and multifunctional orthogonal
   responses. Herein, we discuss the various advances in the emerging field
   of reconfigurable soft materials with a focus on the various parameters
   that can be modulated to control a complex system behavior. In
   particular, we detail approaches that use either long-range fields (i.
   e. electrical, magnetic) or changes in local thermodynamic parameters
   (e. g., solvent quality) in order to elicit a precise dimensional and
   controlled response. The theoretical underpinnings and practical
   considerations for different approaches are briefly presented alongside
   several illustrative examples from the recent studies. In the end, we
   summarize recent accomplishments, critical issues to consider, and give
   perspectives on the developments of this exciting research field.}},

Abstract = {{A material's mechanical properties greatly control cell behavior at the

   multilayers have unique elastic and viscoelastic-like properties that
   can be modulated to produce morphological changes in fibroblasts
   cultured on the film. Protein adsorption is also examined and the data
   are contrasted with the number of cells adhered. The dynamic interaction
   of cell and substrate is only partially explained by conventional
   understanding of surface-receptor interactions and substrate elasticity.
   Viscoelasticity, a mechanical property not often considered, plays a
   significant role at cellular length and time scales for microgel films.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging guided ablation therapy has been applied in both biomedical

   nanocapsules were fabricated through loading perfluorooctylbromide

   poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanocapsules (NCs), followed by the formation of
   PEGylated gold nanoshell on the surface. The resulting multi-component
   NCs were proved to be able to act as nanotheranostic agent to achieve
   successful bimodal ultrasound (US)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   guided photothermal ablation in human tumor xenograft models
   non-invasively. Such a single theranostic agent with the combination of
   real-time US and high-resolution MR imaging would be of great value to

Abstract = {{This review places modern research developments in vascular
   mechanobiology in the context of hemodynamic phenomena in the
   cardiovascular system and the discrete localization of vascular disease.
   The modern origins of this field are traced, beginning in the 1960s when
   associations between flow characteristics, particularly blood
   flow-induced wall shear stress, and the localization of atherosclerotic
   plaques were uncovered, and continuing to fluid shear stress effects on
   the vascular lining endothelial cells (ECs), including their effects on
   EC morphology, biochemical production, and gene expression. The earliest
   single-gene studies and genome-wide analyses are considered. The final
   section moves from the ECs lining the vessel wall to the smooth muscle
   cells and fibroblasts within the wall that are fluid mechanically
   activated by interstitial flow that imposes shear stresses on their
   surfaces comparable with those of flowing blood on EC surfaces.
   Interstitial flow stimulates biochemical production and gene expression,
   much like blood flow on ECs.}},

Abstract = {{The physical and transport properties of Li+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+
   neutralized Nafion were compared to its acid form. Nafion crystallinity
   was disrupted with a variety of cations while average d-spacing remained
   constant. Higher thermal stability in metal ion exchanged Nafion was
   observed using TGA. Ionic interactions were probed by DMA and
   spectroscopic techniques. Divalent ca(2+) exhibited a distinctive
   influence on the chain's mobility as compared to monovalent ions. The
   interaction strength cation exchanged Nafion decreased in the following
   order: Li+ > Ca2+ > Na+ > K+. Gas permeability increases were primarily
   attributed to gas solubility. Nafion had a higher gas activation energy
   E-p, but its permeability was lower than unsulfonated PTFE. (C) 2013

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{144-158}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Opportunistic Large Array (OLA) is one type of cooperative
   transmission, which provides fast and reliable broadcasts and unicasts
   in multi-hop networks. While the existing literature on OLAs assumes
   one-shot transmission with a single packet, we analyze multi-packet OLA
   transmission within a single flow along strip-shaped networks or
   OLA-based cooperative routes. When multiple packets are transmitted from
   the same source using the same channel before the previous packet has
   cleared the network, which is called spatial pipelining, intra-flow
   interference is produced by OLAs transmitting co-channel packets. Using
   the continuum assumption (approximated by high density networks), the
   authors optimize the throughput. This paper theoretically shows spatial
   pipelining over strip networks is always feasible for path loss exponent
   alpha >= 2, which is not true for disk-shaped networks. Moreover, the
   impacts of system parameters are analyzed, and the upper bound of the
   optimal packet spacing (the lower bound of the optimal throughput) is
   derived. Also, spatial pipelining in finite networks is studied with
   numerical results, which confirm the theoretical analysis.}},

Journal = {{PROCESS BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{120-123}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sludge is typically conditioned with petroleum-based polymers such as
   cationic polyacrylamides (c-PAMs) prior to dewatering. It is shown that
   soy and whey proteins can function as sludge conditioners. High cake
   solids are obtained when fiber or fibrous sludge is dewatered after
   treatment with a crude soy flour hydrolysate. Filtrate turbidity is not
   reduced by the soy alone, but it can be significantly lowered with a
   small c-PAM supplement. The approach is demonstrated with wood pulp
   fiber and several paper mill sludges. The binding of soy protein to
   sludge solids is much weaker than that of c-PAM, but it still produces a
   denser cake because charge reversal is reduced. Although soy protein and
   sludge particles are both negatively charged overall they both contain
   positively charged groups that facilitate bonding. The cost:benefits of
   c-PAM supplemented soy protein are attractive when compared to a full
   c-PAM dose. In addition, the soy product has a green value. (C) 2013

Title = {{On the periodicity of traffic oscillations and capacity drop: The role
   of driver characteristics}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{117-136}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper shows that traffic hysteresis arises due to variable driver
   characteristics within each driver and has a profound reproducible
   impact on the periodicity and development of traffic oscillations and
   the bottleneck discharge rate. Following an oscillation, traffic
   initially exhibits lower density and flow; then it evolves toward and
   eventually exceeds the equilibrium, whereupon another oscillation is
   instigated by an aggressive driver(s) with relatively small response
   time and minimum spacing. Thereafter, traffic reverts to lower density
   and flow and repeats the evolutionary cycle. Aggressive driver behavior
   also leads to hysteresis loops that induce the upstream propagation of
   oscillations; with larger hysteresis loops inducing larger oscillation
   growth. Our finding also suggests that the bottleneck discharge rate can
   diminish by 8-23\% when drivers adopt larger response times in reaction
   to disturbances. This finding suggests that existing capacity-drop
   theories, with lane-changes as the main factor, may be incomplete. (C)

Abstract = {{We determine the optimal nonuniform spatial density of nodes in a
   single-hop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) whose task is the distributed
   detection of a target within its sensing field. The optimization
   approach accounts for such factors as the Medium Access Control (MAC)
   protocol being used, the wireless channel's propagation characteristics,
   a randomized sleep/wake-up scheduling protocol, network coverage
   constraints, the energy consumed, the time to reach a decision, and the
   number of nodes in the network. The node density that minimizes the
   average Decision Error Probability (DEP) when a node at the center of
   the network serves as the Cluster Head (CH) is shown to be a function of
   the distance from this CH. The solution of this optimization problem and
   simulations demonstrate both the significant performance improvement
   provided by nonuniform spatial densities and the trade-offs that are
   possible amongst energy, network lifetime, detection performance, and

   distributed in the environment due to its worldwide intensive use. The
   interactions between potentially competing microbial processes (i.e.,
   iron reduction, nitrate reduction, methanogenesis, and dechlorination)
   can significantly influence the environmental fate of PCNB and
   chloroanilines resulting from the reductive biotransformation of PCNB.
   This review evaluates presently available toxicity and distribution
   information as well as the transformation and degradation potential of
   PCNB and chloroanilines under different environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing differential receivers for ultra-wideband (UWB)
   communications employ Gaussian approximation for multiple access
   interference (MAI). However, for a system with strong interference
   caused by a small number of active users, significant performance
   degradation is found for differential UWB receivers due to the
   impreciseness of Gaussian approximation on impulsive MAI. In this paper,
   we propose new differential UWB receivers based on the generalized
   Gaussian (GG) distribution, which subsumes Gaussian distribution and
   Laplace distribution as special cases. Numerical results show that the
   GG distribution approximates MAI well. In addition, we show that
   GG-based multiple-symbol differential receivers can be formulated as the
   same form as the conventional multiple-symbol differential receivers,
   which can be efficiently solved using existing algorithms. Simulations
   are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
   receivers to that of the existing differential UWB receivers when the
   interference caused by a small number of active users is strong.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchically textured Si is explored for low reflection, and
   self-cleaning solar cells, which was fabricated from micropyramids with
   nanostructures that were added by Au-assisted electroless chemical
   etching. Such a structure creates a graded effective refractive index
   from air to Si and leads to a black appearance due to broadband
   reflection suppression in the 300-1200 nm range. A front average
   weighted reflectance of 1.4\% was achieved, which is one of the lowest
   values reported for black Si solar cells. Variation in the size of the
   nano-scale texture was found to have greater impact on the reflectance
   of the hierarchal structure than the size of the micro-scale pyramid
   texture. The hierarchial texturing was applied to a cost effective
   screen-printed, aluminum back-surface field solar cell resulting in a
   conversion efficiency of 16.5\%. In addition, the hierarchical structure
   features mechanical robustness and self-cleaning properties. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The creation of fluorescently labeled viruses is currently limited by
   the length of imaging observation time (e.g., labeling an envelope
   protein) and the rescue of viral infectivity (e.g., encoding a GFP
   protein). Using single molecule sensitive RNA hybridization probes
   delivered to the cytoplasm of infected cells, we were able to isolate
   individual, infectious, fluorescently labeled human respiratory
   syncytial virus virions. This was achieved without affecting viral mRNA
   expression, viral protein expression, or infectivity. Measurements
   included the characterization of viral proteins and genomic RNA in a
   single virion using dSTORM, the development of a GFP fusion assay, and
   the development of a pulse-chase assay for viral RNA production that
   allowed for the detection of both initial viral RNA and nascent RNA
   production at designated times postinfection. Live-cell measurements
   included imaging and characterization of filamentous virion fusion and
   the quantification of virus replication within the same cell over an
   eight-hour period. Using probe-labeled viruses, individual viral
   particles can be characterized at subdiffraction-limited resolution, and
   viral infections can be quantified in single cells over an entire cycle
   of replication. The implication of this development is that MTRIP
   labeling of viral RNA during virus assembly has the potential to become
   a general methodology for the labeling and study of many important RNA
   viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Rotational energy is abundant and widely available in our living
   environment Harvesting ambient rotational energy has attracted great
   attention. In this work, we report a single-electrode-based rotating
   triboelectric nanogenerator (SR-TENG) for converting rotational energy
   into electric energy. The unique advantage of introducing the
   single-electrode TENG is to overcome the difficulty in making the
   connection in harvesting rotational energy such as from a moving and
   rotating tire/wheel. The fabricated device consists of a rotary acrylic
   disc with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) blades and an Al electrode
   fixed on the base. The systematical experiments and theoretical
   simulations indicate that the asymmetric SR-TENGs exhibit much better
   output performances than those of the symmetric TENGs at the same
   rotation rates. The asymmetric SR-TENG with seven PTFE units at the
   rotation rate of 800 r/min can deliver a maximal output voltage of 55 V
   and a corresponding output power of 30 mu W on a load of 100 M Omega,
   which can directly light up tens of red light-emitting diodes. The
   SR-TENG has been utilized to harvest mechanical energy from rotational
   motion of a bicycle wheel. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the SR-TENG
   can be applied to scavenge wind energy and as a self-powered wind speed
   sensor with a sensitivity of about 0.83 V/(m/s). This study further
   expands the operation principle of a single-electrode-based TENG and
   many potential applications of TENGs for scavenging ambient rotational
   energy and as a self-powered environment monitoring sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium wavy nanowires with an ultrathin diameter of 2 nm are
   synthesized using the polyol method without the involvement of any
   template. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of a suitable
   precursor that could be reduced instantaneously to generate a large
   number of small Pd nanoparticles. Due to a quick depletion of precursor,
   the small nanoparticles were unable to grow in size through atomic
   addition. In the case of low surface charges and high surface energies,
   these small nanoparticles were forced to coalesce into ultrathin
   nanowires with a wavy morphology via an attachment mechanism. Thanks to
   the unique structure and involvement of twin defects, the as-obtained Pd
   ultrathin nanowires show a catalytic current density of 2.5 times higher
   than the conventional Pd/C catalyst towards formic acid oxidation. This
   work not only offers a powerful route to the synthesis of nanowires
   through attachment-based growth but also opens the door to the rational
   design and fabrication of novel metal nanostructures with enhanced
   properties.}},

Title = {{Vehicle manufacturing water use and consumption: an analysis based on
   data in automotive manufacturers' sustainability reports}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to develop an estimate of water use and
   consumption in automotive manufacturing to enhance the data quality of
   vehicle life cycle assessments that include life cycle water impacts. A
   benchmark is developed to compare water resources across manufacturing
   and nonproduction-related manufacturing processes, including an
   indication whether indirect water consumption due to electricity
   generation is significant.
   Data from 12 original equipment manufacturers' (OEM's) sustainability
   reports are examined for the years 2006 to 2010. Distinctions are made
   between ``water use{''} and ``water consumption.{''} These factors are
   divided by total reported production to develop use and consumption
   values in cubic meter/vehicle for comparison. Additionally, total energy
   consumption is converted to indirect water consumption based on the
   water consumed in the generation of electricity for the electricity grid
   mix.
   Excluding outliers, average direct water use is 5.20 and 5.95
   m(3)/vehicle for manufacturing and company-wide activities,
   respectively, with corresponding standard deviations of 1.42 and 1.20
   m(3)/vehicle. Average direct water consumption was calculated to be 1.25
   and 4.29 m(3)/vehicle for manufacturing and company-wide activities,
   respectively, with corresponding standard deviations of 0.52 and 1.56
   m(3)/vehicle. Average indirect water consumption due to electricity
   consumption is found to be 2.21 m(3)/vehicle. Variability arises through
   different understandings on the words ``consumption{''} and ``use,{''}
   reporting continuity between years and in classification of data as it
   relates to manufacturing, nonmanufacturing, or company-wide activities.
   These water values show that needs vary widely across OEMs.
   Additionally, the magnitude of the indirect water consumption results
   indicates that OEMs should focus on both indirect and direct water
   consumption to reduce their overall water footprint. The results also
   highlight the potential for significance and variability in indirect
   water consumption, in particular for ``cradle-to-gate{''} type of impact
   assessments, dependent on electricity generation water consumption
   assumptions. It is hoped that with the introduction of water reporting
   standards like the International Organization of Standardization 14046,
   manufacturers will provide a more comprehensive summary of their water
   use and consumption in the future.}},

   Methods}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{176}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-80}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a high-order perturbation method is developed to
   generate/compute response functions for the coarse mesh transport
   (COMET) method, which provides whole-core neutron transport solutions to
   various reactor core types. In this approach, the response functions are
   first generated at a reference eigenvalue point, and the response
   functions at an arbitrary eigenvalue are computed as a highorder
   perturbation from the reference point. The method has been tested at
   both the lattice level (response function generation) and the core level
   (whole-core transport calculations). At the lattice level, it is found
   that the response functions predicted by the perturbation method agree
   very well with those directly computed by the Monte Carlo method. The
   average relative difference in the surface-to-surface response functions
   is 0.29\% to 0.46\% when the eigenvalue k ranges from 0.6667 to 1.5. In
   whole-core transport calculations, the COMET calculations using the
   high-order perturbation method are almost identical to those using the
   interpolation method. The eigenvalue, assembly, and pin fission
   densities predicted by COMET agree very well with the MCNP reference
   solution. This indicates that the high-order perturbation response
   function generation method can achieve the same accuracy as the
   interpolation method while significantly improving the computational
   efficiency of the precomputation phase.}},

   polymer degradation}},
Journal = {{TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{16-27}},

Abstract = {{As the use of fabrics containing spandex for apparel applications is
   expanding, developing eco-friendly technologies to recycle the
   industrial as well as post-consumer waste for spandex blended fabrics
   becomes increasingly important. As is known in the industry and
   demonstrated in this study, spandex may be removed from blended fabrics
   by dissolving it in solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, but the use
   of such solvents is undesirable for economical and environmental
   reasons. The main focus of this study was to develop an alternative
   process for removing the spandex component in a nylon/spandex blended
   fabric (NSBF) by selective degradation so that the nylon component can
   be recovered for recycling. In this process, the fabric first underwent
   a heat treatment step, followed by a washing process. For the heat
   treatment, the effect of temperature, water-to-fabric ratio, and
   pressure were studied. Treatment at 220? for 2 hours under atmospheric
   pressure was found to be very effective, allowing the degraded spandex
   residues to be readily washed off in ethanol, while the nylon component
   retained its original morphology. With the removal of spandex in NSBF, a
   decrease in -CON- absorption peaks in the Fourier transform
   infrared-attenuated total reflectance spectra of the fabrics was
   observed.}},
