Abstract = {{Redox-active organic compounds have been studied as corrosion inhibitors
   for steel. Even though it is clear that chemical interactions at the
   organic metal oxide interface are behind this inhibitive process, the
   detailed mechanism is not yet fully understood. Using phenyl-capped
   aniline tetramer (PCAT), we have elucidated the interactions at the
   interface with iron oxide. We demonstrate the partial reduction of fully
   oxidized PCAT and the partial oxidation of fully reduced PCAT upon
   interaction with iron oxide. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals
   the appearance of charged nitrogen structures in PCAT deposited on
   hematite. Iron oxide films in contact with reduced PCAT show a higher
   conductance due to the introduction of defects, resulting in n- doping.
   In contrast, the iron oxide film in contact with oxidized PCAT shows a
   lower conductance, indicating that defects in the film are removed via
   oxidation, thus reducing the doping level. This is consistent with
   accepted models for corrosion inhibition, in which PCAT assists in the
   formation of a passive oxide film. These results are indicative of
   interfacial charge transfer between PCAT and iron oxide. The extent of
   the charge transfer and the direction of redox processes depend on the
   oxidation state of the molecules, enabling the construction of
   redox-active devices, including sensors and switches.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the effect of CO2 emission together with the depletion of
   fossil fuel resources on future generations, industries in particular
   the transportation sector are in deep need of a viable solution to
   follow the environmental regulation to limit the CO2 emission.
   Thermoelectrics may be a practical choice for recovering the waste heat,
   provided their conversion energy can be improved. Here, the high
   temperature thermoelectric properties of high purity Bi doped
   Mg-2(Si,Sn) are presented. The samples MgSi1-x-ySnxBiy, with x(Sn) >=
   0.6 and y(Bi) >= 0.03 exhibited electrical conductivities and Seebeck
   coefficients of approximately 1000 Omega(-1) cm(-1) and -200 mu V K-1 at
   773 K, respectively, attributable to a combination of band convergence
   and microstructure engineering through ball mill processing. In addition
   to the high electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, the thermal
   conductivity of the solid solutions reached values below 2.5 W m(-1) K-1
   due to highly efficient phonon scattering from mass fluctuation and
   grain boundary effects. These properties combined for zT values of 1.4
   at 773 K with an average zT of 0.9 between 400 and 773 K. The transport
   properties were both highly reproducible across several measurement
   systems and were stable with thermal cycling.}},

Pages = {{6920-6924}},

Abstract = {{Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) can be used to remove cadmium (Cd2+)
   via three removal mechanisms: electrodeposi-tion; chemical
   precipitation; and biosorption. Here, we investigated how cadmium
   concentration affects its removal mech-anisms and efficiency in
   lab-scale MECs. For 10, 50, and 100 mu gCd/ L, cadmium was removed by
   electrodeposition and bio-sorption without chemical precipitation. The
   total amount of cadmium removed by electrodeposition increased from 0.96
   to 7.7 mu g with the increasing cadmium concentration while its
   fractional contribution was stationary at 8-10 \%. The fractional
   contribution of biosorption dropped from 59\% to 4\% with the increasing
   cadmium concentration, but the mass removed by biosorption (3-6 mu g)
   was relatively unaffected by the initial cadmium concentration. For the
   low concentrations, the cadmium removal was not sufficiently high,
   varying 13 to 69\%. However, at 2.5 mu g-Cd/L, effective removal of
   cadmium (93\% removal in 7 days) was observed and electrodeposition made
   the largest contribution to cadmium removal (68\%) while chemical
   precipitation (18\%) and biosorption (14\%) was relatively minor. These
   findings showed that cadmium concentration governs the removal
   mechanisms as well as the removal efficiency in MECs.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an ultra-compact and low-threshold thulium microcavity

   integrated microlaser consists of an active thulium-doped aluminum oxide
   microcavity beside a passive silicon nitride bus waveguide, which
   enables on-chip pump-input and laser-output coupling. We observe lasing
   in the wavelength range of 1.8-1.9 mu m under 1.6 mu m resonant pumping
   and at varying waveguide-microcavity gap sizes. The microlaser exhibits
   a threshold as low as 773 mu W (226 mu W) and a slope efficiency as high
   as 24\% (48\%) with respect to the pump power coupled into the silicon
   nitride bus waveguide (microcavity). Its small footprint, minimal energy
   consumption, high efficiency, and silicon compatibility demonstrate that
   on-chip thulium lasers are promising light sources for silicon
   microphotonic systems. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Soil salinisation is one of the major soil degradation threats occurring
   in Europe. The effects of salinisation can be observed in numerous vital
   ecological and non-ecological soil functions. Drivers of salinisation
   can be detected both in the natural and man-made environment, with
   climate and the foreseen climate change also playing an important role.
   This review outlines the state of the art concerning drivers and
   pressures, key indicators as well as monitoring, modeling and mapping
   methods for soil salinity. Furthermore, an overview Of the effect of
   salinisation on soil functions-and the respective mechanism is
   presented. Finally, the state of salinisation in Europe is presented
   according to the most recent literature and a synthesis of consistent
   datasets. We conclude that future research in the field of soil
   salinisation should be focused on among others carbon dynamics of saline
   soil, further exploration of remote sensing of soil properties and the
   harmonization and enrichment of soil salinity maps across Europe within
   a general context of a soil threat monitoring system to support policies
   and strategies for the protection of European soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A series of octyltetramethyldisiloxane-containing ethylene copolymers,
   poly(ethylene-co-OO7) (abbreviated as E-co-OO7), are prepared from
   vanadium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with
   1-oct(7-en)yl-3-octyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (or OO7)
   macromonomer. The copolymers containing different silicone contents are
   employed as composite lubricants for high-density polyethylene (HDPE).
   The influences of the silicone content in the copolymer and that of the
   added copolymer amount in the blend on the bulk and surface properties
   of the blends are systematically investigated. The results show that
   E-co-OO7 exhibits superior overall performance in comparison with
   conventional lubricants silicone masterbatch and polyethylene wax.
   Compared to HDPE control, 10 wt\% E-co-OO7 addition increases the melt
   flow rates by 49\%, increases the elongation at break from 740 to 860\%,
   increases the water contact angle from 90 degrees up to 108 degrees,
   lowers the coefficient of friction from 0.072 to 0.049, lowers the
   specific wear rate from 11 x 10(-3) to 5.6 x 10(-3) mm(3) Nm(-1). The
   impact strength and high temperature thermal stability are also slightly
   improved. The measured Si/C atomic ratios demonstrate the sufficient
   silicone enrichment on surface of the blends. E-co-OO7 with 23.5 Si-O-Si
   per 1000 C gives the best internal lubrication, and E-co-OO7 with 29.7
   Si-O-Si per 1000 C gives the best external lubrication.}},

Abstract = {{Copper contamination results in poor stability and limited application
   of latexes generated using emulsion ATRP. This work describes an
   electrolysis method, which provides for the removal of copper from such
   latexes, while preserving colloidal stability and latex particle
   integrity. Polyacrylate latexes were synthesized via emulsion
   polymerization with reverse ATRP. The reaction was mediated by CuCl2/
   4,4-di-(5-nonyl)-2,2'-bipyridine (dNbpy) and stabilized with a combined
   surfactant system of Brij-98 and a new surfactant-ligand (SL) design,
   which provides for the capture Cu species residing at the interface of
   latex particles. It is shown that > 98\% of the residual Cu was removed
   after 14-h of electrolysis at a voltage of 3 V, and > 99\% Cu removal
   was achieved after 7-h treatment at 9 V. For comparison, a Cu removal of
   < 50\% was measured in polyacrylate latexes prepared by emulsion ATRP
   using dNbpy as a sole ligand. The removal of Cu using this process is
   shown to be rapid and efficient and provide for a substantial increase
   in latex stability and weather resistance of polymers. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of scandium on the microstructure and texture of hot rolled
   and annealed binary Mg-Sc alloys has been studied. Hot rolled alloys
   develop weaker and more random basal texture than the corresponding
   texture of pure Mg after undergoing the same thermomechanical
   processing. The increase of Sc concentration leads to a systematic
   weakening of the texture, however texture randomization is not as
   prominent as in other Mg-RE alloys. The annealed texture of Mg-Sc alloys
   inherits features of the deformed texture, showing moderately weaker
   intensities of dominant components. The texture weakening is attributed
   to the heterogeneous deformation and nucleation of randomly oriented
   grains at micro shear bands. The microstructure and grain growth
   analysis suggest that Sc atoms have a low tendency to migrate towards
   grain boundaries and impose minimal drag effect. As a result, the grain
   growth is determined by grain boundary self-diffusion with an activation
   energy of similar to 82 +/- 8 kJ/mol. The results confirm the important
   role of solute segregation to grain boundaries in the development of
   annealed texture in Mg-based alloys. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3591-3597}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores a modelling approach for two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous rock sample containing different
   types of inclusions base on the level set method (LSM). Taking the
   elliptical inclusion as an example, its distribution is considered as
   periodical and random, and the dimension is the same or random in the 2D
   finite element mesh. The interface between the matrix and inclusions is
   described by the functions suggested in this paper. Meanwhile, the
   modelling method for irregular inclusions is also provided using LSM for
   both 2D and 3D finite element mesh. In the 3D modelling, inclusions are
   assumed to be spheroid and the distribution also can be periodical or
   random. The main advantage of this modelling method is that the finite
   element mesh can remain the same without considering material
   distributions. In other words, the features of material distribution are
   separated from the mesh. But it should be pointed out that this method
   requires high computational resource. Finally, using LSM, the smeared
   crack model can be used to simulate the features of hydraulic fracture
   propagation in the heterogeneous rock materials with the same mesh.}},

Abstract = {{Decorative polymer films are finding applications in processes that
   require forming at elevated temperatures and significant strain. In
   order to satisfy their function in these applications, the appearance of
   these films must remain unaltered or at least any changes must be
   predictable. This paper examines four different high gloss decorative
   films comprised of different materials in the layers of their
   construction. The films were uniaxially stretched up to failure (which
   was up to 75\% strain) at isothermal conditions of 25, 40, or 75 degrees
   C and then examined. Gloss (at 20 degrees) was the most strongly altered
   parameter concerning the appearance of the films after thermomechanical
   deformation while color intensity was relatively unaffected. The change
   in gloss was higher for the two amorphous films compared to the two that
   exhibited crystallinity. The films were analyzed for their surface
   roughness using a white light interferometer, for their crystallinity by
   X-ray diffraction and for their morphology by atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). Surface roughness increased with crystallinity for the two films
   that exhibited crystals but overall showed no correlation to the gloss
   measurements. Only evidence of altered domain morphology in the films as
   determined by AFM appeared to correlate with the changes in gloss
   reported. (C) 2016 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess cerebral microbleed (CMB) prevalence in patients with
   multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and
   associations with clinical outcomes.
   Materials and Methods: CMBs are associated with aging and
   neurodegenerative disorders. The prevalence of CMBs has not previously
   been well established. In this study, 445 patients with MS (266 with
   relapsing-remitting MS, 138 with secondary progressive MS, and 41 with
   primary progressive MS), 45 patients with CIS, 51 patients with other
   neurological diseases, and 177 healthy control subjects (HCs) underwent
   3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical examinations. A subset
   of 168 patients with MS and 50 HCs underwent neuropsychological testing.
   Number of CMBs was assessed on susceptibility-weighted minimum intensity
   projections by using the Microbleed Anatomic Rating Scale; volume was
   calculated by using quantitative susceptibility maps. Differences
   between groups were analyzed with the chi(2) test, Fisher exact test,
   Student t test, and analysis of variance; associations of CMBs with
   clinical and other MR imaging outcomes were explored with correlation
   and regression analyses. Because CMB frequency increases with age,
   prevalence was investigated in participants at least 50 years of age and
   younger than 50 years.
   Results: Significantly more patients with MS than HCs had CMBs (19.8\%
   vs 7.4\%, respectively; P = .01) in the group at least 50 years old. A
   trend toward greater presence of CMBs was found in patients with MS (P =
   .016) and patients with CIS who were younger than 50 years (P = .039)
   compared with HCs. In regression analysis adjusted for age,
   hypertension, and normalized brain volume, increased number of CMBs was
   significantly associated with increased physical disability in the MS
   population (R-2 = 0.23, P < .0001). In correlation analysis, increased
   number of CMBs was significantly associated with deteriorated auditory
   and verbal learning and memory (P = .006) and visual information
   processing speed trends (P = .049) in patients with MS.
   Conclusion: Monitoring CMBs may be relevant in patients with MS and CIS
   at higher risk for developing cognitive and physical disability. (C)

Abstract = {{Drivers are typically faced with two competing challenges when following
   a preceding vehicle: they need to leave sufficient space in front to
   ensure safety, while doing so the probability of cut-ins by other
   vehicles increases as the car-following gap (CFG) becomes large.
   Therefore, a strategic CFG that addresses both challenges becomes
   critical. This study proposes a method to address the problem through an
   overall objective function of CFG and velocity considering the safety
   hazard and the probability of cut-ins by other vehicles. Based on this,
   seeking the strategic CFG translates to finding the optimal solution
   that minimises the overall objective function. With the support of field
   data, the method along with concrete models are instantiated and
   application of the method is elaborated. The method presented in this
   study can be used to enhance traffic safety and improve traffic
   management in a connected vehicle environment that promises cooperative
   adaptive cruise control and cooperative crash avoidance systems.}},

Abstract = {{Optical spectroscopy of human tissue has been widely applied within the
   field of biomedical optics to allow rapid, in vivo characterization and
   analysis of the tissue. When designing an instrument of this type, an
   imaging spectrometer is often employed to allow for simultaneous
   analysis of distinct signals. This is especially important when
   performing spatially resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In this
   article, an algorithm is presented that allows for the automated
   processing of 2-dimensional images acquired from an imaging
   spectrometer. The algorithm automatically defines distinct spectrometer
   tracks and adaptively compensates for distortion introduced by optical
   components in the imaging chain. Crosstalk resulting from the overlap of
   adjacent spectrometer tracks in the image is detected and subtracted
   from each signal. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated in the
   processing of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance spectra recovered
   from an Intralipid and ink liquid phantom and is shown to increase the
   range of wavelengths over which usable data can be recovered. Published

Title = {{On the Optimal Fronthaul Compression and Decoding Strategies for Uplink
   Cloud Radio Access Networks}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the compress-and-forward scheme for an uplink
   cloud radio access network (C-RAN) model, where multi-antenna base
   stations (BSs) are connected to a cloud-computing-based central
   processor (CP) via capacity-limited fronthaul links. The BSs compress
   the received signals with Wyner-Ziv coding and send the representation
   bits to the CP; the CP performs the decoding of all the users' messages.
   Under this setup, this paper makes progress toward the optimal structure
   of the fronthaul compression and CP decoding strategies for the
   compress-and-forward scheme in the C-RAN. On the CP decoding strategy
   design, this paper shows that under a sum fronthaul capacity constraint,
   a generalized successive decoding strategy of the quantization and user
   message codewords that allows arbitrary interleaved order at the CP
   achieves the same rate region as the optimal joint decoding.
   Furthermore, it is shown that a practical strategy of successively
   decoding the quantization codewords first, then the user messages,
   achieves the same maximum sum rate as joint decoding under individual
   fronthaul constraints. On the joint optimization of user transmission
   and BS quantization strategies, this paper shows that if the input
   distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, then under joint decoding, the
   optimal quantization scheme for maximizing the achievable rate region is
   Gaussian. Moreover, Gaussian input and Gaussian quantization with joint
   decoding achieve to within a constant gap of the capacity region of the
   Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink C-RAN model.
   Finally, this paper addresses the computational aspect of optimizing
   uplink MIMO C-RAN by showing that under fixed Gaussian input, the sum
   rate maximization problem over the Gaussian quantization noise
   covariance matrices can be formulated as convex optimization problems,
   thereby facilitating its efficient solution.}},

   hybrid materials with tunable material properties}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To utilize their superior properties, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)
   must be manipulated and aligned end-to-end. We describe a nondestructive
   method to magnetize MWNTs and provide a means to remotely manipulate
   them through the electroless deposition of magnetic nickel nanoparticles
   on their surfaces. The noncovalent bonds between Ni nanoparticles and
   MWNTs produce a Ni-MWNT hybrid material (NiCH) that is electrically
   conductive and has an enhanced magnetic susceptibility and elastic
   modulus. Our experiments show that MWNTs can be plated with Ni for
   Ni:MWNT weight ratios of gamma = 1, 7, 14 and 30, to control the
   material properties. The phase, atom-level, and morphological
   information from x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, dark field STEM, and atomic force microscopy clarify the
   plating process and reveal the mechanical properties of the synthesized
   material. Ni metalizes at the surface of the Pd catalyst, forming a
   continuous wavy layer that encapsulates the MWNT surfaces. Subsequently,
   Ni acts as an autocatalyst, allowing the plating to continue even after
   the original Pd catalyst has been completely covered. Raising gamma
   increases the coating layer thickness from 10 to 150 nm, which
   influences the NiCH magnetic properties and tunes its elastic modulus
   from 12.5 to 58.7 GPa. The NiCH was used to fabricate Ni-MWNT
   macrostructures and tune their morphologies by changing the direction of
   an applied magnetic field. Leveraging the hydrophilic Ni-MWNT outer
   surface, a water-based conductive ink was created and used to print a
   conductive path that had an electrical resistivity of 5.9 Omega m,
   illustrating the potential of this material for printing electronic
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Biosensors are analytical devices that have found a variety of
   applications in medical diagnostics, food quality control, environmental
   monitoring and biodefense. In recent years, functional nucleic acids,
   such as aptamers and nucleic acid enzymes, have shown great potential in
   biosensor development due to their excellent ability in target
   recognition and catalysis. Deoxyribozymes (or DNAzymes) are
   single-stranded DNA molecules with catalytic activity and can be
   isolated to recognize a wide range of analytes through the process of in
   vitro selection. By using various signal transduction mechanisms,
   DNAzymes can be engineered into fluorescent, colorimetric,
   electrochemical and chemiluminescent biosensors. Among them,
   colorimetric sensors represent an attractive option as the signal can be
   easily detected by the naked eye. This reduces reliance on complex and
   expensive equipment. In this review, we will discuss the recent progress
   in the development of colorimetric biosensors that make use of DNAzymes
   and the prospect of employing these sensors in a range of chemical and

Abstract = {{In this study, a series of geotechnical centrifugal tests were conducted
   to investigate the effectiveness of settlement control of two types of
   rigid pile structure embankments (PRSE) in collapsible loess under
   high-speed railway embankments. The research results show that ground
   reinforcement is required to reduce the post-construction settlement and
   settlement rate of the embankments. The rigid pile structure embankments
   using rigid piles can substantially reduce the embankment settlement in
   the construction of embankments on collapsible loess, and the efficiency
   in settlement reduction is affected by the pile spacing. The pile-raft
   structure embankments ( PRSE) have much stronger ability in terms of the
   effectiveness of settlement control, while the pile-geogrid structure
   embankments (PGSE) provides rapid construction as well as economic
   benefits. Rational range of pile spacing of PRSE and PGSE are suggested
   based on the requirements of various railways design speeds.
   Furthermore, the time effectiveness of negative skin friction of piles
   and the action of pile-cap setting are also investigated. The relevant
   measures for improving the bearing capacity and two parts of transition
   zone forms as positive control mean have been suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Coke quality has a critical role in the steelmaking industry. The aim of
   this study is to examine the complex relationships between various
   conventional coal analyses using coke making index ``free swelling index
   (FSI){''}. Random forest (RF) associated with variable importance
   measurements (VIMs), which is a new powerful statistical data mining
   approach, is utilized in this study to analyze a high-dimensional
   database (3961 samples) to rank variables, and to develop an accurate
   FSI predictive model based on the most important variables. VIMs was
   performed on various types of analyses which indicated that volatile
   matter, carbon, moisture (coal rank parameters) and organic sulfur are
   the most effective coal properties for the prediction of FSI. These
   variables have been used as an input set of RF model for the FSI
   modeling and prediction. Results of FSI model indicated that RF can
   provide a satisfactory prediction of FSI with the correlation of
   determination R-2 = 0.96 and mean square error of 0.16 from laboratory
   FSIs (which is smaller than the interval unit of FSI; 0.5). Based on
   this result, RF can be used to rank and select effective variables by
   evaluating nonlinear relationships among parameters. Moreover, it can be
   further employed as a non-parametric reliable predictive method for
   modeling, controlling, and optimizing complex variables; which to our
   knowledge has never been utilized in the fuel and energy sectors. (C)

Abstract = {{The addition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) greatly enhanced the
   properties of methylcellulose (MC) stabilized aqueous foams. CNC
   addition decreased air bubble size, initial foam densities and drainage
   rates. Mixtures of 2 wt \% CNC + 0.5 wt \% MC gave the lowest density
   foams. This composition sits near the onset of nematic phase formation
   and also near the overlap concentration of methylcellulose. More than
   94\% of the added CNC particles remained in the foam phase, not leaving
   with the draining water. We propose that the nanoscale CNC particles
   bind to the larger MC coils both in solution and with MC at the
   air/water interface, forming weak gels that stabilize air bubbles. Wet
   CNC-MC foams were sufficiently robust to withstand high temperature (70
   degrees C for 6 h) polymerization of water-soluble monomers giving
   macroporous CNC composite hydrogels based on acrylamide (AM),
   2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), or polyethylene glycol diacrylate
   (PEGDA). At high temperatures, the MC was present as a fibrillar gel
   phase reinforced by CNC particles, explaining the very high foam
   stability. Finally, our CNC-MC foams are based on commercially available
   forms of CNC and MC, already approved for many applications. This is a
   ``shovel-ready{''} technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the economic feasibility of combining a novel portable
   gas-to-methanol process with a novel methanol-to-butanol process is
   examined. The gas-to-methanol process converts waste flare gas into
   methanol using a series of truck-mounted devices deployed at oil
   production wellheads. The methanol-to-butanol process uses a new
   proprietary catalyst which produces butanol via a diketene intermediate
   at a large centralized facility. The goal of this work is to identify
   the best ways of commercializing this technology in Alberta. To do this,
   a supply chain optimization model is formulated which considers
   specifically how many gas-to-methanol trucks should be used and where
   specifically in Alberta they should be deployed, the specific suppliers
   of CO2 to use, where the location of the central methanol-to-butanol
   facility should be chosen, and the costs of transportation of materials
   between locations. The model framework also considers the possibility of
   getting methanol in full or in part by alternative means such as
   producing methanol from conventional pipeline natural gas, or purchasing
   methanol from petrochemical or biomass-based routes. The supply chain
   optimization problem is formulated as a nonconvex NLP and BARON is used
   in a Pareto analysis considering weighted combinations of economic and
   environmental objective functions. The resulting analysis provides a
   variety of possible viable strategies which can provide both
   profitability and reduced environmental emissions in Alberta by using a
   combination of the novel portable flare gas capture devices with more
   conventional gas-to-liquids technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by
   radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering using a metallic zinc target.
   Zinc oxide films were prepared in two different gas atmospheres; in the
   first set, helium and oxygen gas flow ratio (He:O-2) was varied from
   87.5\% to 37.5\%. In the second set of experiment, oxygen flow rate was
   kept constant at 2.5 sccm while argon and helium gas flow ratio (Ar:He)
   was varied from 9.0\% to 87.5\%. The structural, wettability, and
   optical properties of ZnO films were investigated by X-ray
   diffractometry (XRD), contact angle measuring system, and UV-vis-NIR
   spectrophotometer. The XRD results show increased preferred orientation
   along (002) plane for deposited ZnO films in both cases. The average
   crystallite size of ZnO films increases with increase in gas ratio for
   both set of experiments. The deposited films are hydrophobic by nature
   for water and ethylene glycol. Optical transmittances greater than 60\%
   were observed in the wavelength interval from 450 nm to 650 nm for both
   cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-doped zinc oxide films (AZO) were deposited on glass substrates

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The promotion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has become a key measure of the
   governments in their attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   However, range anxiety is a big barrier for drivers to choose EVs over
   traditional vehicles. Installing more charging stations in appropriate
   locations can relieve EV drivers' range anxiety. To determine the
   locations of public charging stations, we propose two optimization
   models for two different charging modes - fast and slow charging, which
   aim at minimizing the total cost while satisfying certain coverage goal.
   Instead of using discrete points, we use geometric objects to represent
   charging demands. Importantly, to resolve the partial coverage problem
   (PCP) for networks, we extend the polygon overlay method to split the
   demands on the road network. After applying the models to Greater
   Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and to Downtown Toronto, we show that
   the proposed models are practical and effective in determining the
   locations of charging stations. Moreover, they can eliminate PCP and
   provide much more accurate results than the complementary partial
   coverage method (CP). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Parameter uncertainty and temporal dynamics of sensitivity for

   probabilistic collocation method}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{30-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a hybrid sequential data assimilation and probabilistic
   collocation (HSDAPC) approach is proposed for analyzing uncertainty
   propagation and parameter sensitivity of hydrologic models. In HSDAPC,
   the posterior probability distributions of model parameters are first
   estimated through a particle filter method based on streamflow discharge
   data. A probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is further employed to
   show uncertainty propagation from model parameters to model outputs. The
   temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivities are then generated based on
   the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) generated by PCM, which can reveal
   the dominant model components for different catchment conditions. The
   maximal information coefficient (MIC) is finally employed to
   characterize the correlation/association between model parameter
   sensitivity and catchment precipitation, potential evapotranspiration
   and observed discharge. The proposed method is applied to the Xiangxi
   River located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The results show that:
   (i) the proposed HSDAPC approach can generate effective 2nd and 3rd PCE
   models which provide accuracy predictions; (ii) 2nd-order PCE, which can
   run nearly ten time faster than the hydrologic model, can capably
   represent the original hydrological model to show the uncertainty
   propagation in a hydrologic simulation; (iii) the slow (R-s) and quick
   flows (R-q) in Hymod show significant sensitivities during the
   simulation periods but the distribution factor (alpha) shows a least
   sensitivity to model performance; (iv) the model parameter sensitivities
   show significant correlation with the catchment hydro-meteorological
   conditions, especially during the rainy period with MIC values larger
   than 0.5. Overall, the results in this paper indicate that uncertainty
   propagation and temporal sensitivities of parameters can be effectively
   characterized through the proposed HSDAPC approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation deals with detection and diagnosis of errors
   that, due to existing limitations in pre-silicon verification, escape to
   the silicon prototypes and need to be fixed before committing to
   high-volume manufacturing. Electrical errors, such as those caused by
   cross-talk or power droops, are particularly difficult to catch during
   the pre-silicon phase because of the insufficient accuracy of device
   models, which is often traded-off against simulation time. This
   challenge is further aggravated by the rising number of voltage domains,
   especially if subtle errors are excited in unique electrical states. In
   fact these electrically-induced subtle errors most commonly manifest in
   the logic domain as bit-flips and, to the best of our knowledge, there
   are no systematic methods for designing embedded hardware monitors for
   generic logic blocks that can detect bit-flips with low detection
   latency. Moreover, unlike pre-silicon verification and manufacturing
   test that benefit from well-defined and universally accepted coverage
   metrics, there is no generic metric from which confidence can be implied
   at the end of post-silicon validation. Toward these goals, we present a
   method that relies on design invariants (assertions) that are ranked
   based on their potential to detect bit-flips. We also introduce two
   metrics bit-flip coverage estimate and flip-flop coverage estimate that
   can be used to assess the quality of the selected assertions, and, in
   general, the effectiveness of the post-silicon validation process.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles on the thermoelectric
   properties of Mg2Si0.676Ge0.3Bi0.024 was investigated. Increasing the

   conductivity from 431 Omega(-1) cm(-1) for the pristine sample to 370
   Omega(-1) cm(-1) for the sample with 1.5 wt.\% SiC at 773 K, while
   enhancing the Seebeck coefficient from -202 mu V K-1 to -215 mu V K-1 at
   773 K. In spite of the high thermal conductivity of SiC, its additions
   could successfully decrease the lattice thermal conductivity from 3.2 W
   m(-1) K-1 to 2.7 W m(-1) K-1 at 323 K, presumably by adding more
   interfaces. The Z contrast transmission electron microscopy imaging (Z =
   atomic number) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy revealed bismuth

Abstract = {{While eye drops account for the majority of ophthalmic formulation for
   drug delivery, their efficiency is limited by rapid pre-corneal loss. In
   this study, we investigate nanogel suspensions in order to improve the
   topical ocular therapy by reducing dosage and frequency of
   administration. We synthesized self-assembling nanogels of 140 nm by
   grafting side chains of poly(N-tert-butylacrylamide) (PNtBAm) on
   methylcellulose via cerium ammonium nitrate. Successful grafting of
   PNtBAm onto methylcellulose (MC) was confirmed by both NMR and ATR.
   Synthesized molecules (MC-g-PNtBAm) self-assembled in water driven by
   hydrophobic interaction of the grafted side chains creating colloid
   solutions. Materials were synthesized by changing feed ratios of acid,
   initiator and monomer in order to control the degree of hydrophobic
   modification. The nanogels were tested for different degrees of
   grafting. Viability studies performed with HCE cells testified to the
   biocompatibility of poly(N-tert-butylacrylamide) grafted methylcellulose
   nanogels. Dexamethasone was entrapped with an efficiency superior to 95
   \% and its release presented minimal burst phase. Diffusion of drug from
   the nanogels was found to be delayed by increasing the degree of
   grafting. The release profile of the entrapped compound from the
   MC-g-PNtBAm nanogels can thus be tuned by simply adjusting the degree of
   hydrophobic modification. MC-g-PNtBAm nanogels present promising
   properties for ocular drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a developed fuzzy approximation mixed stochastic approach
   (DFAS) is proposed for a regional wetland ecosystem (RWE) management
   under uncertainty. DFAS can handle traditional objective non-determinacy
   (caused by natural element) and anthropogenic uncertainty (caused by
   artificial factor) expressed as probability distribution and fuzzy set
   in objective function or constraint; it also extend to reflect
   compromise of risk attitude/preference of the decision maker in
   decision-making process through introducing rough set theory (RST) and
   measure Me. The proposed approach can be applied to a practical RWE
   management of Yongnianwa wetland, located in north of China, where the
   natural ecosystem has been suffered severe degradation induced by
   disharmonious developing speeds between human activities and
   environment. Results of ecological effects of wetland ecosystem, water
   allocation patterns, pollution-mitigation schemes, and system benefit
   analysis can be acquired. The results indicate that wetland ecosystem
   can produce a numbers of positive effects to the pollution control and
   environmental protection, where the total excess pollution discharges
   (concluding TN, TP and BOD) would reduce 202 and 242 tone (LAV and UAV)
   at highest. Meanwhile, it finds that wetland system method deemed as an
   effective/appropriate technology can remove 67\%, 72\% and 88\% TN, TP
   and BOD from wastewater, where water quality standard of effluent would
   be II, II and III for TN, TP and BOD at best. However, competitive
   relationships between water consumption from human activity and wetland
   protection can facilitate decision makers adjusting current
   water-environment policies with a more efficient/sustainable manner.
   Meanwhile, tradeoffs between economic benefit and system-failure risk
   under optimistic/pessimistic option can support generating a robust plan
   associated with risk control for RWE under uncertainties. All of these
   detections can avail local decision makers to generate a plan
   integrating socio-economic development and eco-environmental protection
   sustainably. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a discrete-time multiuser multiple-input
   single-output (MISO) Gaussian broadcast channel (BC), in which channel
   state information is available at both the transmitter and the
   receivers. The flexible and explicit design of a uniquely decomposable
   constellation group is provided based on pulse amplitude modulation and
   rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. With this, a
   modulation division (MD) transmission scheme is developed for the MISO
   BC. The proposed MD scheme enables each receiver to uniquely and
   efficiently detect their desired signals from the superposition of
   mutually interfering cochannel signals in the absence of noise. In our
   design, the optimal transmitter beamforming problem is solved in a
   closed-form for two-user MISO BC using max-min fairness as a design
   criterion. Then, for a general case with more than two receivers, we
   develop a user-grouping-based beamforming scheme, where the grouping
   method, beamforming vector design and power allocation problems are
   addressed by using weighted max-min fairness. It is shown that our
   proposed approach has a lower probability of error compared with the
   zero-forcing (ZF) method when the Hermitian angle between the two
   channel vectors is small in a two-user case. In addition, simulation
   results also reveal that for the general channel model with more than
   two users, our user-grouping-based scheme significantly outperforms the
   ZF, time division, minimum mean-square error, and signal-to-leakage-and
   noise ratio-based techniques in moderate and high SNR regimes when the
   number of users approaches to the number of base station (BS) antennas
   and it degrades into the ZF scheme when the number of users is far less
   than the number of BS antennas in Rayleigh fading channels.}},

   Systems for Seismic Risk Assessment}},

Abstract = {{Seismic risk assessment is a critical first step toward mitigating the
   social and economic losses resulting from earthquakes. The FEMA P-58
   document, prepared by the Applied Technology Council (ATC), provides a
   methodology for seismic performance assessment of buildings. The
   methodology consists of five main steps: assembling the building
   performance model, defining earthquake hazards, analyzing building
   response, developing collapse fragility, and quantifying performance.
   Owing to the probabilistic nature of the methodology framework, each
   step incorporates uncertainty. After the 2011 earthquake in
   Christchurch, New Zealand, a significant number of reinforced masonry
   low-rise buildings were deemed unusable, although the damage was
   repairable. This created a need to investigate the seismic collapse
   performance of a reinforced masonry shear wall (RMSW) system. In this
   study, the FEMA P-58 methodology is implemented to assess the
   performance of a typical RMSW office building designed according to the
   National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) 2010 and the Canadian Standards
   Association (CSA) S304-14 masonry design code provisions. In order to
   develop the building collapse fragility curves, an analytical model to
   predict the behavior of RMSW was developed. The model was calibrated
   using experimental results from an earlier study by the authors on
   scaled RMSW. Subsequently, an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA)
   procedure was performed to study the RMSW performance under a suite of
   ground motions consistent with the NBCC 2010 design spectrum for a high
   seismicity site in Victoria, British Columbia. The results of the IDA
   were used to develop collapse fragility curves for RMSW in order to
   facilitate the quantification of the collapse risk under different
   levels of seismic demand. This study is expected to catalyze the
   development of design provisions and subsequent adoption of RMSW in the
   next generations of seismic codes in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Increased exposure to the detrimental effects of blast events has led to
   the release of several guidelines and the recent publication of two
   North American standards that provide guidance on the hardening and
   performance quantification of structures subjected to this type of
   loading. The safety and security logistics and the high cost associated
   with performing experimental blast testing has led to a number of codes
   and guidelines accepting the use of simplified dynamic modeling
   techniques to analyze the response of structural components. Past
   research in blast-masonry interaction has primarily focused on the
   strengthening and retrofit of existing unreinforced masonry wall
   systems, whereas research related to evaluating the blast response of
   reinforced masonry (RM) has been limited. The focus of this study is to
   evaluate the accuracy of using simplified dynamic modeling techniques to
   predict the blast performance of nonintegral RM infill walls. To
   evaluate the accuracy of the simplified dynamic models, the predicted
   response values are compared with results obtained from experimental
   blast testing of RM infill walls that cover a range of wall design
   parameters, charge weights, and standoff distances. The combinations of
   charge weights and standoff distance presented a range of
   scaled-distances, reflecting different explosive threat levels, which
   were selected to induce different damage levels in the RM walls. Results
   from this study indicate that the wall peak deflection response can be
   accurately predicted using the simplified dynamic models, which was used
   to generate RM infill wall performance charts for a range of
   reinforcement ratios. Additionally, it was found that the complex
   response of the nonintegral infill walls investigated in this study is
   bounded by two common boundary configurations as verified by further
   analyses. The analysis results are expected to provide a better
   understanding of RM infill wall performance under blast loads and the
   performance charts can be used as a screening tool for existing walls
   and preliminary design of new construction under different design-basis
   threat (DBT) levels.}},

Abstract = {{The constrained-random methodology is widely used during the pre-silicon
   verification of very-large scale integrated circuits. Recently, research
   efforts have been made to support the application of constrained-random
   patterns during the post-silicon validation stage. In this paper, we
   present a new method, including both software algorithms and on-chip
   hardware structures, for in-system constrained-random generation of
   stimuli sequences that are uniformly distributed. More specifically, we
   facilitate in-system application of constrained-random sequences that
   are cyclic-random, i.e., all the valid values from the user-constrained
   space are generated only once before the entire sample space is
   exhausted. While software simulation environments commonly support this
   feature, e.g., randc in SystemVerilog, to the best of our knowledge this
   is the first time it is shown how such feature can be ported to hardware
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo investigate the feasibility of high-sensitivity cellular MRI
   of embryonic stem (ES) cells using a novel cell permeable and cell
   retentive T-1 contrast agent.
   Materials and MethodsMouse ES cells were labeled with a novel manganese
   porphyrin contrast agent, MnAMP, at 0.1mM over 2 to 24h and retained in
   contrast-free medium for up to 24h postlabeling. MRI was performed on a
   3 Tesla clinical scanner; T-1 and T-2 relaxation times were measured.
   Quantification of manganese content was performed using atomic
   absorption spectroscopy. Viability and proliferation assays were done
   for the longest labeling interval. Differentiation capacity was assessed
   using the hanging drop method to direct differentiation toward
   cardiomyocytes.
   ResultsMnAMP-labeled ES cells exhibited over a fourfold decrease in T-1
   compared with unlabeled cells, and maintained up to a threefold decrease
   24h postlabeling. Viability and proliferation were not affected. Most
   importantly, labeled ES cells differentiated into functional
   cardiomyocytes that exhibited normal contractility patterns.
   ConclusionMnAMP-based cellular MRI is a very high sensitivity T-1
   approach for cellular imaging. It has the potential for noninvasive in

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop an inexpensive magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI)-compatible electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) unit and test it
   for safety and efficacy.
   Materials and MethodsA simple MRI-compatible EMS device was developed
   using radiofrequency (RF) translucent electrodes at 3T. RF heating
   concerns were assessed using optical temperature measurements at
   electrode sites, during scanning of a phantom. EMS efficacy and
   consistency was investigated through in vivo (n = 5) measures of
   P-31-MRS phosphocreatine (PCr) reduction, and altered blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal and the results were compared to effects
   from equivalent voluntary effort on the same subjects.
   ResultsThe presence of an EMS pulse did not interfere with the T-2{*}
   signal in a phantom. However, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was reduced by
   70\% at electrode sites, but only by 10\% 4 cm distally. Under RF
   intense conditions, the temperature at the electrode site increased by
   only 4.7 degrees C over a 16-minute time span. In vivo muscle
   stimulation resulted in 13.5 1.8\% reduction in PCr, which was not
   significantly (P < 0.195) different from voluntary contraction.
   Reproducible muscle BOLD signal changes following EMS were noted, with a
   maximal increase of 10.0 +/- 2.6\% seen in the central soleus. For
   soleus and gastrocnemius compartments, EMS produced significantly higher
   BOLD signal change compared to voluntary contraction (P < 0.05).
   ConclusionA safe and inexpensive MRI-compatible EMS unit can be easily
   built for evaluating muscle function and metabolism within a 3T MRI
   scanner. Clinical applications might include evaluating skeletal muscle
   function in patients with limited or absent voluntary skeletal motor
   function or inadequate exercise capacity. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

   Resources Management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The need for more efficient water use has increased in importance with
   growing water scarcity and increasing competition among water users.
   Measuring the economic efficiency of water use has become a useful
   indicator for water resources management at all levels. This study
   proposes a multilevel factorial fractional programming model to support
   water resources management under uncertainty. Linear fractional
   programming is introduced to provide a practical way for taking into
   account the ratio of economic benefit to water consumption in the
   modeling process. This approach allows water allocation plans to be
   developed on the basis of the optimal economic efficiency of water use
   rather than economic incentives. A multilevel factorial analysis
   technique is integrated within linear fractional programming framework
   to deal with data uncertainty. This technique can quantify the
   individual and interactive effects of uncertain parameters on system
   performance and help decision makers gain improved insight into a
   changing system. To demonstrate its applicability, the model is applied
   to Xingshan County in China. A set of decision alternatives with respect
   to the optimal economic efficiency of water use are provided. The
   effects of uncertain parameters are quantified through a detailed
   uncertainty analysis, and the most influential parameters are
   identified. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Wire brushing and annealing (WBA) process was developed, optimized and
   utilized to modify the surface layer microstructure of AZ31 automotive
   magnesium sheet material. The process was carried out using softer brass
   wire brushes to mitigate the effect of wire brushing on surface quality
   and damage. The influence of modified surface grain structure and
   crystallographic texture was studied by continuous uniaxial tension test
   as well as by a newly proposed multi-step uniaxial stretching and
   annealing (MUSA) process to assess cumulative uniaxial tensile ductility
   of AZ31 sheet. A rotational speed of 2800 revolutions per minute for the
   wire brush with a near-zero depth of cut followed by annealing at 473 K
   (200 A degrees C) for 60 minutes resulted in acceptable surface quality
   with a refined grain layer of depth 30 mu m, and a modified
   crystallographic texture on the surface. Material flow behavior, grain
   microstructure, and texture evolution of WBA-processed material during
   subsequent MUSA process were analyzed to assess the role of wire
   brushing in enhancing the MUSA response of AZ31 sheet. Original fully
   annealed AZ31 sheet (in the non-WBA condition) was also subjected to
   identical MUSA process for comparison purposes. The results showed
   improvement in terminal uniaxial tensile ductility of WBA-MUSA-processed
   material compared to Standard-MUSA material. The ductility improvement
   is attributed to non-basal texture development and re-distribution of
   the texture, as well as to grain refinement within the highly deformed
   surface layer from the combination of WBA and MUSA processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a multi-modelling approach is proposed for improved
   continuous daily streamflow estimation in ungauged basins using
   regionalizationthe process of transferring hydrological data from gauged
   to ungauged watersheds. Four regionalization models, two data-driven and
   two hydrological, were used for continuous daily streamflow estimation.
   Comparison of the individual models reveals that each of the four models
   performed well on a limited number of ungauged basins while none of them
   performed well for the entire 90 selected watersheds. The results
   obtained from the four models are evaluated and reported in a
   deterministic way by a model combination approach along with its
   uncertainty range consisting of 16 ensemble members. It is shown that a
   combined model of the four individual models performed well on all 90
   watersheds and the ensemble range can account for the uncertainty of
   models. The combined model was more efficient and appeared more robust
   compared to the individual models. Furthermore, continuous ranked
   probability scores (CRPS) calculated for the ensemble model outputs
   indicate better performance compared to individual models and
   competitive with the combined model.}},

Abstract = {{The rainfall-runoff process is governed by parameters that can seldom be
   measured directly for use with distributed models, but are rather
   inferred by expert judgment and calibrated against historical records.
   Here, a comparison is made between a conceptual model (CM) and an
   artificial neural network (ANN) for their ability to efficiently model
   complex hydrological processes. The Sacramento soil moisture accounting
   model (SAC-SMA) is calibrated using a scheme based on genetic algorithms
   and an input delay neural network (IDNN) is trained for variable delays
   and hidden layer neurons which are thoroughly discussed. The models are
   tested for 15 ephemeral catchments in Crete, Greece, using monthly
   rainfall, streamflow and potential evapotranspiration input. SAC-SMA
   performs well for most basins and acceptably for the entire sample with
   R-2 of 0.59-0.92, while scoring better for high than low flows. For the
   entire dataset, the IDNN improves simulation fit to R-2 of 0.70-0.96 and
   performs better for high flows while being outmatched in low flows.
   Results show that the ANN models can be superior to the conventional
   CMs, as parameter sensitivity is unclear, but CMs may be more robust in
   extrapolating beyond historical record limits and scenario building.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{661-671}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were performed using a dissolving wall method to
   characterize the development of surface roughness in pipes at Reynolds
   number from 50,000 to 200,000. The test sections had a lining of gypsum
   that dissolved to flowing water in a closed flow loop. The tests were
   run over sequential time periods for each Reynolds number. At the end of
   each time period, the inner surface topography was measured using X-ray
   CT scans. Scallops are seen to initiate on the surface over time and
   then subsequently grow spatially and in depth with time. The surface was
   divided into smaller local areas and a scallop initiation time was
   introduced so that a common time datum from initiation could be used to
   characterize the time development of the roughness. The peak-to-valley
   roughness height was found to scale well with time when normalized by
   the turbulent inner scales. There is an initial period of slower growth
   rate in the roughness height, followed by a period of relatively higher
   growth rate. The growth of the integral length scale of the scallops is
   different, with an initial rapid growth followed by a much slower growth
   rate. The streamwise spacing of the scallops estimated from the density
   is approximately 1000 wall units as the scallops saturate the surface.
   There is a good correlation between the roughness height and the wear
   when normalized by the turbulent inner scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We study the drift induced by the passage of two cylinders through an
   unbounded extent of inviscid incompressible fluid under the assumption
   that the flow is two dimensional and steady in the moving frame of
   reference. The goal is to assess how the resulting total particle drift
   depends on the parameters of the geometric configuration, namely the
   distance between the cylinders and their angle with respect to the
   direction of translation. This problem is studied by numerically
   computing, for different cylinder configurations, the trajectories of
   particles starting at various initial locations. The velocity field used
   in these computations is expressed in closed form using methods of the
   complex function theory, and the accuracy of calculations is carefully
   verified. We identify cylinder configurations which result in increased
   and decreased drift with respect to the reference case when the two
   cylinders are separated by an infinite distance. Particle trajectories
   shed additional light on the hydrodynamic interactions between the
   cylinders in configurations resulting in different drift values. This
   ensemble of results provides insights about the accuracy of models used
   to study biogenic transport.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer to turbulent flow through back-to-back pipe bends

   1.7 times when there was a 1D or 5D length of pipe between the bends.
   The location of the maximum mass transfer was on the inner sidewall
   downstream of the second bend when there was no separation distance
   between the bends. This location changed to the inner wall at the

Volume = {{483}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports synthesis of the first high internal phase emulsion
   (HIPE) system with double emulsion (DE) morphology (HIPE-DE). HIPE is a
   highly concentrated but highly stable emulsion system, which has a
   dispersed/internal phase fraction over 74 vol\%. DE represents an
   emulsion system that hierarchically encapsulates two immiscible phases.
   The combination of HIPE and DE provides an efficient method for
   fabrication of complex structures. In this work, HIPE-DE having a
   water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) morphology has been prepared for the first
   time via a simple one-step emulsification method with
   poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEA) microgel particles as
   Pickering stabilizer. An oil phase fraction up to 90 vol\% was achieved
   by optimizing the microgel concentration in aqueous phase. The mechanism
   of the DE formation has been elucidated. It was found that while PDEA
   microgels stabilized the oil droplets in water, small amount protonated
   DEA monomers acted as surfactant and formed water containing micelles
   inside the oil droplets. It was demonstrated that the W/O/W HIPE-DE
   could be precisely converted into porous polymer structures. With
   styrene as the oil phase in W/O/W HIPE-DE, porous polystyrene particles
   were obtained upon polymerization. With dissolved acrylamide as the
   aqueous phase and toluene as the continuous phase, porous polyacrylamide
   matrixes were prepared. Elevating temperature required for
   polymerization did not change the W/O/W HIPE-DE morphologies. This
   simple approach provides a versatile platform for synthesis of a variety
   of porous polymer systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A water resistant surface was first obtained by immobilizing hydrophobic
   copolymers, poly (styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PSG), with
   functional groups on soy protein isolate (SPI) films. XPS and AFM
   results showed that PSG copolymers were immobilized on the film by
   chemical bonding, and formed a rough surface with some bumps because of
   the segregation of two different phases on PSG copolymers. Water
   resistance of the modified films could be adjusted dramatically by
   further immobilizing different amounts of guanidine-based antimicrobial
   polymers, poly (hexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) (PHMG) on the
   resulting hydrophobic surface. The introduction of hydrophilic PHMG on
   the resulting surface generated many micropores, which potentially
   increased the water uptake of the modified films. Furthermore, the
   modified SPI films showed higher thermostability compared to native SPI
   film and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by contact killing,
   attributed to the presence of PHMG on the surface. The modified SPI film
   with a multi-functional surface showed potential for applications in the
   packaging and medical fields. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{The flow field in single and dual S-shape short radius 90 bends was
   measured using matched refractive index Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
   at Reynolds numbers of 40,000 and 70,000. The high velocity region in
   the first bend of the S-bend moves closer to the outer wall as it moves
   along the curvature than in the single bend. The flow then accelerates
   further along the inner wall of the second bend. The averaged in-plane
   components of the turbulence kinetic energy in the single bend and the
   first bend of the S-bend are similar, with an increase along the outer
   wall and downstream of the separation zone on the bend inner wall. The
   turbulence kinetic energy in the second bend was much higher than in the
   first bend of the S-bend. Counter rotating vortices develop in the first
   bend and propagates into the second bend. High velocity secondary flows
   are observed near the second bend inner wall at approximately 40 along
   the second bend. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are used to provide strong evidence for
   barrier-free nucleation events in a heterogeneous solid-solid system.
   The barrier-free events are characterized by an absence of an incubation

   system size. Furthermore, an analysis of the size and shape of the
   critical nucleus using the Winterbottom construction indicates that no
   solution exists for these barrier-free cases. We propose that
   barrier-free nucleation, which will have a profound effect on phase
   transformation kinetics, may be a general phenomenon for any

Title = {{Platinum single-atom and cluster catalysis of the hydrogen evolution
   reaction}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Platinum-based catalysts have been considered the most effective
   electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting.
   However, platinum utilization in these electrocatalysts is extremely
   low, as the active sites are only located on the surface of the catalyst
   particles. Downsizing catalyst nanoparticles to single atoms is highly
   desirable to maximize their efficiency by utilizing nearly all platinum
   atoms. Here we report on a practical synthesis method to produce
   isolated single platinum atoms and clusters using the atomic layer
   deposition technique. The single platinum atom catalysts are
   investigated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, where they exhibit
   significantly enhanced catalytic activity (up to 37 times) and high
   stability in comparison with the state-of-the-art commercial
   platinum/carbon catalysts. The X-ray absorption fine structure and
   density functional theory analyses indicate that the partially
   unoccupied density of states of the platinum atoms' 5d orbitals on the
   nitrogen-doped graphene are responsible for the excellent performance.}},

Title = {{Sub-T-g features of glasses formed by cooling glycerol under pressure -
   Additional incompatibility of vibrational with configurational states in
   the depressurized, high density glass}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The vibrational state of a glass is naturally incompatible with its
   configurational state, which makes the glass structurally unstable. When
   a glass is kept at constant temperature, both the vibrational and
   configurational states of a glass change with time until it becomes
   metastable (equilibrium) liquid and the two states become compatible.
   The process, known as structural relaxation, occurs at a progressively
   higher rate during heating, and the properties of a glass change
   accordingly. We add to this incompatibility by depressurizing a glass
   that had been formed by cooling a liquid under a high pressure, p, and
   then investigate the effects of the added incompatibility by studying
   thermal conductivity, kappa, and the heat capacity per unit volume rho
   C-p of the depressurized glass. We use glycerol for the purpose and
   study first the changes in the features of kappa and of rho C-p during
   glass formation on cooling under a set of different p. We then partially
   depressurize the glass and study the effect of the p-induced instability
   on the features of kappa and rho C-p as the glass is isobarically heated
   to the liquid state. At a given low p, the glass configuration that was
   formed by cooling at high-p had a higher kappa than the glass
   configuration that was formed by cooling at a low p. The difference is
   more when the glass is formed at a higher p and/or is depressurized to a
   lower p. On heating at a low p, its kappa decreases before its
   glass-liquid transition range is reached. The effect is the opposite of
   the increase in kappa observed on heating a glass at the same p under
   which it was formed. It is caused by thermally assisted loss of the
   added incompatibility of configurational and vibrational states of a
   high-p formed glass kept at low p. If a glass formed under a low-p is
   pressurized and then heated under high p, it would show the opposite
   effect, i.e., its kappa would first increase to its high p value before
   its glass-to-liquid transition range. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Degradation of hybrid halide perovskites under the influence of
   environmental factors impairs future prospects of using these materials
   as absorbers in solar cells. First principle calculations can be used as
   a guideline in search of new materials, provided we can rely on their
   predictive capabilities. We show that the instability of perovskites can
   be captured using ab initio total energy calculations for reactants and
   products augmented with additional thermodynamic data to account for
   finite temperature effects. Calculations suggest that the instability of
   CH3NH3PbI3 in moist environment is linked to the aqueous solubility of
   the CH3NH3I salt, thus making other perovskite materials with soluble
   decomposition products prone to degradation. Properties of NH3OHPbI3,
   NH3NH2PbI3, PH4PbI3, SbH4PbI3, CsPbBr3, and a new hypothetical SF3PbI3

   extraction method. The analysis of the experimental data provided an
   insight into the mechanisms of LG adsorption on MnO2 and MWCNT. It was
   found that the heterocoagulation method is not limited to the
   fabrication of MnO2-MWCNT composites. The improved mixing of the
   individual components allowed for improved capacitive performance of the
   MnO2-MWCNT electrodes. The liquid-liquid extraction method offers the
   additional benefit of reduced agglomeration, which resulted in improved
   mixing at the nanometric scale. Good capacitance performance and low
   impedance were achieved at high active mass loadings, which allowed for
   high integral and differential capacitances, especially at high
   charge-discharge rates. Graphene coated Ni foam current collectors
   allowed for significant improvement in capacitance performance of
   MnO2-MWCNT electrodes, compared to the electrodes prepared using
   uncoated Ni foam current collectors. It was found that the increase in
   capacitance is not related to capacitive properties of graphene. The
   high capacitance of 4.8 F cm(-2) and excellent capacitance retention of
   67\% achieved in the scan rate range from 2 to 100 mV s(-1) are
   promising for practical ES applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A PEGylated protein is prepared by conjugating polyethylene glycol (or
   PEG) with the protein, a process known as PEGylation. Most PEGylation
   processes lead to synthesis of different PEGylated forms of the protein,
   among which only one form is typically of interest. In this work, we
   propose a modeling and optimization-based approach for determining
   optimal operating conditions for protein PEGylation. To this end, a
   first-principles model is proposed and targeted experiments are carried
   out to estimate the model parameters. A simulation-based optimization is
   then carried out to suggest the best operating conditions. Specifically,
   results suggest that to maximize the concentration of mono-PEGylated
   product, the reaction should be carried out at high pH and with a high
   ratio of PEG to protein. Subsequent experiments are conducted to confirm
   the validity of the modeling and optimization approach.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological system analyses are challenged by complexities of irregular
   nonlinearities, data uncertainties, and multivariate dependencies. Among
   them, the irregular nonlinearities mainly represent inexistence of
   regular functions for robustly simulating highly complicated
   relationships between variables. Few existing studies can enable
   reliable simulation of hydrological processes under these complexities.
   This may lead to decreased robustness of the constructed models,
   unfeasibility of suggestions for human activities, and damages to
   socio-economy and eco-environment. In the first of two companion papers,
   a discrete principal-monotonicity inference (DPMI) method is proposed
   for hydrological systems analysis under these complexities.
   Normalization of non-normally distributed samples and invertible
   restoration of modelling results are enabled through a discrete
   distribution transformation approach. To mitigate data uncertainties,
   statistical inference is employed to assess the significance of
   differences among samples. The irregular nonlinearity between the
   influencing factors (i.e. predictors) and the hydrological variable of
   interest (i.e. the predictand) is interpreted as piecewise monotonicity.
   Monotonicity is further represented as principal monotonicity under
   multivariate dependencies. Based on stepwise classification and cluster
   analyses, all paired samples representing the responsive relationship
   between the predictors and the predictand are discretized as a series of
   end nodes. A prediction approach is advanced for estimating the
   predictand value given any combination of predictors. The DPMI method
   can reveal evolvement rules of hydrological systems under these
   complexities. Reliance of existing hydro-system analysis methods on
   predefined functional forms is removed, avoiding artificial
   disturbances, e.g. empiricism in selecting model functions under
   irregular nonlinearities, on the modelling process. Both local and
   global significances of predictors in driving the evolution of
   hydrological variables are identified. An analysis of interactions among
   these complexities is also achieved. The understanding obtained from the
   DPMI process and associated results can facilitate hydrological
   prediction, guide water resources management, improve hydro-system
   analysis methods, or support hydrological systems analysis in other
   cases. The effectiveness and advantages of DPMI will be demonstrated
   through a case study of streamflow simulation in Xingshan Watershed,
   China, in another paper. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Provision of reliable scientific support to socio-economic development
   and eco-environmental conservation is challenged by complexities of
   irregular nonlinearities, data uncertainties, and multivariate
   dependencies of hydrological systems in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR)
   region, China. Among them, the irregular nonlinearities mainly represent
   unreliability of regular functions for robust simulation of highly
   complicated relationships between variables. Based on the proposed
   discrete principal-monotonicity inference (DPMI) approach, streamflow
   generation in the Xingshan Watershed, a representative watershed in this
   region, is examined. Based on system characterization, predictor
   identification, and streamflow distribution transformation, DPMI
   parameters are calibrated through a two-stage strategy. Results indicate
   that the modelling efficiency of DPMI is satisfactory for streamflow
   simulation under these complexities. The distribution transformation
   method and the two-stage calibration strategy can deal with
   non-normality of streamflow and temporally unstable accuracy of
   hydrological models, respectively. The DPMI process and results reveal
   that both streamflow uncertainty and its rising tendency increase with
   flow levels. The dominant driving forces of streamflow generation are
   daily lowest temperature and daily cumulative precipitation in
   consideration of performances in global and local scales. The temporal
   heterogeneity of local significances to streamflow is insignificant for
   meteorological conditions. There is significant nonlinearity between
   meteorological conditions and streamflow and dependencies among
   meteorological conditions. The generation mechanism of low flows is more
   complicated than medium flows and high flows. The DPMI approach can
   facilitate improving robustness of hydro-system analysis studies in the

Abstract = {{The use of bacterial cells as agents of medical therapy has a long
   history. Research that was ignited over a century ago with the
   accidental infection of cancer patients has matured into a platform

   that make them well-suited as smart drug delivery agents. Our ability to
   genetically manipulate the molecular machinery of these cells enables
   the customization of their therapeutic action as well as its precise
   tuning and spatio-temporal control, allowing for the design of unique,
   complex therapeutic functions, unmatched by current drug delivery
   systems. Early results have been promising, but there are still many
   important challenges that must be addressed. We present a review of
   promises and challenges of employing bioengineered bacteria in drug

Title = {{Numerical strategies for damage assessment of reinforced concrete block
   walls subjected to blast risk}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{559-582}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Computational tools and numerical strategies for the determination of
   the response of masonry walls under blast overpressure often rely on
   oversimplifying and conservative assumptions, which, although
   justifiable for design purposes, are not as warranted when fragility
   analysis and risk assessment are the objectives. In addition, due to the
   composite nature of reinforced masonry construction, the evaluation of
   multivariate fragility functions may likely require significant
   computational effort, owing to the multiplicity of variables describing
   the constituent materials and their associated uncertainty. The problem
   is further compounded by the effects of the high strain rates typically
   induced by blast loading, which make the understanding of masonry
   behaviour even more challenging; although efforts are being made in
   order to account for strain rate effects at the macro-scale, no well
   established models are available for reinforced masonry walls.
   Therefore, in order to perform accurate yet expedient fragility analyses
   that can effectively capture rate dependent phenomena, a dynamic model
   based on single-degree-of freedom (SDOF) approach is developed. The SDOF
   model accounts for the nonlinear stress-strain behaviour obtained from
   standard prism tests and integrates strain rate dependent formulations
   provided in the open literature. The model predictions are corroborated
   using data including pressure and displacement histories from field
   testing of six scaled concrete block walls subjected to the detonation
   of live explosives. Within the scope of the current study, the proposed
   model is found to be a reasonable trade-off between computational
   efficiency and numerical accuracy and is an improvement upon a basic
   SDOF approach, which is typically based on the fixed dynamic increase
   factors recommended by modern design standards and technical manuals for
   blast protection. The results presented in this study are expected to
   contribute to the ongoing development of a comprehensive framework for
   the probabilistic risk assessment of structures subjected to explosive
   loading. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Layered lithium transition metal oxides are one of the most important
   types of cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) that possess
   high capacity and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, these layered
   cathode materials suffer structural changes during electrochemical
   cycling that could adversely affect the battery performance. Clear
   explanations of the cathode degradation process and its initiation,
   however, are still under debate and not yet fully understood. We herein
   systematically investigate the chemical evolution and structural
   transformation of the LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (NMC) cathode material in order
   to understand the battery performance deterioration driven by the
   cathode degradation upon cycling. Using high-resolution electron energy
   loss spectroscopy (HR-EELS) we clarify the role of transition metals in
   the charge compensation mechanism, particularly the controversial Ni2+
   (active) and Co3+ (stable) ions, at different states-of-charge (SOC)
   under 4.6 V operation voltage. The cathode evolution is studied in
   detail from the first-charge to long-term cycling using complementary
   diagnostic tools. With the bulk sensitive Li-7 nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) measurements, we show that the local ordering of
   transition metal and Li layers (R (3) over barm structure) is well
   retained in the bulk material upon cycling. In complement to the bulk
   measurements, we locally probe the valence state distribution of cations
   and the surface structure of NMC particles using EELS and scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The results reveal that the
   surface evolution of NMC is initiated in the first-charging step with a
   surface reduction layer formed at the particle surface. The NMC surface
   undergoes phase transformation from the layered structure to a poor
   electronic and ionic conducting transition-metal oxide rock-salt phase
   (R (3) over barm -> Fm (3) over barm), accompanied by irreversible
   lithium and oxygen loss. In addition to the electrochemical cycling
   effect, electrolyte exposure also shows non-negligible influence on
   cathode surface degradation. These chemical and structural changes of
   the NMC cathode could contribute to the first-cycle coulombic
   inefficiency, restrict the charge transfer characteristics and
   ultimately impact the cell capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Syngas, the mixture of CO and H-2, is a key feedstock to produce
   methanol and liquid fuels in industry, yet limited success has been made
   to develop clean syngas production using renewable solar energy. We
   demonstrated that syngas with a benchmark turnover number of 1330 and a
   desirable CO/H-2 ratio of 1: 2 could be attained from
   photoelectrochemical CO2 and H2O reduction in an aqueous medium by
   exploiting the synergistic co-catalytic effect between Cu and ZnO. The
   CO/H-2 ratio in the syngas products was tuned in a large range between
   2: 1 and 1: 4 with a total unity Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, a high
   Faradaic efficiency of 70\% for CO was acheived at underpotential of 180
   mV, which is the lowest potential ever reported in an aqueous
   photoelectrochemical cell. It was found that the combination of Cu and
   ZnO offered complementary chemical properties that lead to special
   reaction channels not seen in Cu, or ZnO alone.}},

   measured in three steps: 1) conjugating an alkyne derivative of
   Rhodamine (Rho-Alk); 2) using paper chromatography to separate the
   immobile latex particles from unreacted fluorophore; and, 3) on-paper
   fluorescence quantification of the latex bound Rho-Alk. Paper
   chromatography with methanol elution was effective because the
   nanoparticles did not migrate during elution, whereas the unreacted dye
   did. This assay can be used to estimate the coupling yield of any alkyne
   simply by conducting a second stage click reaction with Rho-Alk to
   determine the content of azides not consumed in the first click
   reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new two-level rolling horizon optimization framework
   applied to a zero-emissions coal-fueled solid-oxide fuel cell power
   plant with compressed air energy storage for peaking applications.
   Simulations are performed where the scaled hourly demand for the year
   2014 from the Ontario, Canada market is met as closely as possible. It
   was found that the proposed two-level strategy, by slowly adjusting the
   SOFC stack power upstream of the storage section, can improve
   load-following performance by 86\% compared to the single-level
   optimization method proposed previously. A performance analysis
   indicates that the proposed approach uses the available storage volume
   to almost its maximum potential, with little improvement possible
   without changing the system itself. Further improvement to
   load-following is possible by increasing storage volumes, but with
   diminishing returns. Using an economically-focused objective function
   can improve annual revenue generation by as much as 6.5\%, but not
   without a significant drop-off in load-following performance. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3130-3136}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A smeared crack model of hydraulic fracturing numerical calculation is
   proposed based on the complete liquid-solid coupled elastoplastic
   theory. In this model, the elastic part of the material uses the linear
   elastic constitutive relations; the plastic part adopts the Mohr-Coulomb
   failure criterion and hardening criterion. To simulate the fluid flow in
   the crack, the permeability is modified according to the current state
   of effective stress. The relation between the permeability and the
   effective mean stress is assumed to be a hyperbolic tangent function.
   The onset of crack is determined by the mean effective stress. Using the
   user defined subroutines provided by ABAQUS software, the smeared crack
   model is added. According to section photo of the in-situ rock sample, a
   finite element model of heterogeneous material with hard inclusions
   distributed is generated. The progress of hydraulic fracturing under the
   loading condition of centered injection is well simulated and the
   results show the characteristics of fracture zone, stress path located
   at typical location and range of fracture propagation. Numerical tests
   on the rock with hard inclusions distributed are carried out under
   different conditions. The paper concludes the influences of elastic
   modules, cohesion, permeability, and injection rate on the maximum
   injection pore pressure, average injection pore pressure and fracture
   aperture.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced treatment, such as tight membrane filtration and ion exchange,
   can be applied for Pb2+ removal from wastewater but these methods are
   expensive with a high demand for electric energy and chemicals.
   Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are an emerging wastewater treatment
   technology and MECs can remove Pb2+ by reduction and precipitation at
   the cathode and biosorption at the anode; however, reduction at the
   anode has not been reported. We investigated Pb2+ removal mechanisms
   using lab-scale MECs. Using an anion exchange membrane, independent Pb2+
   removal in the anode and cathode chambers was observed at various
   voltage applications, including open circuit, 0.3 V, 0.6 V, and 0.9 V. A
   substantial amount of metallic Pb (0. 10 +/- 0.02 mg) was found on the
   graphite fiber anode. Also, the observed anode potential (-0.15 to -0.33
   V vs. SHE) indicated sufficient driving force for Pb2+ reduction at the
   anode for the Pb2+ concentration of 0.1 to 2.5 mg L-1. Inactivation of
   exoelectrogens using ethanol resulted in no Pb2+ removal. The findings
   show that Pb2+ removal is achieved by various mechanisms in MECs,
   including electrodeposition at the anode by exoelectrogens.}},

Abstract = {{Driving is full of unpredictability and uncertainty. Standardized drive
   cycles, traditionally defined as velocity-time profiles, serve as
   test-beds for performance prediction. However, these generalized

   vehicle might encounter during its life cycle. Thus, the
   ``JourneyMapping{''} concept is highlighted in this paper, which
   redefines drive cycles more realistically as the journey of a vehicle
   from an origin to the destination is influenced by weather, terrain,
   traffic, driver behavior, road, and aerodynamic conditions. AMESim
   software simulations for a Ford Focus Electric 2012 were seen to predict
   energy consumption with about 5\% error, on average, compared with the

Abstract = {{While being cost effective and robust to external optical feedback,
   conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) semiconductor laser diodes cannot be used
   for fiber-optic communication systems beyond 1 Gb/s with span
   requirement over several kilometers due to the mode partition noise
   (MPN) caused by their multimode operation nature. In order to reduce the
   MPN-induced power penalty, we have proposed a narrow spectral width FP
   laser, which incorporates a built-in bandpass filter with its peak
   wavelength detuned from the material gain peak. Both simulation and
   experimental results show that this design can effectively narrow the
   root-mean-square width of the optical spectrum approximately by half.
   Within a given spectral width, we have also studied the impact of the
   number of longitudinal modes on the mode partition statistics k factor,
   aiming at further reducing the MPN-induced power penalty. The proposed
   laser exhibits noticeable better transmission performances over the
   conventional FP laser in simulation, and is expected to find its
   potential applications in high-speed short-reach, yet cost-sensitive
   fiber transmission systems, such as the passive optical access networks
   and Fibre channels for optical interconnection.}},

Title = {{Fast and Inexpensive Detection of Bacterial Viability and Drug
   Effectiveness through Metabolic Monitoring}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Conventional methods for the detection of bacterial infection such as
   DNA or immunoassays are expensive, time consuming, or not definitive and
   thus may not provide all the information sought by medical
   professionals. In particular, it is difficult to obtain information
   about viability or drug effectiveness, which is crucial to formulate a
   treatment. Bacterial culture tests are the ``gold standard{''} because
   they are inexpensive and do not require extensive sample preparation,
   and most importantly, provide all the necessary information sought by
   healthcare professionals, such as bacterial presence, viability and drug
   effectiveness. These conventional culture methods, however, have a long
   turnaround time, anywhere between 1 day and 4 weeks. Here, we solve this
   problem by monitoring the growth of bacteria in thousands of nanowells
   simultaneously to more quickly identify their presence in the sample and
   their viability. The segmentation of a sample with low bacterial
   concentration into thousands of nanoliter wells digitizes the samples
   and increases the effective concentration in those wells that contain
   bacteria. We monitor the metabolism of aerobic bacteria by using an
   oxygen-sensitive fluorophore, ruthenium tris (2,2'-diprydl) dichloride
   hexahydrate (RTDP), which allows us to monitor the dissolved oxygen
   concentration in the nanowells. Using E. coli K12 as a model pathogen,
   we demonstrate that the detection time of E. coli can be as fast as
   35-60 min with sample concentrations varying from 10(4) (62 min for
   detection), 10(6) (42 min) and 10(8) cells/mL (38 min). More
   importantly, we also demonstrate that reducing the well size can reduce
   the detection time. Finally we show that drug effectiveness information
   can be obtained in this format by loading the wells with the drug and
   monitoring the metabolism of the bacteria. The method that we have
   developed is low cost, simple, requires minimal sample preparation and
   can potentially be used with a wide variety of samples in a
   resource-poor setting to detect bacterial infections such as
   tuberculosis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study multicasting multiple description traffic to a
   group of mobile stations (MSs). The traffic is precached at a number of
   access points (APs), and the MSs have different quality requirements in
   terms of number of required descriptions. Each AP transmits one
   description and forms a single-hop multicast group to reach a certain
   number of MSs. Different APs can transmit the same or different
   descriptions. MSs requiring multiple descriptions should be covered by
   at least the same number of the APs that transmit different
   descriptions. We study two problems, description assignments, and power
   allocations. The former is to assign a description for each AP, and the
   latter is to allocate the transmission power for each AP. Two objectives
   are considered subject to satisfying the requirements of the MSs, one is
   to minimize the total transmission power of all the APs, and another is
   to minimize the maximum transmission power of the APs. For each
   objective, a centralized and a distributed scheme are proposed, and
   their performance is compared with the optimum. Numerical results show
   very good performance of the heuristic schemes. Copyright (C) 2016 John

Abstract = {{The efficiency of GaAs nanowire (NW) solar cells can be significantly
   improved with no new processing steps or material requirements. We
   report coupled optoelectronic simulations of a GaAs NW solar cell with a
   vertical p-i-n junction and a highbandgap AlInP passivating shell. Our
   frequency-dependent model facilitates calculation of quantum efficiency
   for the first time in NW solar cells. For passivated NWs, we find that
   short-wavelength photons can be most effectively harnessed by using a
   thin emitter, while long-wavelength photons are best utilized by
   extending the intrinsic region to the NW/substrate interface and using
   the substrate as a base. These two easily implemented changes, coupled
   with the increase of NW height to 3.5 mu m with realistic surface
   recombination in the presence of a passivation shell, result in an NW
   solar cell with greater than 19\% efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of free chlorine used for disinfecting drinking water,
   recreational water, and food processing water is critical for
   environmental and human health conditions, and should be controlled
   within stipulated ranges. This report, for the first time, describes a
   paper-based electrochemical free chlorine sensor fabricated by
   hand-drawing. The electrical resistivity of a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
   chemoresistor increases when it is exposed to free chlorine in water due
   to oxidation reactions. Because the relative change of the electrical
   resistance represents the sensors response, the sensor can be fabricated
   by hand-drawing with different shapes and dimensions. The fabrication
   steps are all at room temperature, require no instrumentation or
   equipment, and can be carried out by untrained personnel. The fabricated
   sensor is mechanically stable, reusable, has a wide sensing range, and
   can accurately measure free chlorine concentrations in real water
   samples. Therefore, the low-cost, hand-drawn free chlorine sensor is of
   great significance for water quality monitoring in less developed areas
   where fabrication facilities, analytical equipment, and trained
   personnel are limited, but the need for analytical devices is critical.
   In addition to the free chlorine sensor demonstrated in this study,
   other types of PEDOT:PSS-based sensors and electronic devices can be
   fabricated by the developed hand-drawing process.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the availability of inexpensive antimicrobial treatment,
   syphilis remains prevalent worldwide, affecting millions of individuals.
   Furthermore, syphilis infection is suspected of increasing both
   susceptibility to, and tendency to transmit, HIV. Development of a
   syphilis vaccine would be a potentially promising step towards control,
   but the value of dedicating resources to vaccine development should be
   evaluated in the context of the anticipated benefits. Here, we use a
   detailed mathematical model to explore the potential impact of rolling
   out a hypothetical syphilis vaccine on morbidity from both syphilis and
   HIV and compare it to the impact of expanded `screen and treat'
   programmes using existing treatments. Our results suggest that an
   efficacious vaccine has the potential to sharply reduce syphilis
   prevalence under a wide range of scenarios, while expanded treatment
   interventions are likely to be substantially less effective. Our
   modelled interventions in our simulated study populations are expected
   to have little effect on HIV, and in some scenarios lead to small
   increases in HIV incidence, suggesting that interventions against
   syphilis should be accompanied with interventions against other sexually
   transmitted infections to prevent the possibility that lower morbidity
   or lower perceived risk from syphilis could lead to increases in other
   sexually transmitted diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a stepwise cluster forecasting (SCF) framework is
   proposed for probabilistic prediction for monthly streamflow through
   integrating stepwise cluster analysis and quantile regression methods.
   The developed SCF method can capture discrete and nonlinear
   relationships between explanatory and response variables. A cluster tree
   was generated through the SCF method for reflecting complex
   relationships between independent (i.e. explanatory) and dependent (i.e.
   response) variables in the hydrologic system. Quantile regression
   approach was employed to construct probabilistic relationships between
   inputs and outputs in each leaf of the cluster tree. The developed SCF
   method was applied for monthly streamflow prediction in Xiangxi River
   based on the gauged records at Xingshan gauging station and related
   meteorological data. The performance of the SCF method was evaluated
   through indices of percent bias (PBIAS), RMSE-observations standard
   deviation ratio (RSR), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE).
   Two new indices, the relative distance to the bounds (RDB) and the
   degree of uncertainty (DOU) were proposed to reflect the uncertainty of
   the predictions from SCF model. The results showed that the uncertainty
   of the predictions was acceptable and would not change significantly in
   calibration and validation periods. Quantile regression was integrated
   into prediction process of the SCF approach to provide probabilistic
   forecasts. The 90 \% confidence intervals could well bracket the
   observations in both calibration and validation periods. Comparison
   among different forecasting techniques showed the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

   polymerization and delivered in a solution of low molecular weight PEG
   and Ve as the solvent instead of water. The hydrogel formed immediately
   in an aqueous environment with a controllable gelation time. The driving
   force for gelation is attributed to the self-assembly of hydrophobic Ve
   residues upon exposure to water to form a physically cross-linked
   polymer network-via polymer chain rearrangement and subsequent phase
   separation, a spontaneous process with water uptake. The hydrogels can
   be customized to give the desired water content, mechanical strength,
   and drug release kinetics simply by formulating the PEGMA-co-Ve polymer
   with an appropriate solvent mixture or by varying the molecular weight
   of the polymer. The hydrogels exhibited no significant cytotoxicity in
   vitro using fibroblasts and good tissue compatibility in the eye and
   when injected subcutaneously. These polymers thus have the potential to
   be used in a variety of applications where injection of a drug or cell
   containing depot would be desirable.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) have been proposed as a
   low-damage seismic force resisting system with reliable self-centring
   capabilities. Vertical post-tensioning tendons are designed to
   self-centre the system after rocking, and energy dissipation may be
   provided to limit the peak displacements. The post-tensioning and energy
   dissipation can be designed using simple methods that rely primarily on
   the first-mode response. However, the frame member forces are highly
   influenced by the higher-mode response, resulting in more complex
   methods to design the frame members. This paper examines previous
   proposals and also proposes two new capacity design methods for CRSBFs.
   The first is a dynamic procedure that requires a truncated response
   spectrum analysis on a model of the frame with modified boundary
   conditions to consider the rocking behaviour. The second is an
   equivalent static method that does not require any modifications to the
   elastic frame model, instead using theory-based lateral force
   distributions to consider the higher modes of the rocking structure.
   Neither method requires empirical calibration. The dynamic procedure is
   used to design two sets of CRSBFs with three, six, nine, twelve and
   eighteen stories, one set using a response modification factor of R = 8
   and the other using up to R = 20. Based on the results of 800 nonlinear
   time history analyses, both methods are generally more accurate than the
   previous capacity design methods and at least as simple to implement.
   Finally, the displacement results suggest that taller CRSBFs designed
   using R8 could still limit interstorey drifts to approximately 2.5\% at
   the maximum considered earthquake level in the cases considered.

Abstract = {{A stable, ultra long-duration high-altitude balloon (HAB) platform which
   can maintain stationary position would represent a new paradigm for
   telecommunications and high-altitude observation and transmission
   services, with greatly reduced cost and complexity compared to existing
   technologies including satellites, telecom towers, and unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs). This contribution proposes a lightweight superpressure
   balloon platform for deployment to an altitude of 25 km.
   Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrusters are presented to maintain position
   by overcoming stratospheric winds. Critical to maintaining position is a
   continual supply of electrical power to operate the on-board propulsion
   system. One viable solution is to deliver power wirelessly to a
   high-altitude craft from a ground based transmitter. Microwave energy,
   not heavily attenuated by the atmosphere, can be provided remotely from
   a ground-based generator (magnetron, klystron, etc.) and steered
   electrically with an antenna array (phased array) at a designated
   frequency (such as 2.45 or 5.8 GHz). A rectifying antenna
   ({''}rectenna{''}) on the bottom of the balloon converts waves into
   direct current for on-board use. Preliminary mission architecture,
   energy requirements, and safety concerns for a proposed system are
   presented along with recommended future work.(C) 2016 IAA. Published by

Abstract = {{This study assessed the impacts of dietary arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on
   26 mineral element contents in the liver and kidney of chicken. A total
   of 100 male Hy-line cocks were randomly divided into 2 groups (50
   chickens in each group), including an arsenic-treated group (basic diet
   supplemented with As2O3 at 30 mg/kg) and a control group (basal diet).
   The feeding experiment lasted for 90 days and the experimental animals
   were given free access to feed and water. We determined 26 mineral
   elements in the liver and kidney by inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that nine element levels (Al,
   Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Cd, Ba, and Pb) were significantly decreased (P <
   0.05) in the liver of chickens exposed to As2O3 compared to the control
   chickens where three element levels (Ni, As, and Hg) increased
   significantly (P < 0.05). The results in the kidney showed that nine
   element levels (Al, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Ni, Sb, Ba, and Pb) were
   significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the chickens exposed to As2O3
   compared to the control chickens where four element levels (Mo, As, Cd,
   and Hg) increased significantly (P < 0.05). These results suggest that
   supplementation of high levels of arsenic affected trace mineral levels
   in the liver and kidney of chicken, and the effects vary from organ to
   organ. The aim of this study is to provide references for further study
   of heavy metal poisoning by detecting the contents of minerals induced

Title = {{Optimization of Spray Drying Conditions for Yield, Particle Size and
   Biological Activity of Thermally Stable Viral Vectors}},
Journal = {{PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This work examines the relevance of viral activity in the
   optimization of spray drying process parameters for the development of
   thermally stable vaccine powders. In some instances, the actual active
   pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is not included in the process
   optimization as it is deemed too costly to use until the final selection
   of operating conditions, however, that approach is inappropriate for
   highly labile biopharmaceutics. We investigate the effects of spray
   drying parameters on i) yield, ii) particle size and iii) viral vector
   activity of a mannitol/dextran encapsulated recombinant human type 5
   adenoviral vector vaccine, to demonstrate the effects and magnitude of
   each effect on the three responses, and further show that the API must
   be included earlier in the optimization.
   Methods A design of experiments approach was used with response surface
   methodology (RSM) to optimize parameters including inlet temperature,
   spray gas flow rate, liquid feed rate and solute concentration in the
   feed.
   Results In general, good conditions for maintaining viral activity led
   to reduced yield and fewer particles of the desired size. Within the
   range of parameters tested, the yield varied from 50 to 90\%, the
   percentage of ideally size particles was 10-50\%, and the viral vector
   titre loss was 0.25-4.0 log loss.
   Conclusions RSM indicates that the most significant spray drying
   parameters are the inlet temperature and spray gas flow rate. It was not
   possible to optimize all three output variables with one set of
   parameters, indicating that there will only be one dominant criteria for
   processing which in the case of viral vaccines will likely be viral
   vector activity.}},

Abstract = {{The foot-ankle complex is frequently injured in a wide array of
   debilitating events such as car crashes. Numerical models and
   experimental tests have been used to assess injury risk, but most do not
   account for the variations in ankle posture that frequently occur during
   these events. In this study, the positions of the bones of the
   foot-ankle complex (particularly, the hindfoot) were quantified over a
   range of postures. Computed tomography scans were taken of a male
   cadaveric leg under axial loading with the ankle in five postures in
   which fractures are commonly reported. The difference in the location of
   the talus and calcaneus between the neutral and each repositioned
   posture was quantified, and substantial rotations and displacements were
   observed for all postures tested (talus: 3 degrees-21.5 degrees,
   1.5-10.5 mm; calcaneus: 10 degrees-20 degrees, 1.5-24.5 mm). Strains
   were also recorded at six locations on bones of the ankle during testing
   and were found to be highest in the calcaneus during inversion-external
   rotation and highest in the talus during eversion-external rotation.
   Postural changes likely affect the load pathway of the foot-ankle
   complex, potentially altering the stress and strain fields from that of
   the neutral case and changing the location of fracture. This highlights
   the need for injury-predicting studies examining the effect of these
   positional changes and to develop revised injury criteria accounting for
   the most vulnerable conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) with a stress
   relaxation effect for twinning in the constitutive description is
   employed to simulate twin formation, propagation and growth in Mg single

   dominates the early stage of plastic deformation and numerical results
   explicitly show the twinning process including twin formation,
   propagation and growth. After a twin band (or a narrow twin) is formed,
   a large gradient of effective stress is found across the band front.
   Also, the resolved shear stress (RSS) on the twin plane along the twin
   direction is highly non homogeneous across the band front. It has been
   demonstrated that softening facilitates the formation of a twin band and
   work hardening is contributive to the growth of the twin band. In
   addition, numerical results indicate that softening plays an important
   role in the propagation of a twin across a grain boundary with a large
   misorientation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the use of a laterally-fed membrane chromatography (or LFMC)
   device for single-step purification of mono-PEGylated lysozyme. Recent
   studies have shown such LFMC devices to be suitable for high-resolution,
   multi-component separation of proteins in the bind-and-elute mode. The
   device used in this study contained a stack of rectangular
   cation-exchange membranes having 9.25 mL bed volume. PEGylation of
   lysozyme was carried out in batch mode using 5 kDa
   methoxy-polyethyleneglycol propionaldehyde (or m-PEG propionaldehyde) in
   the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride as reducing agent. Membrane
   chromatographic separation was carried out at 1.62 membrane bed volumes
   per minute flow rate, in the bind-and-elute mode. When a salt gradient
   was applied, the higher PEGylated forms of lysozyme (i.e. the
   byproducts) eluted earlier than mono-PEGylated lysozyme (the target
   product), while lysozyme eluted last. Under elution conditions optimized
   for resolution and speed, the separation could be carried out in less
   than 15 membrane bed volumes. High purity and recovery of mono-PEGylated
   lysozyme was obtained. The resolution of separation of mono-PEGylated
   lysozyme obtained under the above condition was comparable to that
   reported in the literature for equivalent cation-exchange resin columns
   while the flow rate expressed in bed volumes/min was 21.7 times higher.
   Also, the number of theoretical plates per meter was significantly
   higher with the LFMC device. Therefore the LFMC based purification
   process discussed in this paper combined high-productivity with
   high-resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Two 4D Models Effective in Reducing False Alarms for Struck-by-Equipment
   Hazard Prevention}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, several smart and automated systems have been
   developed to address the issue of struck-by hazards in constructionthat
   is, workers on foot struck by equipment or equipment struck by
   equipment. False alarms (false positives and false negatives) are common
   in such systems, but methods for limiting struck-by hazards have not yet
   been thoroughly studied or tested for real-world implementations. This
   study presents two novel four-dimensional (4D) {[}time and
   three-dimensional (3D) space] models, a time-sphere model and a
   time-cuboid model, that are effective in reducing the rate of false
   alarms. In each developed 4D model, (1)entities' state information,
   including 3D position, orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw), and velocity,
   is acquired and analyzed over time; and (2)the hazardous area around
   equipment or workers is represented by a sphere or a cuboid with the
   warning distance adjusted and updated according to the entities'
   collected state information; and (3)unsafe-proximity query rules
   identify and predict contact collisions using relative position, moving
   direction, speed, and a pairwise 3D unsafe-proximity query. The
   effectiveness of the developed 4D models was evaluated through
   simulation and field experiments; however, the data were not wirelessly
   communicated because the focus of the study was on development,
   analysis, and comparison of two models for safety hazard identification.
   The obtained false positive and false negative rates indicate that the
   two developed 4D models have a strong capability for reducing false
   alarms. The obtained reduced alarm percentages imply that on average
   65\% of the alarms triggered by the most prevalent method can be averted
   by using the time-sphere model and 81\% can be reduced by using the
   time-cuboid model. Furthermore, three major categories of findings are
   summarized: model comparison, model analysis, and the relationship
   between alert zone dimensions and model performance. The developed
   rigorous 4D models can also be employed for several types of contact
   collision that involve temporal and permanent site facilities, materials
   transported in air, and equipment and workers on foot. Reduced false
   alarms will improve construction safety, productivity, and mobility.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic interaction of unanchored objects with a seismically
   qualified system or component in a nuclear power plant (NPP) can be
   detrimental to nuclear safety. In order to assess the seismic risk, an
   accurate quantification of the seismic response of unanchored
   components, such as spent-fuel dry storage casks, portable standby
   generators, electrical transformers, unreinforced masonry radiation
   shielding walls, etc., is required. The rocking response and toppling
   vulnerability of unanchored objects is not covered in nuclear standards,
   guidelines, and reports, except for an approximate method provided in
   ASCE/SEI 43-05 to estimate the maximum rocking angle in lieu of
   nonlinear time history analysis. In this study, the approximate method
   adopted by ASCE/SEI 43-05 is evaluated, first qualitatively and
   subsequently by comparing its predictions against results from a series
   of nonlinear time history analyses (NLTHA). The study concludes that the
   ASCE/SEI 43-05 method (which has also been adopted in FEMA P-58-1 and is
   expected to be adopted in the new revision of ASCE 4) provides highly
   unreliable, and in many cases unconservative, estimates of peak rocking
   rotation for a wide range of block geometries, under various levels of
   excitation. Because a reliable simplified method for estimating rocking
   rotations is not currently available, the paper recommends that rotation
   demands be obtained from nonlinear dynamic analysis.}},

Title = {{Seismic Collapse Risk Assessment of Reinforced Masonry Walls with
   Boundary Elements Using the FEMA P695 Methodology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Using boundary elements in reinforced masonry (RM) walls allows closed
   ties to be used and multiple layers of vertical bars to be accommodated,
   thus providing a confining reinforcement cage. This enhances the overall
   performance of the RM wall with boundary elements relative to
   traditional RM walls with rectangular cross sections. This is attributed
   to the fact that traditional RM walls can typically only accommodate
   single-leg horizontal reinforcement and a single layer of vertical
   reinforcement because of practical limitations associated with concrete
   masonry unit geometrical configuration and construction techniques.
   Following the FEMA P695 methodology, Quantification of Building Seismic
   Performance Factors, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   reported that some low-rise traditional rectangular RM walls (without
   boundary elements) might experience an excessive risk of collapse under
   the maximum considered earthquake (MCE). Moreover, although North
   American codes give seismic modification factors for RM shear walls with
   rectangular cross sections, no distinctive corresponding values are
   provided for RM shear walls with boundary elements. To address these
   issues, this study examines the effect of adopting the seismic response
   modification factors assigned for traditional RM shear walls on the
   collapse risk of RM shear walls with boundary elements. In this respect,
   OpenSees was used to create macro models to simulate the seismic
   response of 20 RM shear walls with boundary elements, designed with
   different configurations under different gravity load levels. The
   modeling approach was experimentally validated and the models were
   subsequently used to perform nonlinear static pushover analyses and
   incremental dynamic analyses following the FEMA P695 methodology. The
   analyses focused on evaluating the wall overstrength, period-based
   ductility, and seismic collapse margin ratios under the MCE. The results
   show that RM walls with boundary elements designed considering the
   ASCE7-10 force reduction factor currently assigned to RM walls with
   rectangular cross sections experience an enhanced performance that is
   enough to meet the FEMA P695 acceptance criteria for the expected
   seismic collapse risk under the MCE.}},

   In addition, it was found that to prevent triplet exciton loss, an ETL

Volume = {{302}},
Pages = {{63-74}},

Abstract = {{Temperature has rarely been examined in twin-screw wet granulation
   despite the obvious capabilities of the extruder for operating at
   elevated temperatures. The present work investigates the wetting
   behavior of a mixture of powders with different sorption characteristics
   at various temperatures to explain the unique granulation behavior
   witnessed with high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in a
   twin-screw extruder. The work studies the twin-screw granulation of a
   controlled release formulation at three different temperatures, namely
   30 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 80 degrees C and attempts to interpret
   the granular properties of collected samples relative to characterized
   moisture sorption isotherms measured for the individual ingredients as
   well as the mixtures. A result of higher temperature processing was
   reduced coarse particles and a final product with more spherical
   granules. Increasing temperature was found to reduce water absorption
   capacity among the ingredients, especially hydroxypropyl methyl
   cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose, leaving more of the added
   water for particle bridging. The gel layer ofhydroxypropyl methyl
   cellulose particles was diminished by the higher temperatures which did
   not appear to impact the strength of the particle bridges formed.
   Inclusion of a more hydrophobic ingredient like acetaminophen
   complicates the distribution of water in a granule. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The native oxide at the surface of III-V nanowires, such as InAs, can be
   a major source of charge noise and scattering in nanowire-based
   electronics, particularly for quantum devices operated at low
   temperatures. Surface passivation provides a means to remove the native
   oxide and prevent its regrowth. Here, we study the effects of surface
   passivation and conformal dielectric deposition by measuring electrical
   conductance through nanowire field effect transistors treated with a
   variety of surface preparations. By extracting field effect mobility,
   subthreshold swing, threshold shift with temperature, and the gate
   hysteresis for each device, we infer the relative effects of the
   different treatments on the factors influencing transport. It is found
   that a combination of chemical passivation followed by deposition of an
   aluminum oxide dielectric shell yields the best results compared to the
   other treatments, and comparable to untreated nanowires. Finally, it is
   shown that an entrenched, top-gated device using an optimally treated
   nanowire can successfully form a stable double quantum dot at low
   temperatures. The device has excellent electrostatic tunability owing to
   the conformal dielectric layer and the combination of local top gates
   and a global back gate.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate groundwater level (GWL) prediction can contribute to sustaining
   reliable water supply to domestic, agricultural and industrial uses as
   well as ecological services, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. In
   this paper, a regional GWL modeling framework was first presented
   through coupling both spatial and temporal clustering techniques.
   Specifically, the self-organizing map (SOM) was applied to identify
   spatially homogeneous clusters of GWL piezometers, while GWL time series
   forecasting was performed through developing a stepwise cluster
   multisite inference model with various predictors including climate
   conditions, well extractions, surface runoffs, reservoir operations and
   GWL measurements at previous steps. The proposed modeling approach was
   then demonstrated by a case of an arid irrigation district in the
   western Hexi Corridor, northwest China. Spatial clustering analysis
   identified 6 regionally representative central piezometers out of 30,
   for which sensitivity and uncertainty analysis were carried out
   regarding GWL predictions. As the stepwise cluster tree provided
   uncertain predictions, we added an AR(1) error model to the mean
   prediction to forecast GWL 1 month ahead. Model performance indicators
   suggest that the modeling system is a useful tool to aid decision-making
   for informed groundwater resource management in arid areas, and would
   have a great potential to extend its applications to more areas or
   regions in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Implementation of a rate dependent tensile failure model for brittle
   materials in ABAQUS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{127-147}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Plate impact tests present the dynamic response of materials under
   impact loading conditions. Commercial finite element software can be
   used to simulate plate impact test and implement the desired
   constitutive or damage model of materials. Implementation of plate
   impact tests also allows researchers to study the dynamic response of
   heterogeneous materials in micro-scale. A plate impact test for brittle
   materials has been simulated in this study using ABAQUS software.
   Micro-cracking in the brittle ceramic materials causes the samples to
   behave inelastically under compressive shock loading. The release waves
   from the free surface of the flyer and rear surface of the target
   release the compressed materials. Consequently, micro-cracks rapidly
   open and extend, causing the damage to grow. Thus, the
   Taylor-Chen-Kuszmaul (TCK) model was implemented using a VUMAT FORTRAN
   ABAQUS/Explicit subroutine with respect to tension with damage growth
   and to compression plasticity for ceramic plates (target). The objective
   of the study is to describe the implementation of a state- and
   pressure-dependent constitutive model that describes tensile damage in
   brittle materials using a finite element method. An iteration second
   order Runge-Kutta method has been developed for further implementation.
   Some parameters, such as damage nucleation and strain rate sensitivity,
   are calibrated based on the ability of the model to reproduce the
   experimental results. The damage model introduced in this study has been
   employed successfully to match the experimental results for an AD-85
   ceramic target material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Water aluminum oxide nanofluid benchmark model}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{148-158}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The nanoparticles in fluid enhance the rate of heat transfer because of
   higher thermal conductivity of nanoparticles. In literature, researchers
   have used different numerical methods to simulate this phenomenon
   considering the fluid as a single phase or as a two phase system. In
   some cases, the numerical results were compared with experimental
   results and good agreements were achieved; while for other no comparison
   was done. On the other hand, there,is no identical numerical research
   that compares various numerical approaches that can be used to study
   thermo-fluidic flow in nanofluid. Accordingly, in this study we have
   numerically solved a benchmark heat transfer nanofluid problem using
   three different widely used numerical approaches: Finite Element Method
   (FEM), Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Finite Difference Method
   (FDM). The numerical results were compared with experimental results in
   literature for validation purposes. Subsequently, a FEM simulation is
   carried out for a three dimensional domain to investigate the three
   dimensional effects of the enclosure's walls on heat transfer in the
   nanofluid. The simulations were performed for water (H2O)-aluminum
   oxide(Al2O3) nanofluid at a particle concentration range of 1\%-3\%
   volume fraction. Numerical results in the forms of temperature, stream
   function and velocity variations as well as average Nusselt number at
   the walls have been presented for a range of Rayleigh numbers (for
   different particles concentration). While, a suitable combination of the
   governing control parameters resulted in an acceptable CFD outcomes for
   all three numerical methods, some differences have been observed between
   different numerical approaches which are reported in this study.
   Eventually, the strength and weakness of various numerical approaches
   are discussed in details. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Transparent ZrO2-SiO2 glass ceramics show potential for application in
   the dental industry. The application of this material prepared by a
   sol-gel method was hindered by the difficulties in obtaining large
   dimension samples. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) offers the possibility
   of achieving transparent ZrO2-SiO2 glass ceramics. In this study, a
   ZrO2-SiO2 powder was prepared by the sol-gel method and subsequently
   sintered by SPS. Varied sintering temperatures and pressures were
   explored to achieve better mechanical strength and transparency. TEM
   results showed single crystalline ZrO2 spherical nanocrystals
   (approximately 20 nm) homogenously embedded in the SiO2 matrix.
   Tetragonal ZrO2 was the only crystalline phase in all specimens. With
   sintering conditions of 1200 degrees C and 30 MPa, a glass ceramic with
   fracture toughness of 4.13 MPa was obtained. This value is similar to
   the commercial dental glass ceramic of IPS e.max (R) Press. The studied
   transparent glass ceramic with high transparency and moderate mechanical
   strength shows promise for dental application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{To assist in the development of nuclear fusion as a viable commercial
   power source, preparation is underway for the fusion demonstration
   reactor (DEMO), which will build on the work of ITER, the international
   experimental fusion reactor. Like other advanced nuclear energy systems,
   DEMO must satisfy several goals including a high level of public and
   worker safety, low environmental impact, high reactor availability, a
   closed fuel cycle and the potential to be economically competitive. Yet
   there are still large scientific and technological safety gaps between
   the on-going ITER project and DEMO that will need to be addressed. Here
   we review international fusion safety research and development relevant
   to DEMO, following the lessons learned so far from ITER. We identify the
   main scientific and technological safety gaps, drawing on knowledge from
   the development of fission energy, in particular Generation IV (Gen-IV)
   fission reactors. From this survey, we discuss the corresponding
   implications for the design and operation of DEMO.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleation, growth and linkage of microvoids are examined in
   commercially pure magnesium using x-ray computed microtomography (XCT).
   Tensile testing was performed inside the chamber of an XCT system with
   each test stopped at various levels of deformation to acquire scans. The
   nucleation of flat penny-shaped voids is observed relatively early
   during plastic deformation due to failure at twin and grain boundaries.
   Once nucleated the voids exhibit rapid growth along preferential
   directions related to the crystallographic texture of the material as
   well as the sample geometry. The final fracture occurs by a macroscopic
   shearing process. Furthermore, the fracture surface reveals two main
   characteristics: a faceted surface associated with twinning and
   irregular features related to the failure of grain boundaries. The data
   exhibit both a quantitative and qualitative difference in the damage
   development process in magnesium as compared with FCC metals such as
   aluminum and copper. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{We propose that an electric field's role in changing the structural
   disorder may be investigated by comparing the field-induced entropy
   decrease, Delta S-E, against the pressure-induced and cooling-induced
   entropy decreases, Delta S-p and Delta S-T, respectively, for the same
   increase in the dielectric a-relaxation time, Delta tau(alpha), or in
   the viscosity. If these three quantities are found to be the same, the
   change in the number of microstates, Delta ln Omega = Delta S/R, would
   be the same whether there is an electric field-induced dipole vector
   alignment, or not. The available data {[}S. Samanta and R. Richert, J.
   Chem. Phys. 142, 044504 (2015)] show that Delta S-E congruent to Delta
   S-p, and Delta S-E congruent to Delta S-T. We further argue that in the
   case of conformational disorder without hydrodynamics, as for a flexible
   molecule's orientationally disordered or plastic crystal, Delta S-T
   would be more negative than Delta S-E for the same increase in Delta
   tau(alpha). For cyclo-octanol plastic crystal, whose octyl-ring would
   lose some of its dielectrically inactive conformational degrees of
   freedom on cooling, Delta S-T is five-times Delta S-E. Hence the entropy
   of such crystals may not be related to their tau(alpha), an aspect
   relevant to certain biopolymer crystals. We also mention other effects
   of E. The findings are relevant to a number of recent studies on the
   analysis of the effect of electric field on a liquid's properties. The
   method can be used to study the role of other entropy-altering variables
   in liquid crystals and ferromagnetic liquids. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity of solid nanoparticles (aluminum) in a nanoporous
   solid matrix (diatomaceous earth) is examined to understand the effect

   find that thermal conductivity is strongly dependent on load applied to
   prepare the mixture compacts, while porosity is influenced by the
   composition of the mixture. The addition of nanoparticles contributes to
   limited increases in thermal conductivity of the mixture by (1)
   increasing contact area between the mixture constituents and (2)
   reduction of porosity that leads to enhanced solid-gas coupling
   contribution. Thermal conductivity increases exponentially with external
   gas pressures due to the coupling effect between the solid particles and
   the entrapped air. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Compared to a composite containing randomly distributed particles,

   aligned into linear chains lying parallel to the loading direction. In
   contrast, chains aligned perpendicular to that direction produce
   negligible stiffness change. These outcomes reveal how zigzag chains,

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Membrane chromatography has significant potential for use in
   biopharmaceutical purification processes. However, currently available
   membrane chromatography devices give poor resolution and therefore their
   use is restricted to polishing applications, typically carried out in
   the flow-through mode. Laterally fed membrane chromatography (or LFMC)
   was developed specifically for carrying high-resolution multi component
   protein separations. Recent studies have shown that resolution obtained
   with LFMC is comparable to that obtained with equivalent resin-based
   packed bed chromatography. Therefore, LFMC combines high-resolution with
   high-productivity, a highly desirable attribute in any purification
   technique. In this paper we explain the workings of LFMC based on
   theoretical and experimental analysis of hydraulic flow-path and
   residence time distribution. Factors likely to affect efficiency of LFMC
   are discussed using a simple electrical circuit analogy. (C) 2016

Title = {{Using a box instead of a column for process chromatography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1468}},
Pages = {{164-172}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Columns with relatively short bed-height to diameter ratios are
   frequently used for process-scale chromatography applications such as
   biopharmaceutical purification. Non-uniform flow distribution within
   such columns could result in broad and poorly resolved eluted peaks,
   which could in turn affect purity, recovery and productivity of the
   process. Different strategies centered on improved column header design
   have been proposed for addressing this problem. This paper describes a
   radically different approach, i.e. the use of a chromatography box (or
   chromato-box) instead of a column, for addressing the challenges posed
   by flow mal-distribution in process-scale, packed-bed chromatography
   devices. The design of the chromatography box devices used in this study
   is based on a laterally-fed membrane chromatography (or LFMC) device,
   that has been described and discussed in several recent papers. The
   performances of two chromatography box devices were compared with their
   equivalent columns in terms of sharpness and asymmetry of flow-through
   and eluted peaks, number of theoretical plates per metre, and peak
   resolution in binary and ternary protein separations. In each of the
   above comparisons, the chromatography box devices performed better than
   their equivalent columns, clearly indicating their potential as an
   alternative in process-scale chromatography applications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{An optical back propagation (OBP) technique is investigated to
   compensate for nonlinear impairments in fiber optic communication
   systems with reconfigurable optical adddrop multiplexers (ROADMs). An
   OBP module consisting of an optical phase conjugator (OPC), amplifiers
   and dispersion-decreasing fibers (DDFs) fully compensates for the
   nonlinear impairments of a transmission fiber. The OBP module can be
   placed after each transmission fiber (inline OBP case) or at each
   network node (node OBP case). For a wavelength division multiplexing
   (WDM) system with 2400 km transmission distance and 32-quadrature
   amplitude modulation (QAM) format, inline OBP and node OBP bring
   Q-factor improvements of 4.9 dB and 5.6 dB as compared with linear
   compensation, respectively. In contrast, receiver-side digital back
   propagation (DBP) only provides 1.3 dB Q-factor gain, due to its
   incapability of mitigating inter-channel nonlinear e ff ects in fiber
   optic networks. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Sparse representations over redundant dictionaries have shown to produce
   high-quality results in various signal and image processing tasks.
   Recent advancements in learning-based dictionary design have made image
   compression using data-adaptive learned dictionaries a promising field.
   In this paper, we present a boosted dictionary learning framework to
   construct an ensemble of complementary specialized dictionaries for
   sparse image representation. Boosted dictionaries along with a
   competitive sparse coding form our ensemble model which can provide us
   with more efficient sparse representations. The constituent dictionaries
   of the ensemble are obtained using a coherence regularized dictionary
   learning model for which two novel dictionary optimization algorithms
   are proposed. These algorithms improve the generalization properties of
   the trained dictionary compared with several incoherent dictionary
   learning methods. Based on the proposed ensemble model, we then develop
   a new image compression algorithm using boosted multi-scale dictionaries
   learned in the wavelet domain. Our algorithm is evaluated for the
   compression of natural images. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm has better rate-distortion performance as compared
   with several competing compression methods, including analytic and
   learned dictionary schemes.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in developing microscale (i.e.,
   high-throughput) methods that enable multiple filtration experiments to
   be run in parallel with smaller sample amounts and thus reduce the
   overall required time and associated cost to run the filtration tests.
   Previous studies to date have focused on simply evaluating the
   filtration capacity, not the separation performance. In this work, the
   stirred-well filtration (SWF) method was used in combination with
   design-of-experiment (DOE) methods to optimize the separation
   performance for three binary mixtures of biomolecules: protein-protein,
   protein-polysaccharide, and protein-DNA. Using the parallel based format
   of the SWF method, eight constant-flux ultrafiltration experiments were
   conducted at once to study the effects of stirring conditions, permeate
   flux, and/or solution conditions (pH, ionic strength). Four separate
   filtration tests were conducted for each combination of process
   variables; in total, over 100 separate tests were conducted. The sieving
   coefficient and selectivity results are presented to match the DOE
   design format and enable a greater understanding of the effects of the
   different process variables that were studied. The method described
   herein can be used to rapidly determine the optimal combination of
   process factors that give the best separation performance for a range of
   membrane-based separations applications and thus obviate the need to run
   a large number of traditional lab-scale tests. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{A cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) based detector system has been developed
   with the goal of combining molecular breast imaging (MBI) and magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) to address shortcomings of each modality. The
   CZT detector system is comprised of four CZT modules tiled in a 2x2
   array. Each module consists of 256 pixels (16 x 16, 2.4 mm pixels) and
   features a built-in ASIC and FPGA. A custom digital readout circuit
   board was designed to interface the four modules with a microcontroller
   to a data acquisition PC. The system was placed within the bore of a 3 T
   GE Discovery MR750 and imaging performance of each modality evaluated
   using both sequential and simultaneous imaging protocols. The mean
   energy resolution of the gamma camera both inside and outside the MRI is
   7.3\% at 140 keV. The maximum increase in the integral uniformity was
   3\% when using a gradient echo MRI sequence while the mean differential
   uniformity when inside the MRI increased by 1\%. Spatial resolution
   varied in a predictable manner from 2.4 mm FWHM at the collimator face
   to 6.9 mm at 10 cm from the collimator. Performance of the 3 T GE
   Discovery MR750 using a 16-channel breast RF coil array was measured
   with and without the gamma camera present using a gradient echo and
   spoiled gradient echo imaging sequence. A realistic 99mTc-filled
   breast-like phantom containing two lesions (30: 1 lesion to background
   ratio) was used to assess the feasibility of both serial and
   simultaneous hybrid imaging. Sequential imaging resulted in a reduction
   in MRI SNR of 70-80\% and a further decrease of 93-98\% was observed
   when performing simultaneous MR/scintigraphy imaging, likely a result of
   RF interference originating from the CZT detector modules and associated
   analog electronics. Co-registered scintigraphic and MRI images display
   negligible geometric distortion when imaged with both simultaneous and
   serial imaging modes, thus indicating the feasibility of combining MBI
   with breast MRI.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the
   importance of the initial soil moisture state for flash flood
   magnitudes. Four extreme events that occurred in different case study
   regions were analysed, one winter and one autumn flash flood in the
   Glofiros and Almirida catchments in Crete, and two summer floods in the
   Rastenberg catchment in Austria. The hydrological processes were
   simulated by the spatially distributed flash flood model Kampus. For the
   Crete cases Kampus model was calibrated against remotely sensed soil
   moisture while for the Austrian case the model was calibrated against
   observed runoff. Kampus model was then used to estimate the sensitivity
   of the stream flow peak to initial soil moisture. The largest of the
   events analysed (in terms of specific peak discharge) was found to have
   a sensitivity of less than 0.2\% flood peak change per \% soil moisture
   change while the smallest event had a sensitivity of more than 3\% flood
   peak change per \% soil moisture change. This suggests that initial soil
   moisture effects on the flash flood response probably depend on event
   magnitude rather than on the climate or region. Moreover, the Austrian
   catchment was found to exhibit a more nonlinear relationship between
   antecedent soil moisture and the peak discharge than the Cretan
   catchments which was explained by differences in the soil type. (C) 2016

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study explores the inclusion of a groundwater recharge based design
   objective and the impact it has on the design of optimum groundwater
   monitoring networks. The study was conducted in the Hamilton, Halton,
   and Credit Valley regions of Ontario, Canada, in which the existing
   Ontario Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network was augmented with
   additional monitoring wells. The Dual Entropy-Multiobjective
   Optimization (DEMO) model was used in these analyses. The value of using
   this design objective is rooted in the information contained within the
   estimated recharge. Recharge requires knowledge of climate,
   geomorphology, and geology of the area, thus using this objective
   function can help account for these physical characteristics. Two
   sources of groundwater recharge data were examined and compared, the
   first was calculated using the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System
   (PRMS), and the second was an aggregation of recharge found using both
   the PRMS and Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSP-F). The
   entropy functions are used to identify optimal trade-offs between the
   maximum information content and the minimum shared information between
   the monitoring wells. The recharge objective will help to quantify
   hydrological characteristics of the vadose zone, and thus provide more
   information to the optimization algorithm. Results show that by
   including recharge as a design objective, the spatial coverage of the
   monitoring network can be improved. The study also highlights the
   flexibility of DEMO and its ability to incorporate additional design
   objectives such as the groundwater recharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The growth rate
   increased with treatment time up to a maximum because of improved
   membrane permeability, and then declined afterwards due to peroxide
   accumulation in the medium. The contents of chlorophylls, carotenoids,
   soluble carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins were also measured to
   understand possible changes on algal metabolism. The EF treatment of

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the transient performance improvement for
   path-following control of underactuated surface vessels (USVs) in the
   presence of oceanic disturbances. The traditional practice that chooses
   the tangent direction of the desired path as the desired heading may
   deteriorate the tracking performance in the curve following due to the
   nonzero sideslip angle therein. Also, the disturbances in wave filed
   greatly affect the transient path-following control. To this end, three
   contributions are made in this paper: 1) an amendment to the definition
   of the desired heading using the sideslip-angle compensation is
   presented to achieve a more accurate path-following maneuver; 2) a novel
   disturbances observer-based composite nonlinear feedback (DO-CNF)
   controller is proposed to restrain system overshoots and eliminate
   steady-state errors while dealing with multiple oceanic disturbances
   with unknown bounds; and 3) the variation of the yaw-rate reference for
   path-following objective is handled in the controller design, which can
   enhance the vessel's robustness to the changing of the path curvature.
   Comparative simulations verify the reasonability of the desired-heading
   amendment and the effectiveness of the DO-CNF approach in improving the
   transient path-following performance of USVs while satisfying actuator
   saturation considering the unknown disturbances and changing reference.}},

Abstract = {{A previous study by the authors provides an overview of existing seismic
   risk assessment approaches and available seismic fragility information
   and highlights the lack of relevant information for nonengineered
   residential buildings. The current paper proposes a procedure for
   developing empirical seismic fragility curves for nonengineered
   residential buildings using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seismic
   ground motion and shaking intensity maps presented in a geographic
   information system (GIS) format, to overcome the lack of ground motion
   recordings. The proposed procedure has been applied to a damage data set
   collected in Bantul Regency, Indonesia, in the aftermath of the May 2006
   Yogyakarta earthquake. Fragility curves for nonengineered single-story
   unreinforced masonry (URM) residential buildings have been derived using
   the damage data set for the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and
   pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) as the ground motion intensity
   measures. The developed fragility curves indicate the high seismic
   vulnerability of nonengineered residential buildings. This study also
   demonstrates the potential of utilizing USGS seismic ground motion data
   to develop empirical fragility curves for nonengineered residential
   buildings in developing countries. In addition, a comparison of the
   results from other seismic risk assessment studies highlights the
   significant influence of the derivation method used on the fragility
   curve characteristics. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Speckle, due to the interference of coherent light having random phases,
   can seriously degrade image quality in a laser based projection system.
   The speckle is even worse when the diode pumped solid state (DPSS)
   lasers are used as light sources since the laser linewidth from the DPSS
   lasers is usually very narrow. In this paper, a de-speckle system
   consisting of a multimode fiber (MMF), a dielectric elastomer actuator
   (DEA) and a lightpipe is proposed and demonstrated, which can reduce
   speckle significantly. The speckle reduction components used in the
   system are optimized, taking into account speckle reduction ability and
   optical efficiency. The proposed de-speckle system is low in cost and
   easy to set up. It features a low optical power penalty and is
   compatible with large venue laser projection for applications such as
   digital cinema. In the proposed de-speckle system, test images captured
   by a camera with a setup following the recently proposed speckle
   measurement standard can achieve a speckle contrast ratio as low as
   4.7\%. By adding a voice coil motor (VCM) to vibrate the MMF to generate
   temporal diversity, the speckle contrast ratio can be further reduced to
   3.7\%.}},

   Rates of Water Distribution Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Presented in this paper is a field data-based probabilistic approach to
   quantifying the expected pipe break rates of water distribution systems.
   Uncertain demands and variations in the roughness of pipes during their
   service lives are described as random variables. Sample values of these
   random variables are generated and input to a distribution system model
   to determine the resulting minimum and maximum pressures in Monte Carlo
   simulations. Based on an estimated break rate-maximum pressure
   relationship, the sample maximum pressures obtained from a Monte Carlo
   simulation are transformed into a sample of break rates, and the
   expected pipe break rate can subsequently be determined. The sample
   minimum pressures are used to gain a better understanding of the
   distribution network. This probabilistic approach is used for a part of
   the City of Hamilton's network in Ontario, Canada. The results show that
   the frequency of low-pressure events is very small, but a higher minimum
   pressure criterion would inevitably increase expected pipe break rates.
   Local field data collection is necessary to use the proposed
   methodology. Savings resulting from reduced pipe break rates justify
   costs associated with data collection.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of dendritic microstructures during the solidification of
   a Mg-15 wt\%Sn alloy was investigated in situ via fast synchrotron X-ray
   microtomography. To enable these in situ observations a novel
   encapsulation method was developed and integrated into a fast, pink
   beam, imaging beamline at Diamond Light Source. The dendritic growth was
   quantified with time using: solid volume fraction, tip velocity,
   interface specific surface area, and surface curvature. The influence of
   cooling rate upon these quantities and primary phase nucleation was
   investigated. The primary dendrites grew with an 18 branch, 6-fold
   symmetry structure, accompanied by coarsening. The coarsening process
   was assessed by the specific surface area and was compared with the
   existing models. These results provide the first quantification of
   dendritic growth during the solidification of Mg alloys, confirming
   existing analytic models and providing experimental data to inform and
   validate more complex numeric models. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The effects of void band orientation and crystallographic anisotropy on
   void growth and linkage have been investigated. 2D model materials were
   fabricated by laser drilling a band of holes into the gage section of
   sheet tensile samples using various orientation angles with respect to
   the tensile axis normal. Both copper and magnesium sheets have been
   studied in order to examine the role of crystallographic anisotropy on
   the void growth and linkage processes. The samples were pulled in
   uniaxial tension inside the chamber of an SEM, enabling a quantitative
   assessment of the growth and linkage processes. The void band
   orientation angle has a significant impact on the growth and linkage of
   the holes in copper. As the void band orientation angle is increased
   from 0 to 45, the processes of coalescence and linkage are delayed to
   higher strain values. Furthermore, the mechanism of linkage changes from
   internal necking to one dominated by shear localization. In contrast,
   the void band orientation does not have a significant impact on the void
   growth and linkage processes in magnesium. Void growth in these
   materials occurs non-uniformly due to interactions between the holes and
   the microstructure. The heterogeneous nature of deformation in magnesium
   makes it difficult to apply a coalescence criterion based on the void
   dimensions. Furthermore, the strain at failure does not show a
   relationship with the void band orientation angle. Failure associated
   with twin and grain boundaries interrupts the plastic growth of the
   holes and causes rapid fracture. Therefore, the impact of the local
   microstructure outweighs the effects of the void band orientation angle
   in this material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the joint multitarget (JoM) estimator proposed for the
   joint target detection and tracking (JoTT) filter is reformulated for
   the Gaussian mixture (GM) implementations of the multitarget
   multi-Bernoulli (MeMBer) filters. For this purpose, a mode-finding
   algorithm is employed to search for the most significant mode of a GM
   density. Thus, the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates of Bernoulli
   targets are determined. In addition, the multi-Bernoulli versions of the
   two conflicting objective functions for the Pareto-optimal value of the
   unknown JoM estimation constant are derived. Simulations compare the
   performance of the proposed JoM estimator with that of the marginal
   multitarget (MaM) estimator in a multitarget tracking scenario, where
   the probability of target detection is a function of target states. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JoM estimator
   outperforms the MaM estimator under moderately low-observable
   conditions. This is because the incomplete cost function of the MaM
   estimator is not adequate to obtain accurate cardinality estimates of
   targets without considering how well targets are localized.
   Nevertheless, the proposed JoM estimator may suffer from track
   termination latency more than the MaM estimator due to the definition of
   its cost function.}},

Title = {{A two-step approach to predict shear band development with crystal

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{265-273}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{A two-step approach is proposed to investigate the shear band formation
   in cold-rolled aluminum alloy sheet during plane strain tension,
   compression and simple shear tests. In the first step, a finite element
   model with only one element using Taylor type polycrystal plasticity
   model is applied to compute the stress-strain curve of the deformation.
   In the second step, a full scale mesoscopic simulation is applied for a
   further study of the details of the shear band development for cases
   with higher possibility of shear band formation as judged from the
   results in step I. Systematic studies show that the hardening/softening
   features of stress-strain curves obtained by one-element method well
   agree with the extent of macroscale shear bands development in
   mesoscopic scale simulation: softening or flat stress-strain curves
   correspond to the formation of severe macroscale shear band in
   mesoscopic scale simulation, and the stronger the softening is, the more
   severe the macroscale shear band is, whereas no macroscale shear band is
   developed when the curves exhibit continuous and obvious hardening.
   Therefore, when it is needed to investigate probability and features of
   shear band formation in many samples or loading modes, e.g. loading
   along different directions, people can use the first step to efficiently
   estimate the possibility of macroscale shear band development for all
   the cases concerned, and then apply the full scale mesoscopic simulation
   only for those cases where stress-strain curves exhibit little hardening
   or softening features. Our calculations show that the computation
   efficiency can be substantially improved by the two-step approach. (C)

Abstract = {{A solvent-free electrostatic separation method was employed to separate
   navy bean flour (NBF) into protein-rich (PR) and starch-rich (SR)
   fractions. The physicochemical properties of NBF and separated fractions
   were compared to proteins (navy bean isolate (NBI) and 7S globulin)
   prepared using a wet process. Gel electrophoresis confirmed that the
   protein distribution in the isolated fractions was similar to that of
   NBF. The protein profile of NBI and 7S globulin was found to be devoid
   of certain proteins that were found in the NBF and PR fraction. Amino
   acid analysis revealed that the NBI and 7S globulin had a lower content
   of sulfur-containing amino acids compared to NBF and the
   electrostatically isolated fractions. CD and fluorescence spectroscopy
   confirmed that denaturation of the proteins during the acid
   precipitation is likely. This novel solvent-free electrostatic
   separation process preserves the native protein structure found in NBF
   and improves the recovery of some of the smaller MW proteins. (C) 2016

Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{615}},
Pages = {{358-365}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{The effect of using indium, a deep-level acceptor in silicon, as a
   dopant for an ultra-thin film ( 2.5 mu m thick) single-crystalline
   silicon solar cell has been investigated. Indium acts as a p-type dopant
   in silicon with an energy level 0.157 eV above the valence band and the
   use of this deep-level acceptor has been proposed as a method to enable
   sub-bandgap transitions via the impurity photovoltaic ( IPV) effect. In
   the current work, a maximum conversion efficiency under 1 sun
   illumination, air mass 1.5, of 4.74 +/- 0.2\% is measured for a solar
   cell using indium as a p-type dopant. An equivalently processed cell
   using boron in place of indium has a maximum efficiency of 4.16 +/-
   0.2\%. Similar relative increases in efficiency have been observed for
   nine individual devices. The area of the cells is 0.5 x 0.5 cm(2) with
   7\% covered by the metal contacts. A dual-junction analytical model is
   used to show that for all indium-doped cells in this study there exists
   an enhancement in the generation of charge carriers compared to
   boron-doped cells. External-Quantum-Efficiency measurements of both
   boron and indium doped cells shows an enhancement in optical to
   electrical conversion for wavelengths of similar to 470-1000 nm when
   indium is used as a dopant. No significant conversion is observed for
   wavelengths >1100 nm, in contradiction of an IPV effect existing in
   these devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the air separation industry, distillation-based cryogenic separation
   is the dominant technology for large-scale production of high-purity
   nitrogen, oxygen, and argon products. The use of rigorous dynamic models
   in the design and operation of air separation units can provide insights
   into the plant operation to inform the development of economically
   beneficial designs and operating practices. In this study, we provide a
   comprehensive analysis on a liquid storage and vaporization strategy for
   air separation units following a two-tiered multiperiod formulation with
   a collocation-based dynamic model. Economic incentives for collecting
   liquid, either directly as liquid product or by liquefaction of
   overproduced gas product, and then redistribution for meeting gas
   product demand or for use as additional reflux are explored in a
   transient market environment. This includes different electricity price
   and/or demand profiles, operation costs, as well as product
   specifications. Operation bottlenecks due to process dynamics constrain
   the operation practice and hence influence the potential profitability.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors study transmission scheduling for a two-way
   relay network in time-varying fading channels, where the relay node can
   opportunistically use traditional one-way relay technique or network
   coding to forward traffic to the end nodes. They formulate a stochastic
   dynamic programme with the objective of minimising the long-run cost,
   defined as a function of both the transmission power and data
   transmission delay. An unconstrained Markov decision process model is
   developed and solved for the average and discounted cost problems. The
   optimal solution requires high computational and modelling complexity
   when the state space is large. For this reason, they develop heuristic
   solutions with lower complexity. For the discounted cost problem, a
   simulation-based dynamic programming algorithm is proposed that not only
   simplifies the modelling process and reduces the computational
   complexity, but also achieves close-to-optimum cost. For the average
   cost problem, a heuristic scheduling scheme is proposed, which makes
   transmission decisions based on estimated costs in the current and next
   time slots. The heuristic scheme achieves close-to-optimum cost
   performance while greatly reducing the computational complexity.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{160-169}},

Abstract = {{Solidification morphology directly impacts the mechanical properties of
   materials; hence many models of the morphological evolution of dendritic
   structures have been formulated. However, there is a paucity of
   validation data for directional solidification models, especially the
   direct observations of metallic alloys, both for cellular and dendritic
   structures. In this study, we performed 4D synchrotron X-ray tomographic
   imaging (three spatial directions plus time), to study the transition
   from cellular to a columnar dendritic morphology and the subsequent
   growth of columnar dendrite in a temperature gradient stage. The
   cellular morphology was found to be highly complex, with frequent
   lateral bridging. Protrusions growing out of the cellular front with the
   onset of morphological instabilities were captured, together with the
   subsequent development of these protrusions into established dendrites.
   Other mechanisms affecting the solidification microstructure, including
   dendrite fragmentation/pinch-off were also captured and the quantitative
   results were compared to proposed mechanisms. The results demonstrate
   that 4D imaging can provide new data to both inform and validate
   solidification models. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The surface of regenerated cellulose membranes was modified by
   irreversible adsorption-of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). Pairs of wet
   CMC-modified membranes were laminated with polyvinylamine (PVAm) at
   room, temperature, and the delamination force for wet membranes was
   measured for both dried and never-dried laminates. The wet adhesion was,
   studied as a function of PVAm molecular weight, amine :content,: and
   deposition pH of the polyelectrolyte. Surprisingly the PVAm CMC system
   gave substantial wet adhesion that exceeded that of TEMPO-oxidized
   membranes with PVAm for both dried and never-dried laminates. The
   greatest wet adhesion was achieved for fully hydrolyzed high molecular
   weight PVAm. Bulk carboxymethylation of cellulose membranes gave
   inferior wet adhesion combined with PVAm as compared to CMC adsorption
   which indicates,that a CMC layer of the order of 10 nm Was necessary.
   There are no obvious covalent cross linking reactions between CMC and
   PVAm at room temperature, and on the basis of our results, we are
   instead attributing the wet adhesion to complex formation between the

   nanoparticles perform as flotation collectors as they spontaneously
   adsorb onto 43 mu m glass beads in water, promoting glass bead
   attachment to air bubbles. Under our flotation conditions at room
   temperature, polystyrene is a hard plastic, whereas, with glass
   transition near room temperature, poly(n-butyl methacrylate) is a soft
   polymer. Colloidal probe atomic force microscopy measurements revealed
   that the pull-off forces and the work of adhesion of PS-PB nanoparticles
   to glass were significantly higher than observed with harder PS
   particles. Glass bead recovery in laboratory flotation experiments
   increased significantly with thickness of the soft PB shells on the
   PB-PS core/shell nanoparticles. Ninety-two nm Janus particles consisting
   of one PS and one PB lobe were also very effective collectors. We
   propose that high nanoparticle/glass bead adhesion minimizes
   nanoparticle removal by bead/bead collisions (nanoscale ball milling)
   during mixing and flotation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we study the mechanical activation of a new type of
   spiropyran mechanophore cross-linker,
   (1'-(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)-3',3'-dimethylspiro{[}chromene-2,2'-indol
   in]-6-yl)methyl methacrylate (MA-SP3-MA) in poly methyl acrylate (PMA),
   prepared via free radical polymerization. Compared with other SPs, SP3
   mechanophore shows two unique features. First, the films exhibit good
   sensitivity towards mechanical force but not to UV irradiation. Second,
   the merocyanine (MC)-to-SP reversion in PMA films after relaxation was
   very fast. Further, the mechanical activation can be repeated for three
   times but with diminishing of peak color, caused by the damage of
   overstrained polymer chains. We also observe that increasing SP content
   leads to stiffer and more rigid elastomer as well as earlier threshold
   strain for activation point of SP to MC but has little effect on
   threshold stress for SP activation. This work offers inspirations
   towards mechanophore design for polymeric materials to broaden the scope
   of potential applications of mechanophores. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Polar discontinuity at interfaces plays deterministic roles in charge
   transport, magnetism, and even superconductivity of functional oxides.
   To date, most polar discontinuity problems have been explored in
   heterointerfaces between two dissimilar materials. Here, we show that
   charged domain walls (CDWs) in epitaxial thin films of ferroelectric
   PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 are strongly coupled to polar interfaces through the
   formation of 1/2 < 101 > \{h0l\}-type crystallographic shear planes
   (CSPs). Using atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy we illustrate
   that the CSPs consist of both conservative and nonconservative segments
   when coupled to the CDWs where necessary compensating charges for
   stabilizing the CDWs are associated with vacancies at the CSPs. The
   CDW/CSP coupling yields an atomically narrow domain wall, consisting of
   a single atomic layer of oxygen. This study shows that the CDW/CSP
   coupling is a fascinating venue to develop emergent material properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hydraulic fracture model based on a fully coupled,
   pore pressure-effective stress formulation. The stress-strain behavior
   of the solid phase is modeled using an elasto-plastic, Mohr Coulomb
   description. Hydraulic conductivity is related to the difference between
   mean effective stress and tensile strength via a hyperbolic tangent
   function that takes into account the relative permeability using the
   Corey correlation. The effect of the damage coefficient E on fracture
   propagation is studied via the hyperbolic function and the sensitivity
   of the solution to the aspect ratio of the elements is checked. Three
   types of material distributions are considered: homogeneous domain in
   which the material properties are constant; heterogeneous domain where
   multi-layered materials with strong and weak layers are included; and
   multi-layered material in which the values of the material properties
   for each layer are randomly generated using a PYTHON script. The
   propagation mechanisms and fracture features are discussed. Finally the
   propagation process, the extent of the fracture zone and pore pressure
   changes from a series of numerical simulations using ABAQUS are
   presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of isochronal annealing on D2 tool steel powder, rapidly
   solidified via both Impulse Atomization and Water Atomization, has been
   evaluated using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and Vickers
   microhardness. The amount of supersaturation of the alloying elements
   inside the retained austenite phase as a function of eutectic
   undercooling was calculated. The fraction of austenite transformed to
   ferrite at different annealing temperatures (from 350 degrees C to 810
   degrees C) was also determined, using Rietveld analysis. The results
   show that although the particles with larger eutectic undercooling have
   larger supersaturation of alloying elements within the retained
   austenite phase, they have a smaller fraction of austenite to ferrite
   transformation at the temperature in which transformation starts. The
   maximum hardness was achieved at an annealing temperature of 550 degrees
   C, due to the formation of fine and well-distributed carbides. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Hierarchically structured materials, inspired by sophisticated
   structures found in nature, are finding increasing applications in a
   variety of fields. Here, we describe the fabrication of wrinkled gold
   nanoparticle films, which leverage the structural tunability of gold
   nanoparticles to program the wavelength and amplitude of gold wrinkles.
   We have carefully examined the structural evolution and tuning of these
   wrinkled surfaces through varying nanoparticle parameters (diameter,
   number of layer, density) and substrate parameters (number of axes
   constrained during wrinkling) through scanning electron microscopy and
   cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. It is found that
   nanoparticle layers of sufficient density are required to obtain
   periodical wrinkled structures. It was also found that tuning the
   nanoparticle diameter and number of layers can be used to program the
   wrinkle wavelength and amplitude by Changing the film thickness and
   mechanical properties. This dual degree of tunability, not previously
   seen with continuous films, allows us to develop one of the smallest
   wrinkles developed to date with tunability in the sub-100 nm regime. The
   effect of the induced structural tunability on the enhancement of the
   intensity of the 4-mercaptopyridine Raman spectra is also studied
   through the application of these. devices as substrates for
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), where wrinkling proves to be
   an effective method for enhancing the SERS signal in Cases where there
   is an inherently low density of gold nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the fabrication of an electrochemical supercapacitor
   (ES) with high gravimetric and areal capacitances, achieved at a high
   mass ratio of active material to current collector. The active material,
   polypyrrole, is in situ polymerized in an aerogel-based current
   collector composed of crosslinked cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Mechanical robustness,
   flexibility, and low impedance of the current collectors are achieved by
   the chemical crosslinking of CNC aerogels and efficient dispersion of
   MWCNTs through the use of bile acid as a dispersant. Furthermore, the
   advanced electrode design results in low contact resistance. A
   single-electrode areal capacitance of 2.1 F cm(-2) is obtained at an
   active mass loading of 17.8 mg cm(-2) and an active material to current
   collector mass ratio of 0.57. Large area ES electrodes and devices show
   flexibility, excellent compression stability at 80\% compression, and
   electrochemical cyclic stability over 5000 cycles. Moreover, good
   retention of capacitive properties is achieved at high charge-discharge
   rates and during compression cycling. The results of this investigation
   pave the way for the fabrication of advanced lightweight ES, which can
   be used for energy storage in wearable electronic devices and other
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output
   (D-MIMO) system, where the channel is flat fading and may be correlated,
   and experiences both small-and large-scale fading. We assume that full
   knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is available at the
   receiver and that only the first-and second-order statistics of the
   channel are available at the transmitter. For such a system with square
   quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), an asymptotic symbol error
   probability (SEP) is derived for the linear zero-forcing (ZF) receiver.
   Then, we propose an optimal diagonal power loading (PL) strategy that
   minimizes the dominant term of the asymptotic SEP subject to either a
   total transmission power constraint when the total power normalization
   coefficient can be fed back to the transmitter from the receiver or an
   individual transmission power constraint. A simple closed-form solution
   is obtained. Computer simulations show that our presented optimal system
   attains significant performance gains over the currently available equal
   PL system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a frame rate upconversion method using optical
   flow motion estimation and a patch-based reconstruction scheme. First,
   forward and backward motion vectors (MVs) are obtained using an optical
   flow algorithm, and reconstructed versions of the current and previous
   frames are generated by our patch-based reconstruction scheme. Using the
   original and reconstructed versions of the current and previous frames,
   two mismatch masks are obtained. Then, two versions of the middle frame
   are generated using a patch-based scheme, with estimated MVs and the
   current and previous frames. Finally, a middle mask, which identifies
   the mismatch areas of the two middle frames, is reconstructed. Using
   these three masks, the best candidates for interpolation are selected
   and fused to obtain the final middle frame. Due to the patch-based
   nature of our reconstruction scheme, most of the holes and cracks will
   be filled. Although there is always a probability of having holes, the
   size and number of such holes are much smaller than those that would be
   generated using pixel-based mapping. The rare holes are filled using
   existing hole-filling algorithms. The experimental results and a
   comparison of our method with existing algorithms show that our method
   performs better in terms of both objective and subjective quality of the
   final interpolated frames. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
   improvement of our method is 1-2 dB.}},

   amplitude constraints. In this paper, a 2-D signal space for bandlimited
   optical intensity channels is presented. A novel feature of this model
   is that the non-negativity and peak constraints are relaxed, and the
   signal space parameterizes the probability of the negative or peak
   amplitude excursions in the output. Although the intensity channel only
   supports non-negative amplitudes, the impact of clipping on system
   performance is shown to be negligible if the likelihood of the negative
   excursion is small. A tractable approximation using finite series is
   used to accurately compute the probability of clipping under average and
   peak optical power constraints. The optical power and spectral
   efficiencies using hexagonal lattice constellations are computed.
   Schemes designed in this paper have higher average and peak optical
   power gains than M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) using previously
   established techniques for spectral efficiencies greater than 2.5 and
   3.5 bits/s/Hz, respectively. For high spectral efficiency, e.g., greater
   than 6 bits/s/Hz, the proposed scheme attains a more than 2-dB average
   and peak optical power gain over 16-PAM using the previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel seven-level (7L) voltage source converter
   for high-power medium-voltage applications. The proposed topology is an
   H-bridge connection of two nested neutral-point clamped (NNPC)
   converters and is referred to as an HNNPC converter. This converter
   exhibits advantageous features, such as operating over a wide range of
   output voltages, particularly for 10-15 kV applications, without the
   need to connect power semiconductors in series; high-quality output
   voltage; and fewer components relative to other classic seven-level
   topologies. A novel sinusoidal pulse width modulation technique is also
   developed for the proposed 7L-HNNPC converter to control flying
   capacitor voltages. One of the main features of the control strategy is
   the independent application of control to each arm of the converter to
   significantly reduce the complexity of the controller. The performance
   of the proposed converter is studied under different operating
   conditions via MATLAB/Simulink simulation, and its feasibility is
   evaluated experimentally on a scaled-down prototype converter.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature-dependence of xyloglucan (XG) adsorption onto smooth
   cellulose model films regenerated from N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO)
   was investigated using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and it
   was found that the adsorbed amount increased with increasing,
   temperature. This implies that the adsorption of XG to NMMO-regenerated
   cellulose is endothermic and supports the:hypothesis that the adsorption
   of XG onto cellulose is an entropy-driven process. We suggest that XG
   adsorption is mainly driven by the release of water molecules from the
   highly hydrated cellulose surfaces and from the XG molecules, rather
   than through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces as previously
   suggested. To test this hypothesis, the adsorption of XG onto cellulose
   was studied using cellulose films with different morphologies prepared
   from cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), semicrystalline NMMO-regenerated
   cellulose, and amorphous cellulose regenerated from lithium
   chloride/dimethylacetamide. The total amount of high molecular weight
   xyloglucan (XG(HMW)) adsorbed was, studied by quartz crystal
   microbalance and reflectometry measurements, and it was found that the
   adsorption was greatest on the amorphous cellulose followed by the CNC
   and NMMO-regenerated cellulose films. There was a significant
   correlation between the cellulose dry film thickness and the adsorbed XG
   amount, indicating that XG penetrated into the films. There was also a
   correlation between the swelling of the films and the adsorbed amounts
   and conformation of XG, which further strengthened the conclusion that
   the water content and the subsequent release of the water upon
   adsorption are important components of the adsorption process.}},

Abstract = {{The comparative corrosion resistance of two high-chromium austenitic
   Fe-Cr-Ni alloys, namely Type 310S stainless steel (UNS S31008) and Alloy
   33 (UNS R20033), was examined after exposure in supercritical water (25
   MPa and 550 degrees C), using a flow-loop autoclave testing facility
   operated at a flow rate of 200 mL/min. Electron microscopy techniques
   were used to determine links between the composition and structure of
   the Cr2O3-based oxide scale formed on both alloys and the difference in
   corrosion resistance observed. The weight change kinetics was distinctly
   different: progressively positive (weight gain) for Type 310S stainless
   steel and progressively negative (weight loss) for Alloy 33. The
   descaled weight loss was lower for Alloy 33, indicating improved
   corrosion resistance. This improved corrosion resistance was attributed
   to the improved stability of the Cr2O3-based scale that formed on Alloy
   33 despite the negative weight change kinetics. The suitability of these
   alloys as candidate fuel cladding for the Generation IV supercritical
   water-cooled reactor concept is discussed in light of the findings
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of forces in cutting operations is a valuable asset to
   manufacturers. This paper demonstrates the improvements in force
   prediction achievable in finite element simulations of orthogonal
   cutting with the incorporation of temperature-dependent friction data
   obtained from a custom heavy-load, high-temperature tribometer. The
   tribometer employed is briefly described and its similarities to
   tool-chip contact in cutting discussed. Simulations with the
   temperature-dependent friction data were performed over a range of uncut
   chip thickness, cutting speed, and tool flank wear conditions. For
   comparison sake, select simulations were also run using a constant
   friction coefficient model and all simulation results were validated
   against experimentally obtained force measurements. The
   temperature-dependent friction data simulations capture the experimental
   trends in force with respect to all three of the parameters
   investigated. For unworn tools, the simulations tend to slightly
   overestimate the tangential and feed force components. For worn tool
   profiles, the simulations predicted forces with minimal error for most
   scenarios, overestimating the tangential force and underestimating the
   feed force. Comparison of simulated temperatures with the range of those
   for which experimental material properties were obtained, particularly
   friction coefficients, is proposed as a useful check as to whether
   simulation results can be reasonably trusted.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) is an attractive solid-state
   optical detector that offers ultra-high photon sensitivity (down to the
   single photon level), high speed (sub-nanosecond dead time) and good
   timing performance (less than 100 ps). In this work, the impact of the
   silicide layer on SPAD's characteristics, including the breakdown
   voltage, dark count rate (DCR), after-pulsing probability and photon
   detection efficiency (PDE) is investigated. For this purpose, two sets
   of SPAD structures in a standard 130 nm complementary metal oxide
   semiconductor (CMOS) process are designed, fabricated, measured and
   compared. A factor of 4.5 (minimum) in DCR reduction, and 5 in PDE
   improvements are observed when the silicide layer is removed from the
   SPAD structure. However, the after-pulsing probability of the SPAD
   without silicide layer is two times higher than its counterpart with
   silicide. The reasons for these changes will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is
   the most recent coordinated experiment of global climate modeling.
   Compared to its predecessor CMIP3, the fifth phase of the homonymous
   experiment-CMIP5 involves a greater number of GCMs, run at higher
   resolutions with more complex components. Here we use daily GCM data
   from both projects to test their efficiency in representing
   precipitation and temperature parameters with the use of a state of the
   art high resolution gridded global dataset for land areas and for the
   period 1960-2005. Two simple metrics, a comprehensive histogram
   similarity metric based on the match of simulated and observed empirical
   pdfs and a metric for the representation of the annual cycle were
   employed as performance indicators. The metrics were used to assess the
   skill of each GCM at the entire spectrum of precipitation and
   temperature pdfs but also for the upper and lower tails of it. Results
   are presented globally and regionally for 26 land regions that represent
   different climatic regimes, covering the total earth's land surface
   except for Antarctica. Compared to CMIP3, CMIP5 models perform better in
   simulating precipitation including relatively intense events and the
   fraction of wet days. For temperature the improvement is not as clear
   except for the upper and lower hot and cold events of the distribution.
   The agreement of model simulations is also considerably increased in
   CMIP5. Substantial improvement in intense precipitation is observed over
   North Europe, Central and Eastern North America and North East Europe.
   Nevertheless, in both ensembles some models clearly perform better than
   others from a histogram similarity point of view. The derived skill
   score metrics provide essential information for impact studies based on
   global or regional land area multi-model ensembles.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of this overview deals with an effect of interior
   insulation that changes thermal regime in a wall and thereby affects
   moisture performance of this wall. Moderately cold and wet climate is
   probably the most difficult to deal with because any interior insulation
   increases a number of freeze-thaw cycles that takes place during
   winters. In this respect, materials used for interior thermal insulation
   are separated depending on their air leakage characteristics and where
   needed an additional air barrier system is added. This article discusses
   one-step freeze-thaw method for assessment of clay brick durability and
   different materials that can be used for interior insulation.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, increased emissions regulations and a push for less dependence
   on fossil fuels are factors that have enticed a growth in the market
   share of alternative energy vehicles. Readily available energy storage
   systems (ESSs) pose a challenge for the mass market penetration of
   hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug- in HEVs, and EVs. This is mainly
   due to the high cost of ESS available today. However, tremendous
   research efforts are going into reducing the cost of these storage
   devices, increasing their lifespan, and improving their energy density.
   This paper aims to give an overview of the current state of readily
   available battery and ultracapacitor (UC) technologies as well as a look
   ahead toward promising advanced battery chemistries and next generation
   ESS. Energy management systems and various battery balancing
   configurations are discussed in addition to battery state/parameter
   estimation and protection mechanisms. Finally, hybrid ESSs (HESS) are
   reviewed as a mitigation strategy to the shortcomings of traditional
   battery and UC technologies. Consideration is given to the combination
   of advanced battery chemistries with UCs to portray HESS performance,
   which can meet and exceed the performance of current ESS technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a first of its kind assessment of butanol production from
   macroalgae through a thermochemical route is carried out. Different
   process configurations were designed and simulated in Aspen Plus to
   quantify their mass and energy balances. Furthermore, economic and
   environmental metrics such as the minimum butanol selling price (MBSP),
   and cost of CO2 equivalent emissions (CO(2)e) avoided were used to
   assess the potential of the different configurations under different
   market scenarios, with comparisons carried out amongst the
   configurations as well as against standard literature references of
   similar processes. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was used to assess
   the impact that changes in key parameters have on the considered
   metrics. The results show that configurations which import natural gas
   and electricity as utility sources alongside the macroalgae feedstock
   offer the lowest MBSP, however they do poorly when cost of CO(2)e
   avoided is considered. On the other hand, the configurations which
   utilize only macroalgae offer the best potential for cost of CO(2)e
   avoided but have the poorest values for MBSP. In addition, the cost of
   CO(2)e avoided obtained for the best configurations are in line with
   literature references. However, the MBSP values are higher than
   literature references for butanol derived from cellulosic feedstock
   primarily due to the high ash content in seaweed. The sensitivity
   analyses results show that changes in gasoline prices have a very
   significant effect on the plant configurations in the South Korean
   market, but not as significantly in the United States market. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In radio frequency wireless communications with additive white Gaussian
   noise (AWGN), the commonly used bipolar pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)
   is considered to be the most energy-efficient 1-D constellation and
   admits a fast maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. For visible light
   communication (VLC) over AWGN channels, the unipolar PAM constellations
   are generated by adding proper direct currents to the bipolar PAM and
   have the same properties. However, for VLC systems with single-photon
   avalanche diode (SPAD VLC), the channel has additive Poisson noise
   (APN), and as a result, modified PAM over APN channels is not
   energy-efficient and its ML receiver has exponentially increasing
   complexity against average bit rate per symbol. In this letter, we first
   propose a low-complexity Anscombe root (AR) receiver by using AR
   transformation to approximately transform the APN channels into AWGN
   channels. Then, for SPAD VLC, with this proposed AR receiver, an
   energy-efficient constellation is designed by minimizing the average
   transmitted optical power for a fixed minimum Euclidean distance and
   shown to be the squared version of unipolar PAM constellations.
   Furthermore, for this constellation, an equally spaced threshold
   receiver is developed. Extensive simulations indicate that: 1) the
   proposed receiver and the ML receiver have almost the same error
   performance for PAM and our optimally designed constellation,
   respectively and 2) our designed constellations significantly outperform
   the unipolar PAM constellation for ML and our proposed receivers.}},

Abstract = {{This letter proposes an integrated InGaAsP-InP/silicon-on-insulator
   (SOI) polarization insensitive semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA).
   The SOA consists of an SOI waveguide-based polarization diversity
   circuit and an InGaAsP-InP gain block. Input light with arbitrary linear
   polarization state will pass through the gain block twice for a
   roundtrip with mutually orthogonal polarization state in its forward and
   backward path, respectively. As such, the polarization-dependent gain
   (PDG) is effectively reduced. Since the returning path is not spatially
   overlapped with the forward path, no extra circulator is needed and the
   device still has two separate ports, one for input and one for output.
   Simulation results show that the PDG is negligibly small and the device
   has a broad working band of 60 nm for a PDG below 0.5 dB. This design is
   compatible with the mature semiconductor fabrication technology and can
   be monolithically integrated with other optical components.}},

Abstract = {{Improvements in medicine and healthcare are accelerating. Information
   generation, sharing, and expert analysis, play a great role in improving
   medical sciences. Big data produced by medical procedures in hospitals,
   laboratories, and research centers needs storage and transmission. Data
   compression is a critical tool that reduces the burden of storage and
   transmission. Medical images, in particular, require special
   consideration in terms of storage and transmissions. Unlike many other
   types of big data, medical images require lossless storage. Special
   purpose compression algorithms and codecs could compress variety of such
   images with superior performance compared to the general purpose
   lossless algorithms. For the medical images, many lossless algorithms
   have been proposed so far. A compression algorithm comprises of
   different stages. Before designing a special purpose compression method
   we need to know how much each stage contributes to the overall
   compression performance so we could accordingly invest time and effort
   in designing different stages. In order to compare and evaluate these
   multi stage compression techniques and to design more efficient
   compression methods for big data applications, in this paper the
   effectiveness of each of these compression stages on the total
   performance of the algorithm is analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   lenses with hyaluronic acid (HA), a carbohydrate naturally contributing
   to the wettability of the native tear film. A two-step preparation

   covalent grafting of hydrazide-functionalized HA via simple immersion
   resulted in a model lens surface that is significantly more wettable,
   more water retentive, and less protein binding than unmodified pHEMA
   while maintaining the favorable transparency, refractive, and mechanical
   properties of a native lens. The dipping/coating method we developed to
   covalently tether the HA wetting agent is simple, readily scalable, and

Title = {{Mitigating covert channels based on analysis of the potential for
   communication}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{643}},
Pages = {{1-37}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{The existence and usage of covert channels in systems of communicating
   agents poses a significant threat to the confidentiality of information.
   It is difficult to fully prevent the possibility of covert channels in a
   system without limiting the communication between its components or
   negatively affecting its behaviour. However, by developing an
   understanding of when a covert channel may exist in a given system and
   which agents are more prone to covert channels than others, approaches
   for mitigating covert channels can be developed in such a way that they
   are able to preserve overall system functionality and the communication
   between its components and with its environment. In this paper, we
   propose an approach for mitigating covert channels in systems of
   communicating agents based on an analysis of the potential for
   communication amongst system agents. First, we propose a mathematical
   framework for communication and concurrency called Communicating
   Concurrent Kleene Algebra (C(2)KA). We use C(2)KA to present a
   formulation of the potential for communication condition for covert
   channel existence. Then, we show how to use the proposed formulation and
   its mathematical background to analyse systems of communicating agents
   in order to devise an approach for modifying the behaviours of agents in
   a system of communicating agents in order to eliminate the potential for
   communication, thus eliminating the potential for a covert channel,
   while still preserving the overall system functionality. Using an
   illustrative example, we show how to specify a system of communicating
   agents using the mathematical framework of C(2)KA and we demonstrate and
   discuss the proposed mitigation approach. We also report on the use of a
   prototype tool that supports the automated verification and analysis of
   the potential for communication condition for covert channel existence.

Abstract = {{A novel two-stage reheating process with new alloy design has been
   developed to improve the microstructure morphology of semisolid Al-Si
   casting aluminum alloy for thixoforming. The process consists of first
   reheating the material to the liquidus temperature, holding for 5 min,
   and then lowering to the predetermined two-stage reheating temperature
   between 843-863 K and holding for 10 min. The experimentally-obtained
   grain diameter, roundness, and the amount of liquid trapped within the
   solid phase were characterized, along with the microstructure obtained
   using the traditional feedstock reheating process. The Wilcox test (with
   alpha = 0.05) was then applied to statistically analyze the measured
   differences in the microstructures obtained using the two different
   processing routes. It was found that a refined near-spherical structure
   with uniform globule size, higher sphericity, lower coarsening rate
   constant, and less entrapped liquid was obtained via the new two-stage
   reheating process in comparison with the microstructure obtained using
   the traditional feedstock reheating process.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamic modelling of a recompression CO2 power cycle for low
   temperature waste heat recovery}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{441-452}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Due to the rising prices of conventional fossil fuels, increasing the
   overall thermal efficiency of a power plant is essential. One way of
   doing this is waste heat recovery. This recovery is most difficult for
   low temperature waste heat, below 240 degrees C, which also covers
   majority of the waste heat source. Carbon dioxide, with its low critical
   temperature and pressure, offers an advantage over ozone-depleting
   refrigerants used in Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) and hence is most
   suitable for the purpose. This paper introduces parametric optimization
   of a transcritical carbon dioxide (T-CO2) power cycle which recompresses
   part of the total mass flow of working fluid before entering the
   precooler, thereby showing potential for higher cycle efficiency.
   Thermodynamic model for a recompression T-CO2 power cycle has been
   developed with waste heat source of 2000 kW and at a temperature of 200
   degrees C. Results obtained from this model are analysed to estimate
   effects on energetic and exergetic performances of the power cycle with
   varying pressure and mass recompression ratio. Higher pressure ratio
   always improves thermodynamic performance of the cycle - both energetic
   and exergetic. Higher recompression ratio also increases exergetic
   efficiency of the cycle. However, it increases energy efficiency, only
   if precooler inlet temperature remains constant. Maximum thermal
   efficiency of the T-CO2 cycle with a recompression ratio of 0.26 has
   been found to be 13.6\%. To minimize total irreversibility of the cycle,
   an optimum ratio of 0.48 was found to be suitable. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Defects caused by high grinding temperatures on both workpieces and
   grinding wheels become more significant with the development of
   difficult-to-machine materials and creep-feed grinding procedures. The
   coolants normally used to dissipate heat can cause harm to the
   environment as well as increase machining costs. A novel idea that
   incorporates a revolving heat pipe into the grinding wheel has been
   proposed to enhance heat transfer in the contact zone. In this study, a
   simulation is performed to investigate the heat transfer mechanism in
   the evaporator and condenser section of a revolving heat pipe grinding
   wheel (RHPGW) at a wheel velocity of 45 m/s. The results indicate that
   natural convection heat transfer and film condensation occur under this
   condition. The heat transfer and startup performance of the RHPGW are
   investigated in further experiments with different working fluids, fluid
   loadings and rotational speeds. Finally, experiments on creep-feed
   grinding of Inconel 718 are performed using a RHPGW and a grinding wheel
   without a revolving heat pipe, without application of any coolant. The
   results show that grinding temperatures can be maintained below 100
   degrees C with a RHPGW and both the workpiece and grinding wheel show
   better quality than those when grinding is performed without a revolving
   heat pipe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a formulation for field problems using hybrid
   polygonal finite elements, taking steady state seepage through a porous
   material as the focus. We make comparisons with a conventional finite
   element formulation based on a single primary variable, focussing on the
   advantages of the hybrid formulation in terms of flux field accuracy and
   extension to convex polygonal shaped elements. For the unconfined case,
   we adopt a head dependent hydraulic conductivity that does not require
   remeshing. The performance of the hybrid polygonal element formulation
   is demonstrated through a series of numerical examples. The results show
   a sensitivity of the location of the free surface in unconfined seepage
   to mesh configuration for hybrid quadrilateral meshes with various
   aspect ratios, but not for hybrid polygonal meshes with various
   orientations and irregularity. Examination of the free surface location
   results for several conforming shape function options shows an
   insensitivity to choice of interpolation function, provided that it
   conforms with the assumptions in the formulation. Copyright (c) 2016

Title = {{Relation of impact strength to the microstructure of functionally graded

Abstract = {{Functionally graded (FG) materials owe their advantage over conventional
   composites to the continuous microstructure that eliminates many
   problems like delamination and stress jumps. Functionally graded porous
   structures have the added advantage of significant weight reduction
   while maintaining comparable strength to the solid precursor. One of the
   attractive applications of FG porous polymers is impact energy
   absorption. This is due to their viscoelastic nature that helps in
   energy dissipation, in addition to their light weight compared to metals
   and ceramics. In this work, FG porous structures of Acrylonitrile
   Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were fabricated with thermally activated
   microspheres. One-dimensional heat flow was introduced across the
   thickness with different terminal temperatures to induce a thermal
   gradient. Different compositions and processing conditions were carried
   out to investigate the relationship between impact energy and
   microstructure. Impact energy showed stronger correlation to pores'
   diameter gradient than to porosity. The fairly strong correlation
   between diameter gradient, permitted expansion ratio, and porosity
   indicates the potential to control the microstructure and hence impact
   energy absorption. Functionally graded porous structures of ABS
   demonstrated their superiority for impact absorption with
   strength-to-weight ratio of 46.02 J cm(3)/g compared to 25.71 J cm(3)/g
   for solid ABS. This work provides processing guidelines to fabricate FG
   porous structures of ABS in relation to impact energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{ELBW survivors in early adulthood have higher hepatic, pancreatic and
   subcutaneous fat}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Premature birth in conjunction with extremely low birth weight (<1 kg,
   ELBW) is associated with insulin resistance and increased
   cardiometabolic health risk compared to birth at full term with normal
   birth weight (NBW). However, little is known regarding the biologic
   mediators of these effects. Abdominal and ectopic lipid accumulation is
   linked to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, yet whether ELBW
   survivors are predisposed to aberrant lipid deposition in adulthood is
   unknown. We used magnetic resonance imaging in a cohort of 16 NBW and 29
   ELBW participants to determine if ELBW survivors have differences in
   pancreatic, hepatic, subcutaneous and visceral fat distribution compared
   to NBW participants. ELBW individuals had a higher proportion of liver
   and pancreatic fat compared to NBW subjects (P < 0.05). Abdominal
   subcutaneous fat, but not visceral fat, area was higher in ELBW
   survivors compared to NBW individuals. In multivariate analyses, tissue
   fat measures were most highly related to BMI and sex, but not preterm
   birth. This work highlights that fat deposition is enhanced in adults
   born preterm and suggests that ectopic fat accretion driven by their
   relatively greater adiposity may contribute to the higher rates of
   metabolic dysfunction seen in ELBW survivors.}},

Title = {{Aging kinetics of levoglucosan orientational glass as a rate dispersion
   process and consequences for the heterogeneous dynamics view}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Aging kinetics of a glass is currently modeled in terms of slowing of
   its a-relaxation dynamics, whose features are interpreted in terms of
   dynamic heterogeneity, i. e., formation and decay of spatially and
   temporally distinct nm-size regions. To test the merits of this view, we
   studied the calorimetric effects of aging an orientational glass of
   levoglucosan crystal in which such regions would not form in the same
   way as they form in liquids, and persist in structural glasses, because
   there is no liquid-like molecular diffusion in the crystal. By measuring
   the heat capacity, C-p, we determined the change in the enthalpy, H, and
   the entropy, S, during two aging-protocols: ( a) keeping the samples
   isothermally at temperature, T-a, and measuring the changes after
   different aging times, t(a), and ( b) keeping the samples at different
   T(a)s and measuring the changes after the same t(a). A model-free
   analysis of the data shows that as t(a) is increased ( procedure ( a)),
   H and S decrease according to a dispersive rate kinetics, and as T-a is
   increased ( procedure ( b)), H and S first increase, reach a local
   maximum at a certain T-a, and then decrease. Even though there is no
   translational diffusion to produce ( liquid-like) free volume, and no
   translational-rotational decoupling, the aging features are
   indistinguishable from those of structural glasses. We also find that
   the Kohlrausch parameter, originally fitted to the glass-aging data,
   decreases with decrease in T-a, which is incompatible with the current
   use of the aging data for estimating the alpha-relaxation time. We argue
   that the vibrational state of a glass is naturally incompatible with its
   configurational state, and both change on aging until they are
   compatible, in the equilibrium liquid. So, dipolar fluctuations seen as
   the alpha-relaxation would not be the same motions that cause aging. We
   suggest that aging kinetics is intrinsically dispersive with its own
   characteristic rate constant and it does not yield the alpha-relaxation
   rate. In this view, thermodynamic and other properties define the
   fictive temperature; the real or imaginary components of a dynamic
   property do not define it. While particles' overall motions may still
   play a crucial role in ( structural) glass physics, we conclude that
   translational diffusion alone is not a requirement for structure
   stabilization on aging of a kinetically frozen state. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{A periodic array of vertical InSb nanowires (nws) was designed for
   photodetectors in the midwavelength infrared (MWIR) region (lambda = 3-5
   mu m). Simulations, using the finite element method, were implemented to
   optimize the nw array geometrical parameters (diameter (D), period (P),
   and length (L)) for high optical absorptance, which exceeded that of a
   thin film of equal thickness. Our results showed HE1n resonances in InSb
   nw arrays can be tuned by adjusting D and P, thus enabling multispectral
   absorption throughout the near infrared to MWIR region. Optical
   absorptance was investigated for a practical photodetector consisting of
   a vertical InSb nw array embedded in bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) as a
   support layer for an ultrathin Ni contact layer. Polarization

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental model study of the
   transient loading of steam generator tubes during a postulated main
   steam line break (MSLB) accident in a nuclear power plant. The problem
   involves complex transient two-phase flow dynamics and fluid-structural
   loading processes. A better understanding of this phenomenon will permit
   the development of improved design tools to ensure steam generator tube
   integrity. The pressure and temperature were measured upstream and
   downstream of a sectional model of a tube bundle in cross-flow, and the
   transient tube loads were directly measured using dynamic piezoelectric
   load cells. High-speed videos were taken to observe and better
   understand the flow phenomena causing the tube loading. The working
   fluid was R-134a and the tube bundle was a normal triangular array with
   a pitch ratio of 1.36. The flow through the bundle was choked for the
   majority of the transient. The transient tube loading is explained in
   terms of the associated fluid mechanics. An empirical model is developed
   that enables the prediction of the maximum tube loads once the pressure
   drop is known.}},

Abstract = {{In order to address the problem of passive tracking from multiple
   asynchronous angle-only sensors with location uncertainty in heavy
   clutter, a new iterative maximum-likelihood probabilistic
   data-association algorithm is proposed in this paper. An iterative
   prediction-update framework is adopted in the algorithm to
   simultaneously estimate the target state as well as the sensor state. At
   the prediction stage, a deterministic sampling approach is used to
   adjust the measurement covariance with sensor location uncertainty. Then
   a two-step grid-search technique is proposed to optimize the
   log-likelihood ratio, combined with a gradient-based search method. At
   the update stage, the operational sensor states are updated with target
   state estimates and measurements in corresponding validation gates. The
   updated sensor states are used to establish a more accurate
   log-likelihood ratio in the next iteration, which leads to better
   parameter estimation. In addition, the effects of the sensor location
   uncertainty on the track acceptance test and the posterior Cramer-Rao
   lower bound are also analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed
   method provides a computationally efficient way to improve track
   initialization performance in heavy clutter with sensor location
   uncertainty. The proposed work has applications in sonar tracking,
   geolocation, electronic support measures, and infrared search and
   tracking systems.}},

Abstract = {{Bearing-only estimation is one of the fundamental and challenging
   problems in target tracking. As in the case of radar tracking, the
   presence of offset or position biases can exacerbate the challenges in
   bearing-only estimation. Modeling various sensor biases is not a trivial
   task, and not much has been done in the literature specifically for
   bearing-only tracking. This paper addresses the modeling of offset
   biases in bearing-only sensors and the ensuing multitarget tracking with
   bias compensation. Bias estimation is handled at the fusion node to
   which individual sensors report their local tracks in the form of
   associated measurement reports (AMRs) or angle-only tracks. The modeling
   is based on a multisensor approach that can effectively handle a
   time-varying number of targets in the surveillance region. The proposed
   algorithm leads to a maximum likelihood bias estimator. The
   corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bound to quantify the theoretical
   accuracy that can be achieved by the proposed method or any other
   algorithm is also derived. Finally, simulation results on different
   distributed tracking scenarios are presented to demonstrate the
   capabilities of the proposed approach. In order to show that the
   proposed method can work even with false alarms and missed detections,
   simulation results on a centralized tracking scenario where the local
   sensors send all their measurements (not AMRs or local tracks) are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To present a fully flow-compensated multiecho gradient echo
   sequence that can be used for MR angiography (MRA), susceptibility
   weighted imaging (SWI), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
   and to study the effects of flow acceleration and background field
   gradients on flow compensation.
   Methods: The quality of flow compensation was evaluated using the data
   from eight volunteers. The effects of flow acceleration were studied by
   changing the polarities of the readout gradients in two consecutive
   scans. The background field was used to estimate the phase errors of
   flow compensation in the presence of field inhomogeneities. SWI and QSM
   data were generated with confounding arterial phase removed. T-2{*} maps
   were obtained from the multiecho data to estimate T-2{*} of arterial
   blood.
   Results: Reasonable flow compensation was achieved. Nevertheless,
   background field gradients and acceleration-induced phase errors were
   found to be as large as p/2 and p/3, respectively, both in agreement
   with theory. T-2{*} was measured as 8264 ms and 7469 ms for arteries
   inside and outside the brain, respectively, at 3T.
   Conclusion: High-quality MRA, SWI, and QSM data can be obtained
   simultaneously. Masking out the arteries to remove the phase due to flow
   acceleration and background field gradients improves the quality of both
   SWI and QSM data. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is essential for evaluating
   different options for blast risk management. However, depending on the
   risk management approach being considered, a rigorous blast PRA study
   can be quite demanding. To expedite this process, a simplified PRA
   framework is proposed for reinforced concrete-block shear wall
   buildings, in order to determine design basis threat (DBT) fragility
   curves based on revised damage limit states most suitable for risk
   assessment. The current definitions of damage states by North American
   standards for blast resistant design involve global response limitssuch
   as the support rotations of a structural elementthat are relatively
   simple to calculate. However, such damage state descriptors can be
   insufficient for the cost-benefit analysis required to evaluate
   different risk mitigation options. As such, building on recent advances
   in the area of performance-based seismic design of concrete-block shear
   wall buildings, this study proposes revised damage states that can be
   associated with more useful metrics, including repair technique and
   building downtime. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a
   hypothetical shear wall building is analyzed under different DBT levels.
   The DBT fragility curves are obtained through Monte Carlo sampling of
   the random variables describing the shear wall system and are used to
   identify the locations that are most suitable for the erection of
   barriers for blast protection. The proposed PRA framework can be used to
   identify target performance requirements, formulated in terms of
   stakeholders' tolerable probability of failure and consequent risk
   management, for different classes of buildings under a range of DBTs.

Abstract = {{The increased demand for resilient infrastructure under accidental or
   deliberate explosions has resulted in the urgent need to quantify the
   performance of both existing and new building components under such
   extreme loading events. The current study focuses on evaluating the
   resilience of reinforced masonry (RM) shear wall systems under blast,
   which is accomplished by quantifying the walls' blast response in the
   out-of-plane direction and the resulting damage levels. In seismic
   zones, such RM walls are detailed to resist in-plane loads in a ductile
   manner, and thus minimal damage is usually expected. Given that blast
   resistant design of civilian buildings only recently has been formally
   introduced in North American design standards, quantifying the
   out-of-plane response and ductility capacities of RM shear walls has not
   been common practice in mainstream building design. In this paper, a
   nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model is developed to predict
   the out-of-plane response of RM wall components under blast loading. The
   SDOF model is first validated by using live explosive (free-field) test
   results. Subsequently, the model is used to perform a numerical
   investigation beyond the range of experimental parameters adopted in the
   test program, by considering a number of wall design characteristics
   such as wall reinforcement ratio, concrete block size and strength, wall
   height, and reinforcement arrangements; a wider range of design basis
   threat levels--identified by charge-mass and standoff-distance
   combinations--is also considered. In general, the study indicates that
   RM walls are capable of withstanding substantial explosions, which would
   result in different damage intensities depending on the wall
   vulnerability and blast hazard levels. The study also shows that
   significant reduction in the wall out-of-plane response can be achieved
   by using two layers of reinforcement instead of the typical single layer
   in RM walls, even in the case of reduced reinforcement ratio. The SDOF
   model is also used to develop RM wall performance charts that can be
   further refined to serve as design guidelines for the purpose of blast
   risk mitigation in future editions of the North American blast design
   standards. Finally, the findings from this study indicate that RM walls
   that are detailed to respond in a ductile manner under in-plane seismic
   loads might not necessarily exhibit a ductile response when subjected to
   out-of-plane blast loads. The latter observation highlights the
   importance of adopting a holistic multihazard design approach when
   evaluating the vulnerability and resilience of building systems under
   extreme events. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{A typical seismically designed reinforced masonry building is composed
   of structural walls, constructed following the same prescriptive
   detailing requirements corresponding to a code classified seismic force
   resisting system (SFRS). However, due to architectural requirements
   (i.e.to allow for requirements such as openings and wall intersections),
   some of these walls might have the same overall aspect ratio but differ
   in their cross-section configurations. The companion paper presented the
   experimental results and force-based seismic design parameters for walls
   that fall under the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) ductile shear
   walls and the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC)
   special-reinforced walls SFRS classifications. The current paper
   utilizes the experimental results to extract key displacement-based
   seismic design parameters, including wall yield and ultimate curvatures,
   wall displacements at yield and at the post-yield stages, stiffness
   degradation, period elongation, and equivalent viscous damping. The
   paper also identifies different damage states and links them to wall
   drift levels, as well as the extent of plasticity within the wall base
   region as key performance-based seismic design parameters. The study
   showed that using a mechanics-based approach, the curvature ductility
   values were at least double the theoretical code values predicted for
   most walls. In addition, within the same SFRS classification, walls
   having the same overall aspect and reinforcement ratios will possess
   significantly different displacement-based seismic design parameters,
   which would subsequently influence their predicted response under
   seismic events. Moreover, the results showed that slab-coupled masonry
   walls showed an enhanced overall performance compared with the
   rectangular and flanged walls tested. Subsequently, it is suggested that
   future editions of the CSA and MSJC account for the effects of varying
   the wall cross section and slab coupling influence on the seismic
   response of ductile/special walls SFRS classifications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The reported experimental study documents the performance of six fully
   grouted reinforced concrete block structural walls tested under
   quasistatic cyclic loading. The walls fall under the ductileshear walls
   and the special reinforced masonry walls seismic force resisting system
   (SFRS) classification of the Canadian and U.S. standards, respectively.
   The test matrix consisted of one rectangular, one flanged, and two
   slab-coupled walls, all with an overall aspect ratio of 1.4. In
   addition, two rectangular walls, representing the individual components
   of the slab-coupled wall systems, were tested to quantify the wall slab
   coupling effects. In addition to discussing the experimental results,
   the study also presents key force-based seismic design (FBSD)
   parameters, such as the wall lateral load capacity, plastic hinge
   length, wall failure modes, and displacement ductility capacities.
   Moreover, the effects of wall cross-sectional configuration and slab
   coupling on the cyclic response and deformation capabilities of the
   walls are discussed. In general, the yield and ultimate loads were found
   to be accurately predicted using the Canadian Standards Association
   (CSA) S304-14 and Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) formulations.
   The wall experimental displacement ductility values (calculated at 20\%
   strength degradation) ranged between 5.4 and 7.6, whereas the idealized
   displacement ductility values at the same strength degradation level
   ranged between 3.4 and 5.4. The analysis results reported in the paper
   highlight the fact that walls designed and detailed within the same SFRS
   classification possess significantly different FBSD parameters. The
   results also indicate that slab coupling, although not recognized as a
   wall coupling mechanism in the current editions of the CSA and MSJC, can
   have significant influences on the seismic response of ductile/special
   reinforced masonry wall systems. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Sea clutter has a major impact on the detection performance of a
   shipborne high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) system. Due to the
   platform motion of shipborne HFSWR, the Doppler spectrum of the
   first-order sea clutter suffers from some broadening so that the targets
   submerged in this broadening Doppler spectrum can be hardly detected. In
   this letter, an improved oblique projection (IOP) method, combining the
   oblique projection (OP) algorithm and the method of sea clutter
   suppression in the Doppler domain, is proposed to suppress sea clutter
   in both Doppler domain and spatial domain for shipborne HFSWR. Compared
   with the OP and the orthogonal weighting algorithms, the proposed IOP
   algorithm is shown to give far superior suppression results in the
   Doppler domain and can achieve better azimuth estimation results based
   on real data.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that a
   significant degree of anisotropy may occur in particulate materials that
   have nearly spherical aggregates (i.e., are typically considered as
   isotropic) provided there is a bias in the distribution of pore space as
   a result of the initial densification process. The study included both
   an experimental and a theoretical component. An experimental program was
   conducted on dynamically compacted samples of Ottawa standard sand
   (C109) and incorporated a series of tests performed at different
   orientations of the specimens. Following the experimental part, a
   plasticity formulation based on the critical-plane approach was
   presented. A systematic procedure for identification of material
   parameters was outlined, and some numerical simulations of a series of
   triaxial tests were conducted. The last part of this work dealt with a
   much weaker load-induced anisotropy. Here, the mathematical framework
   was enhanced by an evolution law for the material fabric. Again, some
   numerical simulations were conducted, and it was demonstrated that the
   proposed framework can, at least in a qualitative manner, account for
   various manifestations of induced anisotropy.}},

Title = {{Pressure Standards in Water Distribution Systems: Reflection on Current
   Practice with Consideration of Some Unresolved Issues}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Pressure standards assist in the design of water distribution systems
   and the assessment of their performance. Although exact thresholds are
   sometimes rather vague, unusually high and low pressures are widely
   understood to increase costs and put systems at risk from events like
   pipe bursts at the high-pressure end to the risk of contaminant
   intrusion or poor firefighting conditions at the low-pressure end.
   Interestingly, because the definition of what conditions constitute
   acceptable pressures differs around the world, a delivery pressure might
   be considered acceptable in some regions and unacceptable in others. But
   if a wider range of system conditions is considered, including transient
   events, an interesting question arises as to what exactly the standards
   might mean and how violations should be evaluated. Specifically, what
   kinds of pressure transgressions are most crucial to system performance
   and economics and what kinds are merely inconvenient? Certainly the
   issue of evaluating consequences is relevant, but it is also complex
   because some consequences are not easily attributed to specific system
   conditions. As this paper considers, the frequency, duration, and
   intensity of the pressure violation are all relevant, but so is the
   vulnerability of the system to those violations. Few of these issues
   have yet received adequate attention, but it is to raising such a
   discussion that this paper is aimed. There is no doubt that pressure
   standards can help to assess system performance and to trigger system
   evolution (i.e.,operational and capital investments). But if the
   criteria themselves, and the means to evaluate them, are too vague, so
   will be the corrective outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the impact of Kerr nonlinearity and stimulated Raman
   scattering on the whispering gallery modes of an optical microsphere.
   When two resonant modes are nonlinearly interacting due to the Kerr
   effect, a resonant mode undergoes a frequency shift that depends not
   only on its energy, but also on the energy of the other mode. A
   mathematical theory is developed taking into account the tensorial
   nature of the third-order susceptibility and vector nature of whispering
   gallery modes. The technique is extended to include stimulated Raman
   scattering, and coupled mode equations are developed to describe the
   energy transfer between the pump and Stokes waves without ignoring
   self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation. The analytical model
   is found to be in good agreement with the numerical results in
   situations where the pump depletion is negligible. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{Climate and weather patterns are an essential resource for outdoor
   tourism activities. The projected changes in climate and weather
   patterns are expected to affect the future state of tourism. The present
   study aims to quantify the positive or negative effect of a 2 A degrees
   C global warming on summertime climate comfort in the sense of
   exercising activities that involve light body activity. The
   well-established Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) and three variants of
   the widely used Tourism Climatic Index (TCI) were analyzed.
   Additionally, a new index based on TCI and CIT was tested and compared
   against the precious indices. Past and future climate data of five
   high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) from different
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of the
   European Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment
   (Euro-CORDEX) for a +2 A degrees C period were used. The results
   indicate improvement in the climate comfort for the majority of European
   areas for the May to October period. For the June to August period,
   central and northern European areas are projected to improve, while
   marginal improvement is found for Mediterranean countries. Furthermore,
   in specific cases of adjacent Mediterranean areas such as the southern
   Iberian Peninsula, the June to August climate favorability is projected
   to reduce as a result of the increase to daytime temperature. The use of
   a set of different indices and different RCMs and RCPs samples a large
   fraction of the uncertainty that is crucial for providing robust
   regional impact information due to climate change. The analysis revealed
   the similarities and the differences in the magnitude of change across
   the different indices. Moreover, discrepancies were found in the results
   of different concentration pathways to the +2 A degrees C global
   warming, with the RCP8.5 projecting more significant changes for some of
   the analyzed indices. The estimation of the TCI using different
   timescale climate data did not change the results on tourism
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidics has advanced magnetic blood fractionation by making
   integrated miniature devices possible. A ferromagnetic microstructure
   array that is integrated with a microfluidic channel rearranges an
   applied magnetic field to create a high gradient magnetic field (HGMF).
   By leveraging the differential magnetic susceptibilities of cell types
   contained in a host medium, such as paramagnetic red blood cells (RBCs)
   and diamagnetic white blood cells (WBCs), the resulting HGMF can be used
   to continuously separate them without attaching additional labels, such
   as magnetic beads, to them. We describe the effect of these
   ferromagnetic microstructure geometries have on the blood separation
   efficacy by numerically simulating the influence of microstructure
   height and pitch on the HGMF characteristics and resulting RBC
   separation. Visualizations of RBC trajectories provide insight into how
   arrays can be optimized to best separate these cells from a host fluid.
   Periodic microstructures are shown to moderate the applied field due to
   magnetic interference between the adjacent teeth of an array. Since
   continuous microstructures do not similarly weaken the resultant HGMF,
   they facilitate significantly higher RBC separation. Nevertheless,
   periodic arrays are more appropriate for relatively deep microchannels
   since, unlike continuous microstructures, their separation effectiveness
   is independent of depth. The results are relevant to the design of
   microfluidic devices that leverage HGMFs to fractionate blood by
   separating RBCs and WBCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hot tearing susceptibility is commonly assessed using a pressure drop
   equation in the mushy zone that includes the effects of both tensile
   deformation perpendicular to the thermal gradient as well as shrinkage
   feeding. In this study, a Pore Fraction hot tearing model, recently
   developed by Monroe and Beckermann (JOM 66:1439-1445, 2014), is extended
   to additionally include the effect of strain rate parallel to the
   thermal gradient. The deformation and shrinkage pore fractions are
   obtained on the basis of the dimensionless Niyama criterion and a
   scaling variable method. First, the model is applied to the binary Al-Cu
   system under conditions of directional solidification. It is shown that
   for the same Niyama criterion, a decrease in the cooling rate increases
   both the deformation and shrinkage pore fractions because of an increase
   in the time spent in the brittle temperature region. Second, the model
   is applied to the industrial aluminum alloy AA5182 as part of a finite
   element simulation of the Direct Chill (DC) casting process. It is shown
   that an increase in the casting speed during DC casting increases the
   deformation and shrinkage pore fractions, causing the maximum point of
   pore fraction to move towards the base of the casting. These results
   demonstrate that including the strain rate parallel to the thermal
   gradient significantly improves the predictive quality of hot tearing
   criteria based on the pressure drop equation.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of intragranular ferrite (IGF) formation in inclusion
   engineered steels with either Ti2O3 or TiN addition were investigated
   using in situ high temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy.
   Furthermore, the chemical composition of the inclusions and the final
   microstructure after continuous cooling transformation was investigated
   using electron probe microanalysis and electron backscatter diffraction,
   respectively. It was found that there is a significant effect of the
   chemical composition of the inclusions, the cooling rate, and the prior
   austenite grain size on the phase fractions and the starting
   temperatures of IGF and grain boundary ferrite (GBF). The fraction of
   IGF is larger in the steel with Ti2O3 addition compared to the steel
   with TiN addition after the same thermal cycle has been imposed. The
   reason for this difference is the higher potency of the TiO (x) phase as
   nucleation sites for IGF formation compared to the TiN phase, which was
   supported by calculations using classical nucleation theory. The IGF
   fraction increases with increasing prior austenite grain size, while the
   fraction of IGF in both steels was the highest for the intermediate
   cooling rate of 70 A degrees C/min, since competing phase
   transformations were avoided, the structure of the IGF was though
   refined with increasing cooling rate. Finally, regarding the starting
   temperatures of IGF and GBF, they decrease with increasing cooling rate
   and the starting temperature of GBF decreases with increasing grain
   size, while the starting temperature of IGF remains constant
   irrespective of grain size.}},

Abstract = {{ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total
   energy, charge density, electronic structure and many other properties
   of systems made of electrons and nuclei, (molecules and periodic solids)
   within Density Functional Theory (DFT), Many-Body Perturbation Theory
   (GW approximation and Bethe Salpeter equation) and Dynamical Mean Field
   Theory (DMFT). ABINIT also allows to optimize the geometry according to
   the DFT forces and stresses, to perform molecular dynamics simulations
   using these forces, and to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective
   charges and dielectric tensors. The present paper aims to describe the
   new capabilities of ABINIT that have been developed since 2009. It
   covers both physical and technical developments inside the ABINIT code,
   as well as developments provided within the ABINIT package. The
   developments are described with relevant references, input variables,
   tests and tutorials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The organic diode, or metal-organic-metal (MOM) structure, is
   constituent key building block of organic-devices. The physical
   understanding and performance evaluation of these devices usually
   require proper modeling and simulation of the metal-organic structure. A
   topic of major concern in the simulation of the MOM structure, although
   frequently mishandled, is the selection of proper boundary conditions at
   the metal-organic interface. In this work, we determine the boundary
   conditions for the charge density at the metal-organic contact.
   Symmetric and asymmetric organic diodes with unipolar and bipolar
   conduction are analyzed. Using experimental current-voltage curves, an
   analytical method to determine the value of the charge density at the
   contacts is proposed. In single-carrier diodes, we observe that the
   charge concentration at the interface due to injection follows a
   power-law function of the current in metal-organic contacts in
   drift-dominated transport. This boundary condition is the way to
   introduce the contact effects in models. The contact affects the other
   regions (e.g., the bulk) as a boundary condition. This boundary
   condition for the charge density keeps information about the limited
   recombination velocity at the contacts and the contribution from space
   charge limited conduction (SCLC) in the bulk. In diffusion-dominated
   transport, at low bias close to the diode's built-in voltage, the charge
   density at the contact is almost constant with the current. The complete
   relation between charge and current for injecting electrodes, extracted
   from the analysis of single-carrier diodes, can be used as boundary
   condition in bipolar devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The monitoring of pH values of liquids for environmental, industrial,
   and biological applications requires sensitive, stable, compact, and
   easy-to-use pH sensors. Here, we develop an inkjet printing process to
   deposit functionalized single-wall carbon nanotubes as both electron
   conduction and pH sensitive layers. Doping and de-doping of the carbon
   nanotubes by hydronium and hydroxide ions is the primary pH sensing
   mechanism. Multi-pass printing is used to deposit closely packed thin
   films and reduce the electrode resistance for efficient electron
   conduction and improved pH sensitivity. The printed electrodes on glass
   substrates show a reproducible pH sensitivity of 48.1 mV/pH with an
   average response time of 7 s and a small hysteresis of 4 mV. In
   addition, similar pH sensing behaviors are obtained by carbon nanotubes
   printed on flexible polymeric substrates. The developed inkjet printing
   process and pH sensing electrodes provide a cost-effective solution for
   future electrochemical monitoring systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{611}},
Pages = {{62-67}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Terbium-doped silicon-rich silicon oxide films were deposited and
   hydrogenated at elevated temperatures. The influence of hydrogenation on
   defects-mediated non-radiative recombination of excited Tb3+ ions was
   investigated by means of photoluminescence and photoluminescence decay
   measurements. An increase in photoluminescence intensity and
   photoluminescence decay time was observed upon hydrogenation for the
   main 5D4-7F5 transition of Tb3+ ions. This observation was ascribed to
   saturation of non-radiative recombination defect centers with hydrogen.
   It was found that the number of emitted photons increases upon
   passivation as a result of two effects: (1) a reduction of the
   non-radiative recombination rate, and (2) optical activation of new Tb3+
   emitters. Based on the obtained results and literature data, Forster
   energy-transfer was suggested as the interaction responsible for the
   non-radiative coupling between Tb3+ ions and defects. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An inkjet printing process for depositing palladium (Pd) thin films from
   a highly loaded ink (>14 wt\%) is reported. The viscosity and surface
   tension of a Pd-organic precursor solution is adjusted using toluene to
   form a printable and stable ink. A two-step thermolysis process is
   developed to convert the printed ink to continuous and uniform Pd films
   with good adhesion to different substrates. Using only one printing
   pass, a low electrical resistivity of 2.6 mu Omega m of the Pd film is
   obtained. To demonstrate the electrochemical pH sensing application, the
   surfaces of the printed Pd films are oxidized for ion-to-electron
   transduction and the underlying layer is left for electron conduction.
   Then, solid-state reference electrodes are integrated beside the
   bifunctional Pd electrodes by inkjet printing. These potentiometric
   sensors have sensitivities of 60.6 +/- 0.1 and 57 +/- 0.6 mV pH(-1) on
   glass and polyimide substrates, and short response times of 11 and 6 s,
   respectively. Also, accurate pH values of real water samples are
   obtained by using the printed sensors with a low-cost multimeter. These
   results indicate that the facile and cost-effective inkjet printing and
   integration techniques may be applied in fabricating future
   electrochemical monitoring systems for environmental parameters and
   human health conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aimed to investigate the role of adenosine
   triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters on the efflux and the
   toxicity of nanoparticles in liver and kidney cells. In this study, we
   synthesized CdTe quantum dots (QDs) that were monodispersed and emitted
   green fluorescence (maximum peak at 530 nm). Such QDs tended to
   accumulate in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), human kidney
   cells 2 (HK-2), and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and cause
   significant toxicity in all the three cell lines. Using specific
   inhibitors and inducers of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance
   associated proteins (Mrps), the cellular accumulation and subsequent
   toxicity of QDs in HepG2 and HK-2 cells were significantly affected,
   while only slight changes appeared in MDCK cells, corresponding well
   with the functional expressions of ABC transporters in cells. Moreover,
   treatment of QDs caused concentration- and time- dependent induction of
   ABC transporters in HepG2 and HK-2 cells, but such phenomenon was barely
   found in MDCK cells. Furthermore, the effects of CdTe QDs on ABC
   transporters were found to be greater than those of CdCl2 at equivalent
   concentrations of cadmium, indicating that the effects of QDs should be
   a combination of free Cd2+ and specific properties of QDs. Overall,
   these results indicated a strong dependence between the functional
   expressions of ABC transporters and the efflux of QDs, which could be an
   important reason for the modulation of QDs toxicity by ABC transporters.

Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Since it is rare that a grain can be fully twinned, an empirical
   equation has been introduced in the current crystal plasticity models to
   terminate twinning within that grain. In the present paper, a new
   empirical equation for describing the termination of twinning in
   magnesium alloys is developed. The new description introduces only a
   single parameter, while the widely used empirical equation involves two
   parameters. It is demonstrated that it is easy to calibrate the single
   parameter and the proposed empirical equation is able to accurately
   simulate the experimentally observed rapid hardening associated with the
   twinning exhaustion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline diamond films have been deposited by pulsed electron

   sapphire, and cubic boron nitride. Based on experimental measurement
   data, obtained from various analytical techniques, it has been observed
   that sp3 bonded carbon content, grain size, film roughness, and
   nanocrystalline fraction of the films do not seem to be much affected by
   the type of substrate material used. The thickness of the films, in the
   range of; 70-90 nm, seems to be relatively the same irrespective of the
   substrate material. Hardness measurements have shown that film hardness,
   ranging between 18.5 and 19.5 GPa, is not remarkably influenced by the

   mapping atomic orbitals for a long time. Here, we explore its
   capabilities by a first-principles approach. For the example of defected

   expected, depending on the orbital character. To judge the feasibility
   of visualizing orbitals in a real microscope, the effect of the optics'
   aberrations is simulated. We demonstrate that, by making use of energy
   filtering, it should indeed be possible to map atomic orbitals in a
   state-of-the-art transmission electron microscope.}},

   ion cross -linked alginate hydrogel with a MOF ligand solution. MOF
   particles are well distributed and embedded in and on the surface of the
   composites. The macroscopic shape of the composite can be designed by
   controlling the shape of the corresponding hydrogel; thus MOF alginate
   beads, fibers, and membranes are obtained. In addition, four different
   MOF alginate composites, including HKUST-1, ZIF-8, MIL-100(Fe), and
   ZIF-67 alginate, were successfully prepared using different metal ion
   cross -linked alginate hydrogels. The mechanism of formation is

Abstract = {{Poly(acrylic acid) with grafted TEMPO moieties, PAA-T, phase separates
   over the pH range 2-4, whereas at lower and higher pH, the polymer is
   water-soluble. The pH range of the two-phase region increases linearly
   with the content of grafted TEMPO moieties. As evidenced by surface
   tension measurements, the PAA-T molecules have little hydrophobic
   character. We propose that at low pH PAA-T is an amphoteric polymer
   that, in addition the anionic carboxyl groups, contains cationic species
   resulting from the disproportion of TEMPO at low pH. Furthermore, we
   propose that two-phase regions occur near the isoelectric points of the
   polymer, suggesting that phase separation is due to electrostatically
   driven association of polymer molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Suspensions of Ag and MnO2 nanoparticles in n-butanol were prepared by
   synthesis in aqueous solutions and liquid-liquid extraction to the
   n-butanol phase. Lauryl gallate (LG) was used as a reducing agent for
   the fabrication of Ag nanoparticles from AgNO3 solutions. MnO2
   nanoparticles were prepared by the reduction of KMnO4 with n-butanol. LG
   showed strong adsorption on Ag and MnO2 particles allowing for their
   liquid-liquid extraction. The adsorption mechanism involved complexation
   of metal atoms on the particle surface with phenolic OH group of LG. The
   synthesis and liquid-liquid extraction method offers benefits for
   nanotechnology, which were demonstrated by the fabrication of advanced
   supercapacitor electrodes and devices. LG allowed co-dispersion of
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and MnO2 in the n-butanol phase. In
   this strategy as-synthesized MnO2 nanoparticles were mixed directly with
   MWCNT. This avoided the difficulties associated with extracting
   particles from aqueous suspensions and subsequent particle agglomeration
   during the drying stage. The MnO2-MWCNT nanocomposite electrodes showed
   an exceptionally high capacitance of 8.0 F cm(-2) at a scan rate of 2 mV
   s(-1) and significant improvement in capacitance retention at high
   charge-discharge rates. Excellent capacitive performance was achieved at
   high active mass loading and a large ratio of active material to current
   collector mass. It was found that such capacitive behavior resulted from
   improved co-dispersion and mixing of MnO2 and MWCNT. The composite
   MnO2-MWCNT electrodes were used for the fabrication of asymmetric
   supercapacitor devices, which showed good electrochemical performance in
   a voltage window of 1.6 V. The proposed method can be used for other
   applications of nanoparticles of metals and oxides in nanotechnology.

Abstract = {{Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal, causing serious environmental and human
   health problems. Conventional methods for removing cadmium from
   wastewater are expensive and inefficient for low concentrations.
   Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) can simultaneously treat wastewater,
   produce hydrogen gas, and remove heavy metals with low energy
   requirements. Lab-scale MECs were operated to remove cadmium under
   various electric conditions: applied voltages of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and
   1.0V; and a fixed cathode potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Regardless of
   the electric condition, rapid removal of cadmium was demonstrated
   (50-67\% in 24h); however, cadmium concentration in solution increased
   after the electric current dropped with depleted organic substrate under
   applied voltage conditions. For the fixed cathode potential, the
   electric current was maintained even after substrate depletion and thus
   cadmium concentration did not increase. These results can be explained
   by three different removal mechanisms: cathodic reduction; Cd(OH)(2)
   precipitation; and CdCO3 precipitation. When the current decreased with
   depleted substrates, local pH at the cathode was no longer high due to
   slowed hydrogen evolution reaction (2H(+) + 2e(-) -> H-2); thus, the
   precipitated Cd(OH)(2) and CdCO3 started dissolving. To prevent their
   dissolution, sufficient organic substrates should be provided when MECs
   are used for cadmium removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{URBAN WATER JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{A drainage area is often divided into sub-areas for estimating the
   area's time of concentration. If runoff from the sub-areas concentrates
   in parallel to the drainage outlet, the time of concentration of the
   drainage area is usually estimated as the longest time of travel through
   the individual sub-areas. Findings reported here show that this
   conventionally used method of estimating time of concentration for
   parallel drainage areas is inappropriate and may result in
   underestimation of flood quantiles. A more suitable method of estimating
   the time of concentration for areas comprised of parallel sub-areas is
   to use a runoff-weighted average of the times of travel through the
   parallel sub-areas. The runoff weight of each sub-area can be calculated
   as the product of its runoff coefficient and area. This proposed method
   was tested and shown to provide more accurate design flood estimates.
   Also compared in this study are design flood estimates obtained through
   continuous simulation and design storm modelling.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into energy-rich
   products can potentially address some of the critical challenges we face
   today, including energy resource shortages and greenhouse gas emissions.
   Our ab initio calculations show that CO2 molecules can be spontaneously
   activated on the clean nonpolar surfaces of wurtzite metal nitrides, for
   example, Ga(In)N. We have further demonstrated the photoreduction of CO2
   into methanol (CH3OH) with sunlight as the only energy input. A
   conversion rate of CO2 into CH3OH (similar to 0.5 mmol g(cat)(-1) h-(1))
   is achieved under visible light illumination (>400 nm). Moreover, we
   have discovered that the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction can
   be drastically enhanced by incorporating a small amount of Mg dopant.
   The definitive role of Mg dopant in Ga(In)N, at both the atomic and
   device levels, has been identified. This study reveals the potential of
   III-nitride semiconductor nanostructures in solar-powered reduction of
   CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Many mathematical models based on the advanced theory of bending to
   predict bending characteristics for monolithic sheet materials are
   available in the literature. In this work, a similar approach is
   utilized to develop bending models for a bilayer laminated sheet
   material. The principal stresses and strains through the thickness and
   change in relative thickness, at specified bend curvatures, are obtained
   as a function of increasing curvature during bending. Additionally,
   three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) based models for bilayer
   laminate bending are developed to overcome simplifications of the
   analytical models. In order to experimentally validate the two models, a
   new experimental bend test-jig is developed and experiments are
   performed on bilayer steel-aluminum laminate for different clad to
   matrix thickness ratios. These experiments have enabled continuous
   measurements of strain along the width at the bend line and through the
   laminate thickness at one of the specimen edges using an online strain
   mapping system based on digital image correlation (DIC) method.
   Analytical model results indicate how the through-thickness strain
   distribution and relative thickness of the specimen in bending are
   influenced by the location and thickness of the soft clad material. The
   FE model and experimental results exhibit similar trends in the relative
   thickness change for different geometric arrangements of steel-aluminum
   layers. The tangential and radial stresses decrease in magnitude with
   increasing aluminum clad thickness ratios. The 3D FE model of laminate
   bending provided strain predictions across the specimen width at the
   bend line on the tension and compression sides that increased with
   increasing clad thickness ratios. Also, relative thickness data from the
   3D FE model showed uniaxial and plane strain stress states at the edge
   and midwidth sections of the test specimen. The results from analytical
   and FE models and from DIC and microscopic thickness measurements
   indicate that thickness at the bend line increases with increasing clad
   thickness for the case of clad layer on the compressive side of the
   laminate i.e., (C-C case) and vice versa for clad layer on the tensile
   side (C-T).}},

Title = {{A Novel Successive Cancellation Method to Retrieve Sea Wave Components
   from Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Image Sequences}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider retrieving individual wave components in a
   multi-directional sea wave model. To solve this problem, a currently and
   commonly used method is three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3D
   DFT) on the radar image sequence. However, the uniform frequency and the
   uniform wavenumber in a wavenumber frequency domain can not always
   strictly satisfy the dispersion relation, and the spectral leakage in
   both temporal and spatial domains exists due to the limited analysis
   area selected from an image sequence. As a result, the DFT method incurs
   undesirable error performance in retrieving directional wave components.
   By deeply investigating the data structure of the multi-directional sea
   wave model, we obtain a new and decomposable matrix representation for
   processing the wave components. Then, a novel successive cancellation
   method is proposed to efficiently and effectively extract individual
   wave components, whose frequency and wavenumber rigorously satisfy the
   liner dispersion relation. Thus, it avoids spectral leakage in the
   spatial domain. The algorithm is evaluated by using linear synthetic
   wave image sequences. The validity of the proposed novel algorithm is
   verified by comparing the retrieved parameters of amplitude, phase, and
   direction of the individual wave components with the simulated
   parameters as well as those obtained by using the 3D DFT method. In
   addition, the reconstructed sea field using the retrieved wave
   components is also compared with the simulated remote sensing images as
   well as those attained using the inverse 3D DFT method. All the
   simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is more
   effective and has better performance for retrieving individual wave
   components from the spatio-temporal remote sensing image sequences than
   the 3D DFT method.}},

Abstract = {{Five types of industrial lignin are blended with a pure cream and a
   commercial sunscreen lotion. Lignin is found to significantly boost
   their sunscreen performance. Photostability of the lignin-modified
   lotions is analyzed. The results show that hydrophobic lignin has better
   sunscreen performance than hydrophilic counterpart. Sun protection
   factor (SPF) of the pure cream containing 10\% organosolv lignin (OL)
   reaches 8.66. Small amount of hydrophobic lignin dramatically increases
   SPF value of the sunscreen lotions. Adding 1\% lignin almost doubles the
   sun lotion's SPF. Addition of 10\% OL to the lotion boosts its SPF from
   15 to 91.61. However, it is also found that hydrophilic lignin tends to
   demulsify the lotions due to an electrostatic disequilibrium. After 2 h
   of UV radiation, UV absorbance of all the five lignin-modified sunscreen
   lotions increases up to the limit of measuring instrument. All the
   lignin types studied in this work are found to have a general
   synergistic effect with sunscreen actives in the commercial lotion. An
   effort is also made to elucidate radical mechanisms of the synergy.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we report the first oxygen (O-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) dual
   gas-switchable thermoresponsive polymers based on a newly synthesized
   monomer N-(2-fluoroethyl amide)-N-(2-(diethylamino)ethyl) acrylamide,
   that is, AM(F1EA-DEAE), which bears both O-2-switchable fluorinated
   ethyl amide (FLEA) and CO2-switchable N,N-diethylamino ethyl (DEAE)
   moieties on its side chain. PoIyAM(F1EA-DEAE) samples prepared from
   reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
   exhibited good temperature-responsive properties. Their inherent low
   critical solution temperature (LCST) could be reversibly tuned to
   different levels by respectively purging O-2 or CO2 into its aqueous
   solution. The O-2-treatment shifted LCST to a higher temperature, while
   the CO2-treatment made the polymer fully water-soluble. The polymer
   could be readily recovered to its initial state by washing off the
   trigger gas with an inert gas such as nitrogen. This work provides an
   effective monomer design approach for the preparation of O-2 and CO2

Title = {{Comparison of multiple linear regression and artificial neural network
   models for downscaling TRMM precipitation products using MODIS data}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Precipitation plays a significant role to energy exchange and material
   circulation in Earth's surface system. According to numerous studies,
   traditional point measurements based on rain gauge stations are unable
   to reflect the spatial variation of precipitation effectively. On the
   other hand, satellite remote sensing could solve this limitation by
   directly providing spatial distribution of rainfall over large areas.
   During the last years, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
   has provided researchers with a large volume of rainfall data used for
   the validation of atmospheric and climate models. However, due to its
   coarse resolution (0.25 degrees) the improvement of its resolution
   appears as a fundamental task. The main aim of this study is to compare
   two different integrated downscaling-calibration approaches namely
   multiple linear regression analysis and artificial neural networks for
   downscaling TRMM 3B42 precipitation data. The statistical relationship
   among TRMM precipitation data and different environmental parameters
   such as vegetation, albedo, drought index and topography were tested in
   the island of Crete, Greece. Free distributed satellite data of coarse
   resolution such as those of MODIS sensor were incorporated in the
   overall analysis. Multiple linear regression as well as artificial
   neural network models was developed and applied, and extensive
   statistical analysis was performed by downscaling the TRMM products. The
   downscaled precipitation estimates as well as the TRMM products were
   subsequently validated for their accuracy by using an independent
   precipitation dataset from a ground rain gauge network. The downscaling
   procedure succeeded to significant improvements of monthly precipitation
   estimation (100 \% improvement in terms of spatial resolution) in terms
   of spatial analysis with means of satellite remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust H-infinity path following control strategy
   for autonomous ground vehicles with delays and data dropouts. The state
   measurements and signal transmissions usually suffer from inevitable
   delays and data packet dropouts, which may degrade the control
   performance or even deteriorate the system stability. A robust
   H-infinity state-feedback controller is proposed to achieve the path
   following and vehicle lateral control simultaneously. A generalized
   delay representation is formulated to include the delays and data
   dropouts in the measurement and transmission. The uncertainties of the
   tire cornering stiffnesses and the external disturbances are also
   considered to enhance the robustness of the proposed controller. Two
   simulation cases are presented with a high-fidelity and full-car model
   based on the CarSim-Simulink joint platform, and the results verify the
   effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the path-following control problem for

   presence of the time-varying road curvature for the desired path. Path
   following is achieved through vehicle lateral and yaw control, i.e., the
   lateral velocity and yaw rate are simultaneously controlled to track
   their respective desired values, where the desired yaw rate is generated
   according to the path-following demand. CarSim-Simulink joint simulation
   results indicate that the proposed controller can effectively improve
   the transient response performance, inhibit the overshoots, and

Abstract = {{The role of the microstructure on void growth and linkage in magnesium
   has been investigated. 2D model materials have been fabricated using
   pico-second laser technology whereby holes were drilled into the gage
   section of tensile samples composed of thin Mg sheet. These were pulled
   in uniaxial tension inside the chamber of an SEM which allowed for a
   quantitative assessment of the void growth and linkage processes. In
   contrast to the recent studies of void growth and linkage in fcc metals
   (copper and aluminum), the local microstructure plays a significant role
   on the deformation and fracture behavior of magnesium. Void growth was
   observed to occur non-uniformly due to interactions between the holes
   and microstructural features such as grain and twin boundaries. In
   addition, the main fracture mechanisms responsible for void linkage
   include failure associated with these boundaries. Twin and grain
   boundaries introduce microstructural features on a length scale
   comparable to the holes which are not present in models based on
   continuum mechanics. In order to model the deformation and fracture of
   magnesium, the initial microstructure as well as microstructural
   evolution must be taken into account.}},

   solving the constrained Markov decision process (MDP) is prohibitively
   high, although the computational complexity for the no-overhearing case
   can be greatly reduced. Heuristic schemes are then proposed, one applies
   to the general case, and another applies to only the no-overhearing
   case. Numerical results demonstrate that the heuristic schemes can
   achieve close-to-optimum average packet transmission delay, and
   furthermore, the second scheme achieves lower maximum delay while
   keeping the same average packet transmission delay and relay node power
   consumption as the first one. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper presents two methods for online rolling horizon optimal
   control of an energy storage unit in a grid-connected microgrid, subject
   to uncertainty in demand and electricity pricing. The proposed methods
   are based on the concept of rolling horizon control, where battery
   charge/discharge activities are determined by repeatedly solving a
   linear optimization problem over a moving control window. The predicted
   values of the microgrid net electricity demand and electricity prices
   over the control horizon are assumed to be uncertain. The first
   formulation of the control is based on the scenario-based stochastic
   conditional value at risk (CVaR) optimization, where the cost function
   includes electricity usage cost, battery operation costs, and grid
   signal smoothing objectives. Multivariate Gaussian distribution is used
   to model the variations of electricity prices and net demand power
   around their predicted nominal values. The second formulation of the
   control reduces the computations by taking a worst-case CVaR stochastic
   optimization approach. In this case, the uncertainty in demand is still
   stochastic but the problem constraints are made robust with respect to
   price variations in a range. Simulation results under different
   scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Considering that the variation of the modal characteristics for the TM
   mode is significantly larger than that for the TE mode when graphene is
   involved in a silicon-based waveguide, a silicon waveguide TE-pass

   Such a polarizer shows the performance merits including ultrahigh
   extinction ratio, low insertion loss for the TE mode, ultracompact
   footprint, and tunable bandwidth by dynamically varying the chemical
   potential of graphene with gate voltage. We further reveal that the
   operation bandwidth can be significantly enlarged by cascading multiple
   polarizers, each of which consists of a silicon waveguide embedded with
   few-layer graphene and is biased at different gate voltages. We
   numerically demonstrate that using a cascade of seven polarizers, it is
   capable of achieving 20-dB extinction ratio and ultralow insertion loss
   for the TE mode (< 0.13 dB) with bandwidth over 120 nm at

Abstract = {{Multicolor single InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire light emitting diodes (LEDs)
   were fabricated on the same substrate using selective area epitaxy. It
   is observed that the structural and optical properties of InGaN/GaN
   quantum dots depend critically on nanowire diameters. Photoluminescence
   emission of single InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire structures exhibits a
   consistent blueshift with increasing nanowire diameter. This is
   explained by the significantly enhanced indium (In) incorporation for
   nanowires with small diameters, due to the more dominant contribution
   for In incorporation from the lateral diffusion of In adatoms. Single
   InGaN/GaN nanowire LEDs with emission wavelengths across nearly the
   entire visible spectral were demonstrated on a single chip by varying
   the nanowire diameters. Such nanowire LEDs also exhibit superior
   electrical performance, with a turn-on voltage similar to 2 V and
   negligible leakage current under reverse bias. The monolithic
   integration of full-color LEDs on a single chip, coupled with the
   capacity to tune light emission characteristics at the single nanowire
   level, provides an unprecedented approach to realize ultrasmall and
   efficient projection display, smart lighting, and on chip spectrometer.}},

Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Void growth and linkage in magnesium is strongly influenced by the local
   microstructure. An innovative approach is used which allows for a
   quantitative analysis of the microstructural features that play a
   significant role in the deformation and fracture processes. Several hole
   configurations were investigated in order to determine the effects of
   void fraction on the growth and linkage processes. The samples were
   pulled in uniaxial tension under both an optical microscope and SEM. The
   digital image correlation method was used to obtain strain
   distributions. Furthermore, the experimental results were compared to
   crystal plasticity finite element simulations in order to determine the
   role of the various deformation mechanisms on the fracture behavior. It
   was established that the void fraction did not have a significant impact
   on the growth and linkage behavior of the holes. Interactions between
   the holes and the microstructure were observed for all of the
   configurations analyzed. The strain distributions revealed that twin and
   grain boundaries produce strain concentrations an order of magnitude
   larger than the macroscopic strain. Furthermore, the results show that
   there is likely a critical strain required to initiate fracture in these
   boundaries. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Material deformation at room temperature and subsequent thermal aspects
   are analyzed at the micro structural level to understand the uniaxial
   deformation behavior of AZ31 magnesium sheet from pre-straining and
   annealing (PSA) process. The sheet is pre-strained in uniaxial tension
   to various strains by conducting interrupted tests and its uniaxial
   stress-strain responses are obtained. The pre-strained specimens are
   then annealed at different temperatures and times and then reloaded in
   uniaxial tension to obtain their post-anneal stress-strain response up
   to large strains. Pre and post-annealing mechanical responses are
   analyzed and correlated with static recovery, grain recrystallization
   and growth kinetics from annealing. Experimental results are utilized to
   develop and validate a microstructure-based model to capture the room
   temperature mechanical and grain-level responses of AZ31 sheet from the
   PSA process. The model incorporates the effect of recovery on the
   recrystallization kinetics, as well as non-constant nucleation and
   growth behavior in order to predict the grain size at the end of
   recrystallization and within the grain growth stage. In addition, the
   mechanical properties of PSA materials are predicted by considering the
   resulting microstructure as a composite of un-recrystallized,
   recrystallized and coarsened grain regions and by employing the rule of

Abstract = {{Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including
   ABCB, ABCC and ABCG families represent general biological defenses
   against environmental toxicants in varieties of marine and freshwater
   organisms, but their physiological functions at differential
   developmental stages of zebrafish embryos remain undefined. In this
   work, functional expressions of typical ABC transporters including
   P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multiresistance associated protein 1 (Mrp1) and
   Mrp2 were studied in zebrafish embryos at 4, 24, 48 and 72h
   post-fertilization (hpf). As a result, both the gene expressions and
   activities of Pgp and Mrps increased with the development of embryos.
   Correspondingly, 4-72 hpf embryos exhibited an increased tolerance to
   the toxicity caused by cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and beta-naphthoflavone
   (BNF) with time. Such a correlation was assumed caused by the
   involvement of ABC transporters in the detoxification of chemicals. In
   addition, the assumption was supported by the fact that model efflux
   inhibitors of Pgp and Mrps such as reversine 205 and MK571 significantly
   inhibited the efflux of toxicants and increased the toxicity of Cd and
   BNF in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, exposure to CdCl2 and BNF induced
   the gene expressions of Pgp and Mrp1 in 72hpf embryos. Thus, functional
   expressions of Pgp and Mrps increased with the development of zebrafish
   embryos, which could cause an increasing tolerance of zebrafish embryos
   to CdCl2 and BNF. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Effective, f-load, and functional-equivalent discharges are metrics that

   frequency distributions of daily flows combined with a power-function
   approximation of sediment rating curves. For 19 small streams in
   Ontario, Canada, goodness-of-fit test statistics do not clearly show
   that mixed gamma distributions improve the fit with observed daily flow
   frequency distributions; however, the discharge indices determined
   analytically using mixed gamma distributions better match empirical
   estimates of these indices than those computed based upon gamma,
   lognormal, and mixed lognormal distributions. Comparative analysis of
   the three discharge indices also suggests that f-load discharge with a
   reasonable f value provides a more consistent design flow for the

Abstract = {{Both deterministic and probabilistic models have been developed to study
   the hydrologic operation of green roofs. Previously developed
   probabilistic models provide only approximate solutions because of
   simplifying assumptions. Exact analytical solutions are derived here for
   not only those variables that are solved for already but also some
   additional ones of interest. Analysis of the additional variables
   reveals that, depending on local climates, the average moisture level of
   a green roof may either always increase or increase first but reach a
   maximum and then even gradually decrease as the growing medium depth
   increases. Example results of analysis also demonstrate that with
   shallow growing medium depths, water required for irrigation may be
   greater than the runoff that can be reduced by green roofs. Taking
   advantage of the solution's analytical tractability, similar insights
   can be easily obtained for locations of interest and used for the better
   design and operation of green roofs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a bivariate hydrologic risk framework is proposed based
   on a coupled entropy-copula method. In the proposed risk analysis
   framework, bivariate flood frequency would be analyzed for different
   flood variable pairs (i.e., flood peak-volume, flood peak-duration,
   flood volume-duration). The marginal distributions of flood peak,
   volume, and duration are quantified through both parametric (i.e.,
   gamma, general extreme value (GEV), and lognormal distributions) and
   nonparametric (i.e., entropy) approaches. The joint probabilities of
   flood peak-volume, peak-duration, and volume-duration are established
   through copulas. The bivariate hydrologic risk is then derived based on
   the joint return period to reflect the interactive effects of flood
   variables on the final hydrologic risk values. The proposed method is
   applied to the risk analysis for the Xiangxi River in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir area, China. The results indicate the entropy method performs
   best in quantifying the distribution of flood duration. Bivariate
   hydrologic risk would then be generated to characterize the impacts of
   flood volume and duration on the occurrence of a flood. The results
   suggest that the bivariate risk for flood peak-volume would not decrease
   significantly for the flood volume less than 1000 m(3)/s. Moreover, a
   flood in the Xiangxi River may last at least 5 days without significant
   decrease of the bivariate risk for flood peak-duration.}},

Abstract = {{A shrink-fit sample is manufactured with a Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V alloy to

   A set of strain and orientation pole figures are measured at various

   diffraction. Two approaches-the traditional sin(2) Psi method and the
   bi-scale optimization method-are taken to determine the stresses in the
   disk based on the measured strain and orientation pole figures, to
   explore the range of solutions that are possible for the stress field
   within the disk. While the stress components computed using the sin(2)
   Psi method and the bi-scale optimization method have similar trends,
   their magnitudes are significantly different. It is suspected that the
   local texture variation in the material is the cause of this

Abstract = {{This paper examines two artifacts facing researchers who use gradient
   echo (GRE) echo planar imaging (EPI) for time series studies of skeletal
   muscles in limbs. The first is through-plane blood flow during the
   acquisition, causing a vessel motion artifact that inhibits proper
   motion correction of the data. The second is distortion of EPI images
   caused by B-0 field inhomogeneities. Though software tools are available
   for correcting these artifacts in brain EPI images, the tools do not
   perform well on muscle images. The severity of the two artifacts was
   described using image similarity measures, and the data was processed
   with both a conventional motion correction program and custom written
   tools. The conventional program did not perform well on the limb images,
   in fact significantly degrading image quality in some trials. Data is
   presented which proves that arterial pulsatile signal caused the
   impairment in motion correction. The new tools were shown to perform
   much better, achieving substantial motion correction and distortion
   correction of the muscle EPI images. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In situ electrical resistivity monitoring technique was employed to
   continuously evaluate the precipitate evolution of an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-based
   commercial alloy during typical artificial aging treatments. The effects
   of artificial aging on the precipitates stability during non-isothermal
   heat treatments were also explored. Conventional hardness test,
   transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry
   were also adopted to verify the electrical resistivity results. The
   results indicated that both the precipitation process and its timely
   rate could be followed by the monitored electrical resistivity during
   artificial aging treatments. The electrical resistivity results gave
   overall information on continuous precipitation and dissolution
   processes, especially under high heating rates. Samples artificial aging
   heat treated at 120 degrees C for 24 h followed by aging at 150 degrees
   C for 24 h presented more stable state and coarser precipitates than the
   samples only artificial aging heat treated at 120 degrees C for 24 h or
   triple artificial aging heat treated at 120 degrees C/24 h + 195 degrees
   C/15 min + 120 degrees/24 h. While the incoherent eta precipitates in
   the samples artificial aging heat treated at 120 degrees C for 24 h
   followed by aging at 150 degrees C for 24 h were more easiness to
   coarsening and dissolve during non-isothermal heat treatments as well.

   changes: A Canadian case study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{86-101}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, plausible changes in annual and seasonal precipitation
   over Ontario, Canada in response to global warming are investigated
   through a regional climate modeling approach. A high-resolution regional
   climate model ensemble based upon the Providing REgional Climates for
   Impacts Studies (PRECIS) model is developed to help explore the possible
   outcomes of future climate. A Bayesian hierarchical model is then
   employed to quantify the uncertainties involved in the modeling results
   and obtain probabilistic projections of precipitation changes at grid
   point scales. The results show that the projected changes in annual
   precipitation exhibit a certain degree of spatial variability with the
   median changes mostly bounded by 0\% and 20\%, implying that the annual
   precipitation over Ontario is more likely to increase in the context of
   global warming. Specifically, the mean changes in annual precipitation
   for 2030s and 2050s would be 7.5\%, while the annual precipitation for
   2080s is likely to increase by an average of 12.5\%. By contrast, the
   spatial variability of seasonal precipitation changes is more
   significant, especially for the changes in spring precipitation which
   may vary from 40\% in south and 50\% in north. It is reported that there
   would be a continuous increasing trend in winter, spring, and autumn
   precipitation from 2030s to 2080s by 5-30\%, but summer precipitation is
   likely to decrease by 5\% or even higher to the end of this century.
   Furthermore, our results suggest that the larger the biases in
   historical simulations, the more uncertain the future projections will

Abstract = {{The interfacial morphology between the catalyst layer (CL) and micro
   porous layer (MPL) influences the performance of proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Here we report a direct method to
   investigate the CL-MPL interfacial morphology of stacked and compressed
   gas diffusion layer (GDL with MPL)-catalyst coated membrane (CCM)
   assemblies. The area, origin and dimensions of interfacial gaps are
   studied with high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (X-ACT).
   The projected gap area (fraction of the CL-MPL interface separated by
   gaps) is higher for GDL-CCM assemblies with large differences in the
   surface roughness between CL and MPL but reduces with increasing
   compression and similarity in roughness. Relatively large continuous
   gaps are found in proximity to cracks in the MPL. These are hypothesized
   to form due to the presence of large pores on the surface of the GDL.
   Smaller gaps are induced by the surface roughness features throughout
   the CL-MPL interface. By modification of the pore sizes on the GDL
   surface serving as substrate for the MPL, the number and dimension of
   MPL crack induced gaps can be manipulated. Moreover, adjusting the CL
   and MPL surface roughness parameters to achieve similar orders of
   roughness can improve the surface mating characteristics of these two
   components. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using network coding in a wireless network can potentially improve the
   network throughput. On the other hand, it increases the complexity of
   resource allocations as the quality of one transmission is affected by
   the link conditions of the transmitter to multiple receivers. In this
   work, we study time slot scheduling and channel allocations jointly for
   a network with bidirectional relaying links, where the two end nodes of
   each link can exchange data through a relay node. Two scenarios are
   considered when the relay node forwards packets to the end nodes. In the
   first scenario, the relay node always forwards network-coded packets to
   both end nodes simultaneously; in the second scenario, the relay node
   opportunistically uses network coding for two-way relaying and
   traditional one-way relaying. For each scenario, an optimization problem
   is first formulated for maximizing the total network throughput. The
   optimum scheduling is not causal because it requires future information
   of channel conditions. We then propose heuristic scheduling schemes. The
   slot-based scheduling maximizes the total transmission rate of all the
   nodes at each time slot, and the node-based scheduling schedules
   transmissions based on achievable transmission rates of individual nodes
   at different channels. The node-based one has lower complexity than the
   slot-based one. Our results indicate that although the node-based
   scheduling achieves slightly lower throughput than the slot-based one,
   both the proposed scheduling schemes are very effective in the sense
   that the difference between their throughput and the optimum scheduling
   is relatively small in different network settings. Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Surface modifications of titanium are widespread in an effort to improve
   the osseointegration capabilities of the metal for orthopaedic and
   dental applications. Here, electrical discharge machining (EDM) was used
   to create modified, notably, dual-topography surfaces on titanium. By
   swapping conventional copper electrodes for a titanium electrode and
   water dielectric, modified surfaces free of trace element contaminants
   were produced. Three surfaces were produced by varying the peak currents
   at 10 A, 29 A and a uniquely hierarchical multi current combination of
   29 A followed by 2.4 A. The physicochemical properties of these surfaces
   were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive
   X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), and Auger Spectroscopy. These revealed the
   topography of the modified surfaces and a titanium oxide layer that was
   markedly thicker on the EDM samples compared to controls. In vitro cell
   testing was carried out with osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Cell
   differentiation was increased in all EDM modified surfaces compared to
   controls and early differentiation was promoted on the dual-topography
   surface. The present study suggests the promise of dual-topography
   surfaces created using EDM for implant applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dynamic two-phase interaction of soil can be modelled by a
   displacement-based, two-phase formulation. The finite element method
   together with a semi-implicit Euler-Cromer time-stepping scheme renders
   a discrete equation that can be solved by recursion. By experience, it
   is found that the CFL stability condition for undrained wave propagation
   is not sufficient for the considered two-phase formulation to be
   numerically stable at low values of permeability. Because the stability
   analysis of the two-phase formulation is onerous, an analysis is
   performed on a simplified two-phase formulation that is derived by
   assuming an incompressible pore fluid. The deformation of saturated
   porous media is now captured in a single, second-order partial
   differential equation, where the energy dissipation associated with the
   flow of the fluid relative to the soil skeleton is represented by a
   damping term. The paper focuses on the different options to discretize
   the damping term and its effect on the stability criterion. Based on the
   eigenvalue analyses of a single element, it is observed that in addition
   to the CFL stability condition, the influence of the permeability must
   be included. This paper introduces a permeability-dependent stability
   criterion. The findings are illustrated and validated with an example
   for the dynamic response of a sand deposit. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Gallium arsenide nanowires have shown considerable promise for use in
   applications in which the absorption of light is required. When the
   nanowires are oriented vertically, a considerable amount of light can be
   absorbed, leading to significant heating effects. Thus, it is important
   to understand the threshold power densities that vertical GaAs nanowires
   can support, and how the nanowire morphology is altered under these
   conditions. Here, resonant photo-thermal modification of vertical GaAs
   nanowires was studied using both Raman spectroscopy and electron
   microscopy techniques. Resonant waveguiding, and subsequent absorption
   of the excited optical mode reduces the irradiance vertical GaAs
   nanowires can support relative to horizontal ones, by three orders of
   magnitude before the onset of structural changes occur. A power density
   of only 20Wmm(-2) was sufficient to induce local heating in the
   nanowires, resulting in the formation of arsenic species. Upon further
   increasing the power, a hollow nanowire morphology was realized. These
   findings are pertinent to all optical applications and spectroscopic
   measurements involving vertically oriented GaAs nanowires. Understanding
   the optical absorption limitations, and the effects of exceeding these
   limitations will help improve the development of all III-V nanowire
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{We have produced a thermally stable recombinant human type 5 adenoviral
   vector (AdHu5) through spray drying with three excipient formulations
   (L-leucine, lactose/trehalose and mannitol/dextran). Spray drying leads
   to immobilization of the viral vector which is believed to prevent viral
   protein unfolding, aggregation and inactivation. The spray dried powders
   were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential
   scanning calorimetry, Karl Fischer titrations, and X-ray diffraction to
   identify the effects of temperature and atmospheric moisture on the
   immobilizing matrix. Thermal stability of the viral vector was confirmed
   in vitro by infection of A549 lung epithelial cells. Mannitol/dextran
   powders showed the greatest improvement in thermal stability with almost
   no viral activity loss after storage at 20 degrees C for 90 days (0.7
   +/- 0.3 log TCID50) which is a significant improvement over the current
   -80 degrees C storage protocol. Furthermore, viral activity was retained
   over short term exposure (72 h) to temperatures as high as 55 degrees C.
   Conversely, all powders exhibited activity loss when subjected to
   moisture due to amplified molecular motion of the matrix. Overall, a
   straightforward method ideal for the production of thermally stable
   vaccines has been demonstrated through spray drying AdHu5 with a blend
   of mannitol and dextran and storing the powder under low humidity
   conditions. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Low-Complexity Robust MISO Downlink Precoder Design Under Imperfect CSI}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3237-3249}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{We consider the design of the linear precoder for a multiple-input
   single-output (MISO) downlink system with quality-of-service (QoS)
   constraints. The broad goal is to develop low-complexity techniques that
   mitigate the impact of the uncertainty in the transmitter's channel
   state information (CSI) by incorporating probabilistic models for the
   uncertainty into the design. The proposed techniques are developed for
   systems based on limited feedback, and they can be easily adapted to
   systems that acquire CSI using estimation on the uplink and channel
   reciprocity. We consider the conventional problem of minimizing the
   transmitted power under probability of outage constraints for a target
   signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), and the related problem
   of minimizing the outage probability under a transmitted power
   constraint. By approximating the outage constraint by a zero-outage
   region, employing a semidefinite relaxation, and applying an extension
   of the S-Lemma that is derived herein, these problems are converted into
   convex and quasi-convex problems, respectively. Insights into the
   structure of the solution of those problems are then used to generate an
   alternate design formulation that provides greater robustness in the
   presence of significant uncertainties and has a quasi-closed-form
   solution. As illustrated by simulations, the proposed alternate design
   provides significantly better performance than the conventional designs
   that do not incorporate uncertainty models, and better performance than
   existing robust designs in the presence of large uncertainties, and does
   so at a computational cost that is close to that of the conventional
   designs.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) and Si with a 60 nm Si0.95Ge0.05 epilayer cap
   (Si0.95Ge0.05/Si) were implanted with 60 keV, 1 x 10(13) cm(-2) boron
   (B) followed by annealing in nitrogen (N-2) or dry oxygen (O-2) in two
   different anneal conditions. B+ implantation energy and dose were set
   such that the B peak is placed inside Si in Si0.95Ge0.05/Si samples and
   concentration independent B diffusion is achieved upon annealing. For
   samples annealed above 1075 degrees C, Ge diffusing from the
   Si0.95Ge0.05 epilayer cap in Si0.95Ge0.05/Si samples reached the B layer
   inside Si and resulted in retarded B diffusion compared to the Si
   samples. For annealing done at lower temperatures, diffusion of Ge from
   Si0.95Ge0.05 epilayer cap does not reach the B layer inside Si. Thus B
   diffusion profiles in the Si and Si0.95Ge0.05/Si samples appear to be
   similar. B diffusion in dry oxidizing ambient annealing of
   Si0.95Ge0.05/Si samples further depends on the nature of Si0.95Ge0.05
   oxidation which is set by the duration and the thermal budget of the
   oxidizing anneal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{172-183}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Semicontinuous distillation systems are notoriously difficult to design
   and optimize because the structural parameters, operational parameters,
   and control system must all be determined simultaneously. In the past 15
   years of research into semicontinuous systems, studies of the optimal
   design of these systems have all been limited in scope to small subsets
   of the parameters, which yields suboptimal and often unsatisfactory
   results. In this work, for the first time, the problem of integrated
   design and control of semicontinuous distillation processes is studied
   by using a mixed integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problem formulation
   to optimize both the structural and control tuning parameters of the
   system. The public model library (PML) of gPROMS is used to simulate the
   process and the built-in optimization package of gPROMS is used to solve
   the MIDO via the deterministic outer approximation method. The
   optimization results are then compared to the heuristic particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Formation in Machining Hardened Steel}},
Journal = {{LUBRICANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In addition to the bulk properties of a workpiece material,
   characteristics of the tribofilms formed as a result of workpiece
   material mass transfer to the friction surface play a significant role
   in friction control. This is especially true in cutting of hardened
   materials, where it is very difficult to use liquid based lubricants. To
   better understand wear performance and the formation of beneficial
   tribofilms, this study presents an assessment of uncoated mixed alumina
   ceramic tools (Al2O3+ TiC) in the turning of two grades of steel, AISI
   T1 and AISI D2. Both workpiece materials were hardened to 59 HRC then
   machined under identical cutting conditions. Comprehensive
   characterization of the resulting wear patterns and the tribofilms
   formed at the tool/workpiece interface were made using X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy.
   Metallographic studies on the workpiece material were performed before
   the machining process and the surface integrity of the machined part was
   investigated after machining. Tool life was 23\% higher when turning D2
   than T1. This improvement in cutting tool life and wear behaviour was
   attributed to a difference in: (1) tribofilm generation on the friction
   surface and (2) the amount and distribution of carbide phases in the
   workpiece materials. The results show that wear performance depends both
   on properties of the workpiece material and characteristics of the
   tribofilms formed on the friction surface.}},

Abstract = {{Bending of sheet materials is a common forming mode for shaping sheet
   components. Although many numerical models of bending, both analytical
   and numerical simulations based, are available in the literature,
   extensive experimental validations have been rather limited. A new bend
   test method and complementary three-dimensional finite element (FE)
   simulation of the experiments are employed to assess the predictions
   from an advanced analytical and FE model of pure bending of aluminium
   sheet materials. The experimental set-up developed and utilised is an
   open concept design that allows access to the tensile surface and
   through-thickness region in the vicinity of the specimen bend line to
   continuously record images of the deforming specimen with two cameras.
   The specimen images are analysed for strains using an online strain
   mapping system based on digital image correction method. Tangential
   strain distribution results from the models in terms of material
   thinning in the bend region are compared with those from the experiments
   on AA2024 aluminium sheet material by considering the responses from the
   specimen edges and mid-width regions at the bend line. Furthermore, the
   tangential and radial stress distributions on the through-thickness
   section of the specimen from the analytical model are compared with
   those from the FE model. The results from experiments, FE model and
   analytical model are compared and discussed in the light of the
   experimental data and the assumptions involved in the development of the
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The path-following problem for four-wheel independently actuated
   autonomous ground vehicles is investigated in this paper. A novel output
   constraint controller is proposed to deal with the lateral offset
   control in path following and maintain the vehicle lateral stability in
   the presence of tire sliding effects. The innovations of this work lie
   in the following two aspects: 1) A novel output constraint control
   strategy, namely, the hyperbolic projection method, is proposed to
   strictly bound the lateral offset to prevent the vehicle from
   transgressing the safety bound in path following; 2) an adaptive and
   robust linear quadratic regulator controller is adopted to obtain the
   optimal active front-wheel steering and direct yaw-moment control inputs
   with vehicle lateral stability consideration and to eliminate the effect
   of parameter uncertainties. CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results
   indicate that the proposed controller can compactly bound the lateral
   offset to avoid transgressing the safe boundary during path following,
   particularly in extreme driving conditions, in the presence of tire
   sliding effects and system uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a higher fidelity battery equivalent circuit model
   incorporating asymmetric parameter values is presented for use with
   battery state estimation ( BSE) algorithm development; particular focus
   is given to state-of-power ( SOP) or peak power availability reporting.
   A practical optimization-based method is presented for model
   parameterization fitting. Two novel model-based SOP algorithms are
   proposed to improve voltage-limit-based power output accuracy in larger
   time intervals. The first approach considers first-order extrapolation
   of resistor values and open-circuit voltage ( OCV) based on the
   instantaneous equivalent circuit model parameters of the cell. The
   second proposed approach, which is referred to as multistep model
   predictive iterative ( MMPI) method, incorporates the cell model in a
   model predictive fashion. Finally, a SOP verification methodology is
   presented that incorporates drive cycle data to realistically excite the
   battery model. Simulation results compare the proposed SOP algorithms to
   conventional approaches, where it is shown that higher accuracy can be
   achieved for larger time horizons.}},

Abstract = {{The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is an efficient
   algorithm for multitarget tracking in the presence of nonlinearities
   and/or non-Gaussian noise. The sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Gaussian
   mixture (GM) techniques are commonly used to implement the PHD filter.
   Recently, a new implementation of the PHD filter using B-splines with
   the capability to model any arbitrary density functions using only a few
   knots was proposed. The spline PHD (SPHD) filter was found to be more
   robust than the SMC-PHD filter because it does not suffer from
   degeneracy, and it was better than the GM-PHD implementation in terms of
   estimation accuracy, albeit with a higher computational complexity. In
   this paper, we propose a multiple model extension to the SPHD filter to
   track multiple maneuvering targets. Simulation results are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the new filter.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, CO2-breathing induced reversible activation of

   mechanophore MA-SP-MA as cross-linker. The microgels can be swollen by
   CO2-aeration. The swelling of microgels activates the SP mechanophore
   into merocyanine, causing distinguished color and fluorescence change.
   Moreover, these transitions are highly reversible, and the initial
   states of microgels can be easily recovered by ``washing off{''} CO2
   with N-2. The present contribution represents the first example of
   CO2-breathing activation of mechanophore within microgels.}},

Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Lipoproteins {[}high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein
   (LDL), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)] are present in blood in
   relatively high concentrations, and, given their importance in
   cardiovascular disease, the interactions of these species with blood
   contacting biomaterials and their possible role in thrombogenesis is of
   interest. In the present communication, quantitative data on the
   adsorption of apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII (the main protein
   components of HDL), and apolipoprotein B (the main protein component of
   LDL and VLDL), as well as the lipoproteins themselves from plasma to a
   biomedical grade polyurethane (PU) with and without a copolymer additive
   that contains polyethylene oxide (PEO) segments, were investigated.
   Adsorption from some binary solutions was also studied. Significant
   quantities of the apolipoproteins were found to adsorb from plasma to
   the PU, while adsorption to the PEO material was more than 90\% lower,
   demonstrating strong protein resistance of the latter material. In
   contrast, significant quantities of the lipoproteins were found to
   adsorb to the PEO as well as to the PU material. From these and
   previously published results, it is concluded that the protein layer
   formed on the PU surface from plasma (and by extension from blood)
   contains apolipoproteins and lipoproteins in addition to other plasma
   proteins; the layer formed on the PEO surface, however, appears to
   contain minimal quantities of plasma proteins (including free
   apolipoproteins) but significant quantities of lipoproteins. (C) 2016

Journal = {{DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{90-97}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The superior properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are best manifest in
   bulk materials when the CNTs are organized in tandem and embedded in a
   continuous matrix. Decorating the CNTs with magnetic nanopartides (MNPs)
   facilitates their expedient organization with a magnetic field. One of
   the most convenient methods for their decoration is to first treat the
   CNTs with nitric or sulfuric acid, or a mixture of the two, and then
   co-precipitate MNPs in situ. Here, six variations of this protocol are
   compared to identify their influence on the decoration of multi-walled
   CNTs (MWNTs). Acid-treated MWNTs are scrutinized using XPS, and the
   decorated MWNTs are examined using X-ray diffraction, transmission
   electron microscopy, Fourier transformer infrared spectroscopy and
   vibrating sample magnetometry. The results show that (1) treatment with
   nitric acid provides the highest (similar to 100\%) attachment of MNPs
   to the MWNT walls, (2) sulfuric acid best preserves the MWNTs with only
   similar to 8\% weight loss, and (3) after acid-treatment, the MWNTs must
   be washed and filtered prior to co-precipitation to prevent the
   consumption of up to 70\% of the iron through side reactions that yield
   nonmagnetic phases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While free-space optical (FSO) links have many inherent advantages, such
   as high data rates and license-free operation, they are sensitive to
   atmospheric conditions. A promising solution to improve the reliability
   of such communication links is to combine FSO and radio frequency (RF)
   channels using Raptor codes. This paper presents a first in-field
   demonstration of real-time Raptor-coded FSO communication over a 1.87 km
   urban link. This work serves as an important initial step toward
   field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation of
   Raptor-coded hybrid FSO/RF links. The hardware architecture of a Raptor
   10 decoder based on a novel resource-and time-efficient matrix inversion
   algorithm is presented and implemented in an FPGA platform. The receiver
   is implemented in a pipelined architecture to maximize link utilization.
   The throughput of the Raptor-coded FSO link is measured both
   experimentally and numerically under real-life weather conditions for a
   continuous period of 8 h. Experimental results demonstrate that
   Raptor-coded FSO links are capable of tracking changes in the channel

Abstract = {{Polyolefins (POs) are the largest polymer product in the world. The
   innovation in converting commodity olefin monomers to highly value added

   structures. Long-chain branching is one of the most important parameters
   in the aspect of various chain branching structures. A huge amount of
   literatures have been reported to achieve better control of long-chain
   branched structures over the last two decades. Recently, good effort has
   been made in reviewing all the major literatures and summarizing the
   catalytic systems and synthetic strategies for the controlled synthesis

Abstract = {{Long-chain branching plays an important role in the performance of
   polyolefins (POs). The existence of a very small amount of long-chain
   branches (LCBs), i.e., < 1 per 10 000 carbons, can significantly improve
   processability of the polyolefin materials, which is highly desired for
   those intractable polyolefins with narrow molecular weight distribution
   and high degree of crystallinity. Numerous literatures have been
   published on the controlled synthesis of long-chain-branched POs. In the
   previous paper, the major literatures of single catalyst systems have
   been summarized. This paper provides a comprehensive review for the
   binary and multiple catalyst systems and a brief summary of some other
   methods for the controlled synthesis of long-chain-branched POs. The
   controllability of long-chain-branched structures in the various
   preparation procedures with single or two reactor systems, and in one or
   two-step processes, is analyzed and compared in-depth.}},

Title = {{Development of Design Code Oriented Formulas for Elastomeric Bearings
   Including Bulk Compressibility and Reinforcement Extensibility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The introduction of alternative reinforcement types for elastomeric
   bearings has rendered it necessary to consider the extensibility of the
   reinforcement as an additional design parameter. The extensibility of
   the reinforcement reduces the lateral restraint on the elastomer and,
   similar to the compressibility of the elastomer, influences important
   design parameters such as the compression modulus and bending modulus.
   Neglecting the compressibility of the elastomer or the extensibility of
   the reinforcement may result in an unconservative overestimation of
   these design parameters. Existing analytical solutions, which have been
   developed based on the pressure solution, are usually not suitable for
   design purposes. In this study, the analytical solutions for infinite
   strip, circular, square, and annular pad geometries are expanded and
   simplified to form geometry-specific approximations that account for
   reinforcement extensibility and bulk compressibility. The derived
   approximations closely and conservatively follow the analytical
   solutions over a large range of shape factors and values of the
   elastomer bulk modulus and reinforcement extensibility. A similar
   procedure used for the compression modulus and bending modulus is
   applied to approximate the maximum shear strain due to compression,
   including bulk compressibility and reinforcement extensibility.
   Generalized equations are proposed that can be adapted to the
   elastomeric pad geometries considered. (C) 2016 American Society of

Title = {{Modeling Soil Salinity in Greenhouse Cultivations Under a Changing
   Climate With SALTMED: Model Modification and Application in Timpaki,
   Crete}},
Journal = {{SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soil salinity is a major soil degradation threat especially for arid
   coastal environments where it hinders agricultural production, thus
   imposing a desertification risk. In the prospect of a changing climate,
   soil salinity caused by brackish water irrigation introduces additional
   uncertainties regarding the viability of deficit irrigation and
   intensive cultivation practices such as greenhouse cropping. Here, we
   propose a modification of the SALTMED leaching requirement model to
   account for greenhouse cultivation conditions. The model is applied in
   the RECARE Project Case Study of Timpaki, a semiarid region in
   south-central Crete, Greece, where greenhouse horticulture is an
   important land use. Excessive groundwater abstractions toward irrigation
   have resulted in a drop of the groundwater level in the coastal part of
   the aquifer, thus leading to seawater intrusion and in turn to soil
   salinization. Crop yield and soil profile electrical conductivity (EC)
   sensitivity to initial soil EC (up to 2 dS m(-1)) and irrigation water
   EC (up to 3 dS m(-1)) are modeled for the locally popular horticultural
   crops of Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum melongena, and Capsicum annuum.
   Climate model data obtained from nine general circulation models for the
   worst case representative concentration pathway of 8.5 W m(-2) of the
   fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project are corrected
   for bias against historical observations with the Multisegment
   Statistical Bias Correction method and used to estimate crop yield and
   soil profile EC sensitivity in a warmer future. Results show that the
   effects of climate change on S. lycopersicum greenhouse cultivations of
   Timpaki will be detrimental, whereas S. melongena and C. annuum
   cultivations may show greater resilience.}},

Title = {{Climate-Induced Shifts in Global Soil Temperature Regimes}},
Journal = {{SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{264-272}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soil temperature is a key factor of plant growth and biological enzyme
   activities occurring in the soil, affected by the land cover, the
   evapotranspiration rate, the albedo, and the energy budget of the soil
   surface. In recent decades, efforts have been made to conserve soils
   against nonsustainable anthropogenic pressures. Changes in climate can
   impose additional threats on soil sustainability, as global scale soil
   temperature regime alterations are expected under global warming. Here,
   data from three well-established global climate models, spanning from
   1981 to as far as 2120, are used to force the JULES (Joint UK Land
   Environment Simulator) model and produce simulations of soil
   temperature, calculating the water and energy budgets of the land
   surface. Modeled soil temperature data are used to estimate the
   climate-induced changes in the global soil temperature regimes at three
   different global warming levels. The results show significant shifts in
   the soil temperature regime for extended areas of the world, especially
   in the northern hemisphere. Pergelic and Cryic areas are reduced,
   whereas the Mesic and Thermic soils gain large areas in all three
   studied scenarios. Implications of the warming patterns might indicate
   the northward shift of various croplands in regions that until now their
   cultivation was not possible.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an Interacting multiple model (IMM) adaptive estimation
   approach is incorporated to design an optimal adaptive control law for
   stabilizing an Unmanned vehicle. Due to variations of the forward
   velocity of the Unmanned vehicle, its aerodynamic derivatives are
   constantly changing. In order to stabilize the unmanned vehicle and
   achieve the control objectives for in-flight conditions, one seeks for
   an adaptive control strategy that can adjust itself to varying flight
   conditions. In this context, a bank of linear models is used to describe
   the vehicle dynamics in different operating modes. Each operating mode
   represents a particular dynamic with a different forward velocity. These
   models are then used within an IMM filter containing a bank of Kalman
   filters (KF) in a parallel operating mechanism. To regulate and
   stabilize the vehicle, a Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) law is
   designed and implemented for each mode. The IMM structure determines the
   particular mode based on the stored models and in-flight input-output
   measurements. The LQR controller also provides a set of controllers;
   each corresponds to a particular flight mode and minimizes the tracking
   error. Finally, the ultimate control law is obtained as a weighted
   summation of all individual controllers whereas weights are obtained
   using mode probabilities of each operating mode.}},

Abstract = {{Gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agents have been commonly used over the

   These complexes, originally thought to be stable and clear from the body

   method for measuring Gd in bone is necessary for further exploring Gd
   retention in the body following the administration of a contrast agent.

   measure Gd in human tibias was investigated. Bone phantoms mimicking
   human tibia were created with Gd concentrations ranging from 0 to 120
   ppm. The minimum detection limit (MDL) was calculated from 20-hour and
   7-hour phantom measurements with a source activity of 0.11 GBq. All MDL
   values were scaled to a more realistic measurement time of 30 minutes
   with a stronger source. Scaling arguments were based on activity ratio,
   measurement time, and system dead time. The MDL for a 1 GBq source was
   estimated to be 3.60-3.64 ppm, for an average range of tissue
   thicknesses overlaying a human tibia. For a stronger source of 5 GBq and
   a four detector cloverleaf system, the MDL was estimated to be 1.49-1.52
   ppm. Determined and predicted MDLs are within the range of previous
   in-vitro Gd measurement data. The K-XRF system shows promising results
   for detecting Gd in bone and should be seriously considered for in-vivo
   measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation is critical for exposing subtle design errors
   that have escaped to the silicon prototypes. Its effectiveness is
   conditioned by in-system application of a large volume of
   functionally-compliant stimuli. In this paper, we present a methodology
   to design constrained-random stimuli generators, which are placed
   on-chip and are configurable at design-time to generate in-system
   functionally-compliant stimuli subject to user-programmable constraints
   provided at validation time. Central to our method is a cube-based
   representation of constraints. These cubes are used as masks that force
   pseudo-random sequences to map onto functionally-compliant stimuli. To
   reduce the on-chip storage requirements, masks are compressed at
   design-time and expanded on-the-fly at validation time using
   decompression circuitry. Experimental results evaluate the impact of our
   method on the requirements for on-chip logic and memory resources.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element models apply material properties using experimentally
   derived density-modulus equations and computed tomographic image data,
   yet numerous different equations exist in the literature. The purpose of
   this study was to experimentally evaluate the distribution of mechanical
   properties through the proximal tibia and compare with those predicted
   using existing density-modulus equations. Indentation testing was
   performed on five cadaveric tibiae, with four slices removed from the
   proximal epiphysis and metaphysis of each. Elastic modulus and yield
   strength were identified for each test and grouped into nine transverse
   regions. These regions were identified on computed tomographic scans,
   and four density-modulus equations from the literature applied. Errors
   between measured and predicted modulus were then calculated. Elastic
   modulus and yield strength varied regionally, with the bone located
   closest to the joint and in the condyles being strongest and the
   intercondylar region the weakest. The optimal relationship for
   predicting modulus varied depending on anatomical region, but generally
   was best predicted by the Goulet equation. The regions of high strength
   identified in this study (condyles and proximal regions) can serve as
   improved sites of attachment for orthopedic devices and should be
   preserved during surgery, if possible. The substantial regional
   variations observed herein (almost a threefold change in modulus across
   different regions) should be incorporated into finite element models and
   applied using the Goulet density-modulus equation.}},

Title = {{Spontaneously occurring occurring fundus findings observed using
   confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy in wild type Sprague Dawley rats}},
Journal = {{REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{160-166}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Non-invasive in vivo imaging is an increasingly used component
   of pre-clinical research. However, to reliably interpret data, it may be
   necessary to identify and document pre-existent findings prior to
   initiating long-term or intensive protocols, particularly where toxicity
   or efficacy is under investigation. Here we report here spontaneously
   occurring findings from the Sprague Dawley (SD) rat eye using
   multi-modal confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO).
   Methods: As part of ongoing studies, with the goal of excluding animals
   with abnormalities from further investigation, a total of 165 wild type
   SD rats (312 eyes) were assessed using cSLO imaging at baseline prior to
   initiating experiments to detect, describe, and determine the prevalence
   of spontaneous fundus findings.
   Results: Using fundus autofluorescence (FAF) as the primary screening
   modality, over 30\% of analyzed eyes possessed some fundus finding that
   differed from the normal composite reference image. Unexpectedly, 100\%
   of eyes demonstrated a diffuse hyperfluorescent region in the posterior
   pole that was ultimately considered normal, and formed part of the
   reference. Evaluated by three independent reviewers, five groups of FAF
   abnormalities were defined, based primarily on shape and size of the
   lesion. Of these, the most extensive lesions were further analyzed using
   infrared reflectance (IR) and red free (RF) imaging. White light and
   autofluorescent microscopy of excised tissue confirmed that the
   extensive lesions were derived from abnormalities in both the isolated
   retina and posterior eyecups.
   Conclusions: Given the newly described hyperfluorescent glow that
   appears in all eyes, and the high basal rate of spontaneous lesions in
   the outbred SD rat, we suggest that investigators be aware of the
   variants of normal, and that baseline in vivo screening be considered
   prior to initiating intensive or expensive investigation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Decreased muscle mass and increased fat mass are commonly seen in the
   thighs of individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Despite the role of
   calf muscles in activities of daily living and knee mechanics, little
   work has investigated calf changes in knee OA. Unlike the thigh, muscle
   and fat in the lower leg can be imaged using a peripheral magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. We aimed to assess agreement between
   subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat (IMF), intramuscular fat (intraMF),
   and lean muscle volumes acquired using a peripheral 1.0T as compared to
   a reference whole-body 3.0T MRI scanner. A calf MRI scan from each
   scanner was acquired from twenty women > 55 years with knee OA. The
   different tissues were segmented on each of ten axial slices for every
   participant using SliceOmatic 5.0 (Tomovision, Magog, QC). Tissue
   volumes were determined for each outcome. Agreement between tissue
   volumes from the two scanners was assessed using intraclass correlation
   (ICC(2,1)) coefficients, standard error, and Bland-Altman plots.
   Agreement between tissue volumes was strong to very strong, with ICCs
   ranging from 0.842 to 0.991 for all outcomes. However, wide confidence
   intervals for IMF and intraMF suggest there is less confidence in
   agreement with segmentation of images from the 1.0T scanner generally
   underestimating fat volume relative to the 3.0T scanner. The 3.0T's
   superior between-tissue contrast likely resulted in more accurate
   segmentation of IMF and intraMF compared to the 1.0T scanner.
   Comparisons of tissue volume between studies using different
   scanners/sequences should be interpreted cautiously.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical response of rare earth containing Mg alloy, WE43, plates
   is found to be more isotropic, as compared to conventional alloys like
   AZ31, despite a moderately strong texture. In order to understand the
   grain-level deformation mechanisms which are responsible, the
   elastoplastic self-consistent (EPSC) polycrystal plasticity code,
   including the recently developed twinning-detwinning (TDT) model, is
   used to describe the homogeneous plastic flow of WE43-T5, plate at
   quasistatic and dynamic strain rates. Latent hardening of the slip modes
   is based on a recent discrete dislocation dynamics study in order to
   reduce the number of empirical fitting parameters without sacrificing
   model fidelity. The approach accounts for the presence of the initial
   texture and its evolution during deformation. The observed flow stress,
   strain, and strain hardening anisotropies and asymmetries are
   well-described. A single set of parameters was used to fit the entire
   set of results, at a given strain rate, thus enabling determination of
   strain rate sensitivities of individual deformation modes. Basal slip
   and extension twinning are rate insensitive, within the strain rate
   regime examined, whereas the prismatic and < c+a > slip exhibit strain
   rate sensitivities of 0.008 and 0.005, respectively. Various
   strengthening mechanisms such as precipitation, grain refinement and
   solid solution hardening effects on each individual deformation modes
   are assessed. The softer modes, basal slip and extension twinning, are
   greatly strengthened in this alloy, as compared to the harder modes such
   as prismatic and < c+a > slip, which renders this material more
   isotropic, even at the grain-level, as compared to conventional Mg
   alloys. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   acoustic trapped modes in axisymmetric cavities. These trapped modes in
   axisymmetric cavities tend to spin because they do not have preferred
   orientation. The present paper investigates rectangular cross-sectional
   cavities as this cavity geometry introduces an orientation preference to
   the excited acoustic mode. Three cavities are investigated, one of which
   is square while the other two are rectangular. In each case, numerical
   simulations are performed to characterize the acoustic mode shapes and
   the associated acoustic particle velocity fields. The test results show
   the existence of stationary modes, being excited either consecutively or
   simultaneously, and a particular spinning mode for the cavity with
   square cross section. The computed acoustic pressure and particle
   velocity fields of the excited modes suggest complex oscillation
   patterns of the cavity shear layer because it is excited, at the
   upstream corner, by periodic distributions of the particle velocity
   along the shear layer circumference.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental facility was designed and built to study the loading on
   steam generator tubes during a blowdown. The facility used refrigerant
   R-134a and measurements were taken for static and dynamic pressures as
   well as tube loading and temperatures. Commissioning experiments
   indicated that the off-the-shelf dynamic pressure transducers and load
   cells could not take the mechanical and thermal shock loading caused by
   the blowdown and produced spurious results of no value. This paper
   presents the instrumentation problems found, explains why they occurred,
   describes the remedial procedures employed, and outlines the
   instrumentation validation methodologies developed. The success of the
   instrumentation development is demonstrated in a series of experiments
   designed to assess the rapid transient measurement system.}},

Title = {{The Effectiveness of Simulator Motion in the Transfer of Performance on

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the importance of platform motion to the transfer
   of performance in motion simulators.
   Background: The importance of platform motion in simulators for pilot
   training is strongly debated. We hypothesized that the type of motion
   (e.g., disturbance) contributes significantly to performance
   differences.
   Methods: Participants used a joystick to perform a target tracking task
   in a pod on top of a MOOG Stewart motion platform. Five conditions
   compared training without motion, with correlated motion, with
   disturbance motion, with disturbance motion isolated to the visual
   display, and with both correlated and disturbance motion. The test
   condition involved the full motion model with both correlated and
   disturbance motion. We analyzed speed and accuracy across training and
   test as well as strategic differences in joystick control.
   Results: Training with disturbance cues produced critical behavioral
   differences compared to training without disturbance; motion itself was
   less important.
   Conclusion: Incorporation of disturbance cues is a potentially important
   source of variance between studies that do or do not show a benefit of
   motion platforms in the transfer of performance in simulators.
   Application: Potential applications of this research include the
   assessment of the importance of motion platforms in flight simulators,
   with a focus on the efficacy of incorporating disturbance cues during
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Typical feature selection methods choose an optimal global feature
   subset that is applied over all regions of the sample space. In
   contrast, in this paper we propose a novel localized feature selection
   (LFS) approach whereby each region of the sample space is associated
   with its own distinct optimized feature set, which may vary both in
   membership and size across the sample space. This allows the feature set
   to optimally adapt to local variations in the sample space. An
   associated method for measuring the similarities of a query datum to
   each of the respective classes is also proposed. The proposed method
   makes no assumptions about the underlying structure of the samples;
   hence the method is insensitive to the distribution of the data over the
   sample space. The method is efficiently formulated as a linear
   programming optimization problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the method
   is robust against the over-fitting problem. Experimental results on
   eleven synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the viability of
   the formulation and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In
   addition we show several examples where localized feature selection
   produces better results than a global feature selection method.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{We consider the problem of power allocation for the single-cell
   multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink with
   quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The base station acquires an
   estimate of the channels and, for a given beam-forming structure,
   designs the power allocation so as to minimize the total transmission
   power required to ensure that target signal-to-interference-and-noise
   ratios at the receivers are met, subject to a specified outage
   probability. We consider scenarios in which the errors in the base
   station's channel estimates can be modelled as being zero-mean and
   Gaussian. Such a model is particularly suitable for time division duplex
   (TDD) systems with quasi-static channels, in which the base station
   estimates the channel during the uplink phase. Under that model, we
   employ a precise deterministic characterization of the outage
   probability to transform the chance-constrained formulation to a
   deterministic one. Although that deterministic formulation is not
   convex, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm that can be shown to
   converge to a globally optimal solution when the starting point is
   feasible. Insight into the structure of the deterministic formulation
   yields approximations that result in coordinate update algorithms with
   good performance and significantly lower computational cost. The
   proposed algorithms provide better performance than existing robust
   power loading algorithms that are based on tractable conservative
   approximations and can even provide better performance than robust
   precoding algorithms based on such approximations.}},

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of rubber layers under pure compression has been
   investigated to considerable extent in the literature. The most widely
   used approach is the so-called pressure solution, which is based on
   several assumptions, most notably that the stress state is dominated by
   the hydrostatic pressure. Other approaches have also been considered,
   but for nearly incompressible material and thin layers their predictions
   are very similar to those of the pressure solution. Nearly all past
   studies on the subject have focused on rubber layers that are bonded to
   either rigid or flexible supports (or reinforcement). Unreinforced
   (i.e., single layer) rubber pads are often installed as unbonded, i.e.,
   without steel end plates connecting them to their top and bottom
   supports. In an unbonded application, rubber pads rely solely on
   friction to develop shear resistance along the contact interfaces. This
   shear resistance is necessary to provide the pad with an adequately
   large vertical stiffness. The effect of the frictional restraint along
   the top and bottom contact surfaces and the influence of partial slip
   have received very little attention in the literature. In this paper, we
   present a theoretical analysis for the behavior of an unbonded rubber
   layer, including the effects of the elastomer's bulk compressibility and
   the contact slip at the supports. Results of a finite element analysis
   are also presented and shown to be in good agreement with the results of
   the theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   dissolution to water at 40 degrees C was used, with a Schmidt number of
   660. The topography of the unworn and worn inner surface was quantified
   using nondestructive X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. The local
   mass transfer rate was obtained from the local change in radius over the
   flow time. Two regions of high mass transfer were present: (i) along the
   intrados of the first bend near the inlet and (ii) at the exit of the
   extrados of the first bend that extends to the intrados of the second
   bend. The latter was the region of highest mass transfer, and the
   scaling of the maximum Sherwood number with Reynolds number followed
   that developed for lower Reynolds numbers. The relative roughness
   distribution in the bend corresponded to the mass transfer distribution,
   with higher roughness in the higher mass transfer regions. The spacing
   of the roughness elements in the upstream pipe and in the two regions of
   high mass transfer was approximately the same; however, the
   spacing-to-height ratio was very different with values of 20, 10, and 6,
   respectively.}},

Title = {{Variation of the vertical stiffness of strip-shaped fiber-reinforced
   elastomeric isolators under lateral loading}},

Abstract = {{A fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolator (FREI) is a relatively new type
   of isolator that utilizes fiber material for the reinforcing layers.
   FREIs can be installed in a bonded or unbonded application. In this
   study, finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out on bonded and
   unbonded strip-shaped FREIs to investigate the variation in vertical
   stiffness as the isolator undergoes lateral displacement. The vertical
   stiffness of the isolators under pure compression obtained by FEA was in
   good agreement with the predictions of two available closed-form
   solutions. As the lateral displacement increases, it was observed that
   for bonded FREIs the vertical stiffness decreases monotonically;
   whereas, for unbonded FREIs, the vertical stiffness decreased up to
   175\% shear deformation, where an increase in vertical stiffness was
   observed. FEA results confirmed that the effective overlap area method
   provides reasonable estimates for the vertical stiffness of bonded
   FREIs. It is observed that as the applied vertical stress increases, the
   vertical stiffness of bonded and unbonded FREIs increases. Finally, the
   paper shows that under large lateral displacements, bonded FREIs develop
   large tensile stresses in the regions outside the overlapping areas,
   while the tensile stresses that develop in unbonded FREIs are very low
   and confined in a small region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In aerated treatment wetlands, oxygen availability is not a limiting
   factor in sustaining a high level of nitrification in wastewater
   treatment. In the case of an air blower failure, nitrification would
   cease, potentially causing adverse effects to the nitrifying bacteria. A
   field trial was completed investigating nitrification loss when aeration
   is switched off, and the system recovery rate after the aeration is
   switched back on. Loss of dissolved oxygen was observed to be more rapid
   than loss of nitrification. Nitrate was observed in the effluent long
   after the aeration was switched off (48 h+). A complementary modeling
   study predicted nitrate diffusion out of biofilm over a 48 h period.
   After two weeks of no aeration in the established system, nitrification
   recovered within two days, whereas nitrification establishment in a new
   system was previously observed to require 20-45 days. These results
   suggest that once established resident nitrifying microbial communities
   are quite robust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A nano- multilayer TiAlCrSiYN/TiAlCrN was deposited by Physical Vapor
   Deposition (PVD) on cemented carbide turning inserts. Assessment of the
   performance of the coated inserts in machining of DA718 Inconel was made
   at various cutting speeds during the initial, running-in stage of wear.
   Three types of machining conditions were used: i. Regular cutting speed
   (40 m/min) used in industrial practice; ii. Higher cutting speed of 60
   m/min, and iii. Accelerated (higher speed followed by regular cutting
   speed). Comprehensive characterization of the tribofilms formed on the
   surface of the worn cutting tools was made using Auger Electron
   Spectroscopy and Xray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analyses. SEM/EDS
   elemental mapping was used for evaluation of the wear patterns. It was
   shown that an initial short-term increase in the cutting speed during
   the running-in stage (condition iii) noticeably improves tool life. This
   is because during initial cutting at high speed, enhanced formation of
   protective/lubricious tribo-ceramic films on the friction surface takes
   place, with the subsequent slowdown in speed preventing total wearing
   out of the beneficial tribofilms. In this way, the tribofilm formation
   process can be enhanced at the start of the process and the benefits of
   these films can be realized over the life of the tool. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   freeze-casting-based fabrication of structurally and mechanically

   fibrillar, columnar, or lamellar morphologies can be produced.
   Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments show that the anisotropy of the
   structure originates from the alignment of the mesostructures, rather
   than the CNC building blocks. The composite hydrogels show high
   structural and mechanical integrity and a strong variation in Young's
   moduli in orthogonal directions. The controllable morphology and

Abstract = {{Solid particles coated by cross-linked polymer layers find applications
   in many areas, including hydraulic fracturing operations. In this study,
   a hot-melt resin coating process for solid particles is developed and
   optimized for hydraulic fracturing applications. Phenolic resin is used
   to coat the particles above its melting point and is subsequently cured
   in situ by hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). The coating quality is then
   characterized by the surface morphology, acid solubility, and crush
   resistance of the resin-coated particles. The effects of various
   operating parameters on the coating performance are systematically
   studied. Among them, temperature is shown to play an especially
   important role. The coating process involves intricate coupling between
   resin rheology, HMTA mass transfer, and curing kinetics, all of which
   are profoundly influenced by temperature. Different constant temperature
   levels as well as controlled temperature ramps are investigated, and the
   results show a complex dependence. Higher temperature leads to stronger
   coating layers with better barrier properties, whereas lower temperature
   is preferable for better surface morphology. These two trends can be
   partially reconciled with ramping temperature profiles; the improvement
   is, however, eventually limited by the rate of heat transfer. This study
   not only provides insight into the physical and chemical processes
   underlying the resin coating operation, it also demonstrates a
   generalizable strategy suitable for various particle coating processes.}},

Abstract = {{Anion substitution with bismuth (Bi) in III-V semiconductors is an
   effective method for experimental engineering of the band gap E-g at low
   Bi concentrations (<= 2\%), in particular in gallium arsenide (GaAs).
   The inverse Bi-concentration dependence of E-g has been found to be
   linear at low concentrations x and dominated by a valence band defect
   level anticrossing between As and Bi occupied p levels. Predictive
   models for the valence band hybridization require a first-principle
   understanding which can be obtained by density functional theory with
   the main challenges being the proper description of E-g and the
   spin-orbit coupling. By using an efficient method to include these
   effects, it is shown here that at high concentrations E-g is modified
   mainly by a Bi-Bi p orbital interaction and by the large Bi atom-induced
   strain. In particular, we find that at high concentrations, the Bi-Bi
   interactions depend strongly on model periodic cluster configurations,
   which are not captured by tight-binding models. Averaging over various
   configurations supports the defect level broadening picture. This points
   to the role of different atomic configurations obtained by varying the
   experimental growth conditions in engineering arsenide band gaps, in
   particular for telecommunication laser technology.}},

Title = {{Lab-scale demonstration of recuperative thickening technology for

   processes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the use of high performance anaerobic
   digestion (AD) processes for the production of biogas at wastewater
   treatment facilities to offset the energy demands associated with
   wastewater treatment. Recuperative thickening (RT) is a promising
   technique which involves recycling a portion of the digested solids back
   to the incoming feed. In general there exists a significant number of
   knowledge gaps in the field of RT because the studies that have been
   conducted to date have almost exclusively occurred in pilot plant or
   full scale trials; this approach greatly limits the amount of process
   optimization that can be done in a given trial. In this work, a detailed
   and comprehensive study of RT was conducted at the lab scale; two custom
   designed digesters (capacity = 1.5 L) were operated in parallel with one
   acting as a `control' digester and the other operating under a
   semi-batch RT mode. There was no significant change in biogas methane
   composition for the two digesters, however the RT digester had an
   average biogas productivity over two times higher than the control one.
   It was found that the recycling of the polymer flocculant back into the
   RT digester resulted in a significant improvement in dewatering
   performance. At the highest polymer concentration tested, the capillary
   suction time (CST) values for flocculated samples for the RT digester
   were over 6 times lower than the corresponding values for the control
   digester. Thus, there exists an opportunity to decrease the overall
   consumption of polymer flocculants through judicious selection of the
   dose of polymer flocculant that is used both for the thickening and
   end-stage dewatering steps in RT processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Sustainability and resiliency metrics for buildings - Critical review}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The driving forces for change in the construction and building industry
   are several, not least of which are health and environmental awareness
   combined with the innate urge to improve living conditions and standards
   under economic constraints. Based on in-depth observation of the current
   practices, improved practices, market conditions, and driving forces, it
   is postulated that the next logical advancement in building construction
   technology is manufactured-modular-prefabricated-off-site construction,
   referred to as off-site construction (OSC). Accordingly, current metrics
   for sustainability and resiliency for buildings are reviewed for
   determining their state of development and application. The review
   revealed that a variety of metrics exist to prove any sustainability
   claims, or portion thereof. Of all the metrics, life cycle assessment
   (LCA) is currently the state-of-the-art in quantifying parts of
   sustainability, namely the environmental impacts, however it faces
   significant challenges. Certification systems, such as LEED, BREEAM and
   DGNB are found to be useful and successful at meeting their purpose,
   however they fail to address all of sustainability's requirements.
   Moreover, these certification systems have yet to produce metrics that
   are repeatable, reproducible and true reflection of the building
   performance. Sustainability metrics for industrial processes and other
   industries were reviewed and found to be more developed in comparison to
   those used for buildings including methods such as the Canberra and
   Mahalanobis distance been employed to aggregate the various
   sustainability factors. The review also revealed that there are no
   metrics for assessing the resiliency for buildings, particularly
   in-tandem with sustainability. Of relevance to OSC. systems is the
   certification systems' inability to adequately account for innovative
   and new construction techniques and material. Although OSC systems have
   shown potential for being a sustainable construction system for
   residential, commercial and industrial buildings, the review revealed
   that the potential is missed in the absence of a true sustainability and
   resiliency metrics for building systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In plane tension of magnesium alloy sheets is accommodated by prismatic
   and basal slip, whereas \{10-12\} twinning is activated when grains are
   elongated along the < c > axis. The plastic behavior of Mg-3Al-1Zn in
   tension has been investigated using a thick rolled plate with a strong
   basal texture. Tensile tests were performed along five directions
   distributed between the normal direction and the transverse direction,
   allowing various amount of \{10-12\} twinning, basal, and prismatic slip
   to take place. The twinning behavior has been investigated using EBSD
   measurement and EVPSC modeling, and Schmid factor analysis was
   performed. The observed amount of variants with a Schmid factor of high
   rank is higher than predicted, emphasizing the necessity of strain
   accommodation between grains and twins. Compared with compression, even
   when twinning activity is low, more \{10-12\} twin variants are
   predicted in tension. This study confirms extension twinning as a major
   deformation mechanism in all tensile directions and an efficient way to
   harden Mg alloys by twin-twin boundaries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{127-136}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{For the purpose of residual PEG removal after protein purification and
   PEGylation, electro-ultrafiltration (EUF) was used for separation of
   human serum albumin (HSA) from polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different
   molecular weights. The results clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of
   EUF for achieving the desired objectives. Higher flux and lower HSA
   transmission were observed in EUF process with the feed consisting of a
   mixture of 1 g/L PEG and 1 g/L HSA, compared to conventional
   ultrafiltration (UF) process, while the PEG transmission was nearly the
   same. When the concentration of PEG increased from 1 g/L to 10 g/L while
   keeping the HSA concentration the same, more HSA passed through the
   membrane in the UF process due to reduction in protein diffusion and
   hydration by PEG. When the HSA concentration increased from 1 g/L to 10
   g/L with the PEG concentration being 1 g/L, the PEG transmission
   decreased significantly. The application of electric field resulted in
   high flux and PEG transmission and low protein transmission through the
   membrane. The effect of electrolyte (i.e., ionic strength and type) on
   the efficiency of the EUF process was also investigated. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The relationship of lightning activity and rainfall is investigated for
   rain events of variable intensity. Rain data from 22 gauging stations
   over the island of Crete and lightning activity from the Global
   Lightning Network including both cloud-to-ground and some cloud flashes
   are analyzed for the period September 2012 to June 2014. Local
   thunderstorms' characteristics are investigated both individually as
   well as in groups according to the results of k-means clustering
   algorithm in 3 dimensions (space (x, y) and time (t)) in which the
   number of clusters is decided by G-means algorithm. Correlation of
   non-zero pairs of rain intensity and number of flashes is examined at
   various time intervals, time lags and effective radii. Also, correlation
   of flash count within 50 km radius around the stations is examined for
   the rain events of maximum hourly intensity for each gauging station.
   The highest coincidence of lightning clusters with intense rain events
   reaches 60\% when gauges are 25-30 km from the cluster center. Maximum
   correlation within non-zero pairs of rain intensity and flashes number
   is obtained for more intense rain (99th percentile) and for increased
   flash count within the searching area (more than 10 flashes). Also,
   correlation is stronger for shorter time windows. The findings of this
   study improve the understanding of thunderstorm events and could provide
   staple information for the improvement of forecasting extreme events.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{A novel solvent-free tribo-electrostatic separation technique for the
   fractionation of legume flour has been explored with the aim of
   producing protein- and carbohydrate-enriched fractions from navy bean
   (Phaseolus vulgaris) flour as a model system. The process consisted of a
   fluidized bed flour reservoir, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
   tribo-charging tube, and a plate-type separation chamber. The
   optimization of the single-stage tribo-electrostatic separation of navy
   bean flour was successfully carried out by designing a mixed level full
   factorial (4(1) x 2(3)) experiment, followed by analyzing the data with
   a multiple linear regression model. The influence of process parameters
   on the protein content and protein separation efficiency of the
   resulting protein-enriched fractions was evaluated. Air flow rate, plate
   voltage, and tribo-charger tube length were found to have a significant
   impact on the protein content and separation efficiency. Although plate
   angle had no significant impact on the protein content, interactions
   with air flow rate, plate voltage and tribo-charger tube length were
   found to have a significant influence on the protein separation
   efficiency. The optimal values of air flow rate, tribo-charger length,
   plate voltage and plate angle were found to be 7 LPM, 240 cm, -6.5 kV
   and 20 degrees, respectively. The protein-enriched fraction produced at
   the optimum conditions had a protein content of 38.1\% accounting for
   50.4\% of the total protein. Good agreement was observed between the
   experimental and predicted values. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Polarization-resolved magneto-photoluminescence is studied in InGaAs/InP
   single quantum wells. In the range of the filling factor nu >= 4 the
   number of populated Landau levels contributing to the photoluminescence
   is found to be equal to the corresponding filling factor, while at nu <=
   3 the number of emitting Landau levels is larger than the filling
   factor, which implies an occupancy of the Landau levels above the Fermi
   level. Such partial occupancy of the Landau levels with energies higher
   than the Fermi energy is due to shake-up processes caused by
   electron-electron interaction. In accordance to the theory, at the
   filling factor around nu = 2 the shake-up process was found to manifest
   itself in the downshifted cusp of the energy of the sigma(-) polarized
   emission from the excited Landau levels, while no change was observed in
   the energy of the sigma(+) polarized emission. The different energies of
   differently spin-polarized excited Landau levels cause the magnetic
   field induced polarization of the emission from excited Landau levels.
   In addition, the bound electron-hole excitonic complexes (trions)
   associated with different Landau levels were observed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a rapid and controllable method to create microscale
   heterogeneities in the 3D stiffness of a soft material by printing
   patterns with a ferrofluid ink. An ink droplet moved through a liquid
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) volume using an externally applied magnetic
   field sheds clusters of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in its wake. By
   varying the field spatiotemporally, a well-defined three-dimensional
   curvilinear feature is printed that contains MNP clusters. Subsequent
   cross-linking of the PDMS preserves the feature in place after the
   magnetic field is removed. Since the ferrofluid ink interferes with the
   cross-linking of PDMS, a 3D print containing ink density variations
   leads to corresponding spatial deviations in the elastic modulus of the
   matrix. The modulus is mapped in the experiments with atomic force
   microscopy. This rapid method to print 3D heterogeneities in soft matter
   promises the ability to mimic mechanical variations that occur in
   natural biomaterials.}},

Title = {{Factors Affecting Grafting Density in Surface-Initiated ATRP: A

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{In surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, knowledge of
   grafting density is of significant interest because it is one of the
   determining properties of grafted polymer. It is well known that not all
   of the immobilized initiators can grow into polymer chains. However,
   little is known about why this happens and what affects the grafting
   efficiency. The lack of information is partly due to the difficulty in
   experimental determination of grafting density on flat substrates. To
   circumvent the problem, Monte Carlo simulation with bond fluctuation
   model is used in this study to investigate the effects of various
   reaction conditions on the grafting density. The simulation results show
   lower grafting density when less deactivator is present. In systems with
   lower deactivator concentration, the number of monomer added per
   activation cycle is higher. Coupling this with close proximity of
   immobilized initiators results in chains initiated at earlier time to
   shield their neighboring initiator moieties from adding monomers, thus
   lowering the grafting density in such a system. These simulation results
   also provide an explanation to the seemingly conflicting trend reported
   in the literatures.}},

Title = {{A concept of integrated environmental approach, Part 2: Integrated

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this series, we discussed that the building
   structure, energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and moisture
   management all need to be considered simultaneously to ensure durability
   of materials and control cost of near-zero energy buildings. These
   factors must be addressed through contributions of the whole design
   team. It is also evident that building physics must take an active role
   in development of nearzero energy buildings. The need to ensure good
   indoor environment and durability of materials and limit the cost of
   buildings led to integrated design process that now is typical in Canada
   for design of low-energy buildings. Furthermore, interactions between
   energy efficiency, quality of indoor environment and moisture management
   led us to introduce a concept of ``environmental control.'' In the
   meantime, we made an unexpected observation-Vancouver dwellings in 2002
   use the same amount of energy as 1920 uninsulated masonry buildings
   erected in the same location. We concluded that despite having advanced
   technology, our lack of vision prevents us from an effective use of this
   technology. With the quest for sustainable buildings, we should learn
   more from termites, who appear to master the art of hygrothermal control
   better than humans as they are capable of maintaining highly stable
   interior comfort zone without heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
   equipment. Nevertheless, whatever progress is achieved in new low-energy
   buildings, it is lost when rehabilitating existing buildings because
   there an owner will typically do one step at a time. If the financial
   constraints do not allow for more, this first step should be an
   integrated action that includes a combination of insulation and heating
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{There are many approaches to fabricate nanoparticles reinforced aluminum
   matrix composites. However, uniform distribution of nanoparticle within
   aluminum matrix remains a difficult challenge. In this study, a novel
   method is used by taking the advantages from squeeze casting of
   semi-solid aluminum slurry combined with electromagnetic field to refine
   the microstructure of the primary Al and eutectic Si phase, plus to
   obtain uniform distribution nano alumina particles in the aluminum
   matrix. It is noted that electromagnetic field plays an important role
   in the formation of non-dendritic primary alpha-Al particles and a great
   microstructure refinement occurs as a consequence of the pressure
   application. It can be seen that the increase in electromagnetic field
   causes smaller and rounder primary alpha-Al particles. A comparative
   study on abrasive wear behavior of nano Al2O3 reinforced aluminum metal
   matrix composite has been carried out in the present investigation. The
   mass loss of the pin was used to study the effect of Al2O3 addition on
   the wear resistance of the composite materials.}},

Abstract = {{We report a comparative study of single-layer (TiAlCrSiY)N and
   multilayer (TiAl-CrSiY)N/(TiAlCr)N PVD coatings on cutting tools during
   the break-in stage of high-speed dry cutting. Phase and chemical
   composition of tribooxides forming in the coating wear area were studied
   by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is shown that amorphous oxide
   films with a thickness of several dozen angstroms contain phases with a
   chemical composition close to mullite, sapphire, rutile, and chromium
   oxide. As a result of selective wear, the contact surface of the
   coatings retains the most durable tribooxides carrying out protective
   functions. Low-cycle fatigue resistance is studied using the cyclic
   microindentation technique. Fractal analysis of time-resolved indenter
   penetration depth curves combined with scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) demonstrates phenomenological regularities of coatings'
   damageability at the early stage of wear. It is shown that, in
   comparison with single-layer (TiAlCrSiY)N, the nucleation and growth of
   microcracks in a multilayer (TiAlCrSiY)N/(TiAlCr)N coating is
   accompanied by acts of microplastic deformation providing a higher

Abstract = {{As a spatial diversity transmission scheme, repetition code (RC) is
   conjectured to be optimal in the sense of error performance for an
   intensity modulated direct detection multi-input-multi-output optical
   wireless communication (IM/DD MIMO-OWC) over log-normal fading channels.
   Despite the fact that all the experimental evidences thus far have
   strongly demonstrated that this hypothesis is indeed true, its
   mathematical proof remains a long-standing open problem mainly due to
   the lack of an explicit signal design criterion like MIMO radio
   frequency communications. In this letter, subject to two commonly used
   power constraints, we prove the optimality of RC under a much weaker
   condition in the sense of maximizing both large-scale and small-scale
   diversity gains for any space signalling using the recently established
   pair-wise error probability design criterion for a maximum likelihood
   (ML) detector.}},

Abstract = {{Subspace-based high-resolution algorithms for direction-of-arrival (DOA)
   estimation have been developed for large-scale adaptive antenna arrays.
   However, its prerequisite step, namely, source enumeration, has not yet
   been addressed. In this paper, a new approach is devised in the
   framework of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to provide
   reliable detection of the signal source number for the general
   asymptotic regime, where m, n -> infinity and m/n -> c is an element of
   (0, infinity), with m and n being the numbers of antennas and snapshots,
   respectively. In particular, the a posteriori probability is determined
   by correctly calculating the LLFs and PFs for the general asymptotic
   case. By means of the maximum a posteriori probability, we are capable
   of effectively finding the signal number. An accurate closed-form
   expression for the probability of missed detection is also derived for
   the proposed BIC variant. In addition, the probability of false alarm
   for the BIC detector is proved to converge to zero as m, n -> infinity
   and m/n -> c. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed detection approach over state-of-the-art
   schemes and corroborate our theoretical calculations.}},

Title = {{An atom probe tomography study of internal oxidation processes in Alloy
   600}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{55-68}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Internal oxidation in Alloy 600 (Ni-16Cr-9Fe) involves the inward
   diffusion of O, which preferentially reacts with solute elements (e.g.
   Cr, Fe) forming internal oxide precipitates. In this work, the internal
   oxidation process and its resultant metal-oxide heterostructures are
   systematically analyzed in 3D at the finest length scales, using atom
   probe tomography (APT). Internal oxidation is induced by exposure of
   Alloy 600 to 480 degrees C hydrogenated steam, with an oxygen partial
   pressure below the dissociation pressure of the solvent metal oxide,
   NiO. Following exposure, nodules of metallic Ni are observed on the
   sample surface, originating from material that is expelled to relieve
   compressive stresses generated by internal oxidation. Probing the
   material immediately below the surface reveals these nodules to be
   directly connected to their parent grains via Ni-rich metal channels.
   The matrix metal is intertwined with a continuous network of oxides,
   which are primarily FeCr2O4. The continuous interface between oxides and
   matrix provides the short-circuit diffusion pathways necessary for Ni
   expulsion. Deeper below the surface, oxides are observed as particles,
   rather than a continuous network, and are often aligned on matrix
   planes. The small oxide particles are Cr2O3, which is also found to be
   the composition at the centres of many larger FeCr2O4 oxides. This
   indicates that oxides first precipitate as Cr2O3, then later grow as
   FeCr2O4 when local depletion of Cr changes which phase is most
   energetically-favourable. Initial comparisons indicate that some
   fundamental findings in this work are applicable to known internal
   oxidation systems at lower and higher temperatures. (C) 2016 Acta

Title = {{An SVSF-Based Generalized Robust Strategy for Target Tracking in Clutter}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous self-drive requires intelligence and cognition that relies on
   observations and tracking of the state of motion of surrounding
   vehicles. This information can be acquired by using sensors; however,
   these are often affected by clutter and noise that, in turn, introduce
   the issues of estimation and data origin uncertainty into the tracking
   system. The most popular methods for estimation and tracking are based
   on the well-studied Kalman filter (KF). KF is optimal when noise is
   white and remains so despite uncertainties in the filter model; the
   robustness and stability of the KF is affected if this condition is not
   met. The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is a relatively new
   method that is more robust to disturbances and uncertainties. The SVSF
   ensures stability by using a discontinuous corrective term that
   maintains estimates to within a subspace of the true state trajectory.
   The discontinuous corrective term results in chattering that is removed
   by using a smoothing boundary layer. In this paper, a generalized
   covariance formulation of the SVSF and a generalized optimal
   time-varying smoothing boundary layer are proposed. The generalized
   optimal SVSF is then combined with a joint probabilistic data
   association technique for target tracking. The robustness and accuracy
   of the new form of filtering and data association is validated and
   comparatively analyzed by its application to an experimental traffic
   monitoring system based on Light Detection and Ranging.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a novel, data-driven, quality modeling, and

   identification methods for use with batch data to identify a state-space
   model from available process measurements and input moves. We
   demonstrate that the resulting linear time-invariant (LTI), dynamic,
   state-space model is able to describe the transient behavior of finite
   duration batch processes. Next, we relate the terminal quality to the
   terminal value of the identified states. Finally, we apply the resulting
   model in a shrinking-horizon, model predictive control scheme to
   directly control terminal product quality. The theoretical properties of
   the proposed approach are studied and compared to state-of-the-art
   latent variable control approaches. The efficacy of the proposed
   approach is demonstrated through a simulation study of a batch
   polymethyl methacrylate polymerization reactor. Results for both

   methacrylate (MMA) as the model system. Good livingness and control up
   to high conversion are obtained through employing ultrasonic waves. By
   this method, MMA is polymerized in bulk up to ``glass state{''} (88\%)
   at 70 degrees C with polydispersity about 1.2 under an operating
   frequency of 40 kHz and output power of 100 W. Chain extension reaction

Abstract = {{The single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) is an attractive photosensor
   due to its high sensitivity and low dead time. In this paper, a
   comprehensive, accurate analytical SPAD circuit simulation model is
   proposed and implemented in Verilog-A hardware description language. It
   shows great application universality and is fully compatible with
   mainstream commercial circuit simulators. This model incorporates all
   important operating features of the SPAD. Most importantly, to the best
   of our knowledge, it is the first time that the band-to-band tunneling
   mechanism and the temporal dependence of after-pulsing probability are
   included in an SPAD circuit simulation model. The parameter extraction
   processes from interavalanche time measurement of a free-running SPAD
   device are discussed. The simulation results indicate that the proposed
   model works well. In addition, the primary dark counts from the model
   are validated against the measurement results. A maximum relative error
   of 8.7\% is observed at 20 degrees C with an excess voltage of 0.5 V.
   The accuracy of this paper can be greatly improved by using more
   accurate physical parameters available from the SPAD fabrication vendor.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) articulations are one of the most reliable
   implanted hip prostheses. Unfortunately, long-term failure remains an
   obstacle to the service life. There is a lack of higher resolution
   research investigating the metallic surface component of MoP hip
   implants. This study investigates the surface and subsurface features of
   metallic cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy (CoCrMo) femoral head
   components from failed MoP retrievals. Unused prostheses were used for
   comparison to differentiate between wear-induced defects and
   imperfections incurred during implant manufacturing. The predominant
   scratch morphology observed on the non-implanted references was shallow
   and linear, whereas the scratches on the retrievals consisted of largely
   nonlinear, irregular scratches of varying depth (up to 150 nm in
   retrievals and up to 60 nm in reference samples). Characteristic hard
   phases were observed on the surface and subsurface material of the cast
   samples. Across all samples, a 100-400 nm thick nanocrystalline layer
   was visible in the immediate subsurface microstructure. Although
   observation of the nanocrystalline layer has been reported in
   metal-on-metal articulations, its presence in MoP retrievals and
   unimplanted prostheses has not been extensively examined. The results
   suggest that manufacturing-induced surface and subsurface
   microstructural features are present in MoP hip prostheses prior to
   implantation and naturally, these imperfections may influence the in
   vivo wear processes after implantation.}},

Abstract = {{The segregation of solutes to austenite/ferrite transformation
   interfaces during decarburization/denitriding of Fe-Mn-C, Fe-Mn-N, and
   Fe-Si-C ternary alloys was studied by using atom probe tomography.
   Manganese was found to segregate noticeably to the transformation
   interface in the presence of carbon, while no segregation could be
   detected in the presence of nitrogen. This result might indicate that
   manganese interacts little with the interface itself and that its
   interaction with the interstitial controls its segregation behavior. In
   the case of Fe-Si-C, the experiments were complicated by interface
   motion during quenching. Preliminary results suggest that silicon was
   depleted at the interface in contrast to the commonly observed
   segregation behavior of silicon at grain boundaries of ferrite and
   austenite. This observation could be explained by taking into account
   the repulsive interaction between silicon and carbon along with the
   intense segregation of carbon to the interface. This would lead to a net
   repulsive interaction of silicon with the interface even when
   considering the intrinsic tendency of silicon to segregate to the
   boundary in the absence of carbon. The results presented here emphasize
   the need to account for the interaction of all solutes present at the
   interface in ferrite growth models.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional wastewater treatment, waste sludge management and
   disposal contribute the major cost for wastewater treatment.
   Bioelectrochemical systems, as a potential alternative for future
   wastewater treatment and resources recovery, are expected to produce
   small amounts of waste sludge because exoelectrogenic bacteria grow on
   anaerobic respiration and form highly populated biofilms on bioanode
   surfaces. While waste sludge production is governed by the yield and
   decay coefficient, none of previous studies have quantified these
   kinetic constants for exoelectrogenic bacteria. For yield coefficient
   estimation, we modified McCarty's free energy-based model by using the
   bioanode potential for the free energy of the electron acceptor
   reaction. The estimated true yield coefficient ranged 0.1 to 0.3 g-VSS
   (volatile suspended solids) g-COD-1 (chemical oxygen demand), which is
   similar to that of most anaerobic microorganisms. The yield coefficient
   was sensitively affected by the bioanode potential and pH while the
   substrate and bicarbonate concentrations had relatively minor effects on
   the yield coefficient. In lab-scale experiments using microbial
   electrolysis cells, the observed yield coefficient (including the effect
   of cell decay) was found to be 0.020 +/- 0.008 g-VSS g-COD-1, which is
   an order of magnitude smaller than the theoretical estimation. Based on
   the difference between the theoretical and experimental results, the
   decay coefficient was approximated to be 0.013 +/- 0.002 el. These
   findings indicate that bioelectrochemical systems have potential for
   future wastewater treatment with reduced waste sludge as well as for
   resources recovery. Also, the found kinetic information will allow
   accurate estimation of wastewater treatment performance in
   bioelectrochemical systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are ideal reinforcing agents for polymer
   nanocomposites because they are lightweight and nano-sized with a large
   aspect ratio and high elastic modulus. To overcome the poor
   compatibility of hydrophilic CNCs in non-polar composite matrices, we
   grafted poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) from the surface of CNCs using
   an aqueous, one-pot, free radical polymerization method with ceric
   ammonium nitrate as the initiator. The hybrid nanoparticles were
   characterized by CP/MAS NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared
   spectroscopy, contact angle, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray
   diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. Spectroscopy demonstrates that
   0.11g/g (11wt\%) PMMA is grafted from the CNC surface, giving
   PMMA-g-CNCs, which are similar in size and crystallinity to unmodified
   CNCs but have an onset of thermal degradation 45 degrees C lower.
   Nanocomposites were prepared by compounding unmodified CNCs and
   PMMA-g-CNCs (0.0025-0.02g/g (0.25-2wt\%) loading) with PMMA using melt
   mixing and wet ball milling. CNCs improved the performance of melt-mixed
   nanocomposites at 0.02g/g (2wt\%) loading compared to the PMMA control,
   while lower loadings of CNCs and all loadings of PMMA-g-CNCs did not.
   The difference in Young's modulus between unmodified CNC and
   polymer-grafted CNC composites was generally insignificant. Overall,
   ball-milled composites had inferior mechanical and rheological
   properties compared to melt-mixed composites. Scanning electron
   microscopy showed aggregation in the samples with CNCs, but more
   pronounced aggregation with PMMA-g-CNCs. Despite improving interfacial
   compatibility between the nanoparticles and the matrix, the effect of
   PMMA-g-CNC aggregation and decreased thermal stability dominated the
   composite performance.}},

   dissociation pressure of NiO. Oxidation phenomena in Alloy 800 were
   investigated using high resolution electron microscopy techniques.
   Limited oxygen penetration was detected at grain boundaries while
   extensive internal oxidation occurred intragranularly. Internal
   oxidation was possible in an alloy containing a reactive solvent
   element, Fe, with the solute element, Ni, displaced to the surface.
   Several stress relief mechanisms are observed to operate simultaneously.
   The relevance of the observed oxidation phenomena on the primary water
   SCC resistance of Alloy 800 is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Alloy 600 (Ni-16Cr-9Fe) and Alloy 800 (Fe-35Ni-23Cr) were exposed to

   intergranular oxidation was observed in Alloy 600. In Alloy 800, only
   shallow intergranular oxygen penetration was detected. The mechanism of
   intergranular embrittlement in Alloy 600 is likely analogous to internal
   oxidation. Internal oxidation may not apply to Alloy 800 due to the

Abstract = {{The study of solid-state nucleation through experiment is often limited
   by its tiny length range and short time scale. In this study, molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations in a quasi 2D geometry are used to study the
   process of a BCC ferrite phase in pure Fe nucleating at a grain boundary
   (GB) in an FCC austenite polycrystalline system. In the MD simulations
   the critical nucleus can be identified, the bulk free energy difference
   between FCC and BCC is known for the Fe interatomic potential used and
   all relevant interface and GB energies are computed using a Gibbs-Cahn
   formulation. For nucleation events that exhibited low energy facets
   completely contained within the parent FCC phase, the results agreed
   well with predictions from classical nucleation theory (CNT) in terms of
   both the size and shape of the critical nucleus. For systems where the
   emerging nucleus contains facets that cross the GB plane the agreement
   with classical theory is less convincing and the observed nucleus does
   not exhibit parallel facets as predicted from the Winterbottom
   construction. The latter nucleation case involves a so-called pucker
   mechanism of the FCC grain boundary to accommodate the emerging nucleus
   and the effect of GB puckering on the incubation time is discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Thin films of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-tannic acid (TA) complexes were
   prepared by a conceptually new strategy, based on electrophoretic
   deposition (EPD). Proof of concept investigations involved the analysis
   of the deposition yield, FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy of the deposited
   material, and electron microscopy studies. The analysis of the
   deposition mechanism indicated that the limitations of the EPD in the
   deposition of small phenolic molecules, such as TA, and electrically
   neutral polymers, similar to PVP, containing hydrogen-accepting carbonyl
   groups, can be avoided. The remarkable adsorption properties of TA and
   film forming properties of the PVP-TA complexes allowed for the EPD of
   materials of different types, such as huntite mineral platelets and
   hydrotalcite clay particles, TiO2 and MnO2 oxide nanoparticles,
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes, TiN and Pd nanoparticles. Moreover, PVP-TA
   complexes were used for the co-deposition of different materials and
   formation of composite films. In another approach, TA was used as a
   capping agent for the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanorods, which were
   then deposited by EPD using PVP-TA complexes. The fundamental adsorption
   and interaction mechanisms of TA involved chelation of metal atoms on
   particle surfaces with galloyl groups, pi-pi interactions and hydrogen
   bonding. The films prepared by EPD can be used for various applications,
   utilizing functional properties of TA, PVP, inorganic and organic
   materials of different types and their composites. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   classification method produced the best overall performance, with a
   lowest detection accuracy (DA) of 99.95\% and a lowest classification
   accuracy (CA) of 99.95\% for the spring faults occurring on individual
   valves. The lowest DA and CA values for multiple faults occurring
   simultaneously were 99.95\% and 92.45\%, respectively. The DA and CA

Abstract = {{Inference in Bayesian networks with large domain of discrete variables
   requires significant computational effort. In order to reduce the
   computational effort, current approaches often assume that discrete
   variables have some bounded number of values or are represented at an
   appropriate size of clusters. In this paper, we introduce decision-tree
   structured conditional probability representations that can efficiently
   handle a large domain of discrete and continuous variables. These
   representations can partition the large number of values into some
   reasonable number of clusters and lead to more robust parameter
   estimation. Very rapid computation and ability to treat both discrete
   and continuous variables are accomplished via modified belief
   propagation algorithm. Being able to compute various types of reasoning
   from a single Bayesian network eliminates development and maintenance
   issues associated with the use of distinct models for different types of
   reasoning. Application to real-world steel production process data is
   presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing the structure of the porous electrodes of polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cells (PEM-FC) can improve device power and durability.
   Analytical microscopy techniques are important tools for measuring the
   electrode structure, thereby providing guidance for structural
   optimization. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), with either Energy
   Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) or Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS)
   analysis, and Scanning Transmission X-Ray Microscopy (STXM) are
   complementary methods which, together, provide a powerful approach for
   PEM-FC electrode analysis. Both TEM and STXM require thin (50-200 nm)
   samples, which can be prepared either by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling
   or by embedding and ultramicrotomy. Here we compare TEM and STXM
   spectromicroscopy analysis of FIB and ultramicrotomy sample preparations
   of the same PEM-FC sample, with focus on how sample preparation affects
   the derived chemical composition and spatial distributions of carbon
   support and ionomer. The FIB lamella method, while avoiding pore-filling
   by embedding media, had significant problems. In particular, in the FIB
   sample the carbon support was extensively amorphized and the ionomer
   component suffered mass loss and structural damage. Although each sample
   preparation technique has a role to play in PEM-FC optimization studies,
   it is important to be aware of the limitations of each method. (C) 2016

   reduction perspective}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{The laminar-turbulent (LT) transition of dilute polymer solutions is of
   great interest not only for the complex transition dynamics itself, but
   also for its potential link to the maximum drag reduction (MDR)
   phenomenon. We present an in-depth investigation of the edge state (ES),
   an asymptotic solution on the LT boundary, in viscoelastic channel flow.
   For given Re and simulation domain size, mean flow statistics of the ES
   do not vary with the introduction of polymers, proving that there is a
   region of turbulent states not susceptible to polymer drag reduction
   effects. The dynamics of the ES features low-frequency fluctuations and
   in the longer domains we studied it is nearly periodic with regular
   bursts of turbulent activities separated by extended quiescent periods.
   Its flow field is dominated by elongated vortices and streaks, with very
   weak extensional and rotational flow motions. Polymer stretching is
   almost exclusively contributed by the mean shear and polymer-turbulence
   interaction is minimal. Flow structures and the kinematics of the ES
   match hibernating turbulence, an MDR-like phase intermittently occurring
   in turbulent dynamics. Its observation now seems to result from
   recurrent visits to certain parts of the ES. The ES offers explanations
   for the existence and universality of MDR, the quantitative magnitude of
   which, however, still remains unsolved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the design of space code for an intensity
   modulated direct detection multi-input-multi-output optical wireless
   communication (IM/DD MIMO-OWC) system, in which channel coefficients are
   independent and non-identically log-normal distributed, with variances
   and means known at the transmitter and channel state information
   available at the receiver. Utilizing the existing space code design
   criterion for IM/DD MIMO-OWC with a maximum likelihood (ML) detector, we
   design a diversity-optimal space code (DOSC) that maximizes both
   large-scale diversity and small-scale diversity gains and prove that the
   spatial repetition code (RC) with a diversity-optimized power allocation
   is diversity-optimal among all the high dimensional nonnegative space
   code schemes under a commonly used optical power constraint. In
   addition, we show that one of significant advantages of the DOSC is to
   allow low-complexity ML detection. Simulation results indicate that in
   high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, our proposed DOSC
   significantly outperforms RC, which is the best space code currently
   available for such system. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Influence of dislocation microstructure on low temperature
   magnetoresistance in copper single- and polycrystals}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{203-216}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Angular and field dependent transverse magnetoresistance (TMR) have been
   studied in copper single- and polycrystals containing different density
   and distribution of dislocations. In the open-orbit orientation, the
   quadratic variation of TMR with the applied magnetic field changes to
   the quasi-linear dependence, as the density of dislocations increases.
   In the closed-orbit orientations, TMR shows a linear dependence with the
   magnetic field, the slope of the characteristic decreases with
   increasing the density of dislocations. The signatures of closed and
   extended orbits are preserved until the very high dislocation densities
   stored in the single crystals. The analysis of the Kohler's plots
   indicates that in the open-orbit orientation TMR violates Kohler's rule,
   but in the closed-orbit orientation Kohler's rule is obeyed. The results
   suggest that at low dislocation density, the magneto-transport of
   electrons is strongly anisotropic and is dominated by small-angle
   scattering, irrespective of the distribution of dislocations. In the
   crystals with higher densities of dislocations containing dislocation
   walls and cells, the electron transport is dominated by a high-angle
   scattering process. The magnetoresistance data are consistent with the
   two-band model and support the theory that the dislocation-induced
   relaxation time is anisotropic due to the non-sphericity of the Fermi
   surface. In the spherical portion of the Fermi surface the scattering is
   isotropic, associated with the constant relaxation time. Strongly
   anisotropic scattering in the aspherical portion of the Fermi surface is
   associated with a much smaller relaxation time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The authors introduce a methodology for fast multi-objective design
   optimisation of miniaturised microwave couplers. The approach exploits
   the surrogate-based optimisation paradigm with an underlying
   low-fidelity model constructed from an equivalent circuit of the
   structure under consideration, corrected through implicit and frequency
   space mapping. A fast prediction tool obtained this way is subsequently
   optimised by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to identify an
   initial approximation of the Pareto front, that is, a set of designs
   representing the best possible trade-offs between conflicting
   objectives. The correction/optimisation of the surrogate is then
   iterated by design space confinement and segmentation based on a Pareto
   set representation obtained thus far in the process. This aims at
   improving the surrogate model accuracy in the vicinity of the
   Pareto-optimal solutions. The technique is demonstrated by two design
   examples of compact rat-race couplers. Experimental validation is also
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{In the large body of research literature on image restoration, very few
   papers were concerned with compression-induced degradations, although in
   practice, the most common cause of image degradation is compression.
   This paper presents a novel approach to restoring JPEG-compressed
   images. The main innovation is in the approach of exploiting residual
   redundancies of JPEG code streams and sparsity properties of latent
   images. The restoration is a sparse coding process carried out jointly
   in the DCT and pixel domains. The prowess of the proposed approach is
   directly restoring DCT coefficients of the latent image to prevent the
   spreading of quantization errors into the pixel domain, and at the same
   time, using online machine-learned local spatial features to regulate
   the solution of the underlying inverse problem. Experimental results are
   encouraging and show the promise of the new approach in significantly
   improving the quality of DCT-coded images.}},

Abstract = {{A waveguide-based antireflection structure is proposed. The device
   consists of two polarization rotators (PRs), two
   polarization-distinguished 90-deg phase delay units (PDUs), and a
   polarization beam combiner (PBC). The PR and PDU, providing the same
   function as a quarter wave plate in free-space optics, convert a
   linearly polarized light into a circularly polarized light. Upon
   reflection from an isotropic homogenous interface, the returned light is
   converted back into a linearly polarized light in its perpendicular
   direction. Through the PBC placed at the input port, the returned light
   is then redirected into a different port for further use or discard. Our
   three-dimensional mode-matching method-based simulation shows that, on
   the silicon-on-insulator waveguide platform, the total device length can
   be made as short as 10.5 mu m. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The assimilation of soil moisture and brightness temperature (TB) are
   expected to improve the modeling of land surface processes, but are only
   available at a resolution that is far coarser than the scale of many
   hydrological processes. Due to systematic differences between model
   states and satellite observations, a bias correction operator is a
   necessary step in land data assimilation schemes and was evaluated as a
   method to disaggregate coarse-scale satellite observations to fine-scale
   model grid cells (similar to 800 m). This was done by coupling the
   Modelisation Environmentale Communautaire-Surface Hydrology (MESH)
   Hydrological Land-Surface Scheme to the Community Microwave Emissions
   Model (CMEM) to simulate soil moisture and TB. By comparison, MESH-CMEM
   was found to be in good agreement with observations from the Soil
   Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite at the scale of SMOS data
   products (R approximate to 0.55), with simulated TB being better
   correlated than soil moisture retrievals. Following bias correction, TB
   and soil moisture retrievals at 800-m resolution had comparable
   performance to coarse-resolution SMOS data. Bias correction of TB was
   more reliable than soil moisture. These findings indicate that both TB
   and soil moisture retrievals can be assimilated in a land surface model
   at moderate-to-high resolution with a simple observation operator.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the conformation of blood proteins due to their binding to
   nonbiological surfaces is the initial step in the chain of immunological
   reactions to foreign bodies. Despite the large number of experimental
   studies that have been performed on fibrinogen adsorption to
   nonbiological surfaces, a clear picture describing this complex process
   has eluded researchers to date. Developing a better understanding of the
   behavior of bioactive fibrinogen motifs upon their interaction with
   surfaces may facilitate the design of advanced materials with improved
   biocompatibility. This is especially important within the context of
   medical implants. Here we present results of explicit-solvent, all-atom
   MD simulations of the adsorption of the fibrinogen D-domain onto a
   graphene surface and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) surface. Our results
   are consistent with experimental observations that interactions with PEG
   do not induce significant conformational changes on immune-reactive
   sites present in the D-domain of fibrinogen. In contrast, our results
   indicate that significant conformational changes induced by adsorption
   to graphene surfaces may occur under conditions that promote a high
   density of blood proteins on the surface. The structural rearrangements
   observed on graphene directly affect the secondary structure content of
   the D-domain, with consequent exposure of the recognition sites P1
   (gamma 190-202) and P2 (gamma 377-395) and the subsite P2-C (gamma
   383-395) involved in immune response. Analysis of the structural
   parameters of the MD conformers was shown to accurately assess the
   biocompatibility of the modeled surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical mapping imaged by electron energy-loss spectroscopy based on
   scanning transmission electron microscopy was conducted on a compressed
   graphite specimen containing different carbon allotropes (hexagonal
   diamond, cubic diamond, and graphite phases). This imaging process
   allows visualization of the complex spatial distribution of different
   diamond phases, and their coexistence was confirmed using dark field
   (DF) imaging. The chemical mapping images showed spatial distribution of
   local bonding state for hexagonal and cubic diamond phases in the whole
   specimen, while the DF images showed only a part of crystalline segments
   with long-range order. Thus, the chemical mapping method has an
   advantage for the purpose of observing locally the existence of
   individual carbon allotropes in the whole specimen. The size
   distribution of the hexagonal diamond phase is approximately 10-100 nm.
   These findings indicate that the compressing method can potentially
   synthesize similar to 100 nm large diamond phases. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to the scarcity of ``easy slip{''} systems in hexagonal materials
   with a hexagonal close-packed structure (hcp), deformation twinning
   plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties and texture
   evolution. In this article, we highlight the current understanding of
   mechanisms and mechanics of the twinning system \{10 (1) over bar2\} <
   10 (1) over bar(1) over bar >, which is commonly activated in all
   hexagonal materials for nucleation and propagation of deformation twins,
   twin-twin interactions, solute segregation at twin boundaries, and the
   development of constitutive models that account for the fundamental
   mechanisms of twinning/detwinning. Future directions such as
   characterizing the three-dimensional shapes of twins, the influence of
   solute atoms on twin propagation, and the influence of twin-twin
   junctions on mechanical properties of the hexagonal materials are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Topical drug delivery to the front of the eye is extremely inefficient
   due to effective natural protection mechanisms such as precorneal tear
   turnover and the relative impermeability of the cornea and sclera
   tissues. This causes low ocular drug bioavailability, requiring large
   frequent doses that result in high systemic exposure and side effects.
   Mucoadhesive drug delivery systems have the potential to improve topical
   drug delivery by increasing pharmaceutical bioavailability on the
   anterior eye surface. We report the synthesis and characterization of a
   series of poly(L-lactide)-b-poly(methacrylic
   acid-co-3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid) block copolymer micelles for use
   as mucoadhesive drug delivery vehicles. Micelle properties, drug release
   rates, and mucoadhesion were shown to depend on phenylboronic acid
   content. The micelles showed low in vitro cytotoxicity against human
   corneal epithelial cells and undetectable acute in vivo ocular
   irritation in Sprague Dawley rats, suggesting good biocompatibility with
   the corneal surface. The micelles show the potential to significantly
   improve the bioavailability of topically applied ophthalmic drugs, which
   could reduce dosage, frequency of administration, and unintentional
   systemic exposure. This would greatly improve the delivery of the ocular
   drugs such as the potent immunosuppressive cyclosporine A used in the
   treatment of severe dry eye disease.}},

Title = {{Deformation behavior of Mg-8.5wt.\%Al alloy under reverse loading
   investigated by in-situ neutron diffraction and elastic viscoplastic
   self-consistent modeling}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The EVPSC-TDT model for polycrystal plasticity and in-situ neutron
   diffraction have been used to investigate the behavior of a
   Mg-8.5wt.\%Al alloy with two starting textures: 1) a typical extrusion
   texture in which a majority of the grains are oriented favorably for
   extension twinning via compression perpendicular to the basal pole, and
   2) a modified texture in which extension twinning can be activated via
   tension parallel to the basal pole in a majority of the grains. Using a
   small number of adjustable parameters, and only two macroscopic tensile
   stress strain curves for calibration, the model is able to capture,
   quantitatively, the trends in multiple data sets, including grain-level
   elastic lattice strains, and diffraction peak intensity changes due to
   lattice re-orientation associated with twinning. For twinning, the model
   assumes a polar critical resolved shear stress activation criterion and
   assigns the stress and hardening of the parent crystal to a newly formed
   twin. The model allows twinning to be driven either by the stress in the
   parent crystal (matrix reduction), in which case all of the twin
   transformation strain is assigned to the matrix, or by the stress in the
   twin (twin propagation), in which case all of the twin transformation
   strain is assigned to the twin. A detailed comparison between the model
   predictions and the neutron diffraction data reveals that assigning all
   of the twin transformation strain either to the matrix or to the twin is
   too one-sided, leading to excessive relaxation and hardening effects. A
   more equitable partitioning of the twin transformation strain is
   necessary. It is suggested that the stress and hardening assigned to a
   newly formed twin is of less importance to the performance of the model
   than the partitioning of the twin transformation strain. Published by

   mechanisms evolve}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{19-47}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In order to investigate the evolution of deformation mechanisms of AZ31B
   Mg alloy sheet and their correlation with material property development
   under intermediate temperatures, systematic experimental examination and
   in-depth crystal plasticity analysis on the material are performed. The
   mechanical responses of AZ31B Mg alloy sheet are measured under uniaxial
   tension and compression along RD (rolling direction), TD (transverse
   direction) and ND (normal direction) directions and over the temperature
   range 100 similar to 300 degrees C. The evolution of anisotropy
   (r-value), texture, and microstructure with respect to temperature and
   strain are examined. Two uncommon deformation behaviors in AZ31 sheet
   deformation are observed in the experiments for the first time. Firstly,
   the slope of r-value versus strain curve in RD compression at lower
   temperature changes from a positive to a negative one when temperature
   rises to 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C. Secondly, micro-bands are
   formed during RD compression at 200 degrees C, in contrast to uniform
   equiaxed dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains in RD tension and ND
   compression. The evolution of deformation mechanisms in the uniaxial
   tension/compression deformation is analyzed with the visco-plastic
   self-consistent (VPSC) model that takes the variation of r-value into
   account. The correlation between the experimental observations and
   deformation modes evolution is probed. It is found that the negative
   slope of activity ratio of prismatic to basal slip is highly consistent
   with the change in r-value with strain during uniaxial compression at
   200 degrees C. The different rotation `room' caused by basal slip in
   uniaxial compression at 200 degrees C, together with the restriction of
   grain boundary, leads to higher misorientation evolution rate in loading
   direction than in the other directions, and then results in the
   formation of micro-bands. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   variance (ANOVA) coupled with its multivariate extensions are performed
   to explore potential interactions among model parameters and among
   hydrological metrics in a systematic manner. The proposed methodology is
   applied to the Xiangxi River watershed by using the conceptual
   hydrological model (HYMOD) to demonstrate its validity and
   applicability. Results reveal that MFA is capable of deriving
   probability density functions (PDFs) of hydrologic model parameters.
   Moreover, the sequential inferences derived from the F test and its
   multivariate approximations disclose the statistical significance of
   parametric interactions affecting individual and multiple hydrological
   metrics, respectively. The findings presented here indicate that
   parametric interactions are complex in a fuzzy stochastic environment,
   and the magnitude and direction of interaction effects vary in different
   regions of the parameter space as well as vary temporally because of the
   dynamic behavior of hydrologic systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript, we consider the problem of multi-rate modeling and
   economic model predictive control (EMPC) of electric arc furnaces (EAF),
   which are widely used in the steel industry to produce molten steel from
   scrap metal. The two main challenges that we address are the multi-rate
   nature of the measurement availability, and the requirement to achieve
   final product of a desired characteristic, while minimizing the
   operation cost. To this end, multi-rate models are identified that
   include predictions for both the infrequently and frequently measured
   process variables. The models comprise local linear models and an
   appropriate weighting scheme to capture the nonlinear nature of the EAF.
   The resulting model is integrated into a two-tiered predictive
   controller that enables achieving the target end-point while minimizing
   the associated cost. The EMPC is implemented on the EAF process and the
   closed-loop simulation results subject to the limited availability of
   process measurements and noise illustrate the improvement in economic
   performance over existing trajectory-tracking approaches. (C) 2016

   (TBP) curves are predicted via partial least squares model from the feed

   furnace coil outlet temperatures). Combined with volumetric and energy
   balances, this enables prediction of crude distillation on par with a
   rigorous distillation model, with 0.5\% root mean square error (RMSE)
   over a wide range of conditions. Associated properties (e.g., gravity,

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design of linear full-diversity space code (FDSC) is
   considered for an intensity-modulated direct-detection
   multiple-input-multiple-output optical wireless communication (IM/DD
   MIMO-OWC) system, in which the channel suffers from log-normal fading

   optimizing both large-scale diversity gain and small-scale diversity
   into a max-min optimization problem with continuous-discrete mixed
   design variables. We propose the use of the Farey sequence in number
   theory as a powerful tool to solve this kind of optimization problem. By
   taking advantage of some available properties and by developing some new
   interesting properties on the Farey sequence, a closed-form solution is
   attained for IM/DD MIMO-OWC equipped with two transmitters and multiple
   receivers. This optimal design shows that a repetition code with an
   optimal power allocation is optimal.}},

Abstract = {{A new offshore high-voltage dc (HVDC) wind generation scheme is proposed
   in this paper. The scheme implements a high-voltage hybrid generator

   system installed in a commercial wind farm. The analyses demonstrate
   improvements in system losses and, hence, efficiency, power-train
   hardware, including cable system mass and, importantly, a reduction in
   major component count and installed power electronics in the nacelle and
   turbine tower, features that lead to reduced capital cost and
   maintenance. The resulting power conversion system is more simplified
   and more amenable to higher voltage implementation since it is not
   constrained by existing state-of-art power-electronic voltage-source
   converter structures. Voltage control is facilitated via dc/dc
   converters located away from the turbine tower. To demonstrate the HG
   operational concept, measured results from a low-power laboratory
   prototype HG system are compared with analytical results and show good
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to examine and recommend procedures
   that can be used to statistically test the exponentiality of large
   amounts of sample data for rainfall event volume, duration, and
   interevent time. Based on literature review and initial analysis, the
   Poisson and chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are selected first. Some
   misconceptions about parameter estimators and degrees of freedom
   associated with the use of the chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are then
   clarified. Using rainfall data from seven stations in the north-central
   region of the United States, the choice of the event volume threshold
   and the minimum interevent time for separating continuous rainfall data
   into individual events are examined in detail. Findings from this study
   suggest that the Poisson test can be used for testing the exponentiality
   of interevent times and for examining the statistical independence of
   consecutive rainfall events. The use of the minimum chi-square estimator
   combined with the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is recommended for
   rainfall event volume and duration. An equation that can be used to
   determine the appropriate number of bins for grouping sample data when
   conducting the chi-square goodness-of-fit tests is also proposed.}},

Title = {{Atropine and Roscovitine Release from Model Silicone Hydrogels}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Drug delivery to the anterior eye has a low compliance and results in
   significant drug losses. In pediatric patients, eye diseases such as
   myopia and retinoblastoma can potentially be treated pharmacologically,
   but the risk associated with high drug concentrations coupled with the
   need for regular dosing limits their effectiveness. The current study
   examined the feasibility of atropine and roscovitine delivery from model
   silicone hydrogel materials which could potentially be used to treat
   myopia and retinoblastoma, respectively.
   Methods
   Model silicone hydrogel materials that comprised TRIS and DMA were
   prepared with the drug incorporated during synthesis. Various materials
   properties, with and without incorporated drug, were investigated
   including water uptake, water contact angle, and light transmission.
   Drug release was evaluated under sink conditions into phosphate buffered
   saline.
   Results
   The results demonstrate that up to 2 wt\% of the drugs can be
   incorporated into model silicone hydrogel materials without adversely
   affecting critical materials properties such as water uptake, light
   transmission, and surface hydrophilicity. Equilibrium water content
   ranged from 15 to 32\% and transmission exceeded 89\% for materials with
   at least 70\% DMA. Extended release exceeding 14 days was possible with
   both drugs, with the total amount of drug released from the materials
   ranging from 16\% to over 76\%. Although a burst effect was noted, this
   was thought to be due to surface-bound drug, and therefore storage in an
   appropriate packaging solution could be used to overcome this if
   desired.
   Conclusions
   Silicone hydrogel materials have the potential to deliver drugs for over
   2 weeks without compromising lens properties. This could potentially
   overcome the need for regular drop instillation and allow for the
   maintenance of drug concentration in the tear film over the period of
   wear. This represents a potential option for treating a host of
   ophthalmic disorders in children including myopia and retinoblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a high resolution, high precision and ultra-low power
   consumption time-to-digital converter (TDC) is presented. The proposed
   TDC is based on the gateable Vernier ring oscillator architecture. Fine
   resolution is achieved through two ring oscillators arranged in the
   Vernier configuration. This TDC employs a single-transition
   end-of-conversion detection circuit and turns off the ring oscillators
   whenever the conversion is completed to reduce power consumption. The
   prototype chip is fabricated in a standard 130 nm digital CMOS process
   and its area is only 0.03 mm(2). Using a 1.2 V supply, the TDC achieves
   a resolution of 7.3 ps, a single-shot precision of 1.0LSB, and an
   average power consumption of 1.2 mW. A root-mean-square integral non
   linearity (INL) of 1.2 LSB is obtained with the help of an INL
   look-up-table calibration. Compared to previously reported
   ring-oscillator based TDCs, the proposed design achieves the lowest
   power consumption to date.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a rucmerical study on the thermal
   performance of large horizontal thermal energy storage tanks. The
   numerical model was validated using measurements obtained from Drake
   Landing Solar Community (DLSC), which is located in Alberta, Canada. A
   total of seven different baffle configurations were assessed for a range
   of operating conditions. Characterization of the tank performance was
   done by monitoring the tank outlet temperature and computing the Huhn
   efficiency, which is a characterization index based on the second law of
   thermodynamics. Results show that the current tanks at DLSC experience
   excessive mixing due to fluid entrainment from the inlet jet. A newly
   introduced design that confines the inlet jet mixing shows the potential
   to enhance the level of stratification during charging or discharging at
   a constant temperature. In addition, most designs tested have a
   relatively high level of stratification during charging, discharging,
   and simultaneous charging and discharging, but fail to sustain the level
   of stratification when a positive buoyant jet is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsive processes frequently occur in many fields, such as radar,
   sonar, communications, audio and speech processing, and biomedical
   engineering. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex linear regression
   (NLR) based minimum dispersion beamforming technique for impulsive
   signals to achieve significant performance improvement over the
   conventional minimum variance beamformer. The proposed beamformer
   minimizes the l(p)-norm of the output with p < 1 subject to a linear
   distortionless response constraint, resulting in a difficult nonconvex
   and nonsmooth optimization problem. The constrained optimization problem
   is first reduced to a multivariate linear regression via constraint
   elimination. As a major contribution of this paper, a coordinate descent
   algorithm (CDA) is devised for solving the resultant NLR problem of
   l(p)-minimization with p < 1 at a computational complexity of O(MN2),
   where is the number of sensors and is the sample size. At each inner
   iteration of the CDA, an efficient algorithm is designed to find the
   global minimum of each subproblem of univariate linear regression. The
   convergence of the CDA is analyzed. The NLR beamformer with a single
   constraint is further generalized to the case of multiple linear
   constraints, which is robust against model mismatch. Simulation results
   demonstrate the superior performance of nonconvex optimization based
   beamformer.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION}},

Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{28-39}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Due to the ill-posed nature of image denoising problem, good image
   priors are of great importance for an effective restoration. Nonlocal
   self-similarity and sparsity are two popular and widely used image
   priors which have led to several state-of-the-art methods in natural
   image denoising. In this paper, we take advantage of these priors and
   propose a new denoising algorithm based on sparse and low-rank
   representation of image patches under a nonlocal framework. This
   framework consists of two complementary steps. In the first step, noise
   removal from groups of matched image patches is formulated as recovery
   of low-rank matrices from noisy data. This problem is then efficiently
   solved under asymptotic matrix reconstruction model based on recent
   results from random matrix theory which leads to a parameter free
   optimal estimator. Nonlocal learned sparse representation is adopted in
   the second step to suppress artifacts introduced in the previous
   estimate. Experimental results, demonstrate the superior denoising
   performance of the proposed algorithm as compared with the
   state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulation, combined with the artificial driving
   force technique, has been used to study solute interactions with
   migrating grain boundaries, especially low angle boundaries, in the
   Al-Mg alloy system. The motion of {[}112] symmetric tilt boundaries was
   investigated employing two different approaches at 300 K (27 A degrees
   C). In the first approach, where solute atoms are segregated and
   surround the intrinsic dislocations at the grain boundary, a strong
   solute pinning effect was observed at all misorientations and at
   different Mg concentrations. A minimum driving force is found to be
   required for overcoming the barrier produced by the segregated solute at
   the boundary and a high magnitude of threshold force was observed in all
   alloys examined. In the alternative approach, where solutes are
   distributed in a confined region away from the grain boundary, we find
   that the velocity-driving force behavior in the high driving pressure
   regime depends on solute concentration, consistent with a recent solute
   pinning model by Hersent et al. The distributed solute approach provided
   less pining effect on low angle grain boundary migration compared to
   that of segregated solutes. The relationship between the restraining
   force and the solute concentration was computed and, when fit to the
   Hersent et al. analysis, the solute pinning constant was found to be
   alpha = 35 +/- A 7 MPa for a 7.785 deg boundary in the Al-Mg binary
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional plant protein production methods involve the use of

   of high quality plant protein powders using navy bean flour as a model
   system. The process consisted of a fluidized bed flour reservoir,

   protein content of the original navy bean flour was increased from
   25.4\% to 47.0\% in the final protein-enriched fraction collected from
   the bottom section of the plate in the separator. A wide variety of
   tribo-charging tubes with different sizes, shapes, and materials were
   tested to evaluate their efficiency. Protein recovery by this approach
   was higher than other solvent-free separation approaches and could be
   improved by further optimization of the flow rate and design

Title = {{Achieving thermal rectification in designed liquid-liquid systems}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Thermal rectification is generally implemented using solid structures.
   We demonstrate how thermal transport can be rectified using designed
   liquid-liquid structures consisting of thin adjacent immiscible water
   and hexane layers. For specified hot and cold side temperatures, the
   heat flux differs when either water or hexane is placed on the hot side,
   demonstrating thermal rectification between the two cases. The
   rectification is influenced by the relative thicknesses of the layers.
   It is the highest when the water-hexane interface temperatures for both
   cases are identical. Changing the thermal conductivity of hexane, which
   is the lower thermal conductivity liquid, e. g., by potentially loading
   it with conducting or insulating nanoparticles, has a larger impact on
   rectification than altering the water conductivity, which is higher. If

   gradual change in the monomeric composition along polymer chains. There
   is no abrupt composition change between the adjacent blocks. This design
   minimizes possible sharp domain boundaries and generates highly

Title = {{Luminescence properties of Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped SiOxNy thin films:
   Prospects for color tunability in silicon-based hosts}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the role of the nitrogen content, the annealing
   temperature, and the sample morphology on the luminescence properties of
   Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped SiOxNy thin films has been investigated. An
   increasing nitrogen atomic percentage has been incorporated in the host
   matrix by gradually replacing oxygen with nitrogen during fabrication
   while maintaining the Si content unaltered, obtaining a sequential
   variation in the film composition from nearly stoichiometric SiO2 to
   SiOxNy. The study of rare earth doped single layers has allowed us to
   identify the parameters that yield an optimum optical performance from
   Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions. Ce3+ ions proved to be highly sensitive to the
   annealing temperature and the nitrogen content, showing strong PL
   emission for relatively low nitrogen contents (from 0 to 20\%) and
   moderate annealing temperatures (800-1000 degrees C) or under high
   temperature annealing (1180 degrees C). Tb3+ ions, on the other hand,
   displayed a mild dependence on those film parameters. Rare earth
   co-doping has also been investigated by comparing the luminescence
   properties of three different approaches: (i) a Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped
   SiOxNy single layer, (ii) a bilayer composed of two SiOxNy single layers
   doped with either Ce3+ or Tb3+ ions, and (iii) a multilayer composed of
   a series of either Tb3+ or Ce3+-doped SiOxNy thin films with interleaved
   SiO2 spacers. Bright green emission and efficient energy transfer from
   either Ce3+ ions or Ce silicates to Tb3+ ions has been observed in the
   co-doped single layer as a consequence of the strong ion-ion
   interaction. On the other hand, independent luminescence from Ce3+ and
   Tb3+ ions has been observed in the Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped bilayer and
   multilayer, providing a good scenario to develop light emitting devices
   with wide color tunability by varying the number of deposited films that
   contain each rare earth dopant. Moreover, the optoelectronic properties
   of Ce3+-and/or Tb3+-doped thin films have been studied by depositing
   transparent conductive electrodes over selected samples. An
   electroluminescence signal according to the rare earth transitions is
   obtained in all cases, validating the excitation of Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions
   upon electron injection. Also, the main charge transport of injected
   electrons has been evaluated and correlated with the layer
   stoichiometry. Finally, a simple reliability test has allowed disclosing
   the origin of the early breakdown of test devices, attributed to the
   excessive joule heating at filament currents that occur around a region
   close to the polarization point. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature fracture during tensile deformation has been studied in
   two commercial wrought magnesium alloys, namely AZ31B and ZEK100. As a
   consequence of differences in texture and grain size the deformation
   modes of these materials differ significantly. This leads to significant
   differences is the kind of damage that results prior to fracture as
   evidenced by a combination of traditional metallography and x-ray
   computed tomography (XCT). The AZ31B samples show little evidence of
   twinning, in part because of the fine grain size, until after the end of
   uniform elongation. Moreover, a high r-value, which increases as
   deformation proceeds, makes this material resistant to shear
   localization. Damage in this material forms by a combination of ductile
   dimple formation at second-phase particles and some twin related
   microcracking. The ZEK100 samples exhibit extensive twinning and a low
   r-value (less than 1) meaning that the material is susceptible to shear
   localization. Although extension twins dominate once the material starts
   to neck contraction twins are also seen. These form the nucleation sites
   for an array of penny shaped cracks. In both materials the final
   fracture is triggered by a macroscopic shear localization that produces
   a slant fracture surface at 45 to the tensile axis. However, in AZ31B,
   void linkage produces a fracture surface that is quasi-ductile in
   appearance, while in ZEK100 the final fracture involves the linkage of
   the twin-induced microcracks and is quasi-brittle in nature. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the
   deposition of humic acid (HA) from solutions in water or mixed
   water-ethanol solvent. The deposition mechanism was based on the
   electrophoresis of anionic HA species, local pH decrease at the anode,
   charge neutralization and HA precipitation. The deposition yield can be
   varied by the variation of HA concentration and deposition voltage. HA
   showed remarkable adsorption on various materials, which involved
   different adsorption mechanisms. HA was used as a dispersing, charging
   and film forming agent for the EPD of materials of different types, such
   as oxide nanoparticles of TiO2 and MnO2, mineral particles of halloysite
   nanotubes and huntite platelets, metal nanoparticles of Ni and Pd, and
   other materials, such as SiC and multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT).
   The use of HA as a co-dispersant allowed for the fabrication of
   MnO2-MWCNT composites with various MWCNT content. The obtained films can
   be used for different applications based on the functional properties of
   the deposited materials, such as catalytic, flame retardant, molecular
   storage and electronic properties. Testing results showed promising

Abstract = {{The electron transport and recombination processes of photoexcited
   electron-hole pairs were studied in InGaAs/InP single quantum wells.
   Comprehensive transport data analysis reveals a asymmetric shape of the
   quantum well potential where the electron mobility was found to be
   dominated by interface-roughness scattering. The low-temperature
   time-resolved photoluminescence was employed to investigate
   recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons. Remarkable
   modification of Auger recombination was observed with variation of the
   electron mobility. In high mobility quantum wells, the increasing pump
   power resulted in a new and unexpected phenomenon: a considerably
   enhanced Auger non-radiative recombination time. We propose that the
   distribution of the photoexcited electrons over different conduction
   band valleys might account for this effect. In low mobility quantum
   wells, disorder-induced relaxation of the momentum conservation rule
   causes inter-valley transitions to be insignificant; as a consequence,
   the non-radiative recombination time is reduced with the increase in
   pump power. Thus, interface-roughness scattering was found responsible
   for both transport properties and dynamic optical response in InGaAs/InP
   quantum wells. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes mathematical formulations for modeling aspects of
   partial shutdowns in multiunit plants. The specific type of partial
   shutdown considered is one that permits the decoupling of affected units
   from the rest of the plant, thus enabling continued plant operation,
   albeit in a more limited fashion. Parsimonious and computationally
   efficient mixed-integer formulations are presented for specific
   discontinuous phenomena that arise in partial shutdown modeling, such as
   shutdown thresholds, induced shutdowns, discontinuous costs, and minimum
   shutdown durations. It is demonstrated that induced shutdowns (secondary
   shutdowns triggered by the original shutdown) can be correctly penalized
   in the objective by capturing the shutdown's true discontinuous economic
   cost. The computed optimal solution is implemented in closed-loop by
   employing a multitiered model predictive shutdown controller, in which a
   discrete-time mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problem is
   embedded. Both objectives of maximizing economics and minimizing
   restoration (shutdown recovery) time are considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The main focus of this study is on application of the enhanced embedded

   J-integral is used to evaluate the energy release rate around the crack
   tip and its value is compared with both that obtained from Extended FEM
   simulations as well as from an analytical solution. The approach is also
   used for modeling of cohesive crack propagation. It is demonstrated that
   the framework gives results that are very close to those obtained using
   Extended FEM, while the former requires less computational effort. A
   comparison with a standard smeared approach is provided in order to
   highlight the nature of the contribution. The embedded discontinuity
   framework is also applied to flow problems with pre-existing cracks. A
   modified form of Fourier law is introduced and later employed for
   modeling of heat transfer/flow in the domain that contains thermally

Abstract = {{Kinematic simulation (KS) is a means of generating a turbulent-like
   velocity field, in a manner that enforces a desired input Eulerian
   energy spectrum. Such models have also been applied in particle-laden
   flows, due to their ability to enforce spatial organization of the fluid
   velocity field when simulating the trajectories of individual Lagrangian
   particles. A critical evaluation of KS is presented; in particular, we
   examine its ability to reproduce single-particle Lagrangian statistics.
   Also the ability of KS to reproduce the preferential concentration of
   inertial particles is examined. Some computational results are
   presented, in which particles are transported alternatively by (1)
   turbulence generated by direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and (2) KS. The effect of
   unsteadiness formulation in particular is examined. We find that even
   steady KS qualitatively reproduces the continuity effect, clustering of
   inertial particles, the elevated dispersion of inertial particles over
   fluid particles, and the intermittency of Lagrangian velocity signals,
   but generally not to the same extent as is seen in the DNS. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{Smart traffic scheduling can be used to reduce downlink roadside unit
   (RSU) energy use in green vehicular roadside infrastructure. In this
   paper, we consider the problem of downlink schedule generation when the
   RSU-to-vehicle radios use a variable bit rate (VBR) air interface. We
   first present offline scheduling formulations that provide lower bounds
   on the energy required to fulfill vehicle requests. An integer linear
   program is introduced that can be solved to find optimal offline VBR
   time slot schedules. We then prove that this problem is NP-complete by a
   reduction from the well-known Santa Claus problem. Two flow-graph-based
   models are then used to solve the minimum energy VBR scheduling problem.
   The first uses generalized flow (GF) graphs that represent time slots as
   individual graph nodes. The second uses time-expanded graphs (TEGs) that
   model the temporal evolution of the system. Both of these models can be
   used to compute lower bounds on energy performance and provide the basis
   for energy-efficient online schedulers. The first scheduler introduced,
   i.e., First-Come First-Serve (FCFS), is very simple and treats all
   vehicles equally and in the order of arrival. Since the time spent in
   energy-favorable locations decreases with higher vehicle speed, the
   second scheduler, i.e., Fastest First (FF), gives priority to faster
   moving vehicles. The greedy GF (G-GF) and greedy TEG (G-TEG) schedulers
   are then introduced, which are motivated by the two flow-graph-based
   models. The proposed algorithm performance is examined under different
   traffic scenarios, and they are found to perform well compared with the
   lower bound. Our results show that the less computationally intensive
   algorithms, i.e., FCFS and FF, can perform well under light load, but
   G-GF and G-TEG, while more complex, can provide near-optimal energy
   consumption and with reasonable demand dropping rates. The results also
   show that the G-GF and G-TEG algorithms are much more fair than the
   simpler algorithms in heavy-load situations.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The characterization of surface plasmon resonances supported by metallic
   nanostructures requires high spatial and energy resolution. In the past
   few years, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has emerged as a
   very powerful tool to accomplish this task. In this work, we demonstrate
   the power of this technique for probing and imaging resonances of
   metallic nanostructures by analyzing the plasmonic response of silver
   nanosquares of sizes ranging from 230 nm up to 1 mu m. Because of the
   relatively large size of these structures, we find that, despite their
   simple geometry, these systems can support a large variety of multipolar
   modes, which can only be detected and imaged thanks to the high spatial
   and energy resolution achieved by pushing EELS to its limits. The
   experimental results are supported by rigorous theoretical calculations
   that allow a detailed interpretation of the EELS measurements. In
   particular, we were able to map, with high level of detail, edge and
   high-order cavity modes. Furthermore, by calculating the scattering
   cross-section of these nanostructures, we confirm that most of the
   observed modes are dark and thus remain hidden in optical measurements,
   thus demonstrating the power of EELS as a unique tool for probing and
   imaging a large range and variety of plasmonic resonances of metallic
   nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels was synthesized using
   strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) between PEG chains
   terminated with either aza-dibenzocyclooctynes or azide functionalities.
   The gelation process was found to occur rapidly upon mixing the two
   components in aqueous solution without the need for external stimuli or
   catalysts, making the system a candidate for use as an injectable
   hydrogel. The mechanical and rheological properties of these hydrogels
   were found to be tunable by varying the polymer molecular weight and the
   number of cross-linking groups per chain. The gelation times of these
   hydrogels ranged from 10 to 60 s at room temperature. The mass-based
   swelling ratios varied from 45 to 76 at maximum swelling (relative to
   the dry state), while the weight percent of polymer in these hydrogels
   ranged from 1.31 to 2.05\%, demonstrating the variations in amount of
   polymer required to maintain the structural integrity of the gel. Each
   hydrogel degraded at a different rate in PBS at pH = 7.4, with
   degradation times ranging from 1 to 35 days. By changing the composition
   of the two starting components, it was found that the Young's modulus of
   each hydrogel could be varied from 1 to 18 kPa. Hydrogel incubation with
   bovine serum albumin showed minimal protein adsorption. Finally, a cell
   cytotoxicity study of the precursor polymers with 3T3 fibroblasts
   demonstrated that the azide- and strained alkyne-functionalized PEGs are
   noncytotoxic.}},

Abstract = {{By applying a simple and inexpensive thermal treatment, we synthesized
   supported gold-oxide nanostructures, which have potential applications
   to plasmonic devices and biosensors. The regrowth of nominally stable
   substrates under gold nanoparticles is associated with the appearance of
   preferential orientations of dewetted nano particles and the formation
   of atomically sharp interfacial monolayers. Steps present at the
   interfacial monolayer usually occur at defects including the
   intersection points of twin planes at the interface. They were related
   to the nucleation and immigration of the interfacial monolayers,
   prompting the substrate regrowth. Accordingly, we proposed the
   twin-assisted growth mechanism, which provides insight on the synthesis
   of gold-oxide nanostructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The active phase responsible for low-temperature CO oxidation in
   nanoparticulate CuO/CeO2 catalysts was identified as surface-substituted
   CuyCe1-yO2-x. Contrary to previous studies, our measurements on a
   library of well-defined CuO/CeO2 catalysts have proven that the CuO
   phase is a spectator species, whereas the surface-substituted
   CuyCe1-yO2-x phase is active for CO oxidation. Using in situ X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy, we found that the copper ions in CuyCe1-yO2-x
   remain at high oxidation states (Cu3+ and Cu2+) under oxygen rich
   catalytic conditions without any evidence for Cut. Artificial neural
   network potential Monte Carlo simulations suggest that Cu3+ and Cu2+
   preferentially segregate to the \{100\} surface of the CuyCe1-yO2-x
   nanoparticle, which is supported by aberration corrected electron
   microscopy measurements. These results pave the way for understanding,
   at the atomic level, the mechanisms and descriptors pertinent for CO
   oxidation on these materials and hence the rational design of
   next-generation catalysts.}},

Title = {{Impact of Connected Vehicle on Work Zone Network Safety through Dynamic
   Route Guidance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Despite enhanced safety strategies, in-vehicles technologies, and
   improvements in infrastructure, urban transportation networks are still
   accident-prone. Connected vehicle offers the possibility to exchange
   data with vehicles and infrastructure in an effort to improve safety.
   The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to evaluate
   the potential safety benefits of deploying a connected vehicle system on
   a traffic network in the presence of a work zone. The modeled connected
   vehicle system in the research reported in this paper uses
   vehicle-to-vehicle (VTV) communication to share information about work
   zone links and link travel times. Vehicles which receive work zone
   information will also modify their driving behavior by increasing
   awareness and decreasing aggressiveness. This paper also proposes a
   decaying average travel time dynamic route guidance algorithm which
   exhibits weighted information decay. Traffic microsimulation software is
   used to model the network and a C plugin is developed to implement
   connected vehicle in the simulation. The surrogate safety measure
   improved time to collision (TTC) is used to assess the safety of the
   network. Various market penetrations of connected vehicles were utilized
   along with three different behavior models to account for the
   uncertainty in driver response to connected vehicle information. The
   results show that network safety is strongly correlated with the
   behavior model used; conservative models yield conservative changes in
   network safety. The results also show that market penetrations of
   connected vehicles under 40\% contribute to a safer traffic network,
   while market penetrations above 40\% decrease network safety. The
   findings of the research reported in this paper indicate connected
   vehicle technology can have unintended consequences, as seen in
   decreased safety at high market penetrations, requiring researchers to
   develop additional applications to mitigate these effects. (C) 2015

Title = {{Low False Alarm Rate Model for Unsafe-Proximity Detection in
   Construction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The research reported in this paper proposes and develops an
   unsafe-proximity detection model focused on decreasing false alarms. By
   considering three types of entity attributes {[}i.e.,(1)position,
   (2)heading/moving direction, and (3)speed], more accurate
   unsafe-proximity identifications with reduced false alarms can be
   achieved. The proposed and developed model works via two modules, as
   follows: (1)state tracking module, and (2)safety rules module. The state
   tracking module collects construction entities' states (position,
   heading, and speed) in real time. The collected states information is
   analyzed in the safety rules module for unsafe-proximity
   identifications. Five common situations on construction jobsites are
   extracted and studied for the development of the safety rules, as
   follows: (1)static equipment and moving worker, (2)moving equipment and
   moving worker, (3)moving equipment and static worker, (4)two pieces of
   moving equipment, and (5)moving equipment and static equipment. The
   unsafe area around equipment is divided into alert and warning areas
   which are quantified using forklift as sample equipment. The
   localization accuracy of the state tracking module and the functional
   effectiveness of the safety rules module are evaluated, through
   simulation and a field experiment. Twelve scenarios and 13 subscenarios
   were designed and incorporated, in the simulation and the field
   experiment, respectively. The extended Kalman filter combined with the
   nearest-neighbor method was used in the simulation and a global
   positioning system (GPS)-aided inertial navigation system sensor was
   used in the field experiment as the state tracking module. The results
   suggest that the magnitude of localization accuracy of the extended
   Kalman filter combined with the nearest-neighbor method and the adopted
   sensor both are less than 0.7m. Such an accuracy level is acceptable for
   construction applications. Moreover, the developed safety rules have a
   strong capability in avoiding false alarms. In some scenarios the
   developed model can avoid one false alarm for each scan. The research
   reported in this paper also demonstrates the applicability and
   feasibility of implementing the model for real applications. The
   developed model has great promise to enhance construction safety and
   mobility by timely avoiding collisions, while reducing false alarms and
   interruptions to work.}},

Abstract = {{A waste management model associated with public-private partnerships
   (WMMPPP) was formulated and applied to the City of Hamilton, Ontario,
   Canada. The WMMPPP has the advantages of considering a combination of
   public and private services so that trade-offs between system costs and
   service quality can be addressed. Meanwhile, uncertain information
   presented as interval numbers can be effectively communicated into the
   optimization processes such that feasible decision alternatives can be
   made through the interpretation and analysis of the interval solutions
   according to projected applicable system conditions. The model minimizes
   the inexact costs (direct costs, indirect costs, and penalties) under
   three waste-service-delivery scenarios: (1)100\% in-house public
   services, (2)a combination of public and private services, and (3)100\%
   private services. These three scenarios covered most types of the
   municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems in North American
   municipalities. The results indicated that reasonable solutions were
   generated through the WMMPPP under different scenarios. Most
   importantly, the risk of total system costs would increase with the
   decrease of service quality due to privatization in Hamilton. This study
   is potentially useful for MSW decision-makers in most municipalities of
   North American for long-term planning of regional waste management
   activities and for formulating related local policies/regulations
   regarding privatizing the service delivery in waste management. It is
   recommended that more-complex and hybrid inexact programming models
   based on the WMMPPP be further developed. (C) 2015 American Society of

   The most robust assay involved an automated centrifugation-decantation
   step to remove latex aggregates before absorbance measurements,
   eliminating aggregate interference with optical measurements made
   through the base of the multiwell plates. For smaller nanoparticles
   (diameter <150 nm), the centrifugation-decantation step was not required

Abstract = {{In conventional cognitive radio, the primary network usually remains
   unchanged. In some cases, however, the primary network operator may wish
   to accommodate secondary user access. In this paper, we assess the
   secondary user VoIP capacity when primary basestation scheduling is
   designed to be secondary network friendly. Friendliness is measured by
   the number of connections that can be supported subject to typical
   quality of service constraints in the presence of delay tolerant primary
   traffic. An offline scheduler is first derived that maximizes
   friendliness using an integer linear program formulation. We show that
   this schedule can be found using a minimum cost flow graph construction
   in time complexity that is polynomial in the number of time slots. Two
   online scheduling algorithms are then compared that achieve various
   levels of friendliness. The first algorithm operates by having the
   primary network temporally shape its residual capacity subject to
   satisfying its own packet deadline constraints. The second algorithm
   assumes virtual secondary calls and applies scheduling to both primary
   traffic and virtual secondary traffic. Results are presented for a
   variety of parameters that show the degree to which friendly scheduling
   can improve secondary user VoIP capacity compared to non-friendly
   primary scheduling.}},

Title = {{Coupled 3D neutron kinetics and thermalhydraulic characteristics of the
   Canadian supercritical water reactor}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{298}},
Pages = {{78-89}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Canadian Supercritical Water-cooled Reactor concept, as an evolution
   of the CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor, includes both pressure
   tubes and a low temperature heavy water moderator. The current Pressure
   Tube type SCWR (PT-SCWR) concept features 64-element fuel assemblies
   placed within High Efficiency Re-entrant Channels (HERCs) that connect
   to core inlet and outlet plena. Among current SCWR concepts the PT-SCWR
   is unique in that the HERC separates multiple coolant and moderator
   regions, giving rise to coupled neutronic-thermalhydraulic feedbacks
   beyond those present in CANDU or contemporary Light Water Reactors. The
   objective of this work was thus to model the coupled neutronic-thermal
   hydraulic properties of the PT-SCWR to establish the impact of these
   multiple regions on the core's transient behavior. To that end, the
   features of the PT-SCWR were first modeled with the neutron transport
   code DRAGON to create a database of homogenized and condensed cross
   sections and thermalhydraulic feedback coefficients. These were used as
   input to a core-level neutron diffusion model created with the code
   DONJON. The behavior of the primary heat transport system was modeled
   with the thermalhydraulic system code CATHENA. A procedure was developed
   to couple the outputs of DONJON and CATHENA, facilitating
   three-dimensional spatial neutron kinetics and coupled thermalhydraulic
   analysis of the PT-SCWR core. Several postulated transients were
   initiated within the coupled model by changing the core inlet and outlet
   boundary conditions. Decreasing coolant density around the fuel was
   demonstrated to produce positive power excursions (i.e., the coolant
   void reactivity around the fuel was positive), but such power transients
   were found to be inherently self-terminating as low density coolant
   inevitably reaches other parts of the HERC geometry (where the void
   reactivity is highly negative). Nevertheless, the observed power
   excursions potentially demonstrate the need for fast-acting shutdown
   system intervention, similar to CANDU designs. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Laryngoscope blades used to intubate newborn babies are relatively bulky
   and frequently exert high pressure on the upper jaw. We tested a
   prototype neonatal offset-blade laryngoscope (NOBL) developed to
   overcome these limitations. Our aims were to compare the pressure on the
   upper jaw exerted by a size 0 Miller laryngoscope and the NOBL on a
   neonatal manikin, as well as the time taken to intubate the trachea and
   the area of view of the larynx. Twenty healthcare professionals with
   more than five years of experience in neonatal intensive care took part;
   the findings were assessed using pressure-sensitive film and
   photographs. High-pressure indentation occurred in 17 (85\%) attempts
   using the Miller versus 1 (5\%) using the NOBL (p = 0.0001). The median
   (IQR {[}range]) pressure exerted with the Miller laryngoscope was 455
   (350-526 {[}75-650]) kPa vs 80 (0-133 {[}0-195]) kPa with the NOBL (p <
   0.0001). The area of pressure exerted with the Miller laryngoscope was
   68 (32-82 {[}0-110]) mm(2) vs 8 (0-23 {[}0-40]) mm(2) with the NOBL (p <
   0.0001). The time to intubate was 8.3 (7.3-10.1{[}4-19]) s for the
   Miller and 8.0 (5.6-9.6 {[}4-13.5]) s for the NOBL (p < 0.0001). The
   area of view blocked by the Miller laryngoscope was 38\% of the oral
   orifice versus 12\% with the NOBL. We conclude that the NOBL
   significantly reduced undesired pressure on the upper jaw during
   tracheal intubation and improved the view of the larynx compared with a
   conventional laryngoscope.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Stable unbonded fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators (SU-FREIs)
   exhibit a characteristic horizontal softening and stiffening response,
   similar to other adaptive devices such as the triple friction pendulum
   and sliding systems with variable curvature. The transition between the
   softening and stiffening occurs at a displacement corresponding to a
   unique deformation known as full rollover. In this paper, the full
   rollover displacement of SU-FREIs is altered by using modified support
   geometry (MSG), a geometric modification of the upper and lower supports
   applied to tailor the hysteresis loops of the isolator. Experimental
   results are used to calibrate a numerical model of a base-isolated
   structure. The model demonstrates that the stiffening regime provides
   minimal restraint against displacements during events that meet or
   exceed the maximum considered earthquake. A parametric study revealed
   that the level of stiffening required to restrain displacements during
   large events is significant. This increase in stiffness is reflected in
   an increase in the response of the structure and light nonstructural
   components. Full rollover and MSG is considered advantageous to maintain
   horizontal stability and provide control over the stiffening of
   SU-FREIs. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Seasonal storage of solar thermal energy for space heating of multiple
   dwellings in cold climates can be accomplished through the use of
   borehole fields in conjunction with large buffer tanks. The buffer tank
   is used to account for the difference between the time over which solar
   energy can be collected and the time required to deposit the collected
   energy into the borehole field. There is motivation to bury the tanks in
   order to save space on ground level, as well as to improve the overall
   efficiency of the system by reducing heat losses from the tank. The
   current paper uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to explore the
   impact of a buried tank on the performance of a borehole thermal energy
   storage (BTES), as well as the thermal interactions between the tank and
   boreholes.
   The long-term performance was assessed in detail by simulating a 20-year
   period. The first 5 years of performance were then compared to results
   for a series of other cases including: a typical BTES layout, a tank
   with the bottom wall insulated as well as tanks with varying aspect
   ratios. It was found that the presence of the tank did not significantly
   reduce the BTES performance. Moreover, performance was relatively
   insensitive to the tank aspect ratio. Insulating the bottom of the tank
   also had negligible difference. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{For vehicle electrification, one of the biggest issues for lithium ion
   batteries is cycle life. Within this context, the mechanisms at the
   source of capacity degradation during cycling are not yet to be fully
   understood. In this work, we use state-of-the-art FIB-SEM serial
   sectioning and imaging techniques to determine the effect of cycling on
   lithium-ion battery cathodes. The three-dimensional (3D) micro
   structural study was performed on both pristine and cycled
   LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (NMC) and Li(L-i(0.2)Ni(0.13)Mn(0.54)Co(0.13))O-2
   (HE-NMC) cathodes. The spatial distribution of active material,
   carbon-doped binder and pore spaces were successfully reconstructed by
   appropriate image processing. Comparisons of NMC and HE-NMC cathodes
   after different number of cycles showed only minor increases in the
   number of smaller active particles, possibly negligible, considering the
   intrinsic microstructure variation within the cathodes. However, the
   connectivity between carbon-doped binder additives and active particles
   in NMC and HE-NMC cathodes, assessed using a ``neighbor counting{''}
   method, showed an appreciable decrease after cycling which indicates a
   detachment of carbon-doped binder from active particles. This
   significant cycling-induced detachment effect between the two phases
   (e.g., similar to 22\% for HE-NMC) could indicate a loss in electrical
   connectivity, which may partially explain the capacity fade in the
   cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The influence of polymer binders on the UV response of organic thin-film
   phototransistors (OTF-PTs) is reported. The active channel of the
   OTF-PTs was fabricated by blending a UV responsive
   2,7-dipenty-Wbenzothieno {[}2,3-b]{[}1]benzothiophene (C5-BTBT) as small
   molecule semiconductor and a branched unsaturated polyester (B-upe) as
   dielectric binder (ratio 1:1). To understand the influence of the
   polymer composition on the photoelectrical properties and UV response of
   C5-BTBT, control blends were prepared using common dielectric polymers,
   namely, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), polycarbonate (PC), and polystyrene
   (PS), for comparison. Thin-film morphology and nanostructure of the
   C5-BTBT/polymer blends were investigated by means of optical and atomic
   force microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction, respectively. Electrical
   and photoelectrical characteristics of the studied OTF-PTs were
   evaluated in the dark and under UV illumination with a constant light
   intensity (P = 3 mW cm(-2), lambda = 365 nm), respectively, using two-
   and three-terminal I-V measurements. Results revealed that the purposely
   chosen B-upe polymer binder strongly affected the UV response of
   OTF-PTs. A photocurrent increase of more than 5 orders of magnitude in
   the subthreshold region was observed with a responsivity as high as 9.7
   AW(-1), at V-G = 0 V. The photocurrent increase and dramatic shift of
   V-Th,V-average (similar to 86 V) were justified by the high number of
   photogenerated charge carriers upon the high trap density in bulk 8.0 X
   10(12) cm(-2) eV(-1) generated by highly dispersed C5-BTBT in B-upe
   binder. Compared with other devices, the B-upe OTF-PTs had the fastest
   UV response times (tau(r1)/tau(r2) = 0.5/6.0) reaching the highest
   saturated photocurrent (>10(6)), at V-G = -5 V and V-SD = -60 V. The
   enhanced UV sensing properties of B-upe based OTF-PTs were attributed to
   a self-induced thin-film morphology. The enlarged interface facilitated
   the electron withdrawing/donating functional groups in the polymer
   chains in influencing the photocharge separation, trapping and
   recombination.}},

Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{446-461}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic study of fuel cell gas turbine (SOFC/GT)
   hybrid systems, focusing on the response to a drastic transient in anode
   fuel composition for constant turbine speed operations. This work is
   motivated by the potential of fuel cells for fuel flexibility, which
   could extend the opportunities for sustainability and profitability in
   energy conversion systems. A combination of hardware and numerical
   models in a hybrid simulator is used to investigate the transient
   trajectories of fuel cell process variables as well as the consequent
   impacts of fuel cell thermal effluent on the integrated gas turbine
   engine. The conversion of thermal energy stored in the fuel cell stack
   to chemical energy during the reforming at the beginning of the cell
   resulted in a 17\% increase in thermal effluent from the fuel cell to
   the turbine in the first few seconds of the transient. Fuel cell solid
   temperature gradients increased by 39\% at 250 s from the initiation of
   the transient. The distributed dynamic performance of the fuel cell in
   terms of the fuel composition gradient, thermal, and electrochemical
   performance across the fuel cell length was carefully characterized,
   considering their interactions and their impacts on the total system
   performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of local density fluctuations on phonon
   propagation in a hydrogen bonded structure, we studied the thermal
   conductivity kappa of the crystal, liquid, and glassy states of pure
   glycerol as a function of the temperature, T, and the pressure, p. We
   find that the following: (i) K-crystal is 3.6-times the kappa(liquid)
   value at 140 K at 0.1 MPa and 2.2-times at 290 K, and it varies with T
   according to 138 x T-0.95; (ii) the ratio kappa(liquid)
   (P)/kappa(liquid) (0.1 MPa) is 1.45 GPa(-1) at 280 K, which,
   unexpectedly, is about the same as kappa(crystal) (p)/kappa(crystal)
   (0.1 MPa) of 1.42 GPa(-1) at 298 K; (iii) kappa(glass) is relatively
   insensitive to T but sensitive to the applied p (1.38 GPa(-1) at 150 K);
   (iv) kappa(glass)-T plots show an enhanced, pressure-dependent peak-like
   feature, which is due to the glass to liquid transition on heating; (v)
   continuous heating cold-crystallizes ultraviscous glycerol under
   pressure, at a higher T when p is high; and (vi) glycerol formed by
   cooling at a high p and then measured at a low p has a significantly
   higher kappa than the glass formed by cooling at a low p. On heating at
   a fixed low p, its kappa decreases before its glass-liquid transition
   range at that p is reached. We attribute this effect to thermally
   assisted loss of the configurational and vibrational instabilities of a
   glass formed at high p and recovered at low p, which is different from
   the usual glass-aging effect. While the heat capacity, entropy, and
   volume of glycerol crystal are less than those for its glass and liquid,
   kappa(crystal) of glycerol, like its elastic modulus and refractive
   index, is higher. We discuss these findings in terms of the role of
   fluctuations in local density and structure, and the relations between K
   and the thermodynamic quantities. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We report the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
   solution copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) with a cleavable
   divinyl comonomer, bis(2-methacryloyl)oxyethyl disulfide (BMAODS).
   2-Cyanb-2-propyldodecyl trithiocarbonate was used as a RAFT chain
   transfer agent and 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) as an initiator.
   The selective cleavage of BMAODS disulfide bonds was used to collect
   primary chains for the determination of the branching density (BD). The
   effects of initial monomer concentration, vinyl/divinyl ratio, and
   primary chain length on the branching and cyclization reactions were
   thoroughly investigated. It was found that more than 50\% pendent double
   bonds from BMAODS were consumed in cyclization rather than in branching.
   The BD increased linearly with the conversion up to approximately 60\%
   conversion. The monomer concentration was found to be the most efficient
   parameter in promoting branching. Increasing divinyl monomer ratio and
   primary chain length favored cyclization over branching. The work
   provides experimental evidence to support the random branching mechanism
   in RAFT copolymerization of vinyl and divinyl monomers.}},

Abstract = {{Bias estimation or sensor registration is an essential step in ensuring
   the accuracy of global tracks in multisensor-multitarget tracking. Most
   previously proposed algorithms for bias estimation rely on local
   measurements in centralized systems or tracks in distributed systems
   along with additional information such as covariances, filter gains, or
   targets of opportunity. In addition, it is generally assumed that such
   data are made available to the fusion center at every sampling time. In
   practical distributed multisensor-tracking systems, where each platform
   sends local tracks to the fusion center, only state estimates and,
   perhaps, their covariances are sent to the fusion center at
   nonconsecutive sampling instants or scans. That is, not all the
   information required for exact bias estimation at the fusion center is
   available in practical distributed-tracking systems. In this paper, a
   new algorithm that is capable of accurately estimating the biases even
   in the absence of filter gain information from local platforms is
   proposed for distributed-tracking systems with intermittent track
   transmission. Through the calculation of the posterior Cramer-Rao lower
   bound and various simulation results, it is shown that the performance
   of the new algorithm, which uses the tracklet idea and does not require
   track transmission at every sampling time or exchange of filter gains,
   can approach the performance of the exact bias estimation algorithm that
   requires local filter gains.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lung cancer results in the highest number of cancer deaths
   worldwide. The segmentation of lung nodules is an important task in
   computer systems to help physicians differentiate malignant lesions from
   benign lesions. However, it has already been observed that this may be a
   difficult task, especially when nodules are connected to an anatomical
   structure.
   Methods: This paper proposes a method to estimate the background of the
   nodule area and how this estimation is used to facilitate the
   segmentation task.
   Results: Our experiments indicate more than 99\% of accuracy with less
   than 1\% of false positive rate (FPR).
   Conclusions: The proposed methods achieved better results than a
   state-of-the-art approach, indicating potential to be used in medical
   image processing systems.}},

Title = {{H-1-MR imaging of the lungs at 3.0 T}},
Journal = {{QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: One disadvantage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the
   inability to adequately image the lungs. Recent advances in
   hyperpolarized gas technology {[}e.g., helium-3 (He-3) and xenon-129
   (Xe-129)] have changed this. However, the required technology is
   expensive and often needing extra physics or engineering staff. Hence
   there is considerable interest in developing H-1 (proton)-based MRI
   approaches that can be readily implemented on standard clinical systems.
   Thus, the purpose of this work was to compare a newly developed free
   breathing proton-based MR lung imaging method to that of a standard
   gadolinium (Gd) based perfusion approach.
   Methods: Healthy volunteers {[}10] were scanned using a 3-T MRI with 8
   parallel receivers, and a cardiac gated fast spin echo (FSE) sequence.
   Acquisition was cardiac triggered, with different time delays
   incremented to cover the entire cardiac cycle. Image k-space was filled
   rectilinearly. But to reduce motion artefacts k-space was
   retrospectively sorted using the minimal variance algorithm (MVA), based
   on physiologic data recorded from both the respiratory bellows and
   electrocardiogram (ECG). Resorted and reconstructed FSE images were
   compared to contrast enhanced lung images, obtained following
   intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA.
   Results: Biphasic variation in FSE lung signal intensity was observed
   across the cardiac cycle with a maximal signal change following rapid
   cardiac ejection (between S and T waves), and following rapid
   isovolumetric relaxation. A difference image between systolic and
   diastolic states in the cardiac cycle resulted in images with improved
   lung contrast to noise ratio (CNR). FSE image intensity was uniform over
   lung parenchyma while Gd-based enhancement of spoiled gradient recalled
   echo (SPGR) images showed gravitational dependence.
   Conclusions: Here we show how H-1-MR images of lung can be obtained
   during free breathing. The image contrast obtained during this approach
   is likely the result of flow and oxygen modulation during the cardiac
   cycle. This free breathing method provides lung images comparable to
   those obtained using Gd-enhancement. Besides having the advantage of
   free breathing, this approach doesn't require any Gd-contrast or suffer
   from methodological problems associated with perfusion (e.g., poor bolus
   timing). However, as gravitational differences typically observed in
   lung perfusion are not visible with this method it is not providing
   exclusive microvascular perfusion information.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report hybrid blue organic light emitting diodes
   (OLEDs) with triple emitting layers (EMLs) composed of fluorescent and
   phosphorescent emitters along with interlayers. The electrical and
   optical properties of hybrid blue OLEDs are investigated as a function
   of the various combinations of EML configurations. In addition, the
   electroluminescent (EL) spectra of the devices are resolved into their
   base components to understand the origin of blue emission by electronic
   transitions of excitons. It was observed that the current density and
   the position of the recombination zone are dependent on the
   configuration of the p and n-type host materials due to the fact that
   the properties of the host materials affect electron and hole mobility.
   Also, the phosphorescent dominant emission triggers drastic roll off in
   efficiency, which was reduced when the fluorescent emitter is involved
   with the emission. Adding an interlayer between the fluorescent and
   phosphorescent EMLs prevented triplet exciton quenching and improved
   overall efficiency.}},

   Performance: The Case of PEDOT:PSS}},

Abstract = {{Variability of indium tin oxide properties can be a significant concern
   for wide-scale manufacturing of organic devices. Many treatments and
   interlayers have been proposed to optimize the electrode surface for
   high device performance. One of the proposed mechanisms is smoothing of
   the anode to achieve better interfacial contact with the active layers.
   To examine the impact of substrate roughness on the structure,
   morphology, stability and device performance of organic diodes, ITO
   substrates of varying roughness, but similar chemical and electronic
   properties, were tested, with and without a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
   interlayer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   electrical measurements, indicate that ITO substrate roughness
   variations caused dramatic differences in film ordering, morphology,
   stability and device performance. Counter-intuitively, rougher surfaces,
   with reduced film ordering and smaller crystalline domains, lead to
   better device performance. For highly anisotropic molecules, which can
   crystallize in both edge-on (long axis perpendicular to the substrate)
   or face-on (long axis parallel to the substrate) configurations such as
   poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) or diindenoperylene (DIP), high substrate
   roughness encourages better contact formation. Although the introduction
   of a PEDOT:PSS interlayer does not uniformly lead to smoother surfaces,
   it does equalize the behaviour of different ITO substrates. A slight
   decrease in the device performance with PEDOT:PSS for the rough ITO
   substrates suggests that different strategies that preserve good contact
   formation can be used to replace this conventional interlayer.}},

Abstract = {{A wealth of knowledge about different types of neural responses to
   electrical stimulation has been developed over the past 100 years.
   However, the exact forms of neural response properties can vary across
   different types of neurons. In this review, we survey four
   stimulus-response phenomena that in recent years are thought to be
   relevant for cochlear implant stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons
   (SGNs): refractoriness, facilitation, accommodation, and spike rate
   adaptation. Of these four, refractoriness is the most widely known, and
   many perceptual and physiological studies interpret their data in terms
   of refractoriness without incorporating facilitation, accommodation, or
   spike rate adaptation. In reality, several or all of these behaviors are
   likely involved in shaping neural responses, particularly at higher
   stimulation rates. A better understanding of the individual and combined
   effects of these phenomena could assist in developing improved cochlear
   implant stimulation strategies. We review the published physiological
   data for electrical stimulation of SGNs that explores these four
   different phenomena, as well as some of the recent studies that might
   reveal the biophysical bases of these stimulus-response phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of the projection operator in tomographic imaging is of
   critical importance especially when working with algebraic methods of
   image reconstruction. This paper proposes a distance-driven projection
   method which is targeted to single-pinhole single-photon emission
   computed tomograghy (SPECT) imaging since it accounts for the finite
   size of the pinhole, and the possible tilting of the detector surface in
   addition to other collimator-specific factors such as geometric
   sensitivity. The accuracy and execution time of the proposed method is
   evaluated by comparing to a ray-driven approach where the pinhole is
   sub-sampled with various sampling schemes. A point-source phantom whose
   projections were generated using OpenGATE was first used to compare the
   resolution of reconstructed images with each method using the full width
   at half maximum (FWHM). Furthermore, a high-activity Mini Deluxe Phantom
   (Data Spectrum Corp., Durham, NC, USA) SPECT resolution phantom was
   scanned using a Gamma Medica X-SPECT system and the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) and structural similarity of reconstructed images was
   compared at various projection counts. Based on the reconstructed
   point-source phantom, the proposed distance-driven approach results in a
   lower FWHM than the ray-driven approach even when using a smaller
   detector resolution. Furthermore, based on the Mini Deluxe Phantom, it
   is shown that the distance-driven approach has consistently higher SNR
   and structural similarity compared to the ray-driven approach as the
   counts in measured projections deteriorates.}},

Pages = {{43-52}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the influences of
   biological processes on the erosion behaviour of organic-rich sanitary
   sewer sediments. The results show that biological activities can make
   sediments expand and their bulk densities decrease. The experimental
   results also illustrate that sewer sediment erosion is a very complex
   process influenced by gravitational consolidation and biostabilisation.
   Aerobic biological processes can weaken a sediment bed and affect the
   erosion patterns for sediments rich in volatile solids, whereas the same
   processes can increase the resistance to erosion of sediments with lower
   volatile solid contents. Under anaerobic conditions, two sediment layers
   with different physical properties and erosion-resistance capabilities
   would form as a result of biological activities. Under low temperature
   and aerobic conditions, however, gravitational consolidation was
   identified as the major factor controlling the erosion behaviour of
   sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Among the different synthesis approaches to colloidal nanocrystals, a
   recently developed toolkit is represented by cation exchange reactions,
   where the use of template nanocrystals gives access to materials that
   would be hardly attainable via direct synthesis. Besides, postsynthetic
   treatments, such as thermally activated solid-state reactions, represent
   a further flourishing route to promote finely controlled cation
   exchange. Here, we report that, upon in situ heating in a transmission
   electron microscope, Cu2Se or Cu nanocrystals deposited on an amorphous
   solid substrate undergo partial loss of Cu atoms, which are then engaged
   in local cation exchange reactions with Cu ``acceptor{''} phases
   represented by rod- and wire-shaped CdSe nanocrystals. This thermal
   treatment slowly transforms the initial CdSe nanocrystals into Cu2-xSe
   nanocrystals, through the complete sublimation of Cd and the partial
   sublimation of Se atoms. Both Cu ``donor{''} and ``acceptor{''}
   particles were not always in direct contact with each other; hence, the
   gradual transfer of Cu species from Cu2Se or metallic Cu to CdSe
   nanocrystals was mediated by the substrate and depended on the distance
   between the donor and acceptor nanostructures. Differently from what
   happens in the comparably faster cation exchange reactions performed in
   liquid solution, this study shows that slow cation exchange reactions
   can be performed at the solid state and helps to shed light on the
   intermediate steps involved in such reactions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a bivariate hydrologic risk framework is proposed through
   coupling Gaussian mixtures into copulas, leading to a coupled GMM-copula
   method. In the coupled GMM-Copula method, the marginal distributions of
   flood peak, volume and duration are quantified through Gaussian mixture
   models and the joint probability distributions of flood peak-volume,
   peak-duration and volume-duration are established through copulas. The
   bivariate hydrologic risk is then derived based on the joint return
   period of flood variable pairs. The proposed method is applied to the
   risk analysis for the Yichang station on the main stream of the Yangtze
   River, China. The results indicate that (i) the bivariate risk for flood
   peak-volume would keep constant for the flood volume less than 1.0 x
   10(5) m(3)/s day, but present a significant decreasing trend for the
   flood volume larger than 1.7 x 10(5) m(3)/s day; and (ii) the bivariate
   risk for flood peak-duration would not change significantly for the
   flood duration less than S days, and then decrease significantly as
   duration value become larger. The probability density functions (pdfs)
   of the flood volume and duration conditional on flood peak can also be
   generated through the fitted copulas. The results indicate that the
   conditional pdfs of flood volume and duration follow bimodal
   distributions, with the occurrence frequency of the first vertex
   decreasing and the latter one increasing as the increase of flood peak.
   The obtained conclusions from the bivariate hydrologic analysis can
   provide decision support for flood control and mitigation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An Enhanced-Internet network that provides ultra-low-latency
   guaranteed-rate (GR) communications for Cloud Services is proposed. The
   network supports two traffic classes, the Smooth and Best-Effort
   classes. Smooth traffic flows receive low-jitter GR service over
   virtual-circuit-switched (VCS) connections with negligible buffering and
   queueing delays, up to 100\% link utilizations, deterministic end-to-end
   quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and improved energy efficiency.
   End-to-end delays are effectively reduced to the fiber ``time of
   flight.{''} A new router scheduling problem called the Bounded
   Normalized-Jitter integer-programming problem is formulated. A fast
   polynomial-time approximate solution is presented, allowing TDM-based
   router schedules to be computed in microseconds. We establish that all
   admissible traffic demands in any packet-switched network can be
   simultaneously satisfied with GR-VCS connections, with minimal
   buffering. Each router can use two periodic TDM-based schedules to
   support GR-VCS connections, which are updated automatically when the
   router's traffic rate matrix changes. The design of a Silicon-Photonics
   all-optical packet switch with minimal buffering is presented. The
   Enhanced-Internet can: 1) reduce router buffer requirements by factors
   of; 2) increase the Internet's aggregate capacity; 3) lower the
   Internet's capital and operating costs; and 4) lower greenhouse gas
   emissions through improved energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the line-of-sight characteristics in indoor visible light
   communication (VLC) systems, different geometrical locations of
   transmitters and receivers provide distinct channel correlations, thus
   bringing various impacts on the conventional multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. In this letter, by taking full
   advantage of the channel state information (CSI) available at both the
   transmitter and the receiver, we present an optimal constellation for
   the 2 x 2 MIMO-VLC system, where the signal vectors are selected to
   maximize the minimum Euclidean distance under a total optical power
   constraint. Simulation results verify both the accuracy and the validity
   of our analytical derivation, and show its significant error performance
   gains over repetition coding (RC) and space shift keying (SSK) for
   mobile receivers, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Smart scheduling can be used to reduce infrastructure-to-vehicle energy
   costs in delay-tolerant vehicular networks. In this paper, we show that,
   by combining this with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) forwarding, downlink
   (DL) traffic schedules can be generated, whose energy costs are lower
   than that in the single-hop case. This is accomplished by having the
   roadside units (RSUs) dynamically forward packets through vehicles,
   which are in energy-favorable locations. This paper considers both
   constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) air-interface
   options. We first derive offline schedulers for the DL RSU energy usage
   when V2V forwarding is added to RSU-to-vehicle communication. Both
   in-channel and off-channel forwarding cases are considered. The CBR and
   VBR cases are obtained using integer linear programming (ILP) and
   time-expanded graph (TEG) formulations, respectively. These schedulers
   provide lower bounds on energy performance and are used for comparisons
   with a variety of proposed online scheduling algorithms. The first
   algorithm is based on a greedy local optimization (GLOA). A version of
   this algorithm, which uses a minimum-cost flow graph (MCFG) scheduler,
   is also introduced. A more sophisticated algorithm is then proposed,
   which is based on a finite-window group optimization (FWGO). Results
   from various experiments show that the proposed algorithms can generate
   traffic schedules with much improved DL energy requirements compared
   with the case where V2V packet forwarding is not used. The performance
   improvements are particularly strong when under heavy loading conditions
   and when the variation in vehicle communication requirements or vehicle
   speed is high. Results that compare the proposed algorithms with
   conventional nonenergy-aware schedulers are also presented.}},

Journal = {{ACS MACRO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{185-189}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effect of tannic acid (TA) and water-soluble cellulose derivatives
   on the properties of Pickering emulsions stabilized by cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNCs) was investigated. The potential to both fully dry
   CNC-stabilized emulsions and to redisperse the dried emulsions in water
   is demonstrated. When CNCs are mixed with excess adsorbing polymer,
   either methyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose, followed by
   emulsification with corn oil, oil-in-water emulsions can be transformed
   without oil leakage into solid dry emulsions via freeze-drying. However,
   these dry emulsions exhibit droplet coalescence within the solid matrix
   and thus cannot be redispersed. Addition of TA (after emulsification)
   imparts dispersibility to the dried emulsions due to complexation
   between the cellulose derivatives and TA which condenses the ``shell{''}
   around the oil droplets. When dried emulsions with TA are placed in
   water, the emulsion droplets redisperse readily without the need for
   high energy mixing, and minimal change in emulsion droplet size is
   observed by Mastersizer and confocal microscopy. Therefore, the simple
   addition of two sustainable components to CNC Pickering emulsions (i.e.,
   TA and methyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose) has led to the first
   dried and redispersible CNC-based emulsions with oil content as high as
   94 wt \%. These processing abilities will likely extend the use of these
   surfactant-free, ``green{''}, and potentially edible emulsions to new
   food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of a simple and effective method to integrate vascular network
   with engineered scaffolds and tissue constructs remains one of the
   biggest challenges in true 3D tissue engineering. Here, we detail the
   use of a commercially available, low-cost, open-source 3D printer
   modified with a microfluidic print-head in order to develop a method for
   the generation of instantly perfusable vascular network integrated with
   gel scaffolds seeded with cells. The print-head features an integrated
   coaxial nozzle that allows the fabrication of hollow,
   calcium-polymerized alginate tubes that can be easily patterned using 3D
   printing techniques. The diameter of the hollow channel can be precisely
   controlled and varied between 500 mu m - 2 mm by changing applied flow
   rates or print-head speed. These channels are integrated into gel layers
   with a thickness of 800 mu m - 2.5 mm. The structural rigidity of these
   constructs allows the fabrication of multi-layered structures without
   causing the collapse of hollow channels in lower layers. The 3D printing
   method was fully characterized at a range of operating speeds (0-40
   m/min) and corresponding flow rates (1-30 mL/min) were identified to
   produce precise definition. This microfluidic design also allows the
   incorporation of a wide range of scaffold materials as well as
   biological constituents such as cells, growth factors, and ECM material.
   Media perfusion of the channels causes a significant viability increase
   in the bulk of cell-laden structures over the long-term. With this
   setup, gel constructs with embedded arrays of hollow channels can be
   created and used as a potential substitute for blood vessel networks.}},

   as a by-product. Our sensitivity technique is illustrated through 1-D,
   2-D, and 3-D electromagnetic examples involving both dispersive and

Abstract = {{Despite the significant improvement of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cell catalyst activities, a cost-effective and stable membrane electrode
   assembly is still lacking, which greatly inhibits the commercialization
   of this efficient and environmental friendly technology in stationary
   and transportation applications. The main reason is that the engineering
   of different components of an electrode, such as catalytically active
   metals, electron transport and reactant diffusion paths in a compatible
   way is very challenging. Here we show the design and preparation of a
   monolithic fuel cell electrode with a compatible wire on wire structure
   that mimics the configuration of a pine tree. We developed a procedure
   to make a flexible carbon thin film composed of porous nanofibers with a
   thickness of similar to 100 nm and centimeter scale lengths. Platinum
   nanowires (ca. 3 nm diameter) were deposited on these microscale carbon
   nanofiber films, resulting in a hierarchical structure. The platinum
   nanowires were then decorated with a porous bismuth coating to modulate
   the atomic structure and induce catalytic activity toward formic acid
   electrooxidation. The end result is a monolithic structure used as a
   fuel cell electrode that combines microscale diffusive pathways and
   nanoscale catalyst structures. Prepared by a process that is readily
   scalable, this design strategy offers a new way to tailor catalytic
   functions at a system level. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{While injectable hydrogels have several advantages in the context of
   biomedical use, their generally weak mechanical properties often limit
   their applications. Herein, we describe in situ-gelling nanocomposite
   hydrogels based on poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) and
   rigid rod-like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) that can overcome this
   challenge. By physically incorporating CNCs into hydrazone cross-linked
   POEGMA hydrogels, macroscopic properties including gelation rate,
   swelling kinetics, mechanical properties, and hydrogel stability can be
   readily tailored. Strong adsorption of aldehyde- and hydrazide-modified
   POEGMA precursor polymers onto the surface of CNCs promotes uniform
   dispersion of CNCs within the hydrogel, imparts physical cross-links
   throughout the network, and significantly improves mechanical strength
   overall, as demonstrated by quartz crystal microbalance gravimetry and
   rheometry. When POEGMA hydrogels containing mixtures of long and short
   ethylene oxide side chain precursor polymers were prepared, transmission
   electron microscopy reveals that phase segregation occurs with CNCs
   hypothesized to preferentially locate within the stronger adsorbing
   short side chain polymer domains. Incorporating as little as 5 wt \%
   CNCs results in dramatic enhancements in mechanical properties (up to
   35-fold increases in storage modulus) coupled with faster gelation
   rates, decreased swelling ratios, and increased stability versus
   hydrolysis. Furthermore, cell viability can be maintained within 3D
   culture using these hydrogels independent of the CNC content. These
   properties collectively make POEGMA-CNC nanocomposite hydrogels of
   potential interest for various biomedical applications including tissue
   engineering scaffolds for stiffer tissues or platforms for cell growth.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesContactless magnetic assembly of cells into 3D clusters has
   been proposed as a novel means for 3D tissue culture that eliminates the
   need for artificial scaffolds. However, thus far its efficacy has only
   been studied by comparing expression levels of generic proteins. Here,
   it has been evaluated by visualizing the evolution of cell clusters
   assembled by magnetic forces, to examine their resemblance to in vivo
   tissues.
   Materials and methodsCells were labeled with magnetic nanoparticles,
   then assembled into 3D clusters using magnetic force. Scanning electron
   microscopy was used to image intercellular interactions and
   morphological features of the clusters.
   ResultsWhen cells were held together by magnetic forces for a single
   day, they formed intercellular contacts through extracellular fibers.
   These kept the clusters intact once the magnetic forces were removed,
   thus serving the primary function of scaffolds. The cells self-organized
   into constructs consistent with the corresponding tissues in vivo.
   Epithelial cells formed sheets while fibroblasts formed spheroids and
   exhibited position-dependent morphological heterogeneity. Cells on the
   periphery of a cluster were flattened while those within were
   spheroidal, a well-known characteristic of connective tissues in vivo.
   ConclusionsCells assembled by magnetic forces presented visual features
   representative of their in vivo states but largely absent in monolayers.
   This established the efficacy of contactless assembly as a means to
   fabricate in vitro tissue models.}},

Abstract = {{The cardinality-balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli (CBMeMBer) filter
   removes the positive bias from the data-updated cardinality estimate in
   the multi-target multi-Bernoulli (MeMBer) filter. In this study, the
   relationship between the MeMBer corrector and the multi-Bernoulli random
   finite set (RFS) distribution is analysed. By utilising this
   relationship, a filter that offers a new statistical framework for the
   MeMBer data update process is proposed. Thus, the multi-Bernoulli RFS
   distribution is extended to model spurious targets arising from targets
   under the legacy track set with high probabilities of existence. Unlike
   the CBMeMBer filter, the proposed filter removes the bias observed in
   the MeMBer filter by distinguishing spurious targets from actual
   targets, and while doing this, it does not make any limiting assumption
   on the probability of target detection. In addition, the modelling of
   spurious targets allows the refinement of the existence probabilities of
   targets in light of measurements. As a result, the stability of the
   cardinality estimate is improved while removing the bias. The
   theoretical analysis performed on the joint detection and state
   estimation problem of a single target reveals the strengths and
   limitations of the proposed filter. In addition, numerical simulations
   are performed in a scenario involving targets with crossing trajectories
   to demonstrate the filter performance.}},

   intensity of Great Lakes-related scientific knowledge collaboration are
   analyzed over the 15-year period from 2000 to 2014, focusing on
   organizational, institutional, and geographic characteristics. The
   results reveal generally robust scientific collaboration between
   government and academic institutions but also a remarkable USA-Canada

Abstract = {{The general approach in a noisy channel scalar quantizer design is an
   iterative descent algorithm, which guarantees only a locally optimal
   solution. While sufficient conditions under which the local optimum
   becomes a global optimum are known in the noiseless channel case, such
   sufficient conditions were not derived for the noisy counterpart.
   Moreover, efficient globally optimal design techniques for general
   discrete distributions in the noiseless case exist; however, they seem
   not to extend to the noisy scenario when a fixed index assignment is
   assumed. Recently, the design of noisy channel scalar quantizer with
   random index assignment (RIA) was proposed using a locally optimal
   iterative algorithm. In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions for
   the uniqueness of a local optimum, which, thus, guarantee the global
   optimality of the solution. These sufficient conditions are satisfied
   for a log-concave probability density function which is, additionally,
   symmetric around its mean. Furthermore, we show that, assuming an RIA,
   the globally optimal design for general discrete sources can also be
   carried out efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to study the change of chip morphology
   with increasing cutting speed by considering the role of microstructure
   evolution in chip root. The orthogonal cutting experiments of AISI 1045
   steel showed that the chip morphology would be changed from continuous
   chip to discontinuous serrated chip as the microstructure softening
   events occurred in the secondary shear zone with the increasing cutting
   speed. Based on the principle of cutting force balance and the concept
   of equilibrium shear angle (I center dot (e)), the influence of the
   dynamic behavior of deformation and recrystallization in chip material
   on chip morphology was analyzed and modeled. Three types of chip
   morphology would be characterized corresponding to the sliding, only
   severe deformation and dynamic recrystallization behaviors,
   respectively, in the secondary shear zone. It was concluded that the
   physical mechanism of the serrated chip morphology is the variation of I
   center dot (e) controlled by the mechanical properties of workpiece
   material in the secondary shear zone, which is related to dynamic
   deformation behavior of material as influenced by microstructural
   softening events, such as recrystallization or phase transformation.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic response of a 2-story reinforced concrete shear wall
   structure seismically isolated using unbonded rectangular
   fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) is investigated. Using
   rectangular isolators, rather than square or circular, for buildings
   with masonry or reinforced concrete structural walls allows a more
   uniform distribution of the gravity loads and eliminates the requirement
   of additional wall beam elements. Time history analyses are conducted
   for both fixed-base (FB) and base-isolated (BI) configurations using 10
   earthquake ground motions, selected to match the design response
   spectrum. The properties of the isolators are taken from lateral cyclic
   test results carried out on scale model FREIs. A pivot-elastic model,
   previously introduced by the authors, is used to model the lateral
   response of the isolators in the time history analyses. The peak
   response values of the BI structure are significantly reduced compared
   with the results for the FB structure. It is concluded that unbonded
   rectangular FREIs can be effectively designed and used to seismically
   isolate masonry or reinforced concrete shear wall structures. (C) 2015

   chicken, while Mg, Si, K, As and Cd decreased significantly (P < 0.05).
   These results suggest that ICP-MS determination of elements in chicken
   tissues enables a rapid analysis with good precision and accuracy.
   Supplementation of high levels of As affected levels of 20 elements (Li,
   Na, AI, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sn, Ba, Tl, Pb, Mg, Si, K, As and
   Cd) in the pectoral muscles of chicken. Thus, it is needful to monitor
   the concentration of toxic metal (As) in chicken for human health.}},

Abstract = {{In visible light communication (VLC) systems for automotive
   applications, different kinds of traffic data with intended priority are
   usually demanded for transmission to meet an important requirement for
   both driving safety and the simplicity of a receiver, mainly due to a
   time urgency issue. For this need, a concept called an additively
   uniquely decomposable constellation (signal amplitude set) group (AUDCG)
   is proposed in this paper to transmit multilayer data for VLC through
   constellation cooperation. Then, an optimal AUDCG is designed by
   minimizing the average optical power subject to a fixed minimum
   Euclidean distance. One of the significant advantages of this optimal
   design is fast demodulation of the sum signal from a noisy received
   signal, as well as fast decoding of individual signal from the estimated
   sum signal. Another important advantage is that this design allows each
   user constellation to be flexibly assigned to meet different priority
   requirements. Computer simulations indicate that our proposed design has
   better error performance than the currently available time-orthogonal
   transmission scheme for this application.}},

Abstract = {{Most P300 event-related potential (ERP)-based brain-computer interface
   (BCI) studies focus on gaze shift-dependent BCIs, which cannot be used
   by people who have lost voluntary eye movement. However, the performance
   of visual saccade-independent P300 BCIs is generally poor. To improve
   saccade-independent BCI performance, we propose a bimodal P300 BCI
   approach that simultaneously employs auditory and tactile stimuli. The
   proposed P300 BCI is a vision-independent system because no visual
   interaction is required of the user. Specifically, we designed a
   direction-congruent bimodal paradigm by randomly and simultaneously
   presenting auditory and tactile stimuli from the same direction.
   Furthermore, the channels and number of trials were tailored to each
   user to improve online performance. With 12 participants, the average
   online information transfer rate (ITR) of the bimodal approach improved
   by 45.43\% and 51.05\% over that attained, respectively, with the
   auditory and tactile approaches individually. Importantly, the average
   online ITR of the bimodal approach, including the break time between
   selections, reached 10.77 bits/min. These findings suggest that the
   proposed bimodal system holds promise as a practical visual
   saccade-independent P300 BCI.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to investigate the performance of a new
   design concept for a tandem Ce:YAG fluorescent solar concentrator. In
   this design, elements of Ce:YAG arranged in a hexagonal pattern within a
   waveguide absorb high energy photons and emit them at an energy
   optimized for edge-mounted III-V solar cells with a bandgap higher than
   silicon's bandgap. A silicon solar cell is located below the waveguide
   to absorb light transmitted or re-emitted through the concentrator. We
   first determined the optical properties of single crystal Ce:YAG. These
   results yielded a peak excitation at 470 nm with an absorption
   coefficient of 25.8 cm(-1), a peak emission at 530 nm with an absorption
   coefficient of 1.57 cm(-1); and an internal quantum efficiency of
   80.0\%. Our experimental analysis using powder Ce:YAG yields a waveguide
   optical efficiency of 33\% for the design excluding focusing lenses and
   54\% with lenses. There are some sources of error that were addressed by
   using single crystal Ce:YAG instead of powder. The projected overall FSC
   efficiency is 15.4\% for a tandem fluorescent design using GaP
   edge-mounted solar cells and a silicon solar cell below the waveguide.
   This efficiency increases to 19.9\% for InGaP edge-mounted cells instead
   of GaP cells. In both cases single crystal Ce:YAG is assumed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced elastomeric bearings were originally proposed as an
   alternative to conventional steel-reinforced elastomeric bearings for
   seismic isolation applications. The flexible fiber reinforcement is a
   light-weight and potentially cost saving alternative to steel
   reinforcement which is assumed rigid in the design process. The variety
   of fiber materials available also serves as an additional parameter for
   designers to tailor the vertical stiffness of the bearing. In this
   paper, the analytical solution for the vertical compression modulus of a
   rectangular elastomeric pad including the effects of bulk
   compressibility and extensibility of the fiber reinforcement is used to
   investigate the achievable decrease in vertical frequency. It is shown
   by an example that the extensibility of the fiber reinforcement can be
   used to significantly reduce the vertical stiffness in comparison to an
   equivalent steel-reinforced elastomeric bearing. The resulting decrease
   in the vertical frequency means that fiber-reinforced elastomeric
   bearings may have an advantage over steel-reinforced bearings in the
   vibration isolation of buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) semiconductor detectors are capable of
   providing superior energy resolution and three-dimensional position
   information of gamma ray interactions in a large variety of fields,
   including nuclear physics, gamma-ray imaging and nuclear medicine. Some
   dedicated Positron Emission Tomography (PET) systems, for example, for
   breast cancer detection, require higher contrast recovery and more
   accurate event location compared with a whole-body PET system. The
   spatial resolution is currently limited by electrode pitch in CZT
   detectors. A straightforward approach to increase the spatial resolution
   is by decreasing the detector electrode pitch, but this leads to higher
   fabrication cost and a larger number of readout channels. In addition,
   inter-electrode charge spreading can negate any improvement in spatial
   resolution. In this work, we studied the feasibility of achieving
   sub-pitch spatial resolution in CZT detectors using two methods: charge
   sharing effect and transient signal analysis. We noted that their valid
   ranges of usage were complementary. The dependences of their
   corresponding valid ranges on electrode design, depth-of-interaction
   (DOI), voltage bias and signal triggering threshold were investigated.
   The implementation of these two methods in both pixelated and
   cross-strip configuration of CZT detectors were discussed. Our results
   show that the valid range of charge sharing effect increases as a
   function of DOI, but decreases with increasing gap width and bias
   voltage. For a CZT detector of 5 mm thickness, 100 mu m gap and biased
   at 400 V, the valid range of charge sharing effect was found to be about
   112.3 mu m around the gap center. This result complements the valid
   range of the transient signal analysis within one electrode pitch. For a
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of similar to 17 and preliminary
   measurements, the sub-pitch spatial resolution is expected to be similar
   to 30 mu m and similar to 250 mu m for the charge sharing and transient
   signal analysis methods, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Water monitoring networks are generally classified into surface water,
   precipitation, groundwater or water quality monitoring networks. The
   design of these networks typically occurs in isolation from each other.
   We present a regionalization approach to identify homogeneous subregions
   of large basins that are suitable as areas for the optimization of an
   integrated water monitoring network. The study area, which comprises a
   portion of the St. Lawrence Basin, was spatially divided using
   ecological units. For each ecological unit, 21 attributes were derived
   including both environmental and hydrological indicators. A spatially
   constrained regionalization technique was applied to define the final
   regions. A scree plot was used to determine the number of regions. The
   sensitivity of the technique to the correlation in the attribute data
   was removed by utilizing principal component analysis to reduce
   correlation between attribute data. During regionalization, the
   component values were weighted by their proportion of the total variance
   explained. The four regions in the final configuration had areas from
   19\% to 31\% of the total area, 63,597km(2). For the St. Lawrence Basin,
   this approach is effective for defining homogeneous regions that can be
   used in further research on the optimization of integrated water
   monitoring networks. The approach is portable to other regions and can
   incorporate any set of attribute data that is valuable to the
   regionalization objective.}},

Abstract = {{Radial-flow membrane chromatography devices which are used for
   flow-through separation are generally unsuitable for bind-and-elute
   chromatography, particularly where multiple components need to be
   separated. We discuss a laterally-fed membrane chromatography device,
   suitable for high-resolution, multi-component protein separation in the
   bind-and-elute mode. In the current study, a stack of cation exchange
   membranes was housed within the membrane device and its performance was
   compared with an equivalent commercial radial-flow device having the
   same membrane bed volume and bed height. Tracer experiments were carried
   out using sodium chloride solution to compare their residence time
   distributions. The laterally-fed device showed superior flow
   distribution characteristics, which could be attributed to a lower
   variability in solute-flow path-lengths, and a smaller dead volume.
   Single protein bind-and-elute experiments carried out using lysozyme
   showed that the peaks obtained with the laterally-fed device were
   significantly sharper and more symmetrical. Excellent separation of
   three model proteins ovalbumin, conalbumin and lysozyme demonstrated
   that the laterally-fed membrane chromatography device was indeed
   suitable for carrying out high-resolution multi-component protein
   purification. These proteins could be fractionated in about 10 membrane
   bed volumes using the laterally-fed device as opposed to 25 bed volumes
   with the radial-flow device. The design of the laterally-fed device is
   simple and its flat shape gives it significantly lower footprint and
   offers additional advantages such as stackability and ease of
   multiplexing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reported the synthesis of a novel type of
   octyltetramethyldisiloxane-containing olefinic macromonomer
   (1-oct(7-en)yl-3-octyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane or OO7), the
   copolymerization of OO7 with ethylene by vanadium catalyst, the
   evaluation of poly(ethylene-co-OO7) as additive on the flow, mechanical
   and thermal properties of polyethylene. The novel siloxane-containing
   comonomer OO7 was synthesized by a two-step hydrosilylation route, with
   only one oxygen atom in the molecule. The comonomer had low oxophilicity
   and hence could be readily copolymerized with ethylene by VCl3(THF)(3)
   catalyst with a high activity of 14 kg/mmol(V).h at the comonomer feed
   of 160 mmol/L. The OO7 incorporation reached to 4.9 mol\%. The
   reactivity ratios were: r(E) = 41.6, r(OO7) = 0.021 and r(E)center dot
   r(OO7) = 0.87, which indicated a tendency of random copolymerization.
   DSC analysis revealed that the glass transition temperatures (T-g) of
   poly(ethylene-co-OO7) were in the range between -74.3 degrees C to -64.0
   degrees C, lower than that of a LLDPE control sample of the similar
   composition. The melting endotherm of poly(ethylene-co-OO7) was
   broadened and shifted to a lower temperature range with increase of the
   OO7 content. Adding 10\% poly(ethylene-co-OO7) as lubricant to HDPE
   increased 44\% melt flow rate (MFR) of the blend. However, the
   mechanical and thermal properties of the blends were not adversely
   affected, compared to HDPE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A high-sensitivity flow-based immunoassay is reported based on a
   gold-coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) chip functionalized
   directly in the QCM without requiring covalent conjugation steps.
   Specifically, the irreversible adsorption of a biotinylated graphene
   oxide-avidin complex followed by loading of a biotinylated capture
   antibody is applied to avoid more complex conventional surface
   modification chemistries and enable chip functionalization and sensing
   all within the QCM instrument. The resulting immunosensors exhibit
   significantly lower nonspecific protein adsorption and stronger signal
   for antigen sensing relative to simple avidin-coated sensors.
   Reproducible quantification of rabbit IgG concentrations ranging from
   0.1 ng/mL to 10 mu g/mL (6 orders of magnitude) can be achieved
   depending on the approach used to quantify the binding with simple mass
   changes used to detect higher concentrations and a horseradish
   peroxidase-linked detection antibody that converts its substrate to a
   measurable precipitate used to detect very low analyte concentrations.
   Sensor fabrication and assay performance take similar to 5 h in total,
   which is on par with or faster than other techniques. Quantitative
   sensing is possible in the presence of complex protein mixtures, such as
   human plasma. Given the broad availability of biotinylated capture
   antibodies, this method offers both an easy and flexible platform for
   the quantitative sensing of a variety of biomolecule targets.}},

Abstract = {{The bending behavior of compositionally-graded martensitic steel was
   investigated in partially decarburized sheets of alloy 300M. The best
   combination of strength and bendability was obtained when the thickness
   of the inner hard core was reduced to one third of the sheet thickness.
   The improved bending behavior of the compositionally-graded sheet is
   attributed to (a) the suppression of crack propagation by introducing a
   more ductile phase at the surface and (b) the spreading of plasticity
   along the circumferential direction as a result of the presence of a
   yield stress gradient in the thickness direction. The bendability of the
   graded material was limited by the initiation and rapid propagation of
   fracture within the hard core of the sheet. Unlike traditional materials
   in which the springback angle increases remarkably with increasing yield
   strength, the compositionally graded material had a small springback
   angle which is comparable to that of steels having a low yield stress
   similar to that of the soft decarburized surface layer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel ultra-compact polarization beam splitter (PBS) utilizing an
   asymmetrical directional coupler with a combination of a silicon
   waveguide (SW) and a graphene multilayer embedded silicon waveguide
   (GMESW) has been proposed and investigated. The modal characteristics of
   the GMESW for the TM mode varies significantly, whereas that for the TE
   mode changes slightly with respect to the SW, inducing the launched TM
   mode to directly pass through the SW with little influence from the
   GMESW, while the TE mode undergoes a strong coupling and is transferred
   to the GMESW. A designed PBS with an 8.3 mu m-long coupler and 200
   nm-wide gap separation offers high extinction ratios (18.2 and 21.2 dB)
   and low insertion losses (0.16 and 0.36 dB) for the thru and cross
   ports, respectively. The presented PBS also presents the ability to work
   with variable splitting ratio power for the TM mode by varying the
   chemical potential of graphene, implying various applications in signal
   processing on a chip. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

   modelling, the early-stage precipitation phenomenon is investigated for
   naturally- and artificially-aged Al-Mg-Si alloys of two different Mg/Si
   ratios, i.e. 1 and 2. It is shown that, regardless of alloy composition
   and aging history, the earliest precipitates appear as finely-dispersed
   Si-rich clusters which gradually undergo a simultaneous coarsening and
   Mg-enrichment. In addition, the energetic factors for the instability of
   natural aging clusters are analysed. The energy analysis also suggests
   that the initial Si-enrichment of the earliest precipitates is due to
   the affinity of locally-strained areas for higher Si concentrations when
   achieving a meta-stable equilibrium with the strain-free surrounding
   matrix. The subsequent Mg-enrichment is shown to be energetically
   necessary for an evolving precipitate to survive and grow. The alloy
   with smaller Mg/Si ratio shows a delay in the onset of Mg-enrichment
   during natural aging, which is attributed to the higher average Si
   content, as well as the slow kinetics of diffusion at natural aging
   temperatures. It is shown that this alloy exhibits a smaller nucleation
   barrier and critical nucleus size as well. We suggest that the above
   described mechanisms govern the evolution of early-stage clustering in
   the common range of age-hardenable Al-Mg-Si alloy compositions. (C) 2015

Volume = {{103}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Controlled diffusion solidification (CDS) is a novel process. It depends
   on mixing two precursor alloys that have different thermal masses to
   make another alloy, and then, the mixture is poured into a near
   net-shaped mold. The process changes the microstructure of the product
   to a non-dendritic structure. The mechanism of CDS depends on three
   considerations: mixing two precursor alloys, nucleation and growth. It
   has been found that the turbulence that occurs during the mixing blends
   the two precursor alloys and results in a mixture that has a matrix and
   morphologies. The matrix forms of the precursor alloy that has a higher
   mass (Alloy1), while the morphologies form of the alloy that has a lower
   mass (Alloy2). Nucleation occurs in the alloy that has the higher
   liquidus temperature near the boundary with the second alloy, thus
   forming the primary Al phase that grows away from the second alloy. The
   temperature of the second alloy strongly affects the stability of the
   solid-liquid interface. A two-dimension model was built using the heat,
   diffusion and Navier stokes equations to understand the probability of
   the nucleation, the growth rate and the stability of the solid-liquid
   interface. The results show that the solid-liquid interface is stable
   during the CDS process compared to during conventional casting
   processes. The numerical results were supported by experimental results
   and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the yaw control issue for in-wheel-motor (IWM)
   electric ground vehicles (EGVs) based on the differential steering in
   the presence of the complete failure of the active front-wheel steering.
   Differential steering is an emerging steering mechanism, generated from
   the differential torque between the left and right wheels in IWM EGVs.
   In case that the regular steering system is defective, differential
   steering can be utilized to act as the sole steering power, and thus
   avoid dangerous consequences for vehicles. For this purpose, a robust
   H-infinity output-feedback controller based on differential steering is
   designed to achieve yaw stabilization, considering that the desired
   steering angle is uncertain and hard to obtain. Parameter uncertainties
   for the cornering stiffnesses and the external disturbances are
   considered to make vehicle robust to different driving conditions.
   CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results based on a high-fidelity and
   full-car model verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller to
   guarantee the equal vehicle handling and stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   nediyl, sodium salt] (PAZO) is a polymeric functional material with a
   number of unique physical properties, which attracted significant
   interest of different scientific communities. Films of PAZO were
   deposited by anodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD) under constant
   current and constant voltage conditions. The deposition kinetics was
   analyzed under different conditions and the deposition mechanism was
   discussed. New strategy was developed for the EPD of different inorganic
   materials and composites using PAZO as a dispersing, charging, binding
   and film forming agent. It was found that PAZO exhibits remarkable
   adsorption on various inorganic materials due to the presence of
   chelating salicylate ligands in its molecular structure. The salicylate
   ligands of PAZO monomers provide multiple adsorption sites by
   complexation of metal atoms on particle surfaces and allow for efficient
   electrosteric stabilization of particle suspensions. The remarkable
   performance of PAZO in its application in EPD have been exemplified by
   deposition of a wide variety of inorganic materials including the single
   element oxides (NiO, ZnO, Fe2O3) the complex oxides (Al2TiO5, BaTiO3,
   ZrSiO4, CoFe2O4) different nitrides (TiN, Si3N4, BN) as well as pure Ni
   metal and hydrotalcite clay. The use of PAZO can avoid limitation of
   other dispersing agents in deposition and co-deposition of different
   materials. Composite films were obtained using PAZO as a co-dispersant
   for different inorganic materials. The deposit composition,
   microstructure and deposition yield can be varied. The EPD method offers
   the advantages of simplicity, high deposition rate, and ability to
   deposit thin or thick films. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of strength and ductility in textured Mg-Gd binary alloys are
   investigated under conditions of uniaxial tension and compression at
   4.2, 78 and 298 K. The alloys obey solution strengthening relationships
   between the critical stress sigma(ss) and the concentration of the
   solute c, which scales as sigma(ss) similar to c(n), with n assuming
   values 0.30-0.53 for tension and 0.73-0.87 for compression. The results
   suggest that Gd solute hardens the compressive yield modes more than the
   tensile yield modes, with basal slip and extension twinning being the
   principal yielding mechanisms in tension and compression. Temperature
   dependence of the yield stress and sss stress suggests contribution of
   non-basal slip systems to the yielding of alloys. Twinning accounts for
   more than 80\% of sample strain in the first 7\% of compression,
   resulting in characteristic S-shape flow curves with four hardening
   stages. The work hardening in Stage A is determined by the extension
   twins propagating throughout primary grains and interacting with grain
   boundaries. Slip-twin interactions control the work hardening rate
   during Stage B, whereas slip-slip interactions determine the work
   hardening in fully twinned materials during Stage C and D. Under tension
   twining is less active, the plastic flow is associated with Stage III of
   work hardening, determined predominantly by slip-slip interactions.
   Increasing Gd concentration in the alloys leads to the reduction of
   tension-compression asymmetry, in agreement with results in the
   literature. Addition of Gd influences the failure and promotes ductile,
   transgranular fracture mode in Mg-Gd alloys down to the low
   temperatures. It is argued that Gd improves the cohesion strength of
   grain boundaries, which suppresses intergranular failure and affects
   favourably ductility of Mg-Gd alloys.}},

   comparable to the one obtained at room temperature, which is
   inconsistent with an expected cubic structure. The variations observed
   in the O K near edge structures, such as a broader and more asymmetric
   lowest energy FS at low temperature, suggest that the magnitude of the
   Ti4+ off-centering along < 111 > increases in lower-temperature phases.
   These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of the O K near edge
   structures to the structural distortions of BTO polymorphs, and form a
   basis for further investigations on defective or strained BTO at the
   nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key fundamentals for organizations to remain competitive in
   the present economic climate is to effectively manage their supply
   chains under uncertainty. The notion of supply chain flexibility
   attempts to characterize the ability of a supply chain to perform
   satisfactorily in the face of uncertainty. However, limited quantitative
   analysis is available. In this work, we utilize a flexibility analysis
   framework developed within the context of process operations and design
   to characterize supply chain flexibility. This framework also provides a
   quantitative mapping to various types of flexibility discussed in the
   operations research and management science literature. Two case studies
   are included to illustrate the application of this framework for
   analyzing the flexibility of existing supply chain processes, as well as
   utilizing it in supply chain design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work introduces multi-period inventory pinch-based algorithm to

   top level computes optimal recipes for aggregated blends over periods
   initially delineated by inventory pinch points. Discrete-time middle
   level uses fixed blend recipes to compute an approximate schedule, i.e.
   what, when, and how much to produce; it also allocates swing storage and
   associated product shipments with specific storage. Continuous-time
   model at the third level computes when exactly to start/stop an
   operation (blend, tank transfer, shipment). MPIP-C algorithm solves

Abstract = {{This work introduces a reduced-size continuous-time model for scheduling

   Nonlinearities are introduced by ethyl RT-70 equations for octane
   blending. Medium-size linear problems (two blenders, more than 20
   orders, 5 products) are solved to optimality within one or two minutes.

Abstract = {{A biomimetic method has been used for the electrodeposition of carbon
   nanotubes (NTs) and composite films using a commercial bile acid. Thin
   films of deoxycholic acid (DCH) were prepared potentiodynamically and
   galvanostatically from deoxycholic acid sodium salt (DCNa) solutions.
   The anodic deposition yield has been investigated at different DCNa
   concentrations. The electrodeposition mechanism involved
   electromigration of anionic DC- species, local pH reduction at the
   anode, and precipitation of DCH. It was found that DCNa allowed
   excellent dispersion of NTs in water. The use of DCNa as a
   multifunctional agent for NTs dispersion, charging, and binding allowed
   electrodeposition of NTs and composite MnO2-NTs films. The MnO2-NTs
   composites were used for charge storage applications in supercapacitors.
   The MnO2-NTs electrodes showed good capacitive behavior. DCNa is a
   promising charging dispersant for NTs dispersion and manufacturing of
   other composites by electrochemical methods.}},

Title = {{Effect of Thermal Pretreatment on the Corrosion of Stainless Steel in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND RADIATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of high-temperature microstructure degradation (thermal
   ageing) on the corrosion resistance of austenitic stainless steels in
   supercritical water (SCW) was evaluated in this study. Mill-annealed
   (MA) and thermally treated (TT) samples of Type 316L and Type 310S
   stainless steel were exposed in 25 MPa SCW at 550 degrees C with 8 ppm
   dissolved oxygen in a flowing autoclave testing loop. The thermal
   treatments applied to Type 316L (815 degrees C for 1000 hr + water
   quench) and Type 310S (800 degrees C for 1000 hr + air cool) were
   successful in precipitating the expected intermetallic phases in each
   alloy, both within the grains and on the grain boundaries. It was found
   that a prolonged time at relatively high temperature was sufficient to
   suppress significant compositional variation across the various
   intermetallic phase boundaries. This paper presents the results of the
   gravimetric analysis and oxide scale characterization using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with X-ray energy-dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS). The role played by the fine precipitate structure on
   formation of the oxide scale, and thus corrosion resistance, is
   discussed. The combined role of dissolved oxygen and flow (revealed by
   examining the differences between Type 316L samples exposed in a static
   autoclave and in the flowing autoclave loop) is also addressed. It was
   concluded that formation of intermetallic phase precipitates during
   high-temperature exposure is not likely to have a major effect on the
   apparent corrosion resistance because of the discontinuous nature of the
   precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, optimal designs for a novel integrated radiant syngas
   cooler and steam methane reformer are explored. Previously, feasible
   base-case designs were established but were sub-optimal given the
   complexity of the model that included more than 200,000 equations. The
   two optimization approaches used in this study include: (i) conventional
   non-linear programming solvers (within gPROMS) and (ii) meta-heuristic
   techniques (Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization). The
   model for the integrated device was implemented in gPROMS, and hence the
   built-in NLP solver was used. However, the NLP solver can only guarantee
   local optimality, and finding good initial guesses manually can be
   prohibitively time consuming. Therefore, the results were compared with
   meta-heuristic methods that are easy to implement, are parallelizable
   and can cover a wide search space. The results using both methods showed
   significant improvement in capital cost, as much as 40\% and with
   improved methane conversion. The advantage of parallel computing when
   using meta-heuristic techniques for optimizing multi-scale models was
   clear: for example, the CPU time reduced by up to 50\% when twice the
   number of cores was utilised to simulate the multi-scale model in
   gPROMS.}},

Abstract = {{Stiffened steel plate system is often used to form large rectangular
   industrial duct structures. The design pressure and the deflection limit
   dictate the plate thickness and the stiffener spacing. Often elastic
   large deflection plate theory is used to determine these values. A
   recent investigation on the plate panel design illustrated that allowing
   for partial yielding of the panel will lead to economical and efficient
   duct,system. The investigation presented in this paper focuses on the
   stiffener requirements associated with the partially yielding plate
   panels. Such stiffeners are often wide flanged steel beam sections,
   where one flange is connected to the duct plate panel and the other
   flange is unsupported. Under suction type pressure situation, the
   unconnected flange of the stiffener is in compression, and the tension
   flange is fully connected to the duct panel, which, along with the web,
   may provide a partial rotational restraint to the compression flange of
   the stiffeners. This study used a finite element method based analysis
   model and a parametric study to establish design recommendations for the
   stiffeners associated with such a plate system. Investigations
   discovered that the stiffener web slenderness (h(w)/t(w)).
   (root(f(ys)/(E))) and the stiffener length slenderness (L/r(ys))
   .(root(f(ys)/(E))) dominate the behaviour and the flexural capacity of
   stiffened plate system associated with the industrial ducts. The
   associated failure modes may be :stiffener lateral-torsional buckling,
   stiffener distortional buckling, stiffener local buckling or stiffener
   end crippling. This paper establishes the ranges of parameters for
   different failure modes and it establishes the bending capacity of the
   stiffeners primarily undergoing stiffener distortional buckling
   associated with partially yielding steel plate panels.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of designing probing signals for a Multi-Input
   Multi-Output (MIMO) radar. The goal is to design a signal vector with a
   desired covariance while ensuring the side-lobes of the ambiguity
   functions are small. We will also consider cases in which a bandwidth
   constraint is placed on the signal. Since covariance matrices are
   structurally constrained, they form a manifold in the signal space.
   Hence, we argue that the difference between these matrices should not be
   in terms of the conventional Euclidean distance (ED), rather, the
   distance should be measured along the surface of the manifold, i.e., in
   terms of Riemannian distance (RD). In either case, the optimization
   problem is quartic in the design variables. An efficient algorithm based
   on iterative convex quadratic optimization is developed and is effective
   in producing good solutions. In addition, we show that by optimizing
   over the manifold, the number of iterations can be significantly reduced
   in comparison to optimizing in the Euclidean space. Several orthonormal
   signal sets, including the Walsh functions, the cosine functions and the
   WLJ functions, are employed to design the transmission signal vector,
   giving us different feasible regions in the optimization. It is observed
   that the WLJ othornormal basis yields feasible solutions under tight
   time-frequency constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium nitride coatings are commonly used to improve the hardness and
   scratch resistance of steel components. They can also be used as
   decorative coatings due to their distinctly gold appearance. These
   features make titanium nitride coatings ideal for use in the high-end
   stainless steel food service and tableware industry. As an industry that
   has yet to fully adopt physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology and
   where quality control and food safety requirements are of great
   importance, research is necessary to assess current deposition methods
   and coating qualities of titanium nitride for use on stainless steel
   tableware. Cathodic arc PVD was selected as the deposition technique for
   this application due to its ability to produce coatings with excellent
   adhesion and wear-resistance properties. Several deposition parameters
   were varied when developing the coating to create a large set of sample
   coatings, which included changing the cleaning methods used for sample
   preparation, the bake temperature and bake duration, deposition
   duration, and bias voltages for ion bombardment. The coatings were then
   analyzed using scratch testing and nano-indentation techniques to
   determine their hardness and adhesion properties. From these results,
   deposition parameters were selected to create a decorative and
   protective titanium nitride coating recipe that is optimized for use

Abstract = {{The active filter auxiliary power module (AFAPM) has been proposed for
   electrified vehicle applications with single-phase onboard chargers. It
   has two modes: 1) the high-voltage (HV) active filtering mode, in which
   the vehicle is connected to the grid and the converter assimilates the
   significant second-order harmonic current introduced by the single-phase
   power; 2) the low-voltage (LV) battery charging mode, in which the
   vehicle is running and the converter charges the LV battery from HV
   battery. This yields a significant capacitance reduction on the DC-link
   of HV battery charger without an additional active filter (AF) circuit.
   However, extra relay and inductors are needed. This paper proposes a
   primary full-integrated AFAPM, which is composed of a two-phase buck
   converter to work as an AF and a dual-active-bridge (DAB) to operate as
   a LV battery charger auxiliary power module (APM). With the proposed
   converter, only an active energy storage capacitor is needed to achieve
   the active filtering and store the second-order harmonic energy. All the
   switches and inductors on the primary stage are shared between the AF
   and APM. Therefore, the cost and size of the dual-voltage charging
   system in the vehicle applications can be reduced further. To confirm
   the effectiveness of the proposed converter, a 720 W prototype has been
   built and experimental results are presented.}},

   and performance assessed by considering DC-link voltage and temperature
   variations. An alternative traction machine design is proposed to
   satisfy the specification. The vehicle power-train is then modified with
   the inclusion of a DC/DC converter between the battery pack and DC-link
   to maintain the traction system DC-link voltage near constant.
   Additionally, inclusion of a supercapacitor system presents a much
   tighter input voltage specification but still doesn't completely
   eliminate the issue. Finally, installing a DC/DC converter to mitigate
   the faulted operation of electric machine drive is reported.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and fast detection of event related potential (ERP) components
   is an unresolved issue in neuroscience and critical health care.
   Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of the ERP to an odd stimulus
   in a sequence of identical stimuli which has good correlation with coma
   awakening. All of the previous studies for MMN detection are based on
   visual inspection of the averaged ERPs (over a long recording time) by a
   skilled neurophysiologist. However, in practical situations, such an
   expert may not be available or familiar with all aspects of evoked
   potential methods. Further, we may miss important clinically essential
   events due to the implicit averaging process used to acquire the ERPs.
   In this paper we propose a practical machine learning approach for
   automatic and continuous assessment of the ERPs for detecting the
   presence of the MMN component. The proposed method is realized in a
   classification framework. Performance of the proposed method is
   demonstrated on 22 healthy subjects through a leave-one subject-out
   strategy where the MMN components are identified with about 93\%
   accuracy.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{7212-7222}},
Abstract = {{Spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency are two critical issues in the
   design of wireless communication networks. Recently, energy harvesting
   cognitive radio networks have been proposed to attempt to solve both the
   issues simultaneously. In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio
   network in which a primary transmitter mainly occupies the channel, and
   a secondary transmitter equipped with an energy harvesting device is
   allowed to opportunistically access the primary channel at any time if
   it is detected to be idle. Here, we assume that energy arrival process
   and primary channel state are random process and two-state
   time-homogenous discrete Markov process, respectively. Instead of the
   expected number of successful spectrum access attempts per time slot as
   a design criterion in current literature, we use the average channel
   capacity as the achievable throughput to jointly optimize energy
   harvesting and spectrum sensing subject to the constraints on the energy
   causality, collision, and temporal correlation of probability of sensing
   the idle/occupied channel, thus achieving or almost achieving both the
   energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency in certain conditions. In
   addition, the corresponding optimum detection threshold and the maximum
   achievable throughput are obtained, which are substantiated by our
   comprehensive computer simulations.}},

   The career signal injection is not viable as there is no PWM to

   injection technique requires current derivative sensors which makes the
   overall scheme less attractive. This paper utilizes the inherent high
   frequency vector injection of the model predictive control to extract
   the position information. It is shown that the high frequency current
   response is amplitude modulated with respect to the position. A
   demodulation technique based on the reactive power estimation is
   proposed. The simulation results at various initial positions confirm
   the validity of the proposed position estimation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We are interested in capturing the multi-scale behaviour of granular
   materials; that is, how micro-scale particle interactions influence the
   macroscopic behaviour of granular materials. We present a novel plane
   strain dynamic formulation for a multi-scale hybrid finite
   element-discrete element analysis. The formulation consists of two basis
   elements: hybrid polygonal body elements representing grains with linear
   elastic behaviour and interface elements representing the nonlinear
   interactions between grains. Combining the two elements provides a
   convenient technique for obtaining results akin to a discrete element
   simulation, but within a continuum-based finite element framework. We
   apply the model to simulate biaxial compression tests with an initial
   consolidation phase under uniform pressure followed by strain-controlled
   deviatoric loading. The model captures the stress-strain relationship of
   a typical compression test on granular material, including the post-peak
   softening regime. Eigen-analysis of the granular structure reveals that
   this modelling approach captures the rich bifurcation space associated
   with the failure of granular materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, big data applications have been rapidly expanding into various
   industries. Healthcare is among those industries that are willing to use
   big data platforms, and as a result, some large data analytics tools
   have been adopted in this field. Medical imaging, which is a pillar in
   diagnostic healthcare, involves a high volume of data collection and
   processing. A massive number of 3D and 4D images are acquired in
   different forms and resolutions using a variety of medical imaging
   modalities. Preprocessing and analysis of imaging data is currently a
   costly and time-consuming process. However, few big data platforms have
   been created or modified for medical imaging purposes because of certain
   restrictions, such as data format. In this paper, we designed, developed
   and successfully tested a new pipeline for medical imaging data (in
   particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI) using the Big
   Data Spark / PySpark platform on a single node, which allowed us to read
   and load imaging data, convert the data to Resilient Distributed
   Datasets in order to manipulate and perform in-memory data processing in
   parallel, and convert final results to an imaging format. Additionally,
   the pipeline provides an option to store the results in other formats,
   such as data frames. Using this new pipeline, we repeated our previous
   work, in which we extracted brain networks from fMRI data using template
   matching and the sum of squared differences (SSD) method. The final
   results revealed that our Spark (PySpark) based solution improved the
   performance (in terms of processing time) approximately fourfold when
   compared with the previous work developed in Python.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular
   predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from
   drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most
   important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper
   understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical
   problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in
   classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper,
   we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers
   brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this
   type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model
   or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when
   compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease.
   Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as
   Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic
   aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features.
   Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture
   LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers
   subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data
   reached 96.85\%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale
   invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning
   classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing
   clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for
   expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.}},

Abstract = {{Computational offloading can improve the energy efficiency of mobile
   devices, by executing some tasks of a mobile application in the cloud.
   In this paper, a new algorithm called `Dynamic Programming with
   Randomization' (DPR) is presented. The DPR algorithm iteratively
   improves an offloading decision vector, by generating random bit strings
   with a biased probability of generating 0s, which represent a decision
   to offload a task. If fragments of these bit strings improve the
   decision vector, they are incorporated into the decision vector (which
   is similar to genetic optimization). The DPR algorithm also uses a
   hamming distance termination criterion, with a preference to offload
   tasks, to find a nearly-optimal offloading solution quickly. The DPR
   algorithm will offload as many tasks as possible to the cloud server
   when the network transmission bandwidth is high, thereby improving the
   total execution time of all tasks and minimizing the energy consumption
   of the mobile device. The DPR algorithm can find excellent quality
   solutions with low computational overhead, by using biased
   randomization. Furthermore, the DPR algorithm can scale to handle larger
   offloading problems without loosing computational efficiency or solution
   quality, as the computational time grows linearly (with a slope less
   than unity) with the problem size. Performance evaluation shows that the
   proposed DPR algorithm can minimize energy requirements while meeting an
   application's execution time constraints, and it is able to find a
   nearly-optimal offloading decision vector in a few iterations.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{93-110}},
Abstract = {{Axial-null illumination (ANI) is proposed to simplify the calibration of
   microwave imaging systems. The illumination also enhances the spatial
   resolution. ANI can be achieved with various array configurations, but a
   minimum of two transmitting antennas are required, which is a well-known
   form of differential illumination. Here, ANI is achieved with four
   transmitting antennas, and its implementation is investigated in a
   planar scanning scenario. The receiving antenna resides at the radiation
   null of the ANI array. Back-scattered reception requires an antenna at
   the center of the ANI array whereas forward-scattered reception requires
   an antenna aligned with the ANI axis, but on the opposite side of the
   imaged volume. The most important advantage of the proposed imaging
   setup is that it eliminates the need for background (or baseline)
   measurements, thus simplifying the system calibration. Also, it is
   proven that at least two-fold improvement in the spatial resolution can
   be achieved in near-field imaging scenarios compared to the conventional
   single-source illumination.}},

   identify data-driven models that capture the temporal dynamics of
   process measurements sampled at different rates. The resulting
   multi-rate models are used to design a two-tiered predictive controller

   closed-loop simulation results illustrate the improvement in economic

   demonstrate that the resulting LTI, dynamic, state-space model is able
   to describe the transient behavior of finite duration batch processes.
   Next, we relate the terminal quality to the terminal value of the
   identified states. Finally, we apply the resulting model in a
   shrinking-horizon, model predictive control scheme to directly control
   terminal product quality. The theoretical properties of the proposed
   approach are studied and compared to state-of-the- art latent variable
   control approaches. The efficacy of the proposed approach is
   demonstrated through a simulation study of a batch polymethyl

Abstract = {{This work considers the problem of actuator and sensor fault isolation
   for nonlinear systems subject to uncertainty. The key idea is to detect
   and isolate faults by using a bank of filters, dedicated to each fault
   that captures the difference between the observed and expected behavior
   of system while allowing thresholds, cognizant of the uncertainty. To
   this end, high gain observer are first designed and the bounds on the
   estimation error, subject to the uncertainty, are established. Then the
   residuals are defined in a way that each is only sensitive to a subset
   of faults, with the thresholds accounting for the impact of the
   uncertainty. The fault isolability condition, characterizing the class
   of faults that are isolable by the proposed fault detection and
   isolation (FDI) scheme is rigorously derived. The effectiveness of the
   fault isolation framework subject to uncertainty and measurement noise
   is illustrated using a chemical reactor example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust H-infinity output-feedback based control
   strategy for the vehicle lateral motion control considering
   network-induced delay and tire force saturation. The unavoidable time
   delay in the in-vehicle networks degrades the control performance, and
   even deteriorates the system stability. In addition, due to the friction
   limit of the tire force, the tire lateral force is suffering saturation
   phenomenon, which also deteriorates the control effect in extreme
   driving conditions. To handle the network-induced delay and tire force
   saturation, a robust H-infinity controller is presented to regulate the
   vehicle lateral motion. An output-feedback control schema, which does
   not need the vehicle lateral velocity, is designed to reduce the cost of
   the control system. The tire cornering stiffness uncertainty and
   external disturbances are also considered in the controller design to
   improve the robustness of the proposed controller. The comparative
   simulation results based on Carsim and Simulink verify the effectiveness
   and robustness of the proposed control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a linear permutation module before the inner
   encoder of the iteratively decoded product coding structure, for the
   transmission of scalable bitstreams over error-prone channels(1). This
   can improve the error correction ability of the inner code when some
   source bits are known from the preceding outer code decoding stages. The
   product code consists of a protograph low-density parity-check code
   (inner code) and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes of various strengths (outer
   code).
   Further, an algorithm relying on protograph-based extrinsic information
   transfer analysis is devised to design good base matrices from which the
   linear permutations are constructed. In addition, an analytical formula
   for the expected fidelity of the reconstructed sequence is derived and
   utilized in the optimization of the RS codes redundancy assignment.
   The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach consistently
   outperforms the scheme without the linear permutation module, reaching
   peak improvements of 1:98 dB and 1:30 dB over binary symmetric channels
   (BSC) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, respectively.}},

   solution hinges on valid image priors or models. In this work, robust

   transmittance estimation and its physical validity is justified. In
   addition, a new sparsity-based optimization approach for transmittance
   image super-resolution/restoration is proposed, which makes a solid
   assumption that most outdoor object surfaces are piece wise linear and
   thus the corresponding depth image is sparse in Laplacian space.
   Experimental results are given in proof of the remarkably improved
   visual quality of our new haze removal technique over its predecessors.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the automotive industry is experiencing a significant
   technology shift from internal combustion engine propelled vehicles to
   second generation battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric
   vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The
   battery pack represents the core of the electric vehicle powertrain and
   its most expensive component and therefore requires continuous condition
   monitoring and control. As such, extensive research has been conducted
   to estimate the battery critical parameters such as state-of-charge
   (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH). In order to accurately estimate these
   parameters, a high fidelity battery model has to work collaboratively
   with a robust estimation strategy onboard of the battery management
   system (BMS). In this paper, three Kalman Filter-based estimation
   strategies are analyzed and compared, namely: The Extended Kalman Filter
   (EKF), Sigma-point Kalman filtering (SPKF) and Cubature Kalman filter
   (CKF). These estimation strategies have been compared based on the
   first-order equivalent circuit-based model. Estimation strategies have
   been compared based on their SOC estimation accuracy, robustness to
   initial SOC error and computation requirement.}},

Abstract = {{Reporting pack-level state-of-charge (SOC) requires identification of
   the maximum and minimum SOC cells in the pack. Applying separate
   estimators for every cell greatly increases the computational burden of
   battery state estimation. Efficient approaches based on either an
   average cell estimator and m-top/bottom estimators are bench marked on
   their ability to report maximum/minimum SOC. A simulation case study on
   a 14-cell battery with cell balancing and typical aged-pack cell-to-cell
   variations is performed. The average estimator approach with
   voltage-based correction is shown to induce unacceptably large errors.
   The m-top/bottom method with voltage based selection criteria is shown
   to be a viable computational efficient approach in estimating
   maximum/minimum SOC cells.}},

Abstract = {{Everyday, people share their digital media on the virtual networks;
   therefore, protecting them against piracy is worthy of consideration.
   Digital watermarking is a method to achieve this goal. In this paper, we
   propose a watermarking method in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain.
   For this purpose, DCT coefficients of the whole image are calculated. It
   helps to present a system without blockiness effects. Then, singular
   values of the watermark image are added to the low frequency DCT
   coefficients of cover image that are located on the main diagonal. We
   use scaling factors for watermark embedding to improve imperceptibility
   of the watermark. A vector of fixed elements, which is calculated
   empirically, is used as a set of scaling factors. We embed the watermark
   with a four-time redundancy in the cover signal. It is helpful to take
   advantage of voting method for improving performance of the system in
   extraction phase. Experimental Results show higher performance of the
   proposed method in comparison with similar works in this domain.}},

Abstract = {{Today's best-effort (BE) Internet of Things (IoT) faces challenges in
   providing the end-to-end-performance, security, and energy efficiency
   needed for the Smart Systems of the 21st century. These future smart
   systems will include smart cities, smart transportation systems, and
   smart manufacturing. This paper surveys the security weaknesses of the
   BE IoT. The BE-IoT cannot be partitioned into distinct interference-free
   virtual networks, which compromises performance, cyber-security, and
   energy efficiency. The design of a secure deterministic
   industrial-tactile IoT core network, which can embed millions of
   distinct secure deterministic virtual networks (SD-VNs) in layer 2, is
   then presented. Deterministic communications, combined with low-jitter
   scheduling, offers several benefits: 1) the removal of all congestion,
   interference, and DOS attacks; 2) a significant reduction in IoT router
   buffer sizes; 3) a significant reduction in IoT energy use; 4) a
   reduction of end-to-end IoT delays to the speed of light in fiber; and
   5) deterministic packet switches are relatively easy to synthesize using
   FPGA technologies. These benefits apply to optical and 5G wireless
   networks. Future smart systems can reserve their own congestion-free
   SD-VNs in layer 2 to manage their traffic, with significantly improved
   performance, security, and energy efficiency. A speed-of-light
   deterministic IoT core network can transform cloud services in the 21st
   century by exploiting a new technology: FPGAs combined with silicon
   photonics transceivers to achieve terabits/second of optical bandwidth.
   To illustrate the transformational potential, Big Data green cloud
   computing over a secure deterministic IoT spanning the European Union is
   explored.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of the internet of things, location
   information becomes increasingly important for various applications.
   However, the localization information of network devices are vulnerable
   to various attacks. In this paper, we propose SPIN, a scheme for
   location verification that allows the access point (AP) to verify
   credibility of a reported location from a network node. This is achieved
   by having an object move actively around the AP at a random speed. The
   moving object blocks the direct path between the AP and individual
   network nodes at a random time and deliberately creates abrupt changes
   in the received signal strength (RSS). This paper proposes a scheme so
   that the AP can distinguish a malicious node from a legitimate one based
   on the reported RSSs from a network node and its reported location
   information. Simulation results show that the proposed SPIN scheme
   achieves high probability of detecting a malicious node and low
   probability of treating a legitimate node as malicious.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition and identification of unknown targets is a crucial task in
   surveillance and security systems. Electronic Support Measures (ESM) are
   one of the most effective sensors for identification, especially for
   maritime and air-to-ground applications. In typical surveillance systems
   multiple ESM sensors are usually deployed along with kinematic sensors
   like radar. Different ESM sensors may produce different types of reports
   ready to be sent to the fusion center. The focus of this paper is to
   develop a new architecture for target recognition and identification
   when non-homogeneous ESM and possibly kinematic reports are received at
   the fusion center. A Bayesian version of the new fusion architecture is
   evaluated using simulations to show the benefit of utilizing different
   ESM reports such as attribute and signal level ESM data.}},
