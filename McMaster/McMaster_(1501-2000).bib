Abstract = {{A conceptually new colloidal method for the fabrication of metal
   oxide-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites is proposed. The
   approach is based on the use of phosphate ester (PE) for the dispersion
   of oxide nanoparticles and m-cresolsulfonphthalein (CS) dye for the
   dispersion of MWCNT. PE imparts a positive charge to the particles in
   ethanol. The adsorption of anionic CS on MWCNT allows the formation of
   stable suspensions of negatively charged MWCNT in ethanol. The
   adsorption of CS on MWCNT is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and
   UV-vis spectroscopy. The heterocoagulation of positively charged oxide
   nanoparticles and negatively charged MWCNT allows the fabrication of
   advanced nanocomposites with improved dispersion of individual
   components. The proof of principle is demonstrated by the fabrication of
   MnO2-MWCNT composite electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors,
   which exhibited significant improvement in capacitance at high
   charge-discharge rates, reduced electrical resistance and good cycling
   stability. The hybrid cells, containing composite MnO2-MWCNT electrodes,
   show promising electrochemical performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An independent component analysis (ICA) mixture model based local
   dissimilarity method is proposed in this article for performance
   monitoring of multimode dynamic processes with non-Gaussian features in
   each operating mode. The normal benchmark set is assumed to be from
   different operating modes, each of which can be characterized by a
   localized ICA model. Thus, an ICA mixture model is developed with a
   number of non-Gaussian components that correspond to various operating
   modes in the normal benchmark set. Further, the Bayesian inference rules
   are adopted to determine the local operating modes that the monitored
   set belongs to and the ICA mixture model based dissimilarity index is
   derived to evaluate the non-Gaussian patterns of process data by
   comparing the localized IC subspaces between the benchmark and the
   monitored sets. Moreover, the process dynamics are taken into account by
   implementing sliding window strategy on the monitored data set. The
   proposed ICA mixture model based dissimilarity method is applied to
   monitor the performance of the Tennessee Eastman Chemical process with
   multiple operating modes and the fault detection results demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed method over the conventional eigenvalue
   decomposition based and geometric angle based principal component
   analysis (PCA) mixture dissimilarity methods.}},

   separation typically carried out using two continuous distillation
   columns. The performance of six control configurations based on
   composition or temperature inferential control were analyzed. Dynamic
   simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the semicontinuous
   system and its temperature inferential control configuration in
   achieving the separation objectives, remaining within operational limits
   and rejecting fresh feed disturbances. Finally, the semicontinuous
   system is compared to the traditional continuous system from an economic

Abstract = {{Target classification has received significant attention in the tracking
   literature. Algorithms for joint tracking and classification that are
   capable of improving tracking performance by exploiting the
   interdependency between target class and target kinematic behavior have
   already been proposed. In these works, target identification relies on
   the a priori information about target classes, but, in practice, the
   prior class information may not always be available or not accurate.
   This motivates the design of a new estimation method that can jointly
   build target classes and classify targets even when a priori information
   is not available. Based on the generic expectation-maximization
   framework, a novel joint multitarget class estimation and target
   identification algorithm that requires only target feature measurements
   is proposed in this paper to achieve this goal. In this approach,
   multitarget classes are characterized by multiple hidden Markov models.
   Besides theoretical derivations, simulations are presented to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In the technical literature, some authors have reported calculation of
   negative pressures in simulations of twin screw extrusion and other
   types of processing, without giving any explanations. In the majority
   publications there is no mention of such meaningless results, even
   though theoretical considerations indicate that negative pressures could
   be obtained in the expansion region of drag flows through narrow
   non-parallel surfaces. The meaningless negative pressures are due to the
   application of single fluid theory to flow regions where bubbles would
   form, when the pressure drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid.
   This has been known for a long time from the study of lubrication
   bearings and related cavitation phenomena. It is argued that the
   boundary conditions should be carefully chosen for avoiding results in
   numerical simulations, which can never be reconciled with experimental
   pressure data.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The soil moisture state partitions both mass and energy fluxes and is
   important for many hydro-geochemical cycles, but is often only measured
   within the surface layer. Estimating the amount of soil moisture in the
   root-zone from this information is difficult due to the nonlinear and
   heterogeneous nature of the various processes which alter the soil
   moisture state. Data-driven methods, such as artificial neural networks
   (ANN), mine data for nonlinear interdependencies and have potential for
   estimating root-zone soil moisture from surface soil moisture
   observations. To create an ANN root-zone model that was nonsite-specific
   and physically constrained, a training set was generated by forcing
   HYDRUS-1D with meteorological observations for different soil profiles
   from the unsaturated soil hydraulic database. Ensemble ANNs were trained
   to provide soil moisture at depths of 10, 20, and 50 cm below the
   surface using surface soil moisture observations and local
   meteorological information. Insights into the processes represented by
   the ANNs were derived from a clamping sensitivity analysis and by
   changing the ANNs input data. Further model testing based on synthetic
   soil moisture profiles from three McMaster Mesonet and three USDA soil
   climate analysis network sites suggests that ANNs are a flexible tool
   capable of predicting root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy. It was
   found that ANNs could well represent soil moisture as estimated by
   HYDRUS-1D, but performance was reduced in comparison to in situ soil
   moisture observations outside the training conditions. The
   transferability of the model appears limited to the same geographic
   region.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the problem of sensor fault isolation and
   fault-tolerant control for nonlinear systems subject to input
   constraints. The key idea is to design fault detection residuals and
   fault isolation logic by exploiting model-based sensor redundancy
   through a state observer. To this end, a high-gain observer is first
   presented, for which the convergence property is rigorously established,
   forming the basis of the residual design. A bank of residuals are then
   designed using a bank of observers, with each driven by a subset of
   measured outputs. A fault is isolated by checking which residuals breach
   their thresholds according to a logic rule. After the fault is isolated,
   the state estimate generated using measurements from the healthy sensors
   is used in closed-loop to maintain nominal operation. The implementation
   of the fault isolation and handling framework subject to uncertainty and
   measurement noise is illustrated using a chemical reactor example. (C)

Abstract = {{The distributions of the mass transfer coefficient in horizontal 90 deg
   bends were measured under a range of two phase annular flow conditions.
   A dissolving wall technique at a high Schmidt number (Sc = 1280) is used
   for the measurements. The maximum mass transfer occurred on the
   centerline of the bend outer wall at an angle of approximately 50 deg
   from the bend inlet under all tested conditions. The area of maximum
   mass transfer rate was found to span approximately 30 deg in the
   circumferential direction. A second region of enhanced mass transfer
   occurred on the latter part of the bend with a local maximum occurring
   slightly off the bend centerline in some cases. Changing the air and
   water superficial velocities (J(v) = 22-30 m/s, J(L) = 0.17-0.41 m/s)
   showed that the air velocity had a larger effect on the mass transfer
   rates than the water velocity; however, the effect of the water velocity
   on the mass transfer was not insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{This work compares theoretically the performance of several
   representative practical multiple description (MD) frameworks with L >=
   3 symmetric descriptions. The first scenario is the classic unequal
   erasure protection (UEP) scheme using a successively refinable code
   (SRC) and Reed-Solomon codes. The second scenario is an improvement upon
   UEP by applying domain partitioning and permuted Reed-Solomon codes. The
   third scenario uses a finer partitioning and erasure correction via
   repetition codes. Additionally, the MD lattice vector quantizer and
   another recent MD scheme are considered in the comparison.
   The aforementioned MD schemes are compared in terms of the expected
   squared error asymptotically achievable as the rate R of a description
   approaches infinity, assuming independent description losses. Our
   analysis reveals that the improvement of the second scenario upon the
   first one when R -> infinity can reach up to 1.68 dB, but it approaches
   0 as the description loss rate p goes to 0 and L approaches infinity.
   Additionally, we find that the first two schemes outperform the third
   one with an unbounded gain when R -> infinity, as p -> 0 or L ->
   infinity. Further, we show that the first three scenarios achieve
   unbounded improvements over the other two as R -> infinity and p -> 0.
   On the other hand, we point out that some of the results of our
   asymptotic analysis rely on strong assumptions and therefore an
   experimental validation is needed before applying them to practical
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive dynamic systems provide a broadly defined platform, whereby
   engineering learns from cognitive neuroscience, and by the same token,
   cognitive neuroscience learns from engineering. The first part of the
   paper is of a tutorial nature, addressing recent advances in cognitive
   perception and cognitive control, which are the dual of each other. The
   study of cognitive perception, viewed from the perspective of Bayesian
   inference, starts with sparse coding, well known in neuroscience.
   However, sparse coding could become ill-posed, particularly when the
   signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such situations, stability is a
   necessary requirement, which can only be satisfied if there is
   sufficient information in the observables. To satisfy this requirement,
   the sparse-coding algorithm is augmented by the addition of information
   filtering (i.e., a special case of Bayesian filtering). Accordingly, the
   performance of sparse coding is improved under the influence of
   perceptual attention. This improvement enhances the cognitive perceptor
   to separate relevant information from irrelevant information. Next,
   moving into cognitive control, viewed from the perspective of Bellman's
   dynamic programming, two ideas are exploited: entropic state of the
   perceptor, and the definition of reward as an invertible function of two
   entropic states, namely, the current state and its immediate past value.
   The net result of building on these two ideas is a modified form of
   Bellman's dynamic programming, and, therefore, a new reinforcement
   learning algorithm, which not only outperforms traditional reinforcement
   learning algorithms, but also offers some highly desirable properties.
   Among them is a linear law of computational complexity, which is the
   best that it could be. The second part of the paper addresses two
   challenging problems: first, how to mediate between cognitive control
   and cognitive perception and, second, how to formulate a procedure for
   risk control. The first problem is resolved by making use of
   probabilistic reasoning, a branch of probability theory, which leads
   into the formulation of a probabilistic reasoning machine. With this
   mediation in place, the conditions for overall system stability are
   derived, thereby confirming the probabilistic reasoning machine as the
   overall system stabilizer. The second challenge is risk control, which
   is by far the most challenging of them all: In the presence of an
   unexpected disturbance in the environment, risk is brought under control
   by mimicking the predict and preadapt function, which is considered to
   be the overarching function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. To be
   specific, motor control is expanded by the inclusion of a new
   preadaptive control mechanism, which involves two different sets of
   actions: One set is made up of possible actions identified by the policy
   in the motor control. The other set involves a window of experiences
   (i.e., optimal actions) gained in the past. In a novel way, by
   exploiting these two sets, we end up with a preadaptive control
   mechanism in the form of a closed-loop feedback structure, which brings
   with it control (executive) attention.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo evaluate fetal cerebral venous blood oxygenation, Y-v, using
   principles of MR susceptometry.
   Materials and MethodsA cohort of 19 pregnant subjects, with a mean
   gestational age of 31.6 4.7 weeks were imaged using a modified
   susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence. Data quality was first
   assessed for feasibility of oxygen saturation measurement, and data from
   five subjects (mean std gestational age of 33.7 +/- 3.6 weeks) were then
   chosen for further quantitative analysis. SWI phase in the superior
   sagittal sinus was used to evaluate oxygen saturation using the
   principles of MR susceptometry. Systematic error in the measured Y-v
   values was studied through simulations.
   ResultsSimulations showed that the systematic error in Y-v depended upon
   the assumed angle of the vessel, , relative to the main magnetic field
   and the error in that vessel angle . For the typical vessel angle of =
   30 degrees encountered in the fetal data analyzed, a as large as +/- 20
   degrees led to an absolute error, Y-v, of less than 11\%. The measured
   mean oxygen saturation across the five fetuses was 66\% +/- 9.4\%. This
   average cerebral venous blood oxygenation value is in close agreement
   with values in the published literature.

Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations and statistical analysis techniques are
   used to study the drag-reducing effect of polymer additives on turbulent
   channel flow in minimal domains. Additionally, a new formulation of
   Karhunen-Loeve decomposition for viscoelastic flows is introduced,
   allowing the dominant features of the polymer stress fields to be
   characterized. In minimal channels, there are intervals of ``active{''}
   and ``hibernating{''} turbulence that display very different structural
   and energetic characteristics; the present work illustrates how the
   statistics of these intervals evolve over the entire range of drag
   reduction (DR) levels. The effect of viscoelasticity on minimal channel
   turbulence is twofold: first, it strongly suppresses the active
   turbulent dynamics that predominate in Newtonian flow and second, at
   sufficiently high Weissenberg number it stabilizes the dynamics of
   hibernating turbulence, allowing it to predominate in the maximum drag
   reduction regime. In this regime, the stress fluctuations become
   delocalized from the wall region, encompassing the entire flow domain.

   secrete factor IX (FIX) for hemophilia treatment, and encapsulated in
   arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-alginate versus fibrinogen-alginate

   displayed distinct attachment morphology, thus suggesting that
   RGD-alginate can potentially be used for the encapsulation of MSCs in
   tissue engineering applications that require enhanced cell attachment
   and viability. However, our data also showed that RGD-alginate
   microcapsules, in contrast to fibrinogen-alginate microcapsules, did not

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a robust linear programming beamformer (RLPB) is proposed
   for non-Gaussian signals in the presence of steering vector
   uncertainties. Unlike most of the existing beamforming techniques based
   on the minimum variance criterion, the proposed RLPB minimizes the
   l(infinity)-norm of the output to exploit the non-Gaussianity. We make
   use of a new definition of the l(p)-norm (1 <= p <= infinity) of a
   complex-valued vector, which is based on the l(p)-modulus of complex
   numbers. To achieve robustness against steering vector mismatch, the
   proposed method constrains the l(infinity)-modulus of the response of
   any steering vector within a specified uncertainty set to exceed unity.
   The uncertainty set is modeled as a rhombus, which differs from the
   spherical or ellipsoidal uncertainty region widely adopted in the
   literature. The resulting optimization problem is cast as a linear
   programming and hence can be solved efficiently. The proposed RLPB is
   computationally simpler than its robust counterparts requiring solution
   to a second-order cone programming. We also address the issue of
   appropriately choosing the uncertainty region size. Simulation results

Abstract = {{Most of the existing beamforming methods are based on the Minimum
   Variance (MV) criterion. The MV approach is statistically optimal only
   when the signal, interferences and the noise are Gaussian-distributed.
   However, non-Gaussian signals arise in a variety of practical
   applications. In this paper, Minimum Dispersion Distortionless Response
   (MDDR) beamforming, which minimizes the l(p)-norm of the output while
   constraining the desired signal response to be unity, is devised for
   non-Gaussian signals. It is shown that the MDDR beamformer, which
   implicitly exploits non-Gaussianity, can improve the performance
   significantly if p > 2 for sub-Gaussian signals or p < 2 for
   super-Gaussian signals. Three efficient algorithms, the Iteratively
   Reweighted Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (IR-MVDR),
   complex-valued full Newton's and partial Newton's methods, are developed
   to solve the resulting l(p)-norm minimization with a linear constraint.
   Furthermore, the MDDR beamformer with a single constraint is generalized
   to the Linearly Constrained Minimum Dispersion (LCMD) beamformer with
   multiple linear constraints, which exhibits robustness against steering
   vector mismatch. The LCMD beamformer yields significant performance
   improvement over the conventional Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance
   (LCMV) beamformer. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
   superior performance of the proposed minimum dispersion beamforming
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental program has been carried out to study the performance of
   partially grouted, nominally reinforced (PG-NR) concrete block
   structural walls under in-plane seismic loading on a shake table. Five
   reduced-scale structural walls were constructed and tested under scaled
   versions of the 1940 El Centro, California earthquake, using its N-S
   component record with a constant axial compression load that represented
   a single-story building. The test walls were grouped into three
   categories. Type I and III walls had reinforcement at the wall end cells
   only, with vertical reinforcement ratios of 0.07 and 0.12\%,
   respectively, based on the gross cross-sectional area of the walls. Type
   II walls were similar to Type I walls, but with an additional
   reinforcement bar located midlength of the wall with a vertical
   reinforcement ratio of 0.10\%, also based on the gross cross-sectional
   area of the wall. The experimental results were documented and discussed
   with respect to wall lateral load capacity, stiffness degradation,
   period shift, displacement ductility levels attained, and relevant
   seismic-force reduction factors. The test results showed that PG-NR
   masonry walls can comprise a ductile seismic force-resisting system.
   Subsequently, PG-NR masonry walls have the potential to bridge the gap
   between unreinforced and reinforced masonry systems. The use of PG-NR
   masonry also results in a reduced cost compared with traditional
   reinforced masonry systems used in seismic zones that are typically
   fully grouted within the plastic hinge zones and require higher
   reinforcement ratios.}},

Title = {{Time- Response Analysis of Arching Unreinforced Concrete Block Walls
   Subjected to Blast Loads}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The new ASCE59-11 standards currently limit the use of unreinforced
   masonry (URM) walls in blast-resistant construction, regardless of the
   wall boundary conditions. This is attributable in part to the lack of
   experimental and analytical studies focusing on evaluating the response
   of URM walls under blast when the walls are forced to arch between the
   surrounding frame members. In this paper, the out-of-plane displacement
   response and structural stability of one-way vertical arching URM walls
   subjected to blast loads are investigated. A simple bilinear
   moment-rotation relationship is developed to simulate the arching wall
   responses. The model takes into account the masonry material strength,
   thrust forces, and wall geometry. Time-response analyses were performed
   using both single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and two-degrees-of-freedom
   (2DOF) models. Both models take into account the rocking phenomenon and
   second-order effects. Responses generated by both models were validated
   using experimental data reported previously. For preliminary design,
   performance charts were developed to correlate the effects of the wall
   slenderness ratio, masonry strength, and block size to the wall response
   under different levels of blast loads. The developed model and charts
   can be used as simple and quick calculation tools to estimate the
   required thickness, height, and strength of the wall under an expected
   blast threat when hardening of URM walls is necessary, with arching
   being considered as one of the alternatives.}},

   Quantifications for Reinforced Concrete Block Structural Walls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A practical alternative to the traditional rectangular cross sections of
   reinforced masonry structural wall systems is to alter the wall ends to
   allow for smaller compression zone depths, and thus higher curvatures to
   develop under increased seismic lateral loads. Despite the significantly
   enhanced seismic performance of flanged and end-confined masonry
   structural walls compared with their rectangular counterparts, seismic
   design parameters related to the former two types of walls have not been
   widely investigated. In addition, prescriptive design requirements for
   rectangular walls are under continuous development to meet the ongoing
   research findings in this area. The focus of the current study is to
   extract specific seismic design parameters of these three types of
   masonry walls having different end configurations for different aspect
   ratios when tested under reversed cyclic loads. The parameters
   investigated include the equivalent plastic hinge lengths, lp, the
   hysteretic damping levels and the trend of period shift corresponding to
   stiffness reduction with increased top wall drift. Three approaches were
   considered to evaluate the equivalent plastic hinge lengths, lp. The
   analyses showed that, following a widely accepted approach, the lp
   values at ultimate loads using the theoretical curvatures and
   experimental displacement ductility levels were approximately 40, 15,
   and 20\% of the wall length for the rectangular, flanged, and
   end-confined walls, respectively. A mechanics-based model, accounting
   for the variation in curvature profile following yielding, strain
   penetration inside concrete foundation and the effects of inclined
   flexure-shear cracking, to determine wall top displacements was
   proposed. At 1\% lateral drift, the calculated hysteretic damping ratios
   were found to be approximately 20\% for all walls. At a displacement
   ductility level of 5.0, corresponding to almost no strength degradation,
   the period increased by at least 70\% compared to that at first yield.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer in dual in-plane short radius bends arranged in an

   cases. The maximum mass transfer occurred for L/D = 0 and was 3.2 times
   larger than the average mass transfer in a fully developed pipe flow
   under the same flow condition. The maximum mass transfer decreased as
   the separation distance between the two bends was increased. The effect
   of Re on the mass transfer enhancement for a separation distance of L/D
   = 0 was examined for Re in the range 40,000-130,000. The peak mass

Abstract = {{The evolution of the self-organization process where dissipative
   structures are formed under the extreme frictional conditions associated
   with high performance dry machining of hardened steels has been studied
   in detail. The emphasis was on the progressive studies of surface
   transformations within multilayer and monolayer TiAlCrSiYN-based PVD
   coatings during the running-in stage of wear when self-organization
   process occurs. The coating layer was characterized by high resolution
   electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS). It is shown that the
   nano-multilayer coating possesses higher non-equilibrium structure in
   comparison to the monolayer. Comprehensive studies of the tribo-films
   (dissipative structures) formed on the friction surface were made using
   a number of advanced surface characterization techniques such as X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near edge
   structure (XANES). The data obtained for the tribo-films was combined
   with the detailed TEM studies of the structural and phase
   transformations within the underlying coating layer. This data was
   related to the micro-mechanical characteristics of the coating layer and
   its wear resistance. It was demonstrated that the evolution of the
   self-organization process is strongly controlled by the characteristics
   of the tribo-films formed at different stages of the wear process.
   Within running-in stage (after length of cut of 15 m) fully protective
   mullite tribo-films predominantly form on the surface of nano-multilayer
   coating, establishing a functional hierarchy within the layer of
   tribo-films. This reduces entropy production during friction and leads
   to significant surface damage reduction and wear rate stabilization. In
   contrast, in a monolayer coating with a lower structural complexity, a
   variety of protective and non-protective tribo-films form during the
   running-in stage, which cannot fully protect the surface. Therefore the
   wear rate on the monolayer is not stabilized and its wear resistance is
   lower. The results obtained show that it is possible to control
   tribo-films evolution during self-organization by means of increase in
   structural complexity and the nonequilibrium state of the surface
   engineered layer with simultaneous tuning of its integrative behaviour.

Abstract = {{In this study, a coal-fuelled integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
   and compressed air energy storage (CAES) system in a load-following
   power production scenario is discussed. Sixteen SOFC-based plants with
   optional carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and syngas shifting
   steps are simulated and compared to a state-of-the-art supercritical
   pulverised coal (SCPC) plant. Simulations are performed using a
   combination of MATIAB and Aspen Plus v7.3. It was found that adding CAES
   to a SOFC-based plant can provide load-following capabilities with
   relatively small effects on efficiencies (1-2\% HHV depending on the
   system configuration) and levelized costs of electricity (similar to
   0.35 cent kW(-1) h(-1)). The load-following capabilities, as measured by
   least-squares metrics, show that this system may utilize coal and
   achieve excellent load-tracking that is not adversely affected by the
   inclusion of CCS. Adding CCS to the SOFC/CAES system reduces measurable
   direct CO2 emission to zero. A seasonal partial plant shutdown schedule
   is found to reduce fuel consumption by 9.5\% while allowing for cleaning
   and maintenance windows for the SOFC stacks without significantly
   affecting the performance of the system (similar to 1\% HHV reduction in
   efficiency). The SOFC-based systems with CCS are found to become
   economically attractive relative to SCPC above carbon taxes of \$22
   ton(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   pressure in a controllable way by fine tuning of the electron beam
   parameters. The control of the detrapping rate is achieved by varying
   the experimental conditions. The underlying physical mechanisms are

Abstract = {{Central venous catheter thrombosis can cause venous obstruction and
   pulmonary embolism. To determine the extent to which catheter thrombosis
   is triggered by the contact or extrinsic pathway of coagulation, we used
   antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to selectively knock down factor
   (f)XII, fXI, or high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), key components of
   the contact pathway, or fVII, which is essential for the extrinsic
   pathway. Knockdown of contact pathway components prolonged the activated
   partial thromboplastin time and decreased target protein activity levels
   by over 90\%, whereas fVII knockdown prolonged the prothrombin time and
   reduced fVII activity to a similar extent. Using a rabbit model of
   catheter thrombosis, catheters implanted in the jugular vein were
   assessed daily until they occluded, up to a maximum of 35 days. Compared
   with control, fXII and fXI ASO treatment prolonged the time to catheter
   occlusion by 2.2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. In contrast, both HK and
   fVII knockdown did not significantly prolong the time to occlusion, and
   dual treatment with fVII- and fXI-directed ASOs produced a time to
   occlusion similar to that with the fXI ASO alone. These findings suggest
   that catheter thrombosis is triggered via the contact pathway and
   identify fXII and fXI as potential targets to attenuate this
   complication.}},

Abstract = {{A new poly(acrylic acid)-grafted TEMPO (PAA-T) is compared to
   polyvinylamine-grafted TEMPO and free TEMPO as oxidation mediators for

   porous cellulose. On the other hand, the resulting surfaces are coated
   with grafted polyvinylamine and laccase, if the enzyme is used as the
   primary oxidant. PAA-T is anionic and does not sufficiently adsorb onto
   anionic cellulose to give oxidation, whereas cellulose rendered cationic
   by an adsorbed layer of PVAm is oxidized by PAA-T + laccase. There is no
   clear ``best choice{''} mediator/primary oxidant combination for
   cellulose oxidation subsequent to PVAm grafting; the advantages of each

Abstract = {{The effect of cast microstructure on bendability of automotive cast
   aluminum alloy A356 has been studied by machining sheet specimens and
   conducting V-bend tests. Specimens in the loaded condition are observed
   from the through-thickness section using a CCD camera and also using a
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). The latter allowed recording of high
   magnification images from the through-thickness region of the bend to
   determine aspects of strain localization and particle induced damage in
   the microstructure. In addition, the initial microstructure is utilized
   as a speckle pattern for further analysis of through-thickness strain
   development in the bent region using digital image correlation (DIC)
   method. The method is applied to unmodified and Sr-modified A356
   compositions. The results indicate superior bendability of Sr modified
   A356 alloy compared to the unmodified alloy. The differences in
   bendability are attributed to the size and morphology of eutectic Si
   phase particles that undergo significant cracking in the tensile region
   of specimen during bending. The results demonstrate that high
   magnification SEM imaging of bent specimens coupled with DIC based
   strain analysis offers a useful method of analyzing the effect of
   microstructure on bendability of cast materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Gelation of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) dispersions was measured as a
   function of the presence of four nonionic polysaccharides. Addition of
   hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), or locust bean
   gum (LBG) to CNC dispersions induced the gelation of dilute CNC
   dispersions, whereas dextran (DEX) did not. These behaviors correlated
   with adsorption tendencies; HEC, HPG, and LBG adsorbed onto CNC-coated
   quartz crystal microbalance sensors, whereas DEX did not adsorb. We
   propose that the adsorbing polysaccharides greatly increased the
   effective volume fraction of dilute CNC dispersions, driving more of the
   nanocrystals into anisotropic domains. SDS and Triton X-100 addition
   disrupted HEC CNC gels whereas CTAB did not. Surface plasmon resonance
   measurements with CNC-coated sensors showed that SDS and Triton X-100
   partially removed adsorbed HEC, whereas CTAB did not. These behaviors
   illustrate the complexities associated with including CNC dispersions in
   formulated products: low CNC contents can induce spectacular changes in
   rheology; however, surfactants and soluble polymers may promote gel
   formation or induce CNC coagulation.}},

Abstract = {{We recently reported on the multilayer printing of sol-gel/enzyme
   bioinks onto porous filter paper to create bioactive paper test strips.
   The method involves printing of four inks: a polymer underlayer, a
   sol-gel-based silica layer, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme layer,
   and finally a top layer of silica. To improve our understanding of the
   nature of these printed materials, filter paper printed with various ink
   components was characterized by activity assays (with and without
   protease treatment), confocal microscopy to assess the location and
   mixing of layers, and scanning electron microscopy of deposited inks to
   assess the morphology and ink location. Although the silica and enzyme
   solutions were printed sequentially, they formed a composite material
   within the porous paper network and coated only the fibers as a 35 +/-
   15 nm thin film without filling the macropores. The silica coating on
   the cellulose fibers was sufficiently flexible to allow bending of the
   paper substrate, unlike traditional silica thin films. The protease
   assay results showed that the AChE was more protected as the amount of
   sol-gel-derived silica printed on paper was increased. The top layer of
   sol-gel ink was found to play a critical role in protection against
   proteolysis, while the bottom layer of sol-gel ink was found to be
   necessary to prevent the potential inhibition of AChE by the cationic
   polymer (used as a capture agent for the product of the enzymatic
   reaction). Overall, the data show that inkjet-printed sol-gel materials
   form thin, protein-entrapping films that are suitable for the production
   of printed biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was polymerized in bulk via atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP) with azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) and
   tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) as initiator for continuous activator
   regeneration (ICAR). The ATRP was first carried out up to high
   conversion at 70 degrees C. When the system reached its glass state at
   about 94\%, the polymerization temperature was elevated to 120 degrees C
   to maximize the conversion.-Livingness of the ICAR ATRP process and
   control of polymer molecular weight at high conversion were carefully
   examined to elucidate the mechanisms of diffusion-controlled reactions.
   The ``gel effect{''} started at about 50\% conversion, and it was
   accompanied by molecular weight distribution broadening. A dramatic
   increase in polydispersity was observed at above 90\% conversion. The
   loss of control over molecular weight was caused by diffusion-controlled
   deactivation, which could be reduced to some extent by increasing
   deactivator concentration. However, despite the loss of control at high
   conversion, livingness of the system did not suffer, owing to
   diffusion-controlled termination. The polymer chains collected at very
   high conversion could be easily extended with high efficiency.}},

Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising solution for the effective
   control of process supply chains. This paper presents an
   optimization-based decision support tool for supply chain management, by
   means of a robust MPC strategy. The proposed formulation: (i) captures
   uncertainty in model parameters and demand by stochastic programming,
   (ii) accommodates hybrid process systems with decisions governed by
   logical conditions/rulesets, and (iii) addresses multiple supply chain
   performance metrics including customer service and economics, within an
   integrated optimization framework. Two mechanisms for uncertainty
   propagation are presented - an open-loop approach, and an approximate
   closed-loop strategy. The performance of the robust MPC framework is
   analyzed through its application to two process supply chain case
   studies. The proposed approach is shown to provide a substantial
   reduction in the occurrence of back orders when compared to a nominal
   MPC implementation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An odor-based sensor system that exploits the metabolic enzyme
   tryptophanase (TPase) as the key component is reported. This enzyme is
   able to convert an odorless substrate like S-methyl-L-cysteine or
   L-tryptophan into the odorous products methyl mercaptan or indole. To
   make a biosensor, TPase was biotinylated so that it could be coupled
   with a molecular recognition element, such as an antibody, to develop an
   ELISA-like assay. This method was used for the detection of an antibody
   present in nM concentrations by the human nose. TPase can also be
   combined with the enzyme pyridoxal kinase (PKase) for use in a coupled
   assay to detect adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP). When ATP is present in
   the low M concentration range, the coupled enzymatic system generates an
   odor that is easily detectable by the human nose. Biotinylated TPase can
   be combined with various biotin-labeled molecular recognition elements,
   thereby enabling a broad range of applications for this odor-based
   reporting system.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal quenching of luminescence of Er dopants in Si nano-crystals
   (Si-nc's) was investigated employing an impedance model for the analysis
   of photo-injected charges. Relaxation response indicated that Er doping
   forms not only optical centers but also trapping centers near the
   Si-nc's. The response time constant of trapped charges was dependent on
   temperature, with the dependence correlating to thermal quenching. These
   findings indicate that quenching occurs by trapping followed by
   consumption of charges. The complex analyses revealed that the response
   represents non-radiative recombination at the centers rather than
   release of confined charges from the Si-nc through the centers. We
   propose a possible energy diagram for the non-radiative recombination.

   Reinforced Masonry Structural Walls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Since the conclusion of the test programs carried out by the Joint
   U.S.-Japan Technical Coordinating Committee on Masonry Research (TCCMAR)
   during the 1970s and 1980s, there has been little progress made to
   enhance the shear strength expressions used for masonry design. The
   experimentally-derived expressions currently employed by North American
   design codes are based on the 45 degrees cracked member assumption and
   truss analogy, where shear strength is expressed as an algebraic
   summation of resistance offered by masonry, axial load, and shear
   reinforcement. By contrast, the modified compression field theory
   (MCFT), which has gained a wide acceptance within the concrete design
   community, demonstrates that the 45 degrees cracked member assumption
   can be overly conservative. Yet the MCFT or similar equilibrium-based
   approaches have often been thought of as incompatible with masonry due
   to the latter's complex anisotropic behavior. However, seismic design
   detailing requirements within North America typically require the
   highly-susceptible plastic hinge region of structural (shear) walls to
   contain vertical and horizontal steel reinforcement in fully grouted
   concrete block units. Under these circumstances, the anisotropic effects
   are greatly reduced and the development of a simplified approach to
   estimate the equilibrium conditions at the shear-critical zone of
   masonry structural walls is possible. Tests on masonry panels conducted
   at McMaster University in Canada are used with existing literature to
   define a set of constitutive relationships for cracked masonry subject
   to stress states that are typical in reinforced masonry structural
   walls. Subsequently, a methodology is proposed to accurately estimate
   the angle of inclination of shear cracking and the shear resistance
   offered by the horizontal reinforcement and the masonry compression
   strut accounting for aggregate interlock effects. The proposed normal
   strain-adjusted shear strength expression (NSSSE) was found to predict
   the shear strength of 57 wall tests reported in literature with a mean
   ratio of experimental to theoretical strengths of
   VExperimental/VTheory=1.16 (C.O.V.=11.4\%) and a 95\% percentile of
   VExperimental/VTheory=0.98.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{TiBC coatings with different phase compositions (nanocrystalline TiBxCy
   or TiB2 phases mixed or not with amorphous carbon, a-C) were prepared by
   magnetron sputtering. These coatings were comparatively studied in terms
   of phase stability after thermal annealing at 250, 500, 750, and 1000
   degrees C in argon using Raman and x-ray absorption near-edge
   spectroscopy techniques. The main differences were observed at
   temperatures above 500 degrees C when oxidation processes occur and the
   mechanical properties deteriorate. At 1000 degrees C, the samples were
   fully oxidized forming a-C, TiO2, and B2O3 as final products. Higher
   hardness and reduced indentation modulus values and better tribological
   properties were observed at 750 degrees C for nanocomposite structures
   including amorphous carbon and ternary TiBxCy phases. This behavior is
   attributed to a protective effect associated with the a-C phase which is
   achieved by the encapsulation of the nanocrystals in the coating and the
   better hard/lubricant phase ratio associated with this type of coating.

Abstract = {{In this work, we show that the well-known Rowe's stress-dilatancy
   relation can be readily recovered from a micromechanical analysis of an
   assembly of rigid particles as a purely dissipative system in the case
   of a regular packing. When the analysis is extended to a random packing,
   one can explicitly incorporate the dependence of fabric, density and
   stress level on dilatancy, a basic aspect of geomaterial behaviour. The

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the cause of poor
   experimental performance of a spatiotemporal pattern correction (SPC)
   scheme that has been proposed as a hearing aid algorithm and to
   determine contexts in which it may provide benefit. The SPC scheme is
   intended to compensate for altered phase response and group delay
   differences in the auditory nerve spiking patterns in impaired ears.
   Based on theoretical models of loudness and the hypothesized importance
   of temporal fine structure for intelligibility, the compensations of the
   SPC scheme are expected to provide benefit; however, preliminary
   experiments revealed that listeners preferred unprocessed or minimally
   processed speech as opposed to complete SPC processed speech.
   Design: An improved version of the SPC scheme was evaluated with a
   computational auditory model in response to a synthesized vowel at
   multiple SPLs. The impaired model auditory nerve response to SPC-aided
   stimuli was compared to the unaided stimuli for spectrotemporal response
   similarity to the healthy auditory model. This comparison included
   analysis of synchronized rate across auditory nerve characteristic
   frequencies and a measure of relative phase response of auditory nerve
   fibers to complex stimuli derived from cross-correlations.
   Results: Analysis indicates that SPC can improve a metric of relative
   phase response at low SPLs, but may do so at the cost of decreased
   spectrotemporal response similarity to the healthy auditory model and
   degraded synchrony to vowel formants. In-depth analysis identifies
   several technical and conceptual problems associated with SPC that need
   to be addressed. These include the following: (1) a nonflat frequency
   response through the analysis-synthesis filterbank that results from
   time-varying changes in the relative temporal alignment of filterbank
   channels, (2) group delay corrections that are based on incorrect
   frequencies because of spread of synchrony in auditory nerve responses,
   and (3) frequency modulations in the processed signal created by the
   insertion of delays.
   Conclusions: Despite these issues, SPC provided benefit to an error
   metric derived from auditory nerve response cross-correlations at low
   SPLs, which may mean phase adjustment is achieved at the expense of
   other metrics, but could be beneficial for low-level speech.}},

Abstract = {{For heterogeneous integration in many More-than-Moore applications,
   surface preparation is the key step to realizing well-bonded multiple
   substrates for electronics, photonics, fluidics and/or mechanical
   components without a degradation in performance. Therefore, it is
   critical to understand how various processing and environmental
   conditions affect their surface properties. In this paper, we
   investigate the effects of oxygen plasma and humidity on some key
   surface properties such as the water contact angle, roughness and
   hardness of three materials: silicon (Si), silicon dioxide (SiO2) and
   glass, and their impact on bondability. The low surface roughness, high
   surface reactivity and high hydrophilicity of Si, SiO2 and glass at
   lower activation times can result in better bondability. Although, the
   surface reactivity of plasma-ambient-humidity-treated Si and SiO2 is
   considerably reduced, their reduction of roughness and increase of
   hydrophilicity may enable good bonding at low temperature heating due to
   augmented hydroxyl groups. The decrease of hardness of Si and SiO2 with
   increased activation time is attributed to higher surface roughness and
   the formation of amorphous layers of Si. While contact angle and surface
   roughness results show a correlation with bondability, the role of
   hardness on bondability requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the hydrologic and hydraulic processes occurring in green

   evaluate the long-term average runoff reduction rates, fractions of time

   extensive and intensive green roofs with or without storage layers, are
   derived by modifying or extending the analytical probabilistic model
   which was previously developed to model probabilistically the
   rainfall-runoff processes occurring on regular catchments. The accuracy
   of these analytical equations is verified by comparing with continuous
   simulation results. Also demonstrated in this paper are the performances

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{83-90}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The ability of microorganisms to use polyethylene as a carbon source has
   only been recently established. This result has significance both from
   an environmental point of view, due to the accumulation of millions of
   tons of waste plastics every year, but also regarding the conservation
   of integrity for infrastructures incorporating this plastic. A number of
   microorganisms with the ability to grow on polyethylene have been
   isolated. The effects of these microorganisms on the physiochemical
   properties of this polymer have been described; these include changes in
   crystallinity, molecular weight, topography of samples and the
   functional groups found on the surface. Although the bio-degradation and
   bio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several
   researchers, the enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these
   phenomena are still unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both
   enzymatic and abiotic factors (such UV light) can mediate the initial
   oxidation of polyethylene chains, and given the chemical similarity
   between polyethylene and olefins it has been suggested that the
   metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be used once the
   size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range for
   enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons). The long-range
   structure and morphology of polyethylene have shown important roles,
   with amorphous regions being more prone to microbial attack than
   crystalline ones. This review focuses on the recent hypotheses and
   experimental findings regarding the biodegradation of polyethylene. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a low-cost modeling methodology for microwave structures
   exploiting low/high-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulations,
   shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP)/generalized shape-preserving
   response prediction (GSPRP), and space mapping (SM). Our approach is a
   two-step process. In step 1, a coarse model is constructed from
   low-fidelity (coarse discretization) EM simulation data by means of a
   recently developed SPRP/GSPRP technique. A comparison between the SPRP
   and GSPRP methods is described. In step 2, the coarse model is enhanced
   by SM using a fine model (high-fidelity EM simulations). We summarize
   the substeps in each step of the proposed algorithm and illustrate them
   graphically. We compare our proposed method with relevant benchmark
   techniques. Our approach is demonstrated by using two microstrip filter
   examples. The results and efficiency of our approach are compared with
   the benchmark techniques, indicating substantial accuracy improvement
   for comparable training set size. Applications for design optimization
   are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous work, a model of full molecular weight distribution (MWD)
   for atom transfer radical polymerization with radical termination has
   been developed, using analogy to a series of continuous stirred tank
   reactors. This model assumes constant reaction rates, which is
   applicable to low conversion batches or steady-state continuous
   processes. In this work, the model is generalized to any polymerization
   condition, which provides variations of the reaction rates with
   conversion are known. Using this extended model, the effect of monomer
   conversion on the MWD is demonstrated, for the cases with and without
   radical termination. The conversion dependence of MWD is found to be
   significant. The broadening of distribution is correlated to the lack of
   control and/or the loss of livingness. Both control and livingness are
   necessary conditions for narrow MWD. It is also found that the effects
   of these two factors are very different, yielding different distribution
   shapes, even with similar average chain lengths (r(N)) and
   polydispersity indexes (PDI).}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a finite element
   model of the distal radius to simulate impact loading. Eight-node
   hexahedral meshes of the bone and impactor components were created.
   Three separate impact events were simulated by altering the impact
   velocity assigned to the model projectile (pre-fracture, crack and
   fracture). Impact forces and maximum and minimum principal strains were
   calculated and used in the validation process by comparing with
   previously collected experimental data. Three measures of mesh quality
   (Jacobians, aspect ratios and orthogonality) and four validation methods
   (validation metric, error assessment, fracture comparisons and ensemble
   averages) assessed the model. The element Jacobians, aspect ratios and
   orthogonality measures ranged from 0.08 to 12, 1.1 to 26 and -70 degrees
   to 80 degrees, respectively. The force and strain validation metric
   ranged from 0.10 to 0.54 and 0.35 to 0.67, respectively. The estimated
   peak axial force was found to be a maximum of 28.5\% greater than the
   experimental (crack) force, and all forces fell within +/- 2 standard
   deviation of the mean experimental fracture forces. The predicted
   strains were found to differ by a mean of 33\% across all impact events,
   and the model was found to accurately predict the location and severity
   of bone damage. Overall, the model presented here is a valid
   representation of the distal radius subjected to impact.}},

Abstract = {{Non-native oligomeric forms of biopharmaceutical proteins are
   therapeutically inactive, and potentially toxic and immunogenic, and
   therefore undesirable in pharmaceutical formulations. Immunoglobulin G
   class of antibodies are known to form stable nonnative oligomers through
   Fab-Fab interactions. In this paper, we investigate thermal-cycling as a
   technique for disaggregating antibody oligomers. Aggregate containing
   monoclonal antibody (mAb) samples were exposed to rapid heating and
   cooling cycles in a thermal-cycler. The heating phase of the
   thermal-cycle resulted in partial unfolding of the Fab domain, leading
   to the release of monomer from the oligomer complexes, whereas the rapid
   cooling that followed led to refolding and minimized the probability of
   protein reaggregation. The extent of mAb oligomer disaggregation was
   determined by size-exclusion chromatography and hydrophobic interaction
   membrane chromatography, whereas protein refolding was assessed by
   circular dichroism spectroscopy. The thermal-cycling technique in
   addition to being suitable for disaggregating protein oligomer samples
   could also potentially be useful for studying the mechanisms of protein
   aggregation and disaggregation. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Grassmannian quantization codebooks play a central role in a number of
   limited feedback schemes for single and multi-user multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. In practice, it is often
   desirable that these codebooks possess additional properties that
   facilitate their implementation, beyond the provision of good
   quantization performance. Although some good codebooks exist, their
   design tends to be a rather intricate task. The goal of this paper is to
   suggest a flexible approach to the design of Grassmannian codebooks
   based on sequential smooth optimization on the Grassmannian manifold and
   the use of smooth penalty functions to obtain additional desirable
   properties. As one example, the proposed approach is used to design
   rank-2 codebooks that have a nested structure and elements from a
   phase-shift keying (PSK) alphabet. In some numerical comparisons,
   codebooks designed using the proposed methods have larger minimum
   distances than some existing codebooks, and provide tangible performance
   gains when applied to a simple MIMO downlink scenario with zero-forcing
   beamforming, per-user unitary beamforming and rate control ((PURC)-R-2),
   and block diagonalization signalling. Furthermore, the proposed approach
   yields codebooks that attain desirable additional properties without
   incurring a substantial degradation in performance.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of bainitic transformation time on the microstructure and
   mechanical properties was investigated in a steel containing 0.4 pct
   C-2.8 pct Mn-1.8 pct Si. The microstructure was characterized using
   optical and transmission electron microscopy; it consisted of bainitic
   ferrite, martensite, and retained austenite. The volume fraction of
   bainite increased from 0.4 for the shortest bainitic transformation time
   (30 minutes) to 0.9 at the longest time (120 minutes). The above
   microstructures exhibited an extended elasto-plastic transition leading
   to very high initial work-hardening rates. The work-hardening behavior
   was investigated in detail using strain-path reversals to measure the
   back stresses. These measurements point to a substantial kinematic
   hardening due to the mechanical contrast between the microstructural
   constituents. The onset of necking coincided with the saturation of
   kinematic hardening. Examination of the fracture surfaces indicated that
   the prior austenite grain boundaries play an important role in the
   fracture process. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{A theory for polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) in atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been derived by using analogy
   to a series of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). This approach
   relates one activation cycle in ATRP to one reactor in CSTRs. The
   derived MWD expression includes effect of radical termination and allows
   detailed investigation on the factors that determine the polymer
   distribution, namely the level of control and livingness. The level of
   control means the average number of activation cycles experienced by
   individual chains. The degree of livingness is quantified by the
   fraction of terminated chains. It was found that the effect of
   livingness and control on MWD is complex. Large number of activation
   cycles does not guarantee a narrow distribution. There exists an optimum
   value of activation cycles to achieve the lowest polydispersity by
   balancing the control (achieved by increasing activation cycles) with
   the loss of livingness (also caused by increasing activation cycles).
   The distribution for ATRP is in-between Poisson and Flory distributions,
   determined by the level of control and livingness. In general, having
   high degree of livingness and maintaining control are both necessary
   conditions to obtain narrow MWD. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Abstract = {{In this paper, nonlinear state estimation problems with modeling
   uncertainties are considered. As demonstrated recently in literature,
   the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) provides the closest known
   approximation to the Bayesian filter in the sense of preserving
   second-order information contained in noisy measurements under the
   Gaussian assumption. The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) has
   also been recently introduced and has been shown to be robust to
   modeling uncertainties. In an effort to utilize the accuracy of the CKF
   and the robustness of the SVSF, the CKF and SVSF have been combined
   resulting in an algorithm referred to as the CK-SVSF. The robustness and
   accuracy of the CK-SVSF was validated by testing it on two different
   computer problems, namely, a target tracking problem and the estimation
   of the effective bulk modulus in an electrohydrostatic actuator. (C)

   enhancement on consolidation, sintering condition, hardness and
   toughness values of the multilayer samples was evaluated. The results
   showed that the cracks were distributed in the co-sintering

   successive layers. The final shape and mechanical properties of the

Abstract = {{High purity H-2 production using microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) is
   often limited by methanogenesis. Here methanogenesis was effectively
   controlled by electrolytic oxygen production. Oxygen production was
   induced intermittently using two stainless steel electrodes, which were
   used as the MEC cathode during Normal operation. It was found that
   oxygen should be produced every 12 h or more frequently because of rapid
   hydrogenotrophic methanogen growth with available pure H-2. This method
   was also effective in an initially methanogen-dominated MEG. However,
   the growth of aerobic biofilms in MECs weakened methanogen control.
   Residual oxygen after fed-batch cycles was found to be the key indicator
   for effective methane control. Methane content was consistently smaller
   than 10\% at the threshold residual oxygen volume (3 mL) or greater. MEG
   operation at such threshold conditions will allow high purity H-2
   production, low energy consumption for O-2 production and minimal O-2
   exposure on bioanodes, enabling sustainable wastewater treatment and
   energy recovery using MECs. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{This study presents a new model for predicting the response of a
   two-dimensional tuned liquid damper (TLD) tank with a variable fluid
   depth. A simple finite element method is presented, which is used to
   calculate the sloshing mode shapes. From the mode shapes, the equivalent
   mechanical properties of the sloshing fluid are estimated. Three tanks
   (flat-bottom, triangular-bottom, and circular-bottom), which have
   closed-form expressions for their equivalent mechanical properties are
   used to evaluate the model. The proposed model is in agreement with the
   closed-form expressions. Subsequently, a parametric study is conducted
   on tanks with a chamfered-bottom, boxed-bottom, and ramped-bottom to
   assess how their properties change as the shape of the tank bottom is
   altered. The model provides TLD designers with greater flexibility when
   selecting a tank shape. Moreover, the model could be used to optimize
   the shape of a TLD tank to maximize its performance for a given liquid
   mass, allowing construction cost savings to be realized.}},

Abstract = {{Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and atom
   probe tomography (APT) measurements were jointly used for the first time
   to probe the local structure around Sr atoms in Al-10\%Sr master alloy
   and in Al-3\%Si-0.04\%Sr and Al-12.5\%Si-0.04\%Sr eutectic alloys in
   order to study the impact of trace levels of Sr on the morphological
   changes occurring in Al-Si binary eutectic alloy. EXAFS analysis shows
   the oxidation states of Sr is close to Sr in all the alloys studied. In
   the Al-10\%Sr master alloy, Sr atoms tend to form the intermetallic
   compound Al4Sr. On the other hand, in Al-Si alloys, Sr atoms segregate
   towards Si-rich regions, preferentially bonding to Si atoms to form
   Al2Si2Sr-like clusters with a coordination environment consistent with
   bulk Al2Si2Sr. APT study reveals the presence of nanometer-sized Al-rich
   and Si-rich regions and support the EXAFS results. We speculate that
   addition of trace levels of Sr to Al-Si binary alloy system results in
   the initial formation of Al2Si2Sr-like clusters and the presence of such
   intermetallic clusters could play an important role such as poisoning of
   nucleation sites, thereby delaying the nucleation of eutectic phases and
   causing the morphological changes of the eutectic phases in the Al-Si
   alloys. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper reports the production of well-defined, highly stable Ag-Au
   alloy nanoparticles (NPs) using living cells of Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtii, with the composition of the bimetallic alloys being solely
   determined by the stoichiometric ratio in which the metal salts were
   added to the cultures. The NPs exhibited a single, well-defined surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) band confirming that they were made of a
   homogeneous population of bimetallic alloys. Particle creation by the
   cells occurred in three stages: (1) internalization of the noble metals
   by the cells and their reduction resulting in the formation of the NPs;
   (2) entrapment of the NPs in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding
   the cells, where they are colloidally stabilized; and (3) release of the
   NPs from the ECM to the culture medium. We also investigated the effect
   of the addition of the metals salts on cell viability and the impact on
   characteristics of the NPs formed. When silver was added to the
   cultures, cell viability was decreased and this resulted in a similar to
   30 nm red shift on the SPR band due to changes in the surrounding
   environment into which the NPs were released. The same observations (in
   SPR and cell viability) was made when gold was added to a final
   concentration of 2 x 10(-4) M, but not when the concentration was equal
   to 10(-4) M, where cell viability was high and the red shift was
   negligible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of protein adsorption is an important consideration in the
   biocompatibility of biomaterials. Various experimental methods can be
   used to determine the quantity of protein adsorbed, but the results
   usually differ. In the present work, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
   were used to prepare a series of model gold surfaces varying
   systematically in water wettability, from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.
   Three commonly used methods, namely, surface plasmon resonance (SPR),
   quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), and
   I-125-radiolabeling, were employed to quantify fibrinogen (Fg)
   adsorption on these surfaces. This approach allows a direct comparison
   of the mass of Fg adsorbed using these three techniques. The results
   from all three methods showed that protein adsorption increases with
   increasing surface hydrophobicity. The increase in the mass of Fg
   adsorbed with increasing surface hydrophobicity in the SPR data was
   parallel to that from I-125-radiolabeling, but the absolute values were
   different and there does not seem to be a ``universally congruent{''}
   relationship between the two methods for surfaces with varying
   wettability. For QCM-D, the variation in protein adsorption with
   wettability was different from that for SPR and radiolabeling. On the
   more hydrophobic surfaces, QCM-D gave an adsorbed mass much higher than
   from the two other methods, possibly because QCM-D measures both the
   adsorbed Fg and its associated water. However, on the more hydrophilic
   surfaces, the adsorbed mass from QCM-D was slightly greater than that
   from SPR, and both were smaller than from I-125-radiolabeling; this was
   true no matter whether the Sauerbrey equation or the Voigt model was
   used to convert QCM-D data to adsorbed mass.}},

Abstract = {{In the electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) context,
   brain source localization methods that rely on estimating second-order
   statistics often fail when the number of samples of the recorded data
   sequences is small in comparison to the number of electrodes. This
   condition is particularly relevant when measuring evoked potentials. Due
   to the correlated background EEG/MEG signal, an adaptive approach to
   localization is desirable. Previous work has addressed these issues by
   reducing the adaptive degrees of freedom (DoFs). This reduction results
   in decreased resolution and accuracy of the estimated source
   configuration. This paper develops and tests a new multistage adaptive
   processing technique based on the minimum variance beamformer for brain
   source localization that has been previously used in the radar
   statistical signal processing context. This processing, referred to as
   the fast fully adaptive (FFA) approach, can significantly reduce the
   required sample support, while still preserving all available DoFs. To
   demonstrate the performance of the FFA approach in the limited data
   scenario, simulation and experimental results are compared with two
   previous beamforming approaches; i.e., the fully adaptive minimum
   variance beamforming method and the beamspace beamforming method. Both
   simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the FFA method can
   localize all types of brain activity more accurately than the other
   approaches with limited data.}},

Abstract = {{SU-8-based photonic-microfluidic integrated devices with on-chip beam
   shaping and collection capabilities were demonstrated in a scattering
   detection and counting application. Through the proper deployment of the
   tailored beam geometries via the on-chip excitation optics, excellent CV
   values were measured for 1, 2, and 5 m blank beads, 16.4, 11.0, and
   12.5\%, respectively, coupled with a simple free-space optical detection
   scheme. The performance of these devices was found dependent on the
   combination of on-chip, lens-shaped beam geometry and bead size. While
   very low CVs were obtained when the combination was ideal, a nonideal
   combination could still result in acceptable CVs for flow cytometry; the
   reliability was confirmed via devices being able to resolve separate
   populations of 2.0 and 5.0 m beads from their mixture with low CV values
   of 15.9 and 18.5\%, respectively. On-chip collection using integrated
   on-chip optical waveguides was shown to be very reliable in comparison
   with a free-space collection scheme, yielding a coincident rate of
   94.2\%. A CV as low as 19.2\% was obtained from the on-chip excitation
   and collection of 5 m beads when the on-chip lens-shaped beam had a
   6.0-m beam waist.}},

Title = {{Explaining the high voice superiority effect in polyphonic music:
   Evidence from cortical evoked potentials and peripheral auditory models}},
Journal = {{HEARING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{308}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{60-70}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Natural auditory environments contain multiple simultaneously-sounding
   objects and the auditory system must parse the incoming complex sound
   wave they collectively create into parts that represent each of these
   individual objects. Music often similarly requires processing of more
   than one voice or stream at the same time, and behavioral studies
   demonstrate that human listeners show a systematic perceptual bias in
   processing the highest voice in multi-voiced music. Here, we review
   studies utilizing event-related brain potentials (ERPs), which support
   the notions that (1) separate memory traces are formed for two
   simultaneous voices (even without conscious awareness) in auditory
   cortex and (2) adults show more robust encoding (i.e., larger ERP
   responses) to deviant pitches in the higher than in the lower voice,
   indicating better encoding of the former. Furthermore, infants also show
   this high-voice superiority effect, suggesting that the perceptual
   dominance observed across studies might result from neurophysiological
   characteristics of the peripheral auditory system. Although musically
   untrained adults show smaller responses in general than musically
   trained adults, both groups similarly show a more robust cortical
   representation of the higher than of the lower voice. Finally, years of
   experience playing a bass-range instrument reduces but does not reverse
   the high voice superiority effect, indicating that although it can be
   modified, it is not highly neuroplastic. Results of new modeling
   experiments examined the possibility that characteristics of middle-ear
   filtering and cochlear dynamics (e.g., suppression) reflected in
   auditory nerve firing patterns might account for the higher-voice
   superiority effect. Simulations show that both place and temporal AN
   coding schemes well-predict a high-voice superiority across a wide range
   of interval spacings and registers. Collectively, we infer an innate,
   peripheral origin for the higher-voice superiority observed in human ERP
   and psychophysical music listening studies.

Abstract = {{Pulsed arc electrohydraulic discharge (PAED) is a kind of thermal plasma
   arc discharge phenomenon which can generate strong pressure wave,
   ultraviolet ray and active groups. Therefore, PAED can act as a
   significant role applying on the technology of water treatment and it
   has broad application prospects. Compared with the existing water
   treatment mechanism, the technology of PAED possesses the most
   sterilization efficient and no secondary pollution. There are a huge
   number of plasma, active groups and gas liquid mixtures generated
   between the two arc electrodes in the water medium when the streamer
   discharge voltage is 3 similar to 5 kV. In addition, water conductivity
   is also changed with the development of pulse arc electrohydraulic
   discharge which should be the prime importance in the process of PAED.
   In this article, firstly we analyzed the discharge mechanism on the
   process of pulsed arc electrohydraulic discharge. After that how the
   conductivity had played a major role in the process of pre-breakdown
   discharge and the main discharge processes will be discussed in detail.
   Experiments were conducted to research the relation among the
   conductivity, the pressure wave, active groups, ultraviolet light,
   discharge current and voltage generated from PAED. In finally the result
   can become a basis for using the water treatment tech of pulsed arc
   electrohydraulic discharge on different conductivity. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{A compact model for the current-voltage characteristics of organic
   thin-film transistors (OTFTs), which includes the effects of the contact
   regions, is proposed. Different physical and morphological aspects of
   contacts with organic or other emerging materials such as graphene,
   semiconducting dichalcogenides such as MoS2, or NW devices are
   described. The electrical behavior of the contacts is studied in OTFTs,
   and circuit models that describe them are reviewed. Two trends are
   observed in the current-voltage curves of the contacts of different
   OTFTs: linear and nonlinear, and different models are used to explain
   them. A unified model for the contact region that reproduces both trends
   and gathers the different physical and structural features of the
   contacts is developed. It is described by a single parameter and
   introduced in a generic analytical model for TFTs. The variability in
   OTFT structures, materials, and fabrication approaches gives rise to a
   strong variability in the values of the parameters of the model. In this
   regard, a characterization technique to determine the value of the
   parameters of the model from experimental data is also developed.
   Different physical tests are proposed to validate the results of the
   technique. The procedure is applied to recent experimental data for
   different pentacene-based transistors. The good agreement between the
   experimental data and our analytical results provides a way to relate
   the parameters of the model with the physical or geometrical origin of
   the contact effects in OTFTs.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In many industrial applications, it is important to identify defects on
   specular surfaces. On machined surfaces, defect identification may be
   further complicated by the presence of marks from a machining process.
   These marks may dramatically and unpredictably change the appearance of
   the surface, while not altering its ability to function. To
   differentiate between surface characteristics that constitute a defect
   and those that do not, we propose a system that directly illuminates
   specular machined surfaces with a programmable array of high-power
   light-emitting diodes that allows the angle of the incident light to be
   varied over a series of images. A reflection model is used to predict
   the reflected intensity as a function of incident lighting angle for
   each point on the imaged surface. A surface defect causes the observed
   reflected intensity as a function of incident lighting angle to differ
   from that predicted by the reflection model. Such differences between
   the observations and the reflection model are shown to identify surface
   defects such as porosities, dents and scratches in the presence of marks
   from the machining process.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the source-channel separation architecture for lossy source
   coding in communication networks. It is shown that the separation
   approach is optimal in two general scenarios and is approximately
   optimal in a third scenario. The two scenarios for which separation is
   optimal complement each other: the first is when the memoryless sources
   at source nodes are arbitrarily correlated, each of which is to be
   reconstructed at possibly multiple destinations within certain
   distortions, but the channels in this network are synchronized,
   orthogonal, and memoryless point-to-point channels; the second is when
   the memoryless sources are mutually independent, each of which is to be
   reconstructed only at one destination within a certain distortion, but
   the channels are general, including multi-user channels, such as
   multiple access, broadcast, interference, and relay channels, possibly
   with feedback. The third scenario, for which we demonstrate approximate
   optimality of source-channel separation, generalizes the second scenario
   by allowing each source to be reconstructed at multiple destinations
   with different distortions. For this case, the loss from optimality
   using the separation approach can be upper-bounded when a difference
   distortion measure is taken, and in the special case of quadratic
   distortion measure, this leads to universal constant bounds.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) are a relatively new type
   of elastomeric bearing. FREIs utilize fiber material for the reinforcing
   layers instead of steel which is used in conventional steel reinforced
   elastomeric isolators (SREIs). Unlike SREIs, where the steel reinforcing
   material is usually assumed to be rigid in extension, the reinforcing
   fiber layers are considered to be flexible in extension. As a result,
   the vertical response characteristics of FREIs differ from those of
   SREIs. In this study, a 3D parametric numerical finite element analysis
   (FEA) is carried out on sixteen circular FREI bearings. All bearings
   investigated have the same overall dimensions, while the thickness of
   elastomer layers and the axial stiffness of reinforcement are the
   parameters that are varied. FEA results, in terms of deformed shape,
   stiffness, stress and/or strain in reinforcing and elastomer layers are
   compared with predicted values obtained using the pressure solution and
   the pressure approach methods. Good overall agreement was observed
   between the FEA results and the results obtained from analytical
   solutions. It was concluded that the end boundary effect, which is often
   neglected, becomes a contributing factor on the vertical response for
   bearings reinforced with flexible reinforcements, or bearings with low
   shape factor values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   cladding on a rate-insensitive core material has been studied. A
   nonlinear long-wavelength analysis, similar to the one proposed by
   Hutchinson and Neale (1977, ``Influence of Strain-Rate Sensitivity on
   Necking Under Uniaxial Tension,{''} Acta Metal., 25, pp. 839-846) for
   monolithic rate-sensitive materials, is developed to identify the onset
   of necking in a rate-sensitive clad sheet. This relatively simple
   analysis is validated by comparing its numerical results with those
   based on more complicated finite element analysis. It is demonstrated
   that for monolithic rate-sensitive materials the proposed nonlinear
   analysis reduces to the one developed by Hutchinson and Neale (1977).
   For cladding sheets, it is found that the necking strain increases
   monotonically by increasing the strain-rate sensitivity of the clad
   layer if the volume fraction of cladding is fixed. It is also revealed
   that, for fixed strain-rate sensitivity of the clad layer, necking
   localization is retarded by increasing the volume fraction of the
   cladding layer.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the optical properties of light emission based on the
   resonance energy transfer mechanism between two molecules in the
   host-dopant systems. For this purpose, we fabricated the organic
   light-emitting devices with the different doped emissive layers. The
   host matrices were made of 4,4',4 `'-tris(carbasol-l-nyl)triphenylamine
   (TCTA) and 2-methyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (MADN) molecules and
   the doped molecules were 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphtacene (Rubrene) and
   4-(Dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidin-4-yl-v
   inyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB). The concentrations of the doped molecules were
   0.1\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\%, and 0.8\%. Through spectroscopic analysis using
   multi-peak fits with a Gaussian function to the emission spectra, we
   obtained the relative light intensity of the two dopants according to
   the doping concentrations and examined the relations between the
   molecular excited energy states and the nature of energy transfer in the
   host and dopant systems. We show that the luminous efficiency of the
   devices has a strong correlation between the energy transfer owing to
   the individual molecular intrinsic properties and the electrical
   characteristics associated with the bulky properties in the devices. (C)

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the CONFIDANT protocol (Buchegger and Boudec in Proceedings
   of the 3rd ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking \&
   Computing, pp. 226-236, 2002), we define and study a basic
   reputation-based protocol in multihop wireless networks with selfish
   nodes. Its reputation mechanism is implemented through the ability of
   any node to define a threshold of tolerance for any of its neighbors,
   and to cut the connection to any of these neighbors that refuse to
   forward an amount of flow above that threshold. The main question we
   would like to address is whether one can set the initial conditions so
   that the system reaches an equilibrium state where a non-zero amount of
   every commodity is routed. This is important in emergency situations,
   where all nodes need to be able to communicate even with a small
   bandwidth. Following a standard approach, we model this protocol as a
   game, and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
   of non-trivial Nash equilibria. Then we enhance these conditions with
   extra conditions that give a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
   for the existence of connected Nash equilibria. We note that it is not
   always necessary for all the flow originating at a node to reach its
   destination at equilibrium. For example, a node may be using
   unsuccessful flow in order to effect changes in a distant part of the
   network that will prove quite beneficial to it. We show that we can
   decide in polynomial time whether there exists a (connected) equilibrium
   without unsuccessful flows. In that case we calculate (in polynomial
   time) initial values that impose such an equilibrium on the network. On
   the negative side, we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a
   connected equilibrium exists in general (i.e., with some nodes using
   unsuccessful flows at equilibrium).}},

Abstract = {{Sensible and latent heat that is stored in materials cannot be typically
   used over long periods, such as seasons, due to heat losses. Storing
   thermal energy in the form of chemical potential circumvents this issue.
   We present a numerical model capable of simulating adsorption/desorption
   based energy release/storage processes for given input material
   properties, operating conditions and geometric configurations. Since an
   analysis of flow in porous media can involve a multitude of empirical
   constants, making the design tool less general, our approach is more
   fundamental. The model is based on the species transport equation to
   characterize the adsorption and desorption in a porous solid and is
   validated against an experimental study. Without requiring microscopic
   details of pore structure, it provides the spatial and temporal
   variations in moisture concentration and temperature during the
   adsorption and desorption processes in the porous material. Through
   parametric variations of input conditions, the proposed model/tool can
   be used to identify adsorbent-adsorbate pairs for optimal performance.

Abstract = {{Partial least-squares (PLS) method has been widely used in multivariate
   statistical process monitoring field. The goal of traditional PLS is to
   find the multidimensional directions in the measurement-variable and
   quality-variable spaces that have the maximum covariances. Therefore,
   PLS method relies on the second-order statistics of covariance only but
   does not takes into account the higher-order statistics that may involve
   certain key features of non-Gaussian processes. Moreover, the
   derivations of control limits for T-2 and squared prediction error (SPE)
   indices in PLS-based monitoring method are based on the assumption that
   the process data follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution
   approximately. Meanwhile, independent component analysis (ICA) approach
   has recently been developed for process monitoring, where the goal is to
   find the independent components (ICs) that are assumed to be
   non-Gaussian and mutually independent by means of maximizing the
   high-order statistics such as negentropy instead of the second-order
   statistics including variance and covariance. Nevertheless, the IC
   directions do not take into account the contributions from quality
   variables and, thus, ICA may not work well for process monitoring in the
   situations when the quality variables have strong influence on process
   operations. To capture the non-Gaussian relationships between process
   measurement and quality variables, a novel projection-based monitoring
   method termed as quality relevant non-Gaussian latent subspace
   projection (QNGLSP) approach is proposed in this article. This new
   technique searches for the feature directions within the
   measurement-variable and quality-variable spaces concurrently so that
   the two sets of feature directions or subspaces have the maximized
   multidimensional mutual information. Further, the new monitoring indices
   including I-2 and SPE statistics are developed for quality relevant
   fault detection of non-Gaussian processes. The proposed QNGLSP approach
   is applied to the Tennessee Eastman Chemical process and the process
   monitoring results of the present method are demonstrated to be superior
   to those of the PLS-based monitoring method. (c) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{The bandwidth bottleneck looming for traditional electronic
   interconnects has driven the consideration of optical communications
   technologies as realized through the complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible silicon nanophotonic platform.
   Within the silicon photonics platform, silicon microring resonators have
   received a great deal of attention for their ability to implement the
   critical functionalities of an on-chip optical network while offering
   superior energy-efficiency and small footprint characteristics. However,
   silicon microring-based structures have a large susceptibility to
   fabrication errors and changes in temperature. Integrated heaters that
   provide local heating of individual microrings offer a method to correct
   for these effects, but no large-scale solution has been achieved to

Abstract = {{PEGylated proteins are value-added biopharmaceutical products obtained
   by conjugating poly (ethylene glycol) or PEG with proteins It is
   difficult to simultaneously obtain both high selectivity and extent of
   synthesis of mono-PEGylated protein using a conventional batch reaction.
   This paper discusses a hollow-fiber membrane reactor (HMR) system
   suitable for addressing this issue. The HMR system was operated in a
   continuous mode with the protein being pumped directly into the lumen of
   the fiber and the PEG reagent being introduced in the hollow-fiber in a
   distributed manner along its length. The PEG concentration at any
   location within the reactor thereby was lower than the protein
   concentration, and thus the synthesis of higher PEGylated by-products
   was suppressed, leading to an increase in selectivity of
   mono-PEGylation. An additional factor that contributed towards the
   enhancement in selectivity was the radial concentration gradient of
   reactants and product within the hollow-fiber, which resulted in the
   diffusion of mono-PEGylated protein away from the reaction zone, thus
   further suppressing the synthesis of the higher PEGylated forms. The
   extent and selectivity of monoPEGylation obtained with the HMR system
   were significantly higher than that obtained in equivalent batch
   reaction. Furthermore, a continuous process is much more desirable than
   a batch process from a manufacturing point of view. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   Diffusion Solidification (CDS) process technology was employed to
   demonstrate the ability to cast AA7050 wrought alloy into high integrity

   mass and subsequently casting the resultant mixture into near net shaped
   cast components. The process enables casting of the high performance Al
   wrought alloys into near net shaped components by circumventing the
   problem of hot tearing by obtaining a non-dendritic morphology of the
   primary Al phase. This study presents the process and alloy parameters
   necessary for the casting of 7050 Al wrought alloy (Al-Zn-Mg-Cu) using
   the CDS process technology. The uniaxial tensile properties after
   various heat treatment conditions such as as-cast, solutionizing and

Abstract = {{The design of stimulus-responsive materials, particularly those intended
   to respond to more than one stimulus, is an inherently challenging and
   typically trial-and-error process involving multiple synthesis/
   characterization iterations in the laboratory. In this work, latent
   variable models are applied to existing, ``failed{''} polymer
   formulations and characterizations to facilitate the rational design of
   materials with specific, targeted properties and to predict responsive
   polymer properties before synthesizing the materials in the laboratory.
   The models are capable of simultaneously predicting three targeted
   polymer properties (cloud point, molecular weight, and \% recovery of
   polymer mass) for poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based materials that can
   be reversibly photo-crosslinked. Model inversion and optimization are
   used to identify new polymer formulations that exhibit significantly
   improved properties relative to the formulations developed by chemical
   intuition based on available literature. This model-based design
   approach moves away from the traditional trial-and-error approach to
   save time, energy, and resources in the production of novel materials
   while at the same time generating responsive polymers with improved

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a precise parameter extraction for organic thin-film
   transistors (OTFTs) operating in the linear regime. The precision is
   achieved by utilizing the mathematical functions Y-VG and H-VG that are
   derived from measured current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, in a proper
   sequence. The Y-VG function compensates for the impact of the contact
   resistance R-c on the I-V characteristics of the OTFT. The H-VG function
   applied on the Y-VG function is used to determine the mobility
   enhancement factor gamma>0, which allows for defining the gamma Y-VG
   function for OTFT that is linearly proportional to the gate-overdrive
   voltage (V-G-V-T). The linearity of the gamma Y-VG function allows for
   extraction of the threshold voltage V-T and the mobility mu in the OTFT.
   Using the extracted parameters, the reduction of the experimental data
   for drain-source resistance with the resistance model for the intrinsic
   channel allows for accurate determination of R-C. The precision of the
   extraction technique is verified by re-simulation that uses the
   extracted values of the parameters, and the re-simulation accurately
   replicates the measurement of the current and the transconductance of
   the OTFT. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the potential benefits of applying short-term
   continuous-time scheduling optimization to an industrial multiproduct
   food processing plant. The facility exhibits several unique production
   policies that are not supported by current continuous-time scheduling
   models. Several extensions to a general global event continuous-time
   scheduling model are proposed to address these limitations. In addition,
   problem knowledge is exploited to develop an aggregate reformulation of
   the model for application to the target problem. The potential benefits
   of scheduling optimization are assessed through several case studies.
   Historical plant performance is benchmarked, and the possible gains in
   production efficiency are highlighted. In addition, the scheduling
   models are used to evaluate potential benefits of operating policy and

Abstract = {{Presurgical mapping in a pediatric patient diagnosed with arteriovenous
   malformation in the left hemisphere revealed a case of apparent
   functional reorganization of a white matter tract.
   Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to identify the motor fields
   following hand movement. As expected, motor field activity for the left
   hand was detected in the right hemisphere. Surprisingly, MEG activity
   was also detected in the right hemisphere following movement of the
   right hand. MEG activations served as seeds from which to launch
   diffusion tensor imaging tractography to delineate the corticospinal
   tracts (CSTs). Using the MEG activation for movement of the right hand,
   we delineated a tract in the right hemisphere. A tract corresponding to
   motor function for the left hand was also delineated in the right
   hemisphere. For comparison, the CSTs of the patient were launched from
   anatomical landmarks at the precentral gyrus, and were successfully
   delineated in each hemisphere. Our findings suggest that the functional
   delineation of white matter pathways may be more sensitive than
   anatomical delineation for identifying reorganization of the developing
   brain in response to a lesion. This study is, to our knowledge, the
   first description of a functional reorganization of an existing tract to
   serve as a CST in children. (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar

Abstract = {{This paper presents the technological development and application of
   hydrated lime in treating the surface of asphalt concrete to develop
   light-coloured, grey asphalt pavements. When appropriately applied on
   the surface of fresh asphalt concrete, hydrated lime makes the surface
   grey, significantly increases its albedo and effectively reduces the
   pavement's temperature caused by hot weather. Two application case
   studies are presented, focusing on how to ensure hydrated lime's
   long-term effectiveness on the surface of asphalt pavements and take
   into account the effect of the subsequent reduced temperature on the
   resilient modulus of asphalt concrete in the design of long-life
   flexible pavements. The increased asphalt concrete modulus, owing to
   lowered temperature, can reduce the design thickness of the asphalt
   concrete without sacrificing pavement performance. This also has a
   positive influence on reduced pavement heat island effects. It is
   concluded that the appropriate use of hydrated lime on asphalt pavement
   surfaces is an effective and economical method to produce
   light-coloured, grey asphalt pavements.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure-property correlation of heat affected zone (HAZ) in X100
   longitudinal submerged arc welding (LSAW) real weld joint was studied in
   this paper. Coarse grained (CG) HAZ and intercritically reheated coarse
   grained (ICCG) HAZ were characterized by optical microscope (OM),
   electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The microstructure of CGHAZ
   is mostly composed of granular bainite with low density of high angle
   boundaries (HAB). Prior austenite grain size is similar to 80 mu m. In
   ICCGHAZ, coarse prior austenite grains were decorated by coarse
   necklacing martensite-austenite (M-A) constituents. Different layers
   were observed within M-A constituent, which may be martensite and
   austenite layers. Charpy absorbed energy of two different HAZ regions
   (ICCGHAZ containing and non-containing regions) was recorded using
   instrumental Charpy impact test machine. The results showed that the
   existence of ICCGHAZ resulted in the sharp drop of Charpy absorbed
   energy from 180J to 50J, while the existence of only CGHAZ could still
   lead to good toughness. The fracture surface was 60\% brittle in the
   absence of ICCGHAZ, and 100\% brittle in the presence of ICCGHAZ in the
   impact tested samples. The underlying reason is the microstructure of
   ICCGHAZ consisted of granular bainite and upper bainite with
   necklace-type M-A constituent along the grain boundaries. Cleavage
   fracture initiated from M-A constituent, either through cracking of M-A
   or debonding from the matrix, was observed at the fracture surface of
   ICCGHAZ. The presence of necklace type M-A constituent in ICCGHAZ
   notably increases the susceptibility of cleavage microcrack nucleation.
   Furthermore, the study of secondary microcracks beneath the CGHAZ and
   the ICCGHAZ through EBSD suggested that the fracture mechanism changes
   from nucleation-controlled in the CGHAZ to propagation-controlled in the
   ICCGHAZ because of the presence of necklace-type M-A constituent in the
   ICCGHAZ region. Both fracture mechanism contribute to the poor toughness
   of the sample contained ICCGHAZ. In conclusion, big prior austenite
   grains with low density of HAB plus coarse necklacing M-A products along
   grain boundary is the dominant factor resulting in low toughness.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing demand for thicker gage pipes particularly for
   off-shore projects. Austenite grain size control in upstream processing
   before pancaking is essential to obtain excellent DBTT and DWTT
   properties in thicker gage product. This paper examines the basic
   science aspects of austenite grain size control by nano-scale
   precipitate engineering.
   Basic science aspects of pinning pressure due to TiN-NbC composite
   precipitates in retarding recrystallization were investigated in a
   previous work way back, using hot torsion simulation studies. In this
   case, dislocation density from deformation is the driving force for
   boundary movement, which is larger than the driving force from
   capillarity for grain coarsening of recrystallized austenite grains. The
   experimental observations confirmed that if the inter-particle spacing
   of TiN is small and the dispersion of TiN is uniform, then NbC will grow
   epitaxially on pre-existing TiN precipitates, thereby eliminating the
   need for strain induced precipitation of NbC on dislocations. The
   pinning pressure from NbC growing on pre-existing TiN particles is found
   to be adequate to retard recrystallization. The analysis showed that the
   Zener pinning pressure from TiN-NbC composite precipitates is about 0.1
   MPa, which is adequate to prevent grain coarsening of recrystallized
   austenite grain of about 25 micron size by capillarity driven driving
   force. Thus, the core concept of austenite grain size control by
   nano-scale precipitate engineering is based on Zener limiting austenite
   grain size by engineering TiN-NbC composites, using TiN dispersion to
   control the interparticle spacing to be about 200 nm, and growth of NbC
   on pre-existing TiN particles to control the size of TiN-NbC composite
   precipitates to be about 30nm. Recent TEM-EELS studies have confirmed
   epitaxial growth of NbC on pre-existing TiN particles with an
   inter-particle spacing of 200 nm.
   Nano-scale precipitate engineering of TiN-NbC composites offers a
   general platform for refining austenite grain size in titanium-niobium
   microalloyed steels in a wide range of technological applications
   including super-martensitic stainless steel. The application of
   nano-scale precipitate engineering concept for refining austenite grain
   size in upstream austenite conditioning in line pipe grades will be
   examined and the benefits will be pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the effects
   of a postulated Main Steam-Line Break on the transient loading of
   nuclear steam generator tubes. The analysis of this problem deals with
   the complex coupling of rapid transient two-phase flow dynamics and
   fluid-structural loading processes. A main concern of nuclear reactor
   safety is to ensure that radioactive materials produced by nuclear
   fission are safely contained. This type of accident produces a
   `blowdown' in which the pressurised water in the steam generator is
   boiled off in a few seconds. The resulting transient loading on the
   steam generator tubing could lead to their rupture, resulting in the
   release of radioactive materials out of containment. A better
   understanding of this phenomenon will permit the development of improved
   design tools to ensure steam generator safety in the event of such an
   accident. This paper presents a work in progress, describing the
   purpose-built experimental facility and a summary of commissioning
   results, including an evaluation of the instrumentation and data
   collection methodology. The final results of this research will provide
   physical insights and guidance for the development of predictive

Abstract = {{Piping systems conveying gases at high pressure often generate high
   level of vibration and noise. These phenomena, in many cases, are
   initiated by the coupling between an unstable separated flow and an
   acoustic mode of the piping system. Various types of cavities in pipe
   flow are among the flow geometries which are known to be liable to the
   generation of tonal noise. Flow over cavities in ducts and piping
   systems has been investigated extensively for two and three dimensional
   situations. In this case, the feedback loop which generates the tonal
   noise is caused by the coupling between the instability of the shear
   layer forming at the cavity opening and an acoustic mode. This paper
   presents a study of tonal noise generation by subsonic pipe flows over a
   cavity formed inside a fully open gate valve. Previous 2D and 3D
   studies, presented in a companion paper, have shown that the presence of
   the valve-seat cavity is responsible for the generation of acoustic
   tonal noise. In this paper, the full 3D geometry of the valve, on a
   small scale model, is studied with experiments and using an unsteady
   compressible flow solver developed at EDF. Experimentally, the evolution
   of the fluid acoustic coupling in term of frequency and amplitude with
   the flow velocity is studied. Also, a modal analysis have been done to
   identify the frequency of acoustic mode of the valve. Numerically, the
   complex 3D geometry is meshed and computation is performed. The results
   show an acoustic tonal noise in a frequency range compatible with that
   experimentally. The study is underway, future analysis of the velocity
   and acoustic fields in the simulation may help to identify the shear
   layer and acoustic modes and to identify how they couple together.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive efficiency describes how individuals optimize limited mental
   resources to achieve improvements in learning and problem-solving.
   Research on expert performance and expertise has shown that expert
   designers structure the organization of cognitive actions more
   efficiently than novices. Howevei; cognitive efficiency in engineering
   design processes has not been well studied because of technical
   limitations at the neurological level and lack of quantitative methods
   for analyzing information contained in designers' cognitive processes at
   the performance level. The purpose of this study is to introduce
   Kolmogorov complexity to measure information contained in the changes of
   sketches generated by designers. The Kolmogorov complexity of each
   design move is calculated by the number of cognitive actions and
   transitions between different levels of information processing. In this
   study, sketches and verbal protocols generated by 15 participants were
   analyzed. Cognitive efficiency was determined by the quality of design
   outcomes and the expenditure of mental effort. The results indicate that
   Kolmogorov complexity is negatively related to cognitive efficiency; the
   higher the Kolmogorov complexity, the lower the cognitive efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The largest technical challenge to full-scale post-combustion carbon
   capture in power plants is the enormous energy consumption for solvent
   regeneration. If legislative requirements impose CO2 capture, chemical
   absorption/desorption using amine solvent solutions is the most mature
   commercial technology available. The use of ejectors to upgrade external
   waste heat has recently been shown to significantly reduce the amount of
   valuable turbine steam required to regenerate the solvent. Using the
   Aspen Plus chemical process simulator, this study considers three
   different liquid sources for producing the ejector secondary steam in a
   waste heat supplied flash tank. In each case the goal is to minimize the
   sum of the heat duty of the ejector primary steam generator and the
   stripping tower reboiler. A base case 20 wt\% MEA absorption/desorption
   CO2 capture process was modeled, with flue gas data from a 400 MW net
   power coal-fired electric plant. Using stripping column condensate or
   lean solution to create the ejector secondary steam were found to be
   viable options for reducing valuable turbine steam consumption, with
   respective reductions of 14\% and 23\% shown for the completed
   simulations. With ejectors, lower temperature waste heat can be used to
   partially replace valuable turbine steam normally required in the
   reboiler for solvent regeneration in CO2 capture. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The sensitivity-based microwave imaging method requires the incident
   field distributions in the background medium, which insofar have been
   derived from analytical or simulation models. However, such models often
   prove inadequate in near-field imaging due to the complexity of the
   background and the acquisition setup. Here, we propose a calibration
   technique to efficiently acquire the necessary field information via
   measurements of a known calibration object containing a sufficiently
   small ``point{''} scatterer. Only measurement data is needed to generate
   the images, i.e., the simulation or analytical incident-field model is
   replaced by a measurement-based model. The approach is validated through
   experiments with a planar raster scanning system. Two different tissue
   mimicking phantoms are imaged: i) dielectric cylinders embedded in a
   5-cm thick layer of high-loss dielectric material and ii) tissue phantom
   containing porcine and bovine meat samples as well as grape inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optimal control strategy (i.e., offset settings
   system) based on the new Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization
   with Differential Evolution (MOPSO-DE) technique is developed and
   presented. The MOPSO-DE algorithm is used for calculating the optimal
   positions (i.e., offset settings) for the cutting tools in lathe
   machines. This optimal control strategy yields interesting results
   without a need to go through the complex mathematical modeling of the
   lathe system. The proposed technique is validated considering a
   real-world industrial system. This strategy is designed to take an
   action every 20 pieces, and it takes only 2.5 sec to run the code and
   optimally calculate the new settings. The control strategy is
   implemented using two high precision linear stepper motors. By
   implementing the new optimal control strategy, the estimated number of
   the defective pieces per day can be reduced by 85\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the application of mathematical modeling to a novel
   drug delivery system using artificial neural networks. For this purpose,
   a Feed-Forward back propagation network was trained by two different
   concepts and the behavior of this drug delivery system was analyzed
   based on the simulated results. The network also successfully determined
   the most accurate release profiles under specific formulation
   parameters. The simulated results showed a high correlation with the
   real data in this study. Furthermore, a new method was proposed in order
   to predict the burst release point in Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid
   (PLGA) based drug delivery systems. This paper reveals that the
   mathematical modeling of novel drug delivery systems not only
   significantly decreases time and cost, but also facilitates the design
   of new pharmaceutical formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain is a complicated network made-up of a large number of
   regions, which are structurally and/or functionally connected. Recently,
   neuroimaging studies using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging have
   revealed that certain neural structures are highly active during periods
   of rest. Amongst several methods that have been developed to analyze
   resting-state fMRI data, Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis
   (PICA) is currently the most popular technique. The major challenge of
   using PICA is that resting-state networks are split into several
   components and visually extracting them can be difficult. In this paper,
   we propose a fast and precise algorithm based on advanced template
   matching in spatial domain such as Normalized Cross Correlation adapted
   to functional images in order to automatically extract the Default Mode
   Network (DMN) which is the task independent resting state network in the
   brain using PICA. We create a DMN template covering all reported regions
   in literature using two standard atlases. Ultimately, we reconstruct an
   image of the extracted DMN from PICA using an optimized decision making.
   Our approach was effective given that our algorithm results correlated
   highly with the DMN template.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a promising technology for clean
   power generation, however their implementation has been limited by
   several degradation mechanisms, which significantly reduce its lifetime
   under constant output power and inhibits the technology for
   commercialization in the near future. With the purpose of harnessing the
   capabilities offered by SOFCs, the U.S. DOE-National Energy Technology
   Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown, WV has developed the Hybrid Performance
   (HyPer) project in which a SOFC 1D, real-time operating model is coupled
   to a gas turbine hardware system by utilizing hardware-in-the-loop
   simulation (HiLS).
   More recently, in order to assess the long-term stability of the SOFC
   part of the system, electrochemical degradation due to operating
   conditions such as current density and fuel utilization have been
   incorporated into the SOFC model and successfully recreated in real time
   for standalone and hybrid operation. The mathematical expression for
   degradation rate was obtained through the analysis of empirical voltage
   versus time plots for different current densities and fuel utilizations
   at 750, 800, and 850 degrees C. Simulation results well reflected the
   behavior of SOFC degradation rates from which the long-term stability of
   the cell under various conditions was assessed. Distributed fuel cell
   parameters are presented for both standalone and hybrid configurations.
   The incorporation of the electrochemical degradation rate into the SOFC
   model provides a framework to study more realistically Fuel Cell-hybrid
   systems and set forth a mechanism to improve the long-term stability of
   SOFCs through the hybridization of such technology.}},

   turbine (SOFC/GT) hybrid systems were investigated using
   hardware-in-the-loop simulations (HiLS) at a test facility located at

   The work focused on applications relevant to polygeneration systems
   which require significant fuel flexibility. Specifically, the dynamic
   response of implementing a sudden change in fuel composition from syngas
   to methane was examined. The maximum range of possible fuel composition
   allowable within the constraints of carbon deposition in the SOFC and
   stalling/surging of the turbine compressor system was determined.
   It was demonstrated that the transient response was significantly impact
   the fuel cell dynamic performance, which mainly drives the entire
   transient in SOFC/GT hybrid systems. This resulted in severe limitations
   on the allowable methane concentrations that could be used in the final
   fuel composition when switching from syngas to methane. Several system
   performance parameters were analyzed to characterize the transient

Abstract = {{The adoption of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology in power
   generation has been limited, in no small part, by material degradation
   issues affecting the stack lifetime, and hence, the economic viability.
   A numeric study was conducted to determine if the life of an SOFC could
   be extended when integrated with a recuperated gas turbine system.
   Dynamic modeling tools developed at the National Energy Technology
   Laboratory (NETL) for real-time applications were applied to evaluate,
   life to failure for both a standalone SOFC and a hybrid SOFC gas
   turbine. These models were modified using empirical relations to
   experimental degradation data to incorporate degradation as a function
   of current density and fuel utilization. For the control strategy of
   shifting power to the turbine as fuel cell voltage degrades, the SOFC
   life could be extended dramatically, significantly impacting the
   economic potential of the technology.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) channels leverage solid-state
   illumination devices to provide a dual role as high-speed communication
   links. These channels are bandwidth-limited and can have high SNRs.
   Bandwidth-efficient intensity-modulated/direct-detection (IM/DD)
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered
   for VLC systems. Key drawbacks of OFDM in IM/DD channels are its high
   peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) as well as the difficulty of
   implementing power efficient, high current, wideband drivers. In this
   paper, we propose a new form of IM/DD OFDM termed spatial optical OFDM
   (SO-OFDM) in which multiple narrowband OFDM signals are transmitted
   simultaneously from different LEDs and allowed to sum in space. In this
   way, a conventional OFDM receiver can be employed while having a series
   of lower power transmitters, each with improved PAPR. Simulation results
   show that in comparison with conventional IM/DD OFDM, SO-OFDM is more
   robust to amplifier nonlinearities and can be implemented with more
   efficient line driver topologies.}},

Abstract = {{The Thin Slab Cast Direct Rolling (TSCDR) process offers several
   economic and environmental advantages. The elimination of slab reheating
   and roughing deformation, however, leave fewer opportunities for grain
   refinement and some large grains persist in the microstructure. To solve
   this problem, we employed the chemistry which leads to a two-phase
   mixture of ferrite and austenite over a wide temperature range. This
   chemistry has two advantages. The first is that the two-phase mixture is
   highly resistant to grain coarsening leading to a small initial grain
   size. Secondly, hot-rolling of the two-phase mixture leads to
   recrystallization nucleation in the vicinity of the second phase
   particles and further grain refinement. Results are presented on the
   hot-rolling of an Fe-Al steel with a mixed ferrite-austenite
   microstructure at high temperatures.}},

   paper investigates the optimization of hybrid power-trains for port
   crane applications. The optimized system is capable of recovering energy
   in the ``Hoist-Down{''} and other regenerative braking operations.
   Moreover, due to the contribution of the power buffer in providing
   energy for acceleration operations, the main energy source can be
   replaced by a lower rated system. The power flow of the crane system is
   analyzed and the value of the energy saving potential is calculated;
   then, the design of the lifting motor is fundamentally studied based on
   the crane operating requirements; furthermore, the application of
   different energy/power storage devices in single and hybrid source
   configurations is discussed based on the crane specification.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Fe and Sr on the evolution of the Fe intermetallic and
   eutectic phases in the Al-Si eutectic (Al-12.6 wt\%Si) alloy was
   studied. Two different amounts of Sr (0.02 and 0.1 wt\%) and three
   levels of Fe (0.5, 1 and 2 wt\%) were introduced in the alloy; thermal
   analysis during solidification coupled with optical microscopy was
   carried out. It was observed, from the thermal data, that the nucleation
   temperature of the Fe intermetallic phase was not affected by the
   addition of Sr, but there is a significant variation in the heat balance
   during nucleation and growth of these phases during solidification.
   Additionally, the order of evolution of Al, Fe intermetallic phases and
   Si was significantly altered by the addition of Sr to the alloy. The
   analyses of the alloys showed that Fe intermetallic phase acted as
   nucleation sites for the Si phase while this was not the case in alloys
   with Sr addition. There is significant reduction in the size and
   alteration of the morphology of the Fe intermetallic phases when Sr was
   added to the alloy.}},

   decarburization mechanism is discussed with particular reference to its
   role in droplet swelling or bloating which has a profound influence on
   the droplet residence time in the slag. Conditions which cause bloating
   are discussed and the rate determining step is proposed to be primarily
   nucleation of CO bubbles inside the metal droplet with some influence
   from growth by reaction at the bubble/metal interface. The discrepancy
   in the super-saturation ratio required for classical nucleation is
   discussed and an approach using a surface tension modifying parameter is
   illustrated. Finally, the role of CO nucleation in controlling the
   driving force for dephosphorization is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion phasing and work output are the two critical indicators for
   achieving and maintaining homogeneous combustion for homogeneous charge
   compression ignition (HCCI) engines. However, the complicated
   thermodynamic process keeps the combustion phasing model from being
   explicit. The current models for CA(50) (crank angle when 50\% fuel
   consumed) requires information that is hardly available for commercial
   engines. In this paper, polynomial models for combustion phasing and
   work output are proposed. The intake conditions, including intake
   manifold temperature, pressure and burned gas fraction as well as the
   fuel injection are chose as the four variables by whom the combustion
   phasing and work output are determined. The impacts of various
   compression ratios on the two indicators (represented by CA(50) and
   IMEP) were investigated and have been classified into two groups:
   vertical shift and curve deformation and both can be well modeled and,
   therefore compensated. The models are validated through high-fidelity
   simulations.}},

   Subsequently, a framework consisting of a model predictive controller,

   an augmented model (including disturbance states) and an associated
   Luenberger observer to estimate the prediction disturbance (plant-model

   2.3\% can be achieved with the proposed OF-MPC design compared to a

Abstract = {{The electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA) is an efficient type of actuator
   commonly used in aerospace applications. It makes use of a closed
   hydraulic circuit, a number of control valves, an electric motor, and a
   fluid pump (usually a type of gear pump). The smooth variable structure
   filter (SVSF) is a relatively new estimation strategy based on sliding
   mode concepts formulated in a predictor-corrector fashion. The SVSF
   offers a number of advantages over other traditional estimation methods,
   including robust and stable estimates, and an additional performance
   metric. A fixed smoothing boundary layer was implemented in an effort to
   ensure stable estimates, and is defined based on the amount of
   uncertainties and noise present in the estimation process. Recent
   advances in SVSF theory include a time-varying smoothing boundary layer.
   This method, known as the SVSF-VBL, offers an optimal formulation of the
   SVSF as well as a method for detecting changes or faults in a system.
   This paper implements the SVSF-VBL in an effort to detect faults in an
   EHA. The results are compared with traditional Kalman filter-based
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{To research and analyze the additional stress distribution and change of
   granular materials, the model tests are used to observe vertical
   additional stress in different position and depth in different
   foundations. And the comparison between observed values both in
   different soils and single soils is conducted to analyze the
   transmission and attenuation of additional stress in granular materials.
   The research results show that the existing of boundary surface can lead
   to different vertical additional stress transmit obviously. And with the
   increasing of loading, the vertical additional stress differences
   between that of different soils get larger, meanwhile, the ratio of
   stress differences to smaller additional stress increases slightly. With
   the increasing of depth, the attenuation rate of vertical additional
   stress of silty soil changes much fast than that of fine sand. Wherever
   in horizontal direction or vertical direction, the vertical additional
   stress of fine sand which has higher compression modulus in different
   soils is slightly larger than that in single soil and transfers
   additional stress (loading) more under the same loading. To granular
   materials, inner friction structure effect is evident influence to

Abstract = {{Water security is a major challenge for science and society. We review
   the rapidly growing literature on water security from the perspective of
   risk science and management. Competing definitions and indicators of
   water security reflect unsettled conceptual and methodological issues.
   However, risk concepts have become prevalent in defining water security;
   measuring it quantitatively; tracking indicators of hazards, exposure,
   and vulnerability; and informing management options to reduce
   water-related risks. We examine water security indicators and indices to
   identify thresholds for water-related risks across multiple dimensions
   of water security and examine how these vary across different scales and
   socioeconomic contexts. Water security indicators reveal a disparity in
   hazards and vulnerability across geographic and political-economic
   conditions. Recognition of water security as a major societal challenge
   has been closely followed by a strong commitment to academic,
   government, development, and policy responses. Pathways to water
   security capture the sequence of investments in institutions and
   infrastructure to reduce water-related risks and manage trade-offs. Two
   well-studied water management case studies illustrate the pathways to
   water security and the need for more systematic comparative assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channel model is very
   useful for the presentation of a wide range of wireless communication
   systems. This paper addresses the joint design of a precoder and a
   receiver for a point-to-point MIMO channel model in a scenario in which
   perfect channel state information (CM) is available at both ends. We
   develop a novel framework for the dual transmission-reception process.
   Under the proposed framework, the receiver decomposes the channel matrix
   by using a block OR decomposition, where Q is a unitary matrix and R is
   a block upper triangular matrix. The optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
   detection process is employed within each diagonal block of R. Then, the
   detected block of symbols is substituted and subtracted sequentially
   according to the block OR decomposition based successive cancellation.
   On the transmitting end, the expression of probability of error based on
   ML detection is chosen as the design criterion to formulate the precoder
   design problem. This paper presents a design of MIMO transceivers in the
   particular case of having 4 transmitting and 4 receiving antennas with
   full CSI knowledge on both sides. In addition, a closed-form expression
   for the optimal precoder matrix is obtained for channels satisfying

   via simulations and using an EXIT chart analysis. In comparison to
   several state-of-the-art demodulators, the proposed demodulator provides
   performance that comes close to that of the list sequential (LISS)
   demodulator, at a computational cost that is close to that of the

Abstract = {{In wireless networks, the availability of multiple transmitting antennas
   can be exploited in several ways. One way is to reduce the interference
   to unintended receivers by placing beamforming nulls in those
   directions, as is done in zero-forcing beamforming. Another is to boost
   the received signal strength at the desired receiver using ``matched{''}
   transmit beamforming. This work studies a partial zero-forcing
   beamforming scheme that combines these two traditional transmission
   schemes, and examines its performance gain in large random spectrum
   sharing networks. Specifically, beamforming vectors are designed to null
   the aggregate interference towards a number of selected primary
   receivers and to boost the received signal strength at the intended
   receiver. Considering Poisson distributed users and Rayleigh fading
   channels, the statistical characterizations of signal and interference
   are analyzed and the optimal number of nulled receivers is discussed.
   The simulation results show that by employing partial zero-forcing
   beamforming with a judiciously chosen number of nulls, the permissible
   density of secondary transmitters can be maximized while protecting the
   successful transmission probabilities of individual networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a structured linear interference alignment
   scheme that can achieve 2 degrees of freedom in the 3 -cell downlink
   network with arbitrary time-invariant channels using only local
   feedback. The scheme employs a finite number of channel extensions and
   results in an equivalent channel matrix that is 2 -level decomposable.
   The linear precoders at the transmitters are constructed from the
   Kronecker products of 2 matrices of specific dimensions. This structured
   precoding scheme enables inter-cell interference cancellation and the
   achievement of the degrees of freedom of the network using only
   ``in-cell{''} channel state information, without the need for any
   information exchange between base stations. Simulation results validate
   the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Interference Alignment is an intriguing approach to the development of
   interference management schemes for wireless networks. Even for networks
   of single antenna nodes with timeinvariant channels, several approaches
   to interference alignment have been proposed. Those schemes construct
   transmitted signals that are not circularly symmetric by using symbols
   from realvalued constellations. In this paper we develop an alternative
   scheme that employs widely linear precoding of symbols from conventional
   complex-valued constellations at the transmitters, and a periodic
   conjugation operation at the receivers. Like the existing schemes, the
   proposed scheme achieves the degrees of freedom of the channel, and it
   adds the convenience of enabling the use of conventional constellations.
   To tackle the difficult problem of optimizing the sum rate under the
   interference alignment constraint, we develop an efficient algorithm on
   the Grassmannian manifold, and we demonstrate that this algorithm can
   reduce the power offset and hence provide significant increases in the
   sum rate at low to moderate SNRs.}},

Abstract = {{Bending and subsequent stretching of sheet materials is typical of many
   sheet forming operations. Bending and bend-stretching characteristics
   and limit strain of monolithic AA2024 and laminated tri-layer Alclad
   2024 aluminum sheet materials are studied by modeling and
   experimentation. A computationally efficient analytical model based on
   advanced bending theory is developed for the laminated sheet materials
   and utilized to predict the bending characteristics of the above sheet
   materials. The effects of cladding thickness ratio on the bending
   characteristics of laminated sheet are compared with the monolithic
   constituent. Also, predictions from the above analytical bending model
   are compared with 2D and 3D FE-based bending models. In addition,
   bend-stretching experiments are conducted using a specialized test jig
   while continuously recording images using dual-camera set-up from
   tensile surface and edge of the specimen. A stochastic pattern is
   applied to the specimen prior to the test and the images are later
   processed to analyze the development and localization of strains based
   on digital image correlation (or DIC) method. Strain maps from DIC
   analysis are utilized to determine the limit strain in the vicinity of
   the bend line, as well as from FE modeling of bend-stretching tests,
   using maximum major strain acceleration criterion for localized necking
   proposed by one of the authors. The results from experimental and
   modeling work indicate higher limit strains in bend-stretching for
   Alclad 2024 compared to monolithic AA2024 sheet.}},

Abstract = {{Al-Mg-Si-(Cu), i.e. AA6xxx, alloys are widely used light alloys which
   can be effectively strengthened through precipitation hardening. The
   final microstructure, and thus properties, of these alloys after common
   artificial aging treatments are largely determined by the
   composition-dependent nano-scale clustering and precipitation that occur
   during the earliest stage of aging. Therefore, multi-length scale
   analysis of the earliest-stage of precipitation can provide critical
   knowledge in understanding the basis for the microstructural evolution
   during aging and attaining the desired microstructures and properties.
   Here, we investigate the effect of alloy composition on the evolution of
   early-stage clusters and precipitates during aging at 180 degrees C
   using high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results map
   a sequential evolution of clusters with an FCC structure but different
   morphology/orientation characteristics. GP-zones with structures other
   than FCC, also form in the early stages of aging. The
   composition-dependent kinetics of beta{''} phase precipitation and
   hardening behavior are discussed in light of the results from
   differential scanning calorimetry experiments, microhardness
   measurements, and conventional transmission electron microscopy.}},

Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{79-93}},
Abstract = {{High temperature deposition of graphene on Cu by chemical vapor
   deposition can be used to produce high quality films. However, these
   films tend to have a non-equilibrium structure, with relatively low
   graphene adhesion. In this study, samples of graphene grown on copper
   foils by high temperature CVD were post-deposition annealed at
   temperatures well below the critical temperature of Cu. Resistance to
   etching under plasma was examined to assess the mechanical robustness of
   the graphene on the Cu surface, analyzed using optical and Raman
   microscopies. We found a correlation between the post-annealing time and
   etching time for the complete removal of graphene from Cu. Etching
   rates, minimum etch times, and surface appearance were observed to vary
   depending on the etching plasma (air, oxygen or nitrogen). Oxygen
   plasmas were found to be the least aggressive, emphasizing the improved
   adhesion with post-annealing treatments. Our results imply that the
   etching of graphene on Cu, and hence the adhesion of graphene, can be
   controlled by proper annealing and choice of plasma gas.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time registration of pre-operative magnetic resonance (MR) or
   computed tomography (CT) images with intra-operative Ultrasound (US)
   images can be a valuable tool in image-guided therapies and
   interventions. This paper presents an automatic method for dynamically
   tracking the deformation of a soft tissue based on registering
   pre-operative three-dimensional (3D) MR images to intra-operative
   two-dimensional (2D) US images. The registration algorithm is based on
   concepts in state estimation where a dynamic finite element (FE)-based
   linear elastic deformation model correlates the imaging data in the
   spatial and temporal domains. A Kalman-like filtering process estimates
   the unknown deformation states of the soft tissue using the deformation
   model and a measure of error between the predicted and the observed
   intra-operative imaging data. The error is computed based on an
   intensity-based distance metric, namely, modality independent
   neighborhood descriptor (MIND), and no segmentation or feature
   extraction from images is required. The performance of the proposed
   method is evaluated by dynamically deforming 3D pre-operative MR images
   of a breast phantom tissue based on real-time 2D images obtained from an
   US probe. Experimental results on different registration scenarios
   showed that deformation tracking converges in a few iterations. The
   average target registration error on the plane of 2D US images for
   manually selected fiducial points was between 0.3 and 1.5 mm depending
   on the size of deformation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a preliminary study of the

   both in chemical engineering classrooms and laboratories. For readers
   unfamiliar with the instructional strategy, the paper describes the
   general approach and then reports on results of its application for the
   fluid mechanics course taken by undergraduate students in the Chemical
   Engineering Department at Qatar University. Inquiry-guided activities
   were developed after a series of interviews with recent chemical
   engineering graduates and employers to gather data on difficulties of
   chemical engineering graduates during the transition period from the
   university to industry. Some common daily problems were gathered,
   discussed, listed and used to formulate in an inquiry guided activity
   structure. Students were asked to participate in a role-play approach in
   which client-contractor relationship and rules of engagements were
   simulated. Both laboratory projects and in-class inquiry guided approach
   were conducted. Student performance and ability to approach conceptual
   problems and design-related issues were monitored and graded.
   Assessments were done after initial coverage of fundamentals of fluid
   mechanics (8 weeks into the course). Activities promoted in-class
   engagement and student performance was observed to enhance student
   performance and engagement to subject when compared to years at which
   the inquiry teaching methods were not used. This observation is observed
   to be valid for both with respect to conceptual approaches as well as
   design-related issues in the early stages of chemical engineering
   education.}},

Title = {{The Dilution Dependency of Multigroup Uncertainties}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The propagation of nuclear data uncertainties through reactor physics
   calculation has received attention through the Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development-Nuclear Energy Agency's Uncertainty Analysis
   in Modelling (UAM) benchmark. A common strategy for performing lattice
   physics uncertainty analysis involves starting with nuclear data and
   covariance matrix which is typically available at infinite dilution. To
   describe the uncertainty of all multigroup physics parameters-including
   those at finite dilution-additional calculations must be performed that
   relate uncertainties in an infinite dilution cross-section to those at
   the problem dilution. Two potential methods for propagating
   dilution-related uncertainties were studied in this work. The first
   assumed a correlation between continuous-energy and multigroup
   cross-sectional data and uncertainties, which is convenient for direct
   implementation in lattice physics codes. The second is based on a more
   rigorous approach involving the Monte Carlo sampling of resonance
   parameters in evaluated nuclear data using the TALYS software. When
   applied to a light water fuel cell, the two approaches show significant
   differences, indicating that the assumption of the first method did not
   capture the complexity of physics parameter data uncertainties. It was
   found that the covariance of problem-dilution multigroup parameters for
   selected neutron cross-sections can vary significantly from their
   infinite-dilution counterparts.}},

   propose a novel approach of statistical context modeling to increase the
   level of sparsity of wavelet image representations. It is shown,
   contrary to a widely held assumption, that high-frequency wavelet
   coefficients have non-zero mean distributions if conditioned on local
   image structures. Removing this bias can make wavelet image
   representations sparser, i.e., having a greater number of zero and
   close-to-zero coefficients. The resulting unbiased probability models
   can significantly improve the performance of existing wavelet-based
   compressive image reconstruction methods in both PSNR and visual

Abstract = {{Biobutanol production through the thermochemical route allows the use of
   a wide variety of feedstocks (including lignocellulosic biomass) and is
   a potentially superior alternative to the biochemical route. However the
   thermochemical route is poorly understood and no techno-economic studies
   of the thermochemical route exist in the peer-reviewed literature to our
   knowledge. To address this issue, this work focuses on the use of CAPE
   tools in modelling a novel thermochemical lignocellulosic
   biomass-to-butanol process and an assessment of its economic
   feasibility. This goal is achieved with a three-step methodology
   comprising of process simulation, heat integration, and an economic
   analysis. The application of this methodology results in a minimum
   butanol selling price (MBSP) which is competitive with biobutanol via
   the biochemical route. A sensitivity analysis on different design and
   cost parameters confirm that this process is quite promising under a
   large range of uncertain market conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Water-insoluble lignin is modified via atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) grafting of 2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate
   (DEAEMA). These lignin-g-DEAEMA samples can be easily dispersed in water
   upon CO2 bubbling. They can also be quickly precipitated out by N-2
   bubbling. The CO2/N-2-switchability of dispersion/precipitation is
   correlated to the graft density and chain length of DEAEMA units. This
   gas-switchable feature gives the lignin materials a wide range of
   potential applications. Demonstrated in this work is the use of
   lignin-g-DEAEMA as a surfactant for Pickering emulsion. An emulsion of
   decane is prepared with the lignin nanoparticles and it can be
   demulsified and re-emulsified by bubbling of the two gases. The
   emulsification/demulsification processes are highly reversible and

   length can be categorized in three categories, below transitional cavity
   length (BTCL), above the transitional cavity length (ATCL), and at the
   transitional cavity length (TCL). The BTCL and ATCL lengths are not
   suitable for wide tunable applications however the TCL length is
   suitable for wide tunable applications and the power profile is closer
   to the traditional power profile of laser diodes. This type of AMQW

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a novel, simple, and inexpensive micro-volume
   ultrafiltration technique for protein concentration, desalting, buffer
   exchange, and size-based protein purification. The technique is suitable
   for processing protein samples in a high-throughput mode. It utilizes a
   combination of capillary action, and osmosis for drawing water and other
   permeable species from a micro-volume sample droplet applied on the
   surface of an ultrafiltration membrane. A macromolecule coated on the
   permeate side of the membrane functions as the osmolyte. The action of
   the osmolyte could, if required, be augmented by adding a supersorbent
   polymer layer over the osmolyte. The mildly hydrophobic surface of the
   polymeric ultrafiltration membrane used in this study minimized sample
   droplet spreading, thus making it easy to recover the retained material
   after separation, without sample interference and cross-contamination.
   High protein recoveries were observed in the micro-volume
   ultrafiltration experiments described in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The edge-emitting distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser with a metal
   nano-strip grating is proposed. It achieves a high reflectivity with a
   much shorter grating length of 200 mu m due to the high refractive index
   contrast of the metal and the semiconductor. Moreover, the modal
   coupling (kappa L) of the grating can be tuned in a wide range by simply
   changing the design parameters of the metal nano-structure.
   In this work, the metal grating is investigated by the coupled-wave
   theory (CWT) and the complex mode matching method (CMMM). Results from
   these two methods are compared and the effects of changing the grating
   parameters, such as the spacing of the grating and the core region, the
   thickness of nano-strips and the duty cycle, are discussed regarding the
   peak reflectivity and the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the
   reflection spectrum. Further simulation of the laser output with the
   multi-mode rate equation model demonstrates the single-mode operation
   for a broad range of the metal grating's design parameters, thus the
   design freedom is provided. For various applications of the DBR laser,
   the requirements such as a shorter cavity length, a lower threshold
   current, or a very high SMSR can be satisfied by properly setting the
   design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Passive optical network (PON) is considered as the most appealing access
   network architecture in terms of cost-effectiveness, bandwidth
   management flexibility, scalability and durability. And to further
   reduce the cost per subscriber, a Fabry-Perot (FP) laser diode is
   preferred as the transmitter at the optical network units (ONUs) because
   of its lower cost compared to distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode.
   However, the mode partition noise (MPN) associated with the
   multi-longitudinal-mode FP laser diode becomes the limiting factor in
   the network. This paper studies the MPN characteristics of the FP laser
   diode using the time-domain simulation of noise-driven multi-mode laser
   rate equation. The probability density functions are calculated for each
   longitudinal mode. The paper focuses on the investigation of the
   k-factor, which is a simple yet important measure of the noise power,
   but is usually taken as a fitted or assumed value in the penalty
   calculations. In this paper, the sources of the k-factor are studied
   with simulation, including the intrinsic source of the laser Langevin
   noise, and the extrinsic source of the bit pattern. The photon waveforms
   are shown under four simulation conditions for regular or random bit
   pattern, and with or without Langevin noise. The k-factors contributed
   by those sources are studied with a variety of bias current and
   modulation current. Simulation results are illustrated in figures, and
   show that the contribution of Langevin noise to the k-factor is larger
   than that of the random bit pattern, and is more dominant at lower bias
   current or higher modulation current.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) is solved using different
   split-step Fourier methods (SSFM). The uniform step size distribution is
   traditionally utilized and the efficiency of the scheme can be improved
   by using the adaptive step sizes. One scheme of using the adaptive step
   size is the local error method, which updates the step size based on the
   local error of the current step. In this paper, a novel scheme which
   combines the minimum area mismatch (MAM) and the local error method is
   proposed. The MAM method can be used to find the optimal step size
   distribution based on minimizing the area mismatch between the ideal
   effective nonlinear coefficient curve and its stepwise approximation.
   The local error is a criterion to choose the total number of steps per
   span. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms
   the schemes using uniform step size and adaptive step size.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable, in situ-gelling nanostructured hydrogels have been prepared
   from hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized polymer precursors based on a
   copolymer of oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA) and an
   oligo(lactic acid) macromonomer (OLA) with varying lactic acid chain
   lengths. The resulting hydrogels contain a mix of chemical (hydrazone
   bond formation between hydrazide and aldehyde groups) and physical
   (hydrophobic interactions between OLA chains) cross-links which form
   competitively as a function of the OLA chain length and density. An
   increase in the OLA chain length and density results in the formation of
   more physical cross-links and fewer chemical cross-links. Tuning the
   relative prevalence of physical and chemical cross-link formation
   facilitated largely independent tuning of gel mechanics relative to gel
   swelling and degradation. Small-angle neutron scattering of these
   OLA-containing hydrogels reveals a microstructure consisting of
   associative hydrophobic domains, based on an increased scattering
   intensity and decreased blob size relative to that observed for POEGMA
   hydrogels prepared without the OLA co-monomer. The presence of
   hydrophobic OLA domains increases the uptake and slows the release of
   bovine serum albumin, a protein well-known to associate with hydrophobic
   domains. Coupled with the observed cytocompatibility of the reactive
   precursor polymers used to prepare the hydrogels, we anticipate
   significant potential applications of these hydrogels for the prolonged
   release of hydrophobic cargoes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a comprehensive experimental program on
   medium-size and large-size fluid dampers in an effort to extract their
   force output during cyclic loading by simply measuring the strain on the
   damper housing and the end-spacer. The paper first discusses the stress
   path within the damper and subsequently via the use of linear elasticity
   shows that the experimental data obtained with commercially available
   strain gauges yield a force output of the damper that is in good
   agreement with the readings from the load cell. The paper then examines
   the performance of a portable data acquisition system that can be used
   to collect and transmit data from a damper installed on a bridge to a
   nearby location. The data show that the proposed arrangement is
   promising for monitoring in-situ the force output of fluid dampers and
   detecting possible loss of their energy dissipation capability.}},

Abstract = {{Successful in situ spatiotemporal tracking of corrosion processes
   occurring at heterogeneous Mg alloy microstructures was achieved through
   tandem analyses involving electron and electrochemical microscopies.
   Through cross-correlation of scanning electron microscopy and scanning
   electrochemical microscopy images and subsequent analytical transmission
   electron microscopy, the morphology and chemical composition of
   microstructural components on the surface of a sand-cast AM50 Mg alloy
   were related to their respective local evolution of H-2 with micron
   scale resolution prior to, during and post corrosion. The results
   confirm that the preferential water reduction sites in the initial
   stages of corrosion are the Al8Mn5 intermetallics while a beta-Mg17Al12
   precipitate contaminated with Ni becomes cathodically active at a later
   stage of corrosion. This approach demonstrates the power of correlative
   approaches to probe and understand local electrochemical phenomena. (c)

Abstract = {{A conceptually new approach has been developed for the fabrication of
   MnO2-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites for electrodes of
   electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). Benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium
   chloride (BAC) surfactant and caffeic acid (CA) selectively adsorbed on
   MWCNT and MnO2, respectively, and allowed the formation of stable
   aqueous suspensions of positively charged MWCNT and negatively charged
   MnO2. The comparison of the electrophoretic deposition yield data for
   BAC, CA and other molecules provided an insight into the influence of
   the molecular structure on adsorption of the molecules and dispersion of
   MWCNT and MnO2. Advanced composite materials with good mixing of the
   individual components were obtained by heterocoagulation, based on an
   ion-pairing assembly of BAC and CA. The composite electrodes, prepared
   by the new method showed superior electrochemical performance. It was
   found that high capacitance and good capacitance retention at high
   charge-discharge rates can be achieved at high active mass loadings. A
   practical outcome of this study was the fabrication of an asymmetric SC
   device, containing a positive MnO2-MWCNT electrode and negative
   activated carbon-carbon black composite electrode with a voltage window
   of 1.8 V in an aqueous electrolyte. The asymmetric device showed high
   capacitance, high power-energy characteristics, good capacitance
   retention at high charge-discharge rates and cyclic stability.}},

Abstract = {{Centrifugal model tests were performed to investigate the effectiveness

   of remoulded and undisturbed collapsible loess can be divided into three
   stages with respect to time. The settlement of embankment built on
   collapsible loess foundation without improvement does not meet the
   post-construction settlement constraint for embankment of ballast track
   high-speed railways. Use of rigid piles, with or without caps, can
   significantly reduce embankment settlement and the rate of

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) align in suspension when subjected to
   external forces, such as electric and magnetic fields and shear stress.
   In this chapter, we discuss how orientation in suspension can be locked
   into solid films by solvent casting, spin coating, solution dipping,
   convective shear assembly, and Langmuir-Blodgett/Schaeffer deposition.
   The nature of the nanoparticle organization depends on the type and
   manner in which the external force is applied, for example magnetic
   fields produce films with either long-range nematic or chiral nematic
   order, whereas electric and shear forces generally give films with
   uniaxial order. In most cases, CNCs align with their long axes parallel
   to the direction of the applied force, except in magnetic fields, where
   CNCs orient perpendicular to the field. Aligned CNC films have many
   potential applications, including as model cellulose surfaces and tissue
   engineering substrates. Furthermore, the directed-assembly methods
   presented here may be used to prepare CNC-based composites with enhanced
   mechanical performance.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptually new approach has been developed for the fabrication of
   composite polypyrrole (PPy)-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors (ESs). The approach is
   based on the use of pyrocatechol violet (PV), eriochrome cyanine R (ECR)
   and acid fuchsin (AF) dyes as dispersants for MWCNTs and dopants for PPy
   polymerization. Testing results showed excellent electrochemical
   performance of the composite electrodes at high active mass loadings.
   The composite electrodes showed superior capacitance retention at high
   scan rates, compared to pure PPy electrodes. The comparison of the
   experimental data for the ES electrodes, prepared using different dyes,
   provided insight into the influence of their structure and functional
   groups on the composite microstructure and electrochemical performance.
   The use of ECR as a dispersant for MWCNTs and dopants for PPy allowed
   the fabrication of PPy coated MWCNTs. The fabrication method is simple
   and suitable for mass production. This new finding opens up a new and
   promising strategy for the fabrication of efficient ES electrodes and
   devices. The PPy coated MWCNTs were used for the fabrication of
   electrodes with a specific capacitance of 2.430-4.798 F cm(-2) in the
   scan rate range of 2-100 mV s(-1) for active mass loading of 18 mg
   cm(-2). The ES cells showed high capacitance at different charge
   discharge rates and good cycling stability. The ES cells and modules
   showed promising performance for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Lakes form an important freshwater drinking source for many
   urban areas surrounding the Lakes but also provide a sink for pollutants
   and runoff. Consequently introducing new drinking water intakes into any
   of these water bodies requires investigation into local pollutant
   sources and their transport in order to determine the most appropriate
   location and depth of any new intake.
   Two methods involving the calibration of a 3D wind driven transport
   model, to spill data collected over a 4 week period, are described. The
   methods include the traditional trial and error approach and the
   application of a nonlinear inverse model to optimize parameter
   estimates. Results show that calibration using the inverse modeling
   approach was an improvement over the traditional trial and error
   approach by providing a clear quantitative analysis of parameter
   sensitivity and importance, and ultimately yielding a better fit between
   observed and simulated data. The calibrated three-dimensional model was
   ultimately applied to assess the impacts of a potential local pollutant
   source to several proposed new drinking water intakes located along the
   north shore of Lake Ontario.}},

Abstract = {{Among all possible variants of the Isaichev orientation relationship

   cementite on ferrite-austenite semi-coherent interfaces is considered a

   crystallographic relations and habit planes of the ferrite-cementite,
   ferrite-austenite and austenite-cementite phases, a model for cementite
   nucleation has been proposed. The interphase-boundary nucleus is assumed
   to form on a semi-coherent ferrite-austenite interface and to possess
   ferrite-cementite and austenite-cementite habits as two main facets of
   the nucleus. It is shown that interphase cementite nucleation will be
   viable if the energies of all facets of the nucleus are in the

Abstract = {{In this paper, some of the recent achievements in surface-act vat

   allows for the combination of electronic, photonic, fluidic and

   applications in health diagnostics and screening, for example. These
   nanobonding technologies provide void-free, strong, and nanoscale
   bonding at room temperature or at low temperatures (<200 degrees C), and
   they do not require chemicals, adhesives, or high external pressure. The
   interfaces of the nanobonded materials in ultra-high vacuum and in air
   correspond to the covalent bonds, and hydrogen and hydroxyl bonds,
   respectively, which gives rise to excellent bonding properties. Further,
   these nanobonding technologies are well-suited for the development of
   low-cost, high-performance miniaturized systems such as biophoton'c

Abstract = {{A new method has been developed for the surface modification of
   inorganic particles, which allowed their efficient electrostatic
   dispersion and cathodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The approach
   is based on the use of cationic celestine blue (CB) dye as a charging
   and dispersing agent. The key advantages of this approach are related to
   its applicability to different materials and strong adsorption of CB to
   the inorganic surfaces, which is of critical importance for efficient
   particle dispersion. Proof-of-concept studies involved the EPD of thin
   films of various materials, such as TiO2, MnO2, Mn3O4, BaTiO3,
   halloysite nanotubes, zirconia and yttria. The results of the deposition
   rate measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis and
   quartz crystal microbalance studies provided an insight into the
   mechanism of CB adsorption, which involved the interactions of the OH
   groups of the catechol ligand of CB and metal atoms on the particle
   surface. It was demonstrated that CB can be used as an efficient
   dispersing agent for the nanoparticle synthesis by chemical
   precipitation methods. The feasibility of EPD of various oxide materials
   paved the way to the EPD of various composites using CB as a
   co-dispersant for the individual components. Thin films of individual
   oxides and composites were investigated by electron microscopy and X-ray
   diffraction methods. The benefits of cathodic EPD for nanotechnology
   were demonstrated by the formation of nanostructured MnO2 films on
   commercial high surface area current collectors for energy storage in
   electrochemical supercapacitors. Testing results showed that the method
   allowed the fabrication of efficient electrodes with high capacitance
   and excellent capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates. The
   new method paves the way for the deposition of other functional
   materials and composites for advanced applications.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium nanomaterials have shown great promise for use in sensing and
   energy storage devices, and developing simple and inexpensive top-down
   and bottom-up methods for creating such materials has attracted much

   hierarchical multiscale materials which are dually optimized at the
   nanoscale for addressing various functional demands and are amenable for
   micro/macroscale integration into practical devices, remains a
   challenge. Here we demonstrate a rapid and simple approach based on
   kinetically-controlled electrochemical deposition and photolithography
   for creating programmable hierarchical multiscale palladium structures.
   Through electrochemical methods, we are able to structurally and
   functionally program palladium materials based on their deposition
   kinetics. Structures ranging from 2D thin films into 3D globules
   decorated with nano-needles are created with a tunable hydrogen storage
   capacity, Raman signal magnitude, and analytical sensitivity.
   Furthermore, lithography-based methods are used to pattern these
   programmable structures into highly organized and periodic

Abstract = {{This study concerns the determination of effective transport
   coefficients for multiscale composite materials used in various
   electrochemical systems. The effective transport coefficients are
   indispensable in macroscale modeling of such systems. We propose an
   integrated approach which for a given two-phase or three-phase
   microstructure allows us to systematically determine the exact values of
   different effective transport coefficients such as diffusivity of a
   species or electric conductivity. In addition to electron microscopy,
   this approach combines state-of-the-art techniques of mathematical
   homogenization, image processing and numerical computation. When only
   partial information about the microstructure is available, rigorous
   upper and lower bounds are available on the effective transport
   coefficients and we demonstrate that the commonly used Bruggeman's
   formula may in fact violate the lower bound in some regimes. These upper
   bounds also allow one to quantify how much the transport properties of
   the material with a given composition could be improved. The proposed
   approach is illustrated by analyzing a three-phase electrode material of
   an actual Li-ion battery. We also quantify the uncertainty of the
   effective transport coefficients resulting from possibly imprecise
   information about the material properties of the individual phases and
   address the question concerning the importance of resolving all three
   phases. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used for
   image-guided biopsy and focal therapy of prostate cancer. A combined
   rigid and deformable registration technique is proposed to register
   pre-treatment diagnostic 3 T magnetic resonance (MR) images, with the
   identified target tumor(s), to the intra-treatment 1.5 T MR images. The
   pre-treatment 3 T images are acquired with patients in strictly supine
   position using an endorectal coil, while 1.5 T images are obtained
   intra-operatively just before insertion of the ablation needle with
   patients in the lithotomy position. An intensity-based registration
   routine rigidly aligns two images in which the transformation parameters
   is initialized using three pairs of manually selected approximate
   corresponding points. The rigid registration is followed by a deformable
   registration algorithm employing a generic dynamic linear elastic
   deformation model discretized by the finite element method (FEM). The
   model is used in a classical state estimation framework to estimate the
   deformation of the prostate based on a similarity metric between pre-
   and intra-treatment images. Registration results using 10 sets of
   prostate MR images showed that the proposed method can significantly
   improve registration accuracy in terms of target registration error
   (TRE) for all prostate substructures. The root mean square (RMS) TRE of
   46 manually identified fiducial points was found to be 2.40 +/- 1.20 mm,
   2.51 +/- 1.20 mm, and 2.28 +/- 1.22 mm for the whole gland (WG), central
   gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively after deformable
   registration. These values are improved from 3.15 +/- 1.60 mm, 3.09 +/-
   1.50 mm, and 3.20 +/- 1.73 mm in the WG, CG and PZ, respectively
   resulted from rigid registration. Registration results are also
   evaluated based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean absolute
   surface distances (MAD) and maximum absolute surface distances (MAXD) of
   the WG and CG in the prostate images.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of InAsP/InP
   nanowires are reported. InP nanowires were grown on < 111 > Si
   substrates by the Au-assisted vapor-liquid-solid process in a gas source
   molecular beam epitaxy system. InAsyP1-y segments were grown within the
   InP nanowires, creating single or multiple quantum dots structures. The
   quantum dot dimensions and composition were determined by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). PL from the quantum dot
   structures could be tuned by the InAsyP1-y composition (y), or by the
   size of the quantum dot via the quantum confinement effect.
   Cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements confirmed localized emission from
   the quantum dots. To reduce detrimental surface states, the nanowires
   were passivated with an AlInP shell, which resulted in strong PL
   emission.}},

Title = {{Climate Change Impact on Photovoltaic Energy Output: The Case of Greece}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Solar power is the third major renewable energy, constituting an
   increasingly important component of global future-low carbon-energy
   portfolio. Accurate climate information is essential for the conditions
   of solar energy production, maximization, and stable regulation and
   planning. Climate change impacts on energy output projections are thus
   of crucial importance. In this study the effect of projected changes in
   irradiance and temperature on the performance of photovoltaic systems in
   Greece is examined. Climate projections were obtained from 5 regional
   climate models (RCMs) under the A1B emissions scenario, for two future
   periods. The RCM data present systematic errors against observed values,
   resulting in the need of bias adjustment. The projected change in
   photovoltaic energy output was then estimated, considering changes in
   temperature and insolation. The spatiotemporal analysis indicates
   significant increase in mean annual temperature (up to 3.5 degrees C)
   and mean total radiation (up to 5W/m(2)) by 2100. The performance of
   photovoltaic systems exhibits a negative linear dependence on the
   projected temperature increase which is outweighed by the expected
   increase of total radiation resulting in an up to 4\% increase in energy
   output.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of
   cotton were surface modified with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).
   Essentially, the counterions of the CNC surface sulfate ester groups are
   exchanged for cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA+), which acts as a bulky,
   amphiphilic cation. The CTAB-modified CNCs were thoroughly purified to
   remove surfactant that was non-electrostatically bound. The surface
   modification could be tailored from 50 to 100\% charge coupling
   efficiency by varying the reaction conditions. The main factor that
   influenced coupling efficiency was ionic strength; increasing the ionic
   strength screened electrostatic interactions, which led to decreased
   surfactant adsorption. Adsorption isotherms of CTAB on model CNC films,
   measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, indicated an
   increase in adsorbed surfactant amount with increasing bulk CTAB
   concentration without achieving saturation in the concentration range
   studied. CTAB-modified CNCs were unstable in water but formed stable
   colloidal suspensions in ethanol, which transitioned into a continuous
   gel-like chiral nematic liquid crystal at relatively low concentrations
   (similar to 4 wt. \%) but did not phase separate into isotropic and
   anisotropic phases. The particle size and morphology of the
   CTAB-modified CNCs were unchanged compared to the native CNCs but were
   more thermally stable and less hydrophilic after the surface
   modification reaction.}},

   diagnostic model. Regarding the dataset, 0.5 x 0.5, 33-year (1979-2011)
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis
   (ERA-Interim) is used. The cyclone tracks and their characteristics are
   identified with the aid of Melbourne University algorithm (MS scheme).
   The region of interest is divided into a grid mesh and for each grid the
   probability of rain occurrence from passing cyclones is estimated. Such
   probability maps are estimated for three rain intensity categories. The
   probability maps are evaluated for random partitions of the data as well
   as for selected rain periods. Cyclones passing south of Italy are found
   to have greater probability of producing light rain events in Crete in
   contrast to medium and heavy rain events which are mostly triggered by
   cyclones of southern trajectories. The performance of the probability
   maps is very satisfactory, recognizing the majority of ``affecting{''}
   cyclones and rejecting most cyclones that do not trigger rain events.
   Statistical measures of sensitivity and specificity range between 0.5
   and 0.8 resulting in effective forecasting potential.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an integrated power divider/combiner at the interface between
   silicon nanowire and plasmonic slot waveguide (PSW). The proposed
   configuration facilitates light access and manipulation in planar
   nano-plasmonic circuits. The light is incident from a standard silicon
   nanowire to be accessed by a nano-plasmonic circuit providing
   subwavelength confinement. The structure overcomes the losses associated
   with long distance light propagation in nano-plasmonic splitters as
   coupling and splitting are performed at the same interface with minimal
   losses. Two PSWs placed orthogonally to the silicon nanowire forming
   hybrid junctions are exploited for the power dividing/combining
   functionality. The power splitter has been analyzed using the finite
   difference time domain (FDTD) numerical method. The ultra-compact
   proposed device provides wide-band power splitting functionality. A
   splitting of 34.7\%, over most of the wavelength spectrum from 0.8 mu m
   - 2.5 mu m, is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Age and hearing-level matched tinnitus and control groups were presented
   with a 40 Hz AM sound using a carrier frequency of either 5 kHz (in the
   tinnitus frequency region of the tinnitus subjects) or 500 Hz (below
   this region). On attended blocks subjects pressed a button after each
   sound indicating whether a single 40 Hz AM pulse of variable increased
   amplitude (target, probability 0.67) had or had not occurred. On passive
   blocks subjects rested and ignored the sounds. The amplitude of the 40
   Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) localizing to primary auditory
   cortex (A1) increased with attention in control groups probed at 500 Hz
   and 5 kHz and in the tinnitus group probed at 500 Hz, but not in the
   tinnitus group probed at 5 kHz (128 channel EEG). N1 amplitude (this
   response localizing to nonprimary cortex, A2) increased with attention
   at both sound frequencies in controls but at neither frequency in
   tinnitus. We suggest that tinnitus-related neural activity occurring in
   the 5 kHz but not the 500 Hz region of tonotopic A1 disrupted
   attentional modulation of the 5 kHz ASSR in tinnitus subjects, while
   tinnitus-related activity in A1 distributing nontonotopically in A2
   impaired modulation of N1 at both sound frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{A bio-inspired chemical approach has been developed for the surface
   modification, dispersion and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of metal
   oxide particles. The study of the chemical mechanism of mussel adhesion
   to different surfaces has driven the development of advanced dispersing
   agents with strong adsorption to oxide nanoparticles. The investigation
   of dopamine, caffeic acid, tiron and other molecules from the catechol
   family, and various molecules from salicylic acid, gallic acid, and
   chromotropic acid families revealed their strong adsorption to metal
   oxide surfaces. The analysis of dispersion and deposition yield data for
   various materials provided an insight into the influence of molecular
   structures of the organic dispersants on adsorption mechanisms and EPD
   efficiency. The adsorbed dispersants imparted new and unique properties
   to the nanoparticles. Further advancements in the EPD technology were
   achieved by the use of cationic and anionic dyes such as pyrocatechol
   violet, celestine blue, alizarin red from the catechol family and
   alizarin yellow, aurintricarboxylic acid and calconcarboxylic acid from
   salicylate family and their derivatives. It was discovered that
   polyaromatic dyes can be used as efficient co-dispersants for oxide
   materials, carbon nanotubes and graphene for the fabrication of
   composite films by EPD. Another important breakthrough was the
   development of film forming dispersants for EPD nanotechnology. New
   strategies have emerged for the synthesis of non-agglomerated
   nanoparticles of controlled size, organic fibers and coated particles.
   The use of new dispersants with strong interfacial adsorption and
   multifunctional properties has driven the development of advanced
   composites, containing metal oxide nanoparticles, conductive polymers,
   carbon nanotubes, graphene, polyelectrolytes and other materials.
   Colloidal and interface chemistry of new dispersing agents is emerging
   as a new area of technological and scientific interest.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the
   fabrication of manganese dioxide (MD) films for application in

   red (PGR) and aurintricarboxylic acid (ACA) dyes on MD was attributed to
   catecholate and salicylate type of bonding respectively involving
   chelation of Mn atoms on the MD particle surface. The adsorption of the
   dyes on MD allowed efficient dispersion, charging and deposition. The
   higher charge/mass ratio of ACA, compared to that of PGR, allowed
   deposition at lower dye concentration and lower voltages. The kinetics
   and mechanism of deposition were discussed. Electrochemical testing
   results showed that the MD films prepared by the EPD method are
   promising for application in ES. The highest specific capacitance of 409

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The self-excited oscillation of a large aspect ratio planar jet
   impinging on a flat plate is investigated experimentally at a single
   transonic jet velocity to clarify the effect of varying the jet
   thickness on pattern of jet oscillation and frequency of resulting
   acoustic tone. The study has been performed for a series of jet
   thicknesses, 1 mm to 4 mm, each of which is tested for the complete
   range of plate position, i.e. impingement distance, over which acoustic
   tones are generated. The results reveal that the jet oscillation is
   controlled by a fluid-dynamic mechanism for small impingement distances,
   where the hydrodynamic flow instability controls the jet oscillation
   without any coupling with local acoustic resonances. At larger
   impingement distances, a fluid-resonant mechanism becomes dominant, in
   which one of the various hydrodynamic modes of the jet couples with one
   of the resonant acoustic modes occurring between the jet nozzle and the
   impingement plate. Within the fluid-resonant regime, the acoustic tones
   are found to be controlled by the impingement distance, which is the
   length scale of the acoustic mode, with the jet thickness having only
   minor effects on the tone frequency. Flow visualization images of the
   jet oscillation pattern at a constant impingement distance show that the
   oscillation occurs at the same hydrodynamic mode of the. jet despite a
   four-fold increase in its thickness. Finally, a feedback model has been
   developed to predict the frequency of acoustic tones, and has been found
   to yield reasonable predictions over the tested range of impingement
   distance and nozzle thickness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in the domain of ground target tracking based
   on measurements from airborne ground moving target indication (GMTI)
   radar is the masking of targets due to the Doppler blind zone of the
   sensor. This blind zone arises from the clutter cancellation by
   space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to separate moving target returns
   from the general clutter background. Low-Doppler targets can easily be
   masked by such a blind zone, leading to sequences of missed detections
   that strongly deteriorate the performance of a standard tracking filter.
   This work investigates the Doppler blind zone in the case of bistatic
   transmitter and receiver configurations and its impact on the tracking
   of ground targets. The knowledge on the Doppler blind zone is
   incorporated into a Bayesian unscented Kalman filter multiple hypothesis
   tracker (UKF-MHT) tracking filter that is also capable of using road-map
   information. Based on different simulation scenarios, it is demonstrated
   that in contrast to a monostatic configuration with sideways-looking
   radar, the blind zone width determined by the minimum detectable
   velocity is not constant in general. The obtained track results reveal
   the benefit of exploiting this additional knowledge, especially in
   combination complementary with road-map information if available.}},

   in collocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars. After
   deriving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) as a performance measure, the
   antenna allocation problem is formulated as a standard semi-definite
   programming (SDP) for the single-target case. In addition, for multiple
   unresolved target scenarios, a sampling-based algorithm is proposed to
   deal with the nonconvexity of the cost function. Simulations confirm the
   superiority of the localization results under the optimal structure.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoplasmonic optical interconnects is proposed to mitigate challenges
   facing electronics integration. It provides fast and miniaturized data
   channel that overcome the diffraction limit. We present a three
   dimensional plasmonic coupler that vertically bends the light to
   multilevel circuit configurations. It exploits light guiding in
   nanoscale plasmonic slot waveguides (PSWs). A triangularly-shaped
   plasmonic slot waveguide rotator is introduced to attain such coupling
   with good efficiency over a wide bandwidth. Using this approach, light
   propagating in a horizontal direction is easily converted and coupled to
   propagate in the vertical direction and vice versa. The proposed
   configuration is further extended to the design of a multilayer power
   divider/combiner with ultra-compact footprint that guides the light to
   multiple channels. A detailed study of the triangular rotator is
   demonstrated with the analysis of multiple configurations. This
   structure is suitable for efficient coupling and splitting in multilevel
   nano circuit environment.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{From economic viability and sustainable development of view, the future
   alternative ironmaking processes, in general, may be classified into two
   representative routes, ``Pre-reduction-Smelting reduction{''} process
   and ``Direct reduction-Melting{''} process. In the present work, aimed
   for hot metal production, the carbon rate (in kg tHM(-1)) is considered
   as the yardstick for the measurement of the ``goodness{''} of these two
   processes, because it reflects the consumption of coal and energy, and
   the amount of carbon dioxide eventually to be emitted to atmosphere. By
   the thermodynamic calculation, under the idealized conditions, the total
   adiabatic carbon rate along ``Direct reduction-Melting{''} process is
   approximately 145 kg tHM(-1) lower than that along
   ``Pre-reduction-Smelting reduction{''} process. Therefore, direct
   reduction would likely lead to an alternative process with much lower
   carbon rate, and it should be reasonable and successfully developed.}},

Title = {{A New Optical Surface Measurement Method with Iterative
   Sparsity-Constrained Threshold Phase Retrieval Algorithm}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Due to its low complexity and acceptable accuracy, phase retrieval
   technique has been proposed as an alternative to solve the classic
   optical surface measurement task. However, to capture the overall wave
   field, phase retrieval based optical surface measurement (PROSM) system
   has to moderate the CCD position during the multiple-sampling procedure.
   The mechanical modules of CCD movement may bring about unexpectable
   deviation to the final results. To overcome this drawback, we propose a
   new PROSM method based on spatial light modulator (SLM). The mechanical
   CCD movement can be replaced by an electrical moderation of SLM
   patterns; thus the deviation can be significantly suppressed in the new
   PROSM method. In addition, to further improve the performance, we
   propose a new iterative threshold phase retrieval algorithm with
   sparsity-constraint to effectively reconstruct the phase of wave field.
   Experimental results show that the new method provides a more simple and
   robust solution for the optical surface measurement than the traditional
   techniques and achieves higher accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{A very high resolution (VHR) digital elevation model (DEM) is produced
   from a GeoEye-1 0.5-m-resolution satellite stereo pair and is used for
   floodplain management and mapping applications such as watershed
   delineation and river cross-section extraction. For this purpose, a 2 m
   x 2 m resolution terrain surface is produced from the stereo pair by
   using the Leica Photogrammetry Suite (LPS) enhanced Automatic Terrain
   Extraction (eATE) algorithm. DEM accuracy is assessed by comparison with
   measured individual ground control points (GCPs), stream cross-sections
   and other landscape features. Results show that the produced DEM is in
   good agreement with ground truth and superior to products of lower
   resolution, such as 90 m NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
   and 1: 5,000 topographical maps. One- and two-dimensional hydraulic
   models are used to simulate rainfall-runoff characteristics and flood
   wave kinematics of the flash flood event of 17 October 2006 that
   occurred in the ungauged basin of Almirida, using the 2 m VHR-DEM as an
   input. Results show that the hydraulic simulation based on the generated
   VHR-DEM, calibrated and validated via field data, produces an accurate
   extent and water level of the flooded area. Remote sensing stereo
   reconstruction is a promising alternative to traditional survey methods
   in flood mapping applications.}},

Abstract = {{Data assimilation (DA) methods continue to evolve in the design of
   streamflow forecasting procedures. Critical components for efficient DA
   include accurate description of states, improved model
   parameterizations, and estimation of the measurement error. Information
   about these components are usually assumed or rarely incorporated into
   streamflow forecasting procedures. Knowledge of these components could
   be gained through the generation of a Pareto-optimal set - a set of
   competitive members that are not dominated by other members when
   compared using evaluation objectives. This study integrates
   Pareto-optimality into the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the
   particle filter (PF). Comparisons are made between three methods:
   evolutionary data assimilation (EDA) and methods based on the
   integration of Pareto-optimality into the EnKF (ParetoEnKF) and into the
   PF (ParetoPF). The methods are applied to assimilate daily streamflow
   into the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model in the Spencer Creek
   watershed in Canada. The updated members are applied to forecast
   streamflows for up to 10 days ahead, where forecasts for 1 day, 5 day
   and 10 day lead times are compared to observations. The results show
   that updated estimates are similar for all three methods. An evaluation
   of updated members for multi-step forecasting revealed that EDA had the
   highest forecast accuracy compared to ParetoEnKF and ParetoPF, which
   have similar accuracies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{392-406}},
Abstract = {{Data assimilation has allowed hydrologists to account for imperfections
   in observations and uncertainties in model estimates. Typically, updated
   members are determined as a compromised merger between observations and
   model predictions. The merging procedure is conducted in decision space
   before model parameters are updated to reflect the assimilation.
   However, given the dynamics between states and model parameters, there
   is limited guarantee that when updated parameters are applied into
   measurement models, the resulting estimate will be the same as the
   updated estimate. To account for these challenges, this study uses
   evolutionary data assimilation (EDA) to estimate streamflow in gauged
   and ungauged watersheds. EDA assimilates daily streamflow into a
   Sacramento soil moisture accounting model to determine updated members
   for eight watersheds in southern Ontario, Canada. The updated members
   are combined to estimate streamflow in ungauged watersheds where the
   results show high estimation accuracy for gauged and ungauged
   watersheds. An evaluation of the commonalities in model parameter values
   across and between gauged and ungauged watersheds underscore the
   critical contributions of consistent model parameter values. The
   findings show a high degree of commonality in model parameter values
   such that members of a given gauged/ungauged watershed can be estimated
   using members from another watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Missing values in in situ monitoring data is a problem often encountered
   in hydrologic research and applications. Values in a data set may be
   missing because of sensor error or failure of data recording devices.
   Whereas various imputation techniques have focused on
   hydrometeorological data, very few studies have investigated gap-filling
   methods for soil moisture data. This paper aims to fill that gap by
   investigating well-established statistical and data-driven methods for
   infilling missing values in a high resolution, soil moisture time
   series. Since 2006, the authors collected hourly soil moisture data in
   the Hamilton-Halton Watershed, Southern Ontario, Canada at four research
   sites. Each site contained nine stations with time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) soil sensors at six soil depths. From these distributed data sets,
   the authors removed values randomly (approximate to 5\%) and
   systematically (approximate to 20\%) from the data to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the monthly average replacement (MAR), soil layer
   relative difference (SLRD), linear and cubic interpolation, artificial
   neural networks (ANN), and evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR)
   infilling methods. When values were randomly removed, interpolation,
   ANN, and EPR were able to infill the missing values with similar
   efficiency, whereas MAR and SLRD were the least effective methods.
   Similarly, when large systematic gaps were present in the data,
   interpolation and ANN were the most effective methods of infilling,
   respectively. However, the effectiveness of both infilling methods is
   limited as serial gaps become larger than 72-100h.}},

Title = {{Quality relevant nonlinear batch process performance monitoring using a

Abstract = {{Multiway kernel partial least squares method (MKPLS) has recently been
   developed for monitoring the operational performance of nonlinear batch
   or semi-batch processes. It has strong capability to handle batch
   trajectories and nonlinear process dynamics, which cannot be effectively
   dealt with by traditional multiway partial least squares (MPLS)
   technique. However, MKPLS method may not be effective in capturing
   significant non-Gaussian features of batch processes because only the
   second-order statistics instead of higher-order statistics are taken
   into account in the underlying model. On the other hand, multiway kernel
   independent component analysis (MKICA) has been proposed for nonlinear
   batch process monitoring and fault detection. Different from MKPLS,
   MKICA can extract not only nonlinear but also non-Gaussian features
   through maximizing the higher-order statistic of negentropy instead of
   second-order statistic of covariance within the high-dimensional kernel
   space. Nevertheless, MKICA based process monitoring approaches may not
   be well suited in many batch processes because only process measurement
   variables are utilized while quality variables are not considered in the
   multivariate models. In this paper, a novel multiway kernel based
   quality relevant non-Gaussian latent subspace projection (MKQNGLSP)
   approach is proposed in order to monitor the operational performance of
   batch processes with nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamics by combining
   measurement and quality variables. First, both process measurement and
   quality variables are projected onto high-dimensional nonlinear kernel
   feature spaces, respectively. Then, the multidimensional latent
   directions within kernel feature subspaces corresponding to measurement
   and quality variables are concurrently searched for so that the
   maximized mutual information between the measurement and quality spaces
   is obtained. The I-2 and SPE monitoring indices within the extracted
   latent subspaces are further defined to capture batch process faults
   resulting in abnormal product quality. The proposed MKQNGLSP method is
   applied to a fed-batch penicillin fermentation process and the
   operational performance monitoring results demonstrate the superiority
   of the developed method as apposed to the MKPLS based process monitoring
   approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MAGAZINE OF CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-49}},
Abstract = {{The increasing tendency to use urban civilian buildings for military
   purposes prompts the need for the assessment of their blast resistance.
   Many of these buildings are made of reinforced concrete ( RC). Popular
   tools available for the assessment of existing RC structures in practice
   include guidelines and design standards, technical manuals and
   specialised software. These tools include certain assumptions based on
   scarcely available test data, as historically they were collected for
   military purposes. Efforts to transfer this knowledge from military to
   civilian applications are relatively recent and need be corroborated by
   further testing and numerical analysis. The objective of this paper is
   to present the results of field tests on full-scale RC members to check
   the validity of a number of assumptions routinely made in current
   numerical/analytical models. The data captured during the tests,
   including reflected pressure and member displacements, are compared with
   results of empirical and numerical models, in order to gauge the
   robustness and accuracy of the assumptions underpinning these models.
   Finally, recommendations are made for an expedient assessment of
   existing buildings based on simple methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The paper aims to focus on the memory-polynomial model (MPM)
   as special case of Volterra series, implemented in hardware. The
   behavior of the 1WPM is fully proved through a comparison with AM-AM and
   AM-PM measured data. The results show that this simulation technique is
   able to prove the effectiveness of the 1VIPM implementation as
   behavioural model for high power radiofrequency amplifiers. The system
   is able to compensate perturbations caused by modern communication
   systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - The implementation uses Matlab-Simulink,
   and its digital signal processing (DSP) builder. The first stage allows
   developing the model in Matlab using the DSP builder blockset through
   the signal compiler block. Then, the design is downloaded to the DSP
   board.
   Findings - The paper demonstrates a proper behavior of the MPM as a
   truncation of the Volterra series, with respect to different inputs.
   This is a key point, because the series truncations allow first to
   implement this model in real time and second to obtain a correct
   precision, for instance when modeling amplification of digital signals
   in high frequency.
   Originality/value - The global system approach permits to easily
   develop, simulate, and validate a wireless system. The efficiency of a
   complete connected solution based on Agilent Technologies tools,
   combining simulations and measurements under true operating conditions,
   seems to be clearly demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate motor functional
   status measured by motor Functional Independence Measure (mFIM) test in
   population above 65 years of age after the hip fracture.
   Material and Methods: We evaluated 203 patients after hip fracture by
   mFIM test on 3 occasions: at admission (Period-1), at discharge
   (Period-2) and 3 months after discharge (Period-3); 3 age groups:
   Group(65-74), Group(75-84) and Group(85-up) and 2 groups concerning
   Severity Index (SI): group 0-1.99 (SI 1) and group >= 2 (SI2).
   Results: In same SI group there is significant increase in mFIM values
   for Period-2 and Period-3 for both genders and in first two age groups,
   while for those above 85 years of age with higher SI we found
   non-significant change in mFIM values between discharge and 3 months
   post discharge period.
   Discussion: The most significant improvement is obtained for women in
   first and third age groups and with higher SI.
   Conclusion: Gender is not significant predictor for motor functional
   recovery measured by mFIM test in patients with hip fracture, although
   the admittance mFIM is a good indicator for mFIM capacity recovery in
   women of certain age groups (first and third age groups).}},

Abstract = {{The properties of Cu-Mn-O spinels containing Mg were studied for use as
   protective coatings on UNS430 stainless steel interconnects in solid
   oxide fuel cells. Cu-Mn-Mg-O spinel coatings were formed by oxidizing
   electrodeposited copper, manganese, and magnesium hydroxide films in air
   at 800 degrees C. A base layer of copper aided uniform manganese
   deposition and uniform spine! formation. The Mg-Mn-O pseudobinary phase
   diagram based on XRD results shows a wide range of spinet
   non-stoichiometry. The CuMn2O4 spinel coating has higher conductivity
   (similar to 100 S/cm at 800 degrees C) but exhibited buckling defects.
   Addition of magnesium to the Cu-Mn-O spinel coatings significantly
   reduced the buckling damage. Although the measured electrical
   conductivity of MgMn2O4 is 1-2 S/cm at 800 degrees C, Cu0.7Mg0.3Mn2O4
   has a conductivity of similar to 60 S/cm at 800 degrees C. Cu-Mn-Mg-O

Abstract = {{White matter matures with age and is important for the efficient
   transmission of neuronal signals. Consequently, white matter growth may
   underlie the development of cognitive processes important for learning,
   including the speed of information processing. To dissect the
   relationship between white matter structure and information processing
   speed, we administered a reaction time task (finger abduction in
   response to visual cue) to 27 typically developing, right-handed
   children aged 4 to 13. Magnetoencephalography and Diffusion Tensor
   Imaging were used to delineate white matter connections implicated in
   visual-motor information processing. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and
   radial diffusivity (RD) of the optic radiation in the left hemisphere,
   and FA and mean diffusivity (MD) of the optic radiation in the right
   hemisphere changed significantly with age. MD and RD decreased with age
   in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and bilaterally in
   the cortico-spinal tracts. No age-related changes were evident in the
   inferior longitudinal fasciculus. FA of the cortico-spinal tract in the
   left hemisphere and MD of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus of
   the right hemisphere contributed uniquely beyond the effect of age in
   accounting for reaction time performance of the right hand. Our findings
   support the role of white matter maturation in the development of

Abstract = {{Floods are one of the most common natural disasters worldwide, leading
   to economic losses and loss of human lives. This paper highlights the
   hydrological effects of multi-temporal land use changes in flood hazard
   within the Yialias catchment area, located in central Cyprus. A
   calibrated hydrological model was firstly developed to describe the
   hydrological processes and internal basin dynamics of the three major
   subbasins, in order to study the diachronic effects of land use changes.
   For the implementation of the hydrological model, land use, soil and
   hydrometeorological data were incorporated. The climatic and stream flow
   data were derived from rain and flow gauge stations located in the wider
   area of the watershed basin. In addition, the land use and soil data
   were extracted after the application of object-oriented nearest neighbor
   algorithms of ASTER satellite images. Subsequently, the cellular
   automata (CA)-Markov chain analysis was implemented to predict the 2020
   land use/land cover (LULC) map and incorporate it to the hydrological
   impact assessment. The results denoted the increase of runoff in the
   catchment area due to the recorded extensive urban sprawl phenomenon of
   the last decade.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated how comparable peripheral quantitative computed tomography
   (pQCT) measurements of cortical thickness, density, and apparent
   trabecular structure at the ultradistal tibia were with those measured
   with high-resolution pQCT (HR-pQCT). We also examined whether the
   accuracy of the pQCT-based trabecular and cortical measurements improved
   with reductions in slice thickness from the standard 2.2 mm to 1.1 and
   0.6 mm. We immersed 15 dry tibia specimens in saline in a sealed
   cylinder and scanned 22 5 mm from the distal tibia plateau using pQCT
   and HR-pQCT. pQCT underestimated cortical thickness by Stratec
   (CThStratec) and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) by 21.4\% and 72.9\%,
   whereas bone volume to total volume (BV/TV) and cortical density (CDen)
   were overestimated by 265.8\% and 13.1\%, respectively. Measurements of
   trabecular volumetric bone mineral density, trabecular area, total area,
   cortical thickness by custom software were comparable, but for
   CThStratec, Tb.Sp, BV/TV, and CDen, the differences between imaging
   devices varied with magnitude of the estimate. We recommend that
   researchers or clinicians interested in using pQCT to measure apparent
   trabecular structure or cortical thickness at the epiphyses, or in
   comparing findings from different devices, be aware of the differences
   between HR-pQCT and pQCT.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being an accepted model for a wide variety of optical channels,
   few general results on optimal signalling for discrete-time Poisson
   (DTP) channels are known. Among the most significant is that under
   simultaneous peak and average constraints, the capacity-achieving
   distributions are discrete with a finite number of mass points.
   In this paper, several fundamental properties of capacity-achieving
   distributions for DTP channels are established. In particular, we
   demonstrate that all capacity-achieving distributions of the DTP channel
   have zero as a mass point. In the case of only a peak constraint, it is
   further shown that the optimal distribution always has a mass point at
   the maximum amplitude. Finally, under solely an average power
   constraint, it is shown that a finite number of mass points are
   insufficient to achieve the capacity. In addition to these analytical
   results, a numerical algorithm based on deterministic annealing is
   presented which can efficiently compute both the channel capacity and
   the associated optimal input distribution under peak and average power
   constraints. Numerical lower bounds based on the envelope of information
   rates induced by the maxentropic distributions are also shown to be
   extremely close to the capacity, especially in the low power regime.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete-time Poisson (DTP) channels exist in many scenarios including

   simulation, binary-input distributions have been observed to be optimal
   in many cases, however, little analytical work exists on conditions for
   optimality or the form of optimal signalling.
   In this second part, the general properties of Part I are extended to
   the case of DTP channels where binary-inputs are optimal. Necessary and
   sufficient conditions on the optimality of binary (i.e. two mass point)
   distributions are presented by leveraging the general properties of DTP
   capacity-achieving distributions. Closed-form expressions of the
   capacity-achieving distributions are derived in several important
   special cases including zero dark current and for high dark current.
   Numerical results are presented to elucidate the developed analytical

   This result generalizes the standard expression found in the literature,

   of the Lambert W function. As done in the derivation of the standard
   expression, the generalization only considers thermionic emission, but
   the method can equally be applied for other transport mechanisms. The
   general result mathematically contains the expression for the current
   density across a metal-semiconductor Schottky contact as a limiting
   case, unifying the treatment of these two heterointerfaces into a single

Abstract = {{In this study, an inexact mixed-integer fractional energy system
   planning (IMIF-EP) model is developed for supporting sustainable energy
   system management under uncertainty. Based on a hybrid of
   interval-parameter programming (IPP), fractional programming (FP) and
   mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques, IMIF-EP can
   systematically reflect various complexities in energy management
   systems. It not only handles imprecise uncertainties and dynamic
   features associated with power generation expansion planning, but also
   optimizes the system efficiency represented as output/input ratios. An
   interactive transform algorithm is proposed to solve the IMIF-EP model.
   For demonstrating effectiveness of the developed approach, IMIF-EP is
   applied to support long-term planning for an energy system. The results
   indicate that interval solutions obtained from IMIF-EP can provide
   flexible schemes of resource allocations and facility expansions towards
   sustainable energy management (SEM) under multiple complexities. A
   comparative economical energy management (EEM) system is also provided.
   Compared with least-cost models that optimize single criterion, IMIF-EP
   can better characterize practical energy management problems by
   optimizing a ratio between criteria of two magnitudes. In application,
   IMIF-EP is advantageous in balancing conflicting objectives and
   reflecting complicated relationships among multiple system factors. (C)

Abstract = {{Accurate wind speed forecasting is becoming increasingly important to
   improve and optimize renewable wind power generation. Particularly,
   reliable short-term wind speed prediction can enable model predictive
   control of wind turbines and real-time optimization of wind farm
   operation. However, this task remains challenging due to the strong
   stochastic nature and dynamic uncertainty of wind speed. In this study,
   unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is integrated with support vector
   regression (SVR) based state-space model in order to precisely update
   the short-term estimation of wind speed sequence. In the proposed
   SVR-UKF approach, support vector regression is first employed to
   formulate a nonlinear state-space model and then unscented Kalman filter
   is adopted to perform dynamic state estimation recursively on wind
   sequence with stochastic uncertainty. The novel SVR-UKF method is
   compared with artificial neural networks (ANNs), SVR, autoregressive
   (AR) and autoregressive integrated with Kalman filter (AR-Kalman)
   approaches for predicting short-term wind speed sequences collected from
   three sites in Massachusetts, USA. The forecasting results indicate that
   the proposed method has much better performance in both one-step-ahead
   and multi-step-ahead wind speed predictions than the other approaches
   across all the locations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A phenomenological model of the auditory periphery in cats was

   a few issues arising from the responses of the previous version have
   been addressed. The parameters of the synapse model have been readjusted
   to better simulate reported physiological discharge rates at saturation
   for higher characteristic frequencies {[}Liberman, J. Acoust. Soc. Am.
   63, 442-455 (1978)]. This modification also corrects the responses of
   higher-characteristic frequency (CF) model fibers to low-frequency tones
   that were erroneously much higher than the responses of low-CF model
   fibers in the previous version. In addition, an analytical method has
   been implemented to compute the mean discharge rate and variance from
   the model's synapse output that takes into account the effects of

Abstract = {{A measurement-based method to evaluate the efficiency of antennas used

   network formed by the antennas and the medium between them. The medium's
   electrical properties mimic those of tissue and can vary according to
   the application. Several measurements are performed with one of the
   antennas being loaded with known loads. A system of equations is
   constructed from the acquired data. The solution of this system produces
   the efficiency of the antenna in addition to other unknown parameters of
   the SFG. The efficiencies of two antennas are estimated from measured
   and simulated data and are verified through comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of image resolution up-conversion (image interpolation)
   based on maximum a posteriori sequence estimation is proposed. Instead
   of making a hard decision about the value of each missing pixel, we
   estimate the missing pixels in groups. At each missing pixel of the high
   resolution (HR) image, we consider an ensemble of candidate
   interpolation methods (interpolation functions). The interpolation
   functions are interpreted as states of a Markov model. In other words,
   the proposed method undergoes state transitions from one missing pixel
   position to the next. Accordingly, the interpolation problem is
   translated to the problem of estimating the optimal sequence of
   interpolation functions corresponding to the sequence of missing HR
   pixel positions. We derive a parameter-free probabilistic model for this
   to-be-estimated sequence of interpolation functions. Then, we solve the
   estimation problem using a trellis representation and the Viterbi
   algorithm. Using directional interpolation functions and sequence
   estimation techniques, we classify the new algorithm as an adaptive
   directional interpolation using soft-decision estimation techniques.
   Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm yields images with
   higher or comparable peak signal-to-noise ratios compared with some
   benchmark interpolation methods in the literature while being efficient
   in terms of implementation and complexity considerations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a generalized equalization model for image

   histogram and contrast enhancement/white balancing, we first establish a
   generalized equalization model integrating contrast enhancement and
   white balancing into a unified framework of convex programming of image
   histogram. We show that many image enhancement tasks can be accomplished
   by the proposed model using different configurations of parameters. With
   two defining properties of histogram transform, namely contrast gain and
   nonlinearity, the model parameters for different enhancement
   applications can be optimized. We then derive an optimal image
   enhancement algorithm that theoretically achieves the best joint
   contrast enhancement and white balancing result with trading-off between
   contrast enhancement and tonal distortion. Subjective and objective
   experimental results show favorable performances of the proposed
   algorithm in applications of image enhancement, white balancing and tone
   correction. Computational complexity of the proposed method is also

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate the
   cerebrovascular hemodynamic response of cervical spine positions
   including rotation and cervical spine manipulation in vivo using
   magnetic resonance imaging technology on the vertebral artery (VA).
   Methods: This pilot study was conducted as a blinded examiner cohort
   with 4 randomized clinical tasks. Ten healthy male participants aged 24
   to 30 years (mean, 26.8 years) volunteered to participate in the study.
   None of the participants had a history of disabling neck, arm, or
   headache pain within the last 6 months. They did not have any current or
   history of neurologic symptoms. In a neutral head position, physiologic
   measures of VA blood flow and velocity at the C1-2 spinal level were
   obtained using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging after 3
   different head positions and a chiropractic upper cervical spinal
   manipulation. A total of 30 flow-encoded phase-contrast images were
   collected over the cardiac cycle, in each of the 4 conditions, and were
   used to provide a blood flow profile for one complete cardiac cycle.
   Differences between flow (in milliliters per second) and velocity (in
   centimeters per second) variables were evaluated using repeated-measures
   analysis of variance.
   Results: The side-to-side difference between ipsilateral and
   contralateral VA velocities was not significant for either velocities (P
   = .14) or flows (P = .19) throughout the conditions. There were no other
   interactions or trends toward a difference for any of the other blood
   flow or velocity variables.
   Conclusions: There were no significant changes in blood flow or velocity
   in the vertebral arteries of healthy young male adults after various
   head positions and cervical spine manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{Bioretention systems are increasingly being used to control the adverse
   effects of urbanization on stormwater quantity and quality. The
   stormwater capture efficiency of a bioretention system, defined as the
   fraction of stormwater volume captured by the system, can be used as an
   important index of its stormwater management performance. In this paper,
   an analytical probabilistic expression (APE) is derived for estimating
   the long-term average stormwater capture efficiency of bioretention
   systems. The derivation is based on the probability distribution
   functions of the input rainfall event characteristics and the
   rainfall-runoff-overflow transformations occurring on a bioretention
   system and its contributing catchment. In the derivation, instead of
   simply adopting the Howard's conservative assumption as used in many
   previous studies, an approximate expected value of the surface
   depression water contents of a bioretention system at the end of a
   random rainfall event {[}denoted as E(S-dw)] is derived and used. The
   accuracy of the resulting APE is verified by comparing its results with
   those determined from continuous simulations. The use of E(S-dw) is
   proven to be advantageous than the use of the Howard's conservative
   assumption, it demonstrates that similar methods may be developed to
   analytically evaluate the stormwater management performance of other
   types of storage facilities for which the Howard's conservative
   assumption was employed previously.}},

Abstract = {{It is very important that the electrical power which the appliances are
   subjected to, needs to be at their rated value. This is because the
   performance of the appliance is optimum at its designated value.
   Unfortunately, in the UK and in other parts of the world, the electric
   appliances are supplied with voltage higher than their required value
   which is wasting a considerable amount of energy, deteriorating the
   performance of the electric appliances and is proving very costly for
   electricity consumers. This problem of overvoltage and the effect of
   voltage optimization on the domestic appliances will be investigated in
   this project. In order to determine the effects of the overvoltage,
   several experiments at different supply voltages and one using a Voltage
   Optimizer will be carried out on one domestic freezer, which is one of
   the most commonly used domestic appliance. For every experiment, the
   motor parameters such as temperature, power consumption, current drawn
   etc. will be measured. In the end, the parameter values for all the
   experiments will be analyzed in order to determine the benefit of
   voltage optimization for domestic appliances.}},

Abstract = {{Structure learning of Bayesian Network is one of important topics in
   machine learning and widely applied in expert system. The traditional
   algorithms for structure learning are usually focused on the entire
   nodes in BN. It is difficult to learn the structure efficiently from the
   huge amounts of data. In reality, BN as a special inference network and
   the community also exists in BN. To achieve this goal, we propose Graph
   Partitioning Approach for BN Structure Learning. Firstly, we get the
   skeleton of BN by conditional dependence test. Secondly, skeleton is
   divided into some communities. Thirdly, the structure of every community
   is learned and the edges between communities are determined by BIC
   (Bayesian Information Criterion) score function. Numerical experiments
   on the standard network show that our proposed algorithm can greatly
   reduce the time cost of structure learning and have more accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution finite element models (HRFEM) simulating human heads can
   be utilized to quantify Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) threshold due to a
   direct (e.g. impact) or an indirect (e.g. blast) dynamic shock. With the
   complex brain structure, for an accurate investigation of the influence
   of such brain injuries, accurate realistic geometrical brain structures
   must be developed.
   The objective of the current simulation study is to present the steps
   undertaken to generate a high resolution finite element model for human
   brains that will assist in studying the effects of a wide a spectrum
   mechanical insult to human heads. In this study, an MRI-T1 DICOM data
   files for healthy male head have been used for segmenting and extracting
   the brain structure. The segmented brain model has been meshed using
   tetrahedral elements with maximum size of 2 mm. This HRFEM for the brain
   was composed of 116,394 nodes and 607,457 elements. The model was then
   subjected to a simulated shock wave of 0.3 MPa peak pressure from
   anterior direction. This was simulated using the ConWep module available
   in the LSDYNA explicit finite element modeling software. Three
   dimensional plots of maximum pressure and maximum stress clearly
   demonstrated significant effects of the dynamic shock load. The
   generated HRFEM for the brain and the simulation results demonstrate the
   capability of the modeling approach in describing the brain response
   under shock-type loads, including those caused by blast wave.}},

Abstract = {{Upconversion is an optical process in which two or more low-energy
   photons are converted to one high-energy photon. Placing layers capable
   of performing this process at the rear face of a standard bifacial solar
   cell allows for utilization of sub-bandgap photons that would be
   otherwise lost. Optimization of antireflection coatings for devices
   using upconversion is particularly important as it needs to take into
   account the normally neglected sub-bandgap part of the spectrum. In this
   paper we study the optimization of antireflection coatings for bifacial
   silicon solar cells for upconversion applications. A 3-layer stack of
   MgF2 / Si3N4 / TiO2 shows the lowest weighted reflectance with 88.6\%
   transmission at 1520 nm as compared to 78\% transmission for I-layer
   ARC. Minimizing reflection losses results in greater number of photons
   reaching the upconverter layer resulting in a potential enhancement of
   28\% in the short-circuit current due to upconversion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a system that uses computation offloading,
   where an infrastructure-based cloud server executes jobs on behalf of a
   set of mobile devices. In this type of system, mobile job completion
   times include the latency needed for uploading to the cloud server.
   Since the processed jobs are subject to hard deadline constraints, this
   can introduce energy unfairness where mobile devices with poor channel
   conditions do not fully benefit from computation offloading. This
   unfairness however, can be compensated for, by dynamic scheduling at the
   cloud server. We first derive an offline scheduler using an integer
   linear program which uses a min-max energy objective and non-preemptive
   cloud server scheduling. We then introduce three online scheduling
   algorithms. The first is referred to as First-Generated-First-Served
   (FGFS) where jobs that are generated earlier are given priority at the
   cloud server. A modified version, referred to as gamma-Ratio Accepted
   FGFS (gamma-FGFS) is proposed where acceptance of a job execution
   partition is subject to an energy threshold test. We also introduce a
   version of this algorithm, gamma-Ratio Accepted Earliest Deadline First
   (gamma-EDF) which uses earliest deadline first scheduling to test for
   job partition feasibility. Various performance results are presented
   which show the improvements in energy fairness possible with the
   proposed schedulers.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional methods for the detection of bacterial viability and drug
   resistance are either expensive, time consuming, or not definitive, and
   thus do not provide all the information sought by the medical
   professionals. Here, we solve these problems by introducing an
   innovative detection method to produce rapid and accurate diagnosis of
   bacterial infection through miniaturization and parallelization. This
   method is demonstrated with wells of several shapes (square, circle),
   diameters (100 - 1000 mu m) and depths (<= 100 mu m). In the development
   of proof of concept, we use laboratory strain of E. coli as the model
   pathogen. The integration of the fluorescent oxygen sensor, ruthenium
   tris (2,2'-diprydl) dichloride hexahydrate (RTDP), allows us to monitor
   the dissolved oxygen concentration as a measure of bacterial metabolism.
   Detection time of the bacteria within the microwells can be as fast as a
   few of hours (4-5hrs), with concentrations that vary between 102 to 108
   cells/mL. Adding the appropriate drug to the broth and measuring growth
   through fluorescence also probed drug resistance. This reported method
   for microfabrication of the wells, is rapid, economical, versatile and
   simple.}},

Abstract = {{Retargeting algorithms are needed to transfer an image from a device to
   another with different size and resolution. The goal is to preserve the
   best visual quality for important objects of the original image. In
   order to reduce image size, pixels should be removed from less important
   parts of the image. Therefore, we need an energy function to select less
   important pixels in seam carving. Various energy functions have been
   proposed in previous works to minimize the distortion in salient
   objects. In this paper we combine three different importance maps to
   form a new energy map. We first use both gradient and depth maps to
   highlight the values in the saliency map, eventually generates the final
   energy map. Experimental results using the proposed energy map show
   better visual appearance in comparison to previous algorithms even at
   high resizing percentage. The visual artifacts that cause shape
   deformation in salient objects and deteriorates geometrical consistency
   of the scene are considerably reduced in our proposed algorithm.}},

   graph-theoretically modeled as the construction of K-edge maximum-weight

   the proposed algorithm is made more effective by being combined with a
   preprocess of image restoration that aims to correct quantization errors

Abstract = {{There has been significant interest in the use of semiconductor
   detectors such as cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) for SPECT/MRI and PET/MRI
   due to their ability to operate in high magnetic fields. However, the
   effect of these materials on magnetic field homogeneity must be
   considered when designing an MR-compatible gamma camera. Field maps were
   generated for several materials considered for an MR-compatible gamma
   camera to determine the extent of the shift in magnetic field. The
   materials used were CZT, Al, carbon fiber, printed circuit boards,
   thermoelectric cooler, Pb and a composite material consisting largely of
   tungsten. A lipid phantom filled with a mixture of 50\% canola oil and
   50\% water (similar to 9 cm x similar to 9 cm x 6 cm) was imaged with
   and without the materials placed adjacent to the phantom/foot ankle
   coil. Data were acquired with the materials individually and as a
   combined system with and without power. MRI phase images, at TE = 5 and
   8 ms (using a 3T MRI), were used to calculate magnetic field (B-0)
   homogeneity. Tungsten and the thermoelectric cooler resulted in a
   significant B-0 shift near the boundary of the phantom where the
   materials were placed, whereas the aluminum had the least effect on the
   field homogeneity. Based on a linear approximation, the material with
   the largest effect on the magnetic field, tungsten, would need to be
   placed approximately 0.6 cm outside of the RF receiver coil, making it
   3.4 cm in total from the phantom to have negligible effect on the field
   homogeneity. There was negligible effect on magnetic field homogeneity
   when high or low voltage power were supplied to the CZT detector system.}},

Abstract = {{A novel free chlorine sensor which uses oxidation of phenyl capped
   aniline tetramer (PCAT) to dope single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and
   changes its resistance has been developed. The oxidation of PCAT by
   chlorine switches the PCAT-SWCNT system to low resistance (p-doped)
   state which is detected by probing it with a small voltage. The change
   in resistance is proportional to the concentration of the chlorine in
   the sample. The p-doped PCAT-SWCNT then can be electrochemically
   un-doped by polarizing it cathodically. This new sensor not only shows
   good sensing response in the whole concentration range of free chlorine

   interpolation to generate an initial HR estimation, GPU-aided

   implemented with GPU to support real-time applications. Experiments

Abstract = {{Flow-induced vibration is an important criterion for the design of heat
   exchangers in nuclear, fossil and chemical plant. Of the several known
   vibration excitation mechanisms, fluidelastic instability (FEI) is the
   most serious because it can cause tube failures in a relatively short
   period of time. Traditionally, FEI has been observed to occur in the
   direction transverse to the flow and anti-vibration bars (AVB) have been
   used to stamen the tubes against this motion. More recently, interest
   has increased in the possibility of FEI occurring in the streamwise
   direction, parallel to the flow. This is the subject of the present
   paper. Numerical simulations have been carried out to study the effects
   of tube-to-support clearance, tube sliding friction, tube-to-support
   preload, and ambient turbulence levels on the FEI threshold in the
   streamwise direction. As one would expect, increasing friction and tube
   preload against the support both tend to stabilize the tube against
   streamwise FEI. Importantly, the results also show that decreasing
   tube-support clearances destabilizes streamwise FEI while having little
   effect on transverse FEI. Increasing ambient turbulence levels also has
   the effect of destabilizing streamwise FEI.}},

Abstract = {{A Main-Steam-Line-Break accident in a CANDU nuclear steam generator
   produces a blowdown in which all the pressurised water is boiled off in
   a few seconds. The resulting high transient loading on the heat
   exchanger tubing could lead to their rupture, resulting in the release
   of radioactive materials out of containment. A better understanding of
   this phenomenon will permit the development of improved design tools to
   ensure steam generator safety in the event of such an accident. The
   paper presents a commissioned experimental rig and instrumentation
   system, for which a two-phase experimental program has been developed.
   Using R134a as the working fluid, measurements of temperature, pressure,
   and tube loading, as well as simultaneous high-speed flow visualisation,
   have been taken at conditions simulating a full-scale operating steam
   generator. The experimental results will be used to develop theoretical
   modelling tools for single and two-phase blowdown, such that an estimate
   of tube loading during Main-Steam-Line Break can be predicted from

Title = {{Cognitive Control: Theory and Application}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{698-710}},
Abstract = {{From an engineering point-of-view, cognitive control is inspired by the
   prefrontal cortex of the human brain; cognitive control may therefore be
   viewed as the overarching function of a cognitive dynamic system. In
   this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control
   that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which
   are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the
   perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive
   characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is
   shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of
   Bellman's dynamic programming Distinctive properties of the new
   algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2)
   algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of
   complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the
   cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic
   properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented,
   which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic
   the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1)
   the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive
   controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different
   controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional Q-learning, and
   the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state
   model, and they both involve the use of planning.}},

Abstract = {{Polyvinylamine (PVAm) was derivatized with lactobionic acid to give
   PVAm-GAL with pendant galactose groups along the PVAm chain. The
   galactose substituents were shown to undergo two types of specific
   interactions: (1) condensation with phenylboronic acid moieties on
   polymers and on surfaces; and, (2) the specific binding of RCA(120), a
   galactose-specific lectin. Surface binding and assembly was monitored
   with Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM-D) measurements. Multilayer
   assemblies based on boronic ester formation were destroyed by lowering
   the pH, or by introducing sorbitol. We propose that the physical
   adsorption of PVAm-GAL onto silica or other negatively charged support
   surfaces is a simple route to galactose-rich interfaces, possibly useful
   for affinity separations, cell targeting and cell culturing. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Optimum selection of cutting conditions in high-speed and
   ultra-precision machining processes often poses a challenging task due
   to several reasons; such as the need for costly experimental setup and
   the limitation on the number of experiments that can be performed before
   tool degradation starts becoming a source of noise in the readings.
   Moreover, oftentimes there are several objectives to consider, some of
   which may be conflicting, while others may be somewhat correlated.
   Pareto-optimality analysis is needed for conflicting objectives; however
   the existence of several objectives (high dimension Pareto space) makes
   the generation and interpretation of Pareto solutions difficult. The
   approach adopted in this paper is a modified multi-objective efficient
   global optimization (m-EGO). In m-EGO, sample data points from
   experiments are used to construct Kriging meta-models, which act as
   predictors for the performance objectives. Evolutionary multi-objective
   optimization is then conducted to spread a population of new candidate
   experiments towards the zones of search space that are predicted by the
   Kriging models to have favorable performance, as well as zones that are
   under explored. New experiments are then used to update the Kriging
   models, and the process is repeated until termination criteria are met.
   Handling a large number of objectives is improved via a special
   selection operator based on principle component analysis (PCA) within
   the evolutionary optimization. PCA is used to automatically detect
   correlations among objectives and perform the selection within a reduced
   space in order to achieve a better distribution of experimental sample
   points on the Pareto frontier. Case studies show favorable results in
   ultra precision diamond turning of Aluminum alloy as well as highspeed
   drilling of woven composites.}},

   microfluidic devices, serving as a controlled time shutoff valve. The
   utility of the valve was demonstrated by a one-step, fully automatic
   implementation of a complex pesticide assay requiring timed, sequential
   exposure of an immobilized enzyme layer to separate liquid streams.
   Pullulan film dissolution and the capillary wicking of aqueous solutions
   through the device were measured and modeled providing valve design
   criteria. The films dissolve mainly by surface erosion, meaning the film
   thickness mainly controls the shutoff time. This method can also provide
   time-dependent sequential release of reagents without compromising the
   simplicity and low cost of paper-based devices.}},

Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) control the wind-induced vibrations of tall
   buildings using sloshing fluid. TLD tanks of complex geometry may be
   required in practice due to space limitations; however, their behaviour
   has not been considered in the literature. This study develops and
   experimentally validates a model to describe the structure-TLD
   interaction of a 2D system when the TLD tank geometry is complex. The
   equations of motion of the structure-TLD system are developed using
   Lagrange's equation. In general, the 2D structure-TLD interaction must
   be represented as a coupled four degree of freedom system. The model is
   validated using new structure-TLD system tests where the structure is
   subjected to 1D and 2D harmonic and random excitation. Two TLD tanks of
   complex geometry are considered; the first tank is anti-symmetric about
   both axes, whereas the second tank is symmetric about both axes. For the
   anti-symmetric tank, energy transfer between orthogonal structural sway
   modes and sloshing modes is significant; however, for the symmetric
   tank, this energy transfer is negligible. Experimental results indicate
   that the model adequately predicts the structural response; however, the
   nonlinear behaviour of the fluid response cannot be captured by the
   linearized model. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Target tracking in high clutter or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   environments is an important topic and still a challenging task. Joint
   Maximum Likelihood Probabilistic Data Association (JML-PDA) is a
   well-known batch method for initializing the tracks of very low
   observable (VLO) targets in heavy clutter environments. On the other
   hand, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) algorithm, which
   is commonly used for recursive track maintenance, lacks track
   initialization capability. In this paper, we propose a Combined JML-PDA
   and JPDA (CJML-PDA) algorithm to automatically initialize and maintain
   the tracks. This combined approach seamlessly shares information between
   the initialization and maintenance stages of the tracker. In contrast,
   in other batch-recursive approaches the initialization and maintenance
   algorithms operate rather independent of each other. The effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a heavy clutter scenario
   and its performance is tested on closely-spaced (but resolved) targets
   with association ambiguity using angle-only measurements. (C) 2013

   properties of the two classes of freestanding monolayers are roughly
   similar, with small differences due to the anisotropy and longer bond
   lengths of the centered rectangular case, the surface alloys on the two
   substrates behave quite differently. The formation energies on Mo(110)
   are markedly smaller; we trace this to the fact that magnetism
   contributes significantly to mixing on Ru(0001) but not on Mo(110). On
   Ru(0001), there is a very stable (root 3 x root 3) FeAu2 phase, in
   agreement with experiments. By performing cluster expansion

Abstract = {{A conceptually new approach to the fabrication of polypyrrole
   (PPy)-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) for application in
   electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors (ES) is proposed.
   Cetrimonium persulfate (CTA)(2)S2O8 in the form of nanocrystals is used
   as an oxidant for the chemical polymerization of PPy. Ponceau S (PS) dye
   is investigated as a new anionic dopant. Testing results show that PS
   allows reduced PPy particle size and improved electrochemical
   performance, whereas (CTA)(2)S2O8, nanocrystals pro, mote the formation
   of PPy nanofibers, We demonstrate for the first time that MWCNT can be
   efficiently dispersed using (CTA)(2)S2O8 nanocrystals. The analysis of
   the dispersion mechanism indicates that (CTA)(2)S2O8 dissociation is
   catalyzed by MWCNT. This new finding opens a new and promising strategy
   in MWCNT dispersion for colloidal processing of nanomaterials and
   electrophoretic nanotechnology. Uniformly coated MWCNT are obtained
   using (CTA)(2)S2O8 as a dispersant for MWCNT and oxidant for PPy
   polymerization and utilizing advantages of PS as an efficient dopant and
   nanostructure controlling agent. The analysis of the testing results
   provides an insight into the influence of PS molecular structure on PPy
   nanostructure and electrochemical properties. The PPy-coated MWCNT show
   superior electrochemical performance compared to PPy nanoparticles. The
   proof-of-principle is demonstrated by the fabrication of ES electrodes
   with excellent electrochemical performance at high active material
   loadings, good capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates, and
   excellent cycling stability.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional materials do not only attract interest owing to their
   anisotropic properties and quantum confinement effects but also lend
   themselves as well-defined building blocks for the rational design of 3D
   materials with custom-made structures and, hence, properties. Here, we
   present the bottom-up fabrication of an artificial superlattice derived
   from positively charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) and negatively
   charged perovskite layers sequentially assembled by electrostatic
   layer-by-layer deposition. In contrast to previously employed bulk
   methods averaging out the elemental distribution within such stacks, we
   use a combination of HRTEM, STEM, and EEL spectroscopy to elucidate the
   structure and composition of the multilayer stack with a high spatial
   resolution on the subnanometer scale. Atomic column resolved STEM
   coupled with EELS line scans confirms the periodic arrangement of
   individual nanosheets by evaluation of the Ca-L-2,L-3 and Mn-L-2,L-3
   edges. Furthermore, HRTEM confirms the formation of up to 100 double
   layer thick films, thus demonstrating the transition from ultrathin
   nanosheet assemblies to artificial bulk solids with engineered
   structures and property profiles. We ascertain the formation of densely
   packed stacks with a well-ordered layered morphology, while
   nonidealities such as lack of in-plane layer registry, layer
   terminations, sheet bending, and contamination by residual ligands are
   side effects of the solution-based deposition process. In addition, we
   demonstrate that the packing density of the multilayer system can be
   tuned by changing the LDH dispersing agent from formamide to water,
   resulting in porous stacks containing about eight times less LDH and
   featuring significantly increased interlayer distances.}},

Title = {{HIV Sexual Transmission Is Predominantly Driven by Single Individuals
   Rather than Discordant Couples: A Model-Based Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relative contribution to HIV transmission from
   different social groups is important for public-health policy.
   Information about the importance of stable serodiscordant couples (when
   one partner is infected but not the other) relative to contacts outside
   of stable partnerships in spreading disease can aid in designing and
   targeting interventions. However, the overall importance of
   within-couple transmission, and the determinants and correlates of this
   importance, are not well understood. Here, we explore how mechanistic
   factors - like partnership dynamics and rates of extra-couple
   transmission - affect various routes of transmission, using a
   compartmental model with parameters based on estimates from Sub-Saharan
   Africa. Under our assumptions, when sampling model parameters within a
   realistic range, we find that infection of uncoupled individuals is
   usually the predominant route (median 0.62, 2.5\%-97.5\% quantiles:
   0.26-0.88), while transmission within discordant couples is usually
   important, but rarely represents the majority of transmissions (median
   0.33, 2.5\%-97.5\% quantiles: 0.10-0.67). We find a strong correlation
   between long-term HIV prevalence and the contact rate of uncoupled
   individuals, implying that this rate may be a key driver of HIV
   prevalence. For a given level of prevalence, we find a negative
   correlation between the proportion of discordant couples and the
   within-couple transmission rate, indicating that low discordance in a
   population may reflect a relatively high rate of within-couple
   transmission. Transmission within or outside couples and among uncoupled
   individuals are all likely to be important in sustaining heterosexual
   HIV transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, intervention policies
   should be broadly targeted when practical.}},

Title = {{Modelling of quasi-static adiabatic bubble formation, growth and

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{742-754}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to lessen the computational expense of bubble growth
   simulations without compromising its fundamental shape characteristics,
   an analytical model is developed It is substantiated using validated
   numerical results simulating quasi static adiabatic bubble growth for
   Bond numbers less than 0.07 in which its characteristic length is the
   radius of the cavity from which the bubble is issuing. The model's
   ability to predict shape and size evolution for bubble formations is
   shown to predict the growth and detachment volume to be in the range
   from 0.05\% for a 0.00137 Bond number to 3\% for a 0.06032 Bond number.
   The model builds upon a recent numerical study which showed that the
   shape evolution of a quasi-static bubble formation may be idealised as a
   spherical segment atop a cylindrical neck for low Bond number
   applications. By incorporating this geometry, the present work's
   proposed model accounts for bubble shape transformation throughout the
   bubble growth cycle by including a necking phenomenon in which the bulk
   of the bubble rises due to an elongating base as it prepares to detach.
   This is accomplished by introducing: (1) a volume condition which
   geometrically relates the neck height with the bubble's spherical
   segment at detachment; (2) a force instability criterion signalling the
   onset of detachment which relates the size of the bubble to its Bond
   number and cavity radius; and (3) a neck evolution growth curve. The
   analytical model ties these relations together with the use of the
   characteristics of the proposed geometry generating a full description
   of quasi-static adiabatic bubble growth and detachment for low Bond
   number formations. The resulting predicted bubble growth
   characteristics, such as profile, volume, centre of gravity, truncated
   sphericity and aspect ratio, are presented and discussed with respect to
   a validated numerical treatment of the problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Pack cementation is an attractive method for the formation of aluminum
   coatings on metal substrates. When applied to porous stainless steel
   substrates, the aluminum vapour species can diffuse into the pores and

   stainless steel substrates by the pack cementation method. The effects
   of pack mixture composition, temperature, time, and the morphology of
   the substrates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. It
   was shown that the degree of coverage of the aluminum coatings increased
   with porosity of the substrate. In addition, increased reaction time and
   temperature of the pack led to a more homogeneous distribution of
   aluminum across the substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Rain gardens have increasingly been used to control the adverse effects
   of urbanization on storm-water quantity and quality. The ratio or
   percentage of storm water generated from the contributing area of a rain
   garden that is captured by the surface depression of the rain garden is
   known as its storm-water capture efficiency. This capture efficiency is
   an important indicator of a rain garden's performance for storm-water
   management. Based on the probability distributions of local rainfall
   event characteristics and the hydrologic operation of rain gardens, an
   explicit analytical equation is derived for estimating the long-term
   average storm-water capture efficiency of a rain garden. The validity of
   the analytical equation is demonstrated by comparing its outcomes with
   results from a series of continuous simulations. Example applications of
   this equation are made for two locations.}},

Abstract = {{In many scientific, medical, and defense applications of image/video
   compression, an l(infinity) error bound is required. However, pure
   l(infinity)-optimized image coding, colloquially known as near-lossless
   image coding, is prone to structured errors such as contours and
   speckles if the bit rate is not sufficiently high; moreover, most of the
   previous l(infinity)-based image coding methods suffer from poor rate
   control. In contrast, the l(2) error metric aims for average fidelity
   and hence preserves the subtlety of smooth waveforms better than the
   l(infinity) error metric and it offers fine granularity in rate control,
   but pure l(2)-based image coding methods (e.g., JPEG 2000) cannot bound
   individual errors as the l(infinity)-based methods can. This paper
   presents a new compression approach to retain the benefits and
   circumvent the pitfalls of the two error metrics. A common approach of
   near-lossless image coding is to embed into a DPCM prediction loop a
   uniform scalar quantizer of residual errors. The said uniform scalar
   quantizer is replaced, in the proposed new approach, by a set of
   context-based l(2)-optimized quantizers. The optimization criterion is
   to minimize a weighted sum of the l(2) distortion and the entropy while
   maintaining a strict l(infinity) error bound. The resulting method
   obtains good rate-distortion performance in both l(2) and l(infinity)
   metrics and also increases the rate granularity. Compared with JPEG
   2000, the new method not only guarantees lower l(infinity) error for all
   bit rates, but also it achieves higher PSNR for relatively high bit
   rates.}},

Title = {{Analysis of implicit and explicit lattice sensitivities using DRAGON}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{265}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Deterministic lattice physics transport calculations are used
   extensively within the context of operational and safety analysis of
   nuclear power plants. As such the sensitivity and uncertainty in the
   evaluated nuclear data used to predict neutronic interactions and other
   key transport phenomena are critical topics for research. Sensitivity
   analysis of nuclear systems with respect to fundamental nuclear data
   using multi-energy-group discretization is complicated by the dilution
   dependency of multi-group macroscopic cross-sections as a result of
   resonance self-shielding. It has become common to group sensitivities
   into implicit and explicit effects to aid in the understanding of the
   nature of the sensitivities involved in the calculations, however the
   overall sensitivity is an integral of these effects. Explicit effects
   stem from perturbations performed for a specific nuclear data for a
   given isotope and at a specific energy, and their direct impact on the
   end figure of merit. Implicit effects stem from resonance self-shielding
   effects and can change the nature of their own sensitivities at other
   energies, or that for other reactions or even other isotopes.
   Quantification of the implicit sensitivity component involves some
   manner of treatment of resonance parameters in a way that is
   self-consistent with perturbations occurring in associated multigroup
   cross-sections. A procedure for assessing these implicit effects is
   described in the context of the Bondarenko method of self-shielding and
   implemented using a WIMS-D4 multi-group nuclear library and the lattice
   solver DRAGON. The resulting sensitivity results were compared to those
   calculated by TSUNAMI-ID, which computes implicit sensitivities using a
   different methodology consisting of a combination of linear perturbation
   theory and automatic differentiation. Energy-dependent sensitivity
   profiles and integrated sensitivity coefficients are presented, as well
   as a comparison of calculated sensitivities for different energy group
   structures and geometry dimensionalities. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Establishing an adequate hydrometric network to provide accurate and
   reliable continuous flow information for various users remains a major
   challenge. This includes the design of new networks or the evaluation of
   existing networks. This study proposes a combined regionalization and
   dual entropy-multiobjective optimization (CRDEMO) method for determining
   minimum network that meets the World Meteorology Organization (WMO)
   standards, which is considered herein an optimal minimum network. A
   regionalization approach is used to estimate flows in potential
   locations for new additional stations, and a dual entropy-multiobjective
   optimization approach is used to identify optimal trade-offs between the
   maximum possible information content and the minimum shared information
   among the stations. The method was examined in two Canadian River
   basins, namely, the St. John River and St. Lawrence River basins. The
   St. John River basin has a higher network density compared to the St.
   Lawrence River basin. Results of the analysis indicate that the St.
   Lawrence River basin requires a high number of new additional stations
   to meet the WMO minimum network density. It was also determined that
   existing stations do not have a significant influence in determining the
   locations of new stations in the St. Lawrence River basin. Conversely,
   however, in the St. John River basin, existing stations have significant
   influence on the determination of locations of new stations due to the
   higher number of existing stations. Overall, the CRDEMO technique is
   shown to be robust for designing optimal minimum hydrometric networks
   and can be a useful tool for evaluating current and proposed networks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Laser-induced Coulomb explosion of gold nanoparticles for
   breast cancer has been studied by nanophotolysis technique. This study
   aimed to investigate whether laser-induced bubble formation due to
   Coulomb explosion can provide an effective approach for selective damage
   of breast cancer with gold nanoparticles.
   Method: Numerical method involves laser-induced Coulomb explosion of
   gold nanoparticles. Different parameters related to nanophotolysis such
   as laser fluence, tumor depth, cluster radius, laser pulse duration, and
   bubble formation is studied numerically. Numerical simulation was
   performed using Mat lab.
   Results: The gold nanoparticles of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nm in radius
   could penetrate into tumor 1.14, 1.155, 1.189, 1.20 and 1.22 cm in depth
   respectively. The maximum penetration depth in tumor could be obtained
   with nanoparticles of 50 nm radius. Short laser pulse of 40 ns with
   nanoparticles of 10 nm radius could penetrate into tumor 1.14 cm in
   depth. Bubbles with a radius of 9 pm could effectively kill breast
   cancer cells without damaging healthy ones. The bubble radius increased
   from 4 to 9 pm with an increase in pulse duration in the range of 10 to
   30 ns.
   Conclusions: Gold nanopartides with increasing radius and bubble
   formation for selective damage of breast cancer cells are successfully
   probed. The present calculated results are compared with other
   experimental findings, and good correlation is found between the present
   work and previous experimental values. It was demonstrated that bubble
   formation in tumor may further increase the efficacy of breast cancer
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Chromotropic acid disodium salt (CHR) and its derivatives, such as
   2,7-Bis(2-sulfophenylazo)chromotropic acid tetrasodium salt (CHR-BS),
   2-(phenylazo)chromotropic acid disodium salt (CHR-P) and
   2-(1-naphthyldiazenyl)chromotropic acid disodium salt (CHR-N) were
   investigated as new anionic dopants for chemical polymerization of
   polypyrrole (PPy) for application in electrodes of electrochemical
   supercapacitors (ES). The analysis of electron microscopy data and
   electrochemical testing results provided an insight into the influence
   of dopant structure, size and charge on the PPy powder morphology and
   electrochemical performance of PPy electrodes. The increase in the size
   and charge of the dopant molecules resulted in reduced powder
   agglomeration and lower particle size. The use of CHR-BS allowed the
   fabrication of non-agglomerated PPy powders with particle size below 50
   nm. It was found that new anionic dopants allowed the fabrication of ES
   electrodes with high mass loading in the range of 20-40 mg cm(-2) and
   good electrochemical performance. Due to the higher charge to mass ratio
   of CHR and CHR-BS. compared to CHR-P and CHR-N, the CHR and CHR-BS doped
   PPy showed higher capacitance. The specific capacitance of 7.2 F cm(-2)
   was achieved using CHR-BS doped PPy. Moreover, CHR-BS doped PPy
   electrodes showed excellent cycling stability. The ES cells, containing
   CHR-BS doped PPy electrodes showed promising electrochemical
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Semicontinuous distillation of impurities for the production of butyl
   acrylate from bio-butanol and bio-acrylic acid}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{165-177}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chemical production processes which use biosynthetic pathways typically
   experience variations in the concentration and composition of impurities
   contained in the products, due to the natural variability of biological
   behaviour. As a result, downstream processes which use these
   biosynthetic chemical products need to be quite flexible with respect to
   the impurity concentrations. In this study, a ternary semicontinuous
   distillation process is investigated, separating a mixture into three
   fractions, as a potential candidate for the purification of three
   different bio-based chemicals (bio-acrylic acid, bio-n-butanol, and
   bio-n-butyl acrylate) which are generated at various steps in the
   process to produce bio-n-butyl acrylate from bio-based feedstocks. In
   this model-based investigation, the performance of this approach is
   discussed in terms of the energy demand, product loss, and the cycle
   time. It is shown, that a single ternary semicontinuous system can be
   applied to purify several bio-based chemicals, allowing a simple
   increase or decrease of the desired final purity, while being able to
   handle natural variations of the initial compositions of the feed. (c)

   waveguide. By introducing subwavelength trenches in the active InGaAsP
   layer, the subwavelength coupler is designed to provide a gradual

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to study the influence of thickness of
   individual elastomer layers (first shape factor) on the vertical and
   horizontal responses of fiber reinforced elastomeric bearings that are
   not bonded or mechanically fastened to their top and bottom supports. By
   definition, the first shape factor, S-1, is the ratio of the plan area
   to the perimeter stress-free area of a single elastomer layer within the
   bearing. Results of a comprehensive 2D-finite element study on a large
   group of bearings with different shape factors of 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40
   suggest that the shape factor S-1 is a critical parameter in controlling
   both the vertical compression modulus of the bearing and the level of
   stress in the fiber-reinforcing layers. Furthermore, the secant
   horizontal stiffness and the stress demand in the bearing elastomer
   material are to a limited extent influenced by the parameter S-1.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the purification of mono-PEGylated HSA by hydrophobic
   interaction membrane chromatography. The hydrophobicity difference
   between the different fractionated species was induced by the addition
   of a lyotropic salt that caused phase transition of PEG (hydrophilic
   under normal condition) to a mildly hydrophobic form. The HSA PEGylation
   reaction mixture was mixed with lyotropic salt and passed through a
   stack of hydrophilized polyvinylidene fluoride membrane discs.
   Unmodified HSA was obtained in the flow through, while the PEGylated
   forms of the protein bound to the membrane and could be eluted by
   reducing the salt concentration. Among the three major PEGylated forms
   of HSA present in the feed (i.e. mono-, di-, and tri-), mono-PEGylated
   HSA was eluted first and could be resolved from the others. The purified
   material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, and SEC
   combined with multi-angle light scattering. All these analytical
   techniques indicated the presence of species that has a molar mass
   consistent with mono-PEGylated HSA. A scaled-down version of the
   membrane chromatographic methods could be used for the rapid and

Abstract = {{Injectable hydrogels based on carboxymethyl cellulose and dextran,

   maintained their original shape for more than 60 days. The maximum
   storage modulus was observed in hydrogels with 0.250 wt \% of unmodified
   CNCs and 0.375 wt \% of CHO-CNCs. CHO-CNCs acted as both a filler and a
   chemical cross-linker, making the CHO-CNC-reinforced hydrogels more
   elastic, more dimensionally stable, and capable of facilitating higher
   nanoparticle loadings compared to hydrogels with unmodified CNCs,
   without sacrificing mechanical strength. No significant cytotoxicity to
   NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells was observed for the hydrogels or their
   individual components. These properties make CNC-reinforced injectable
   hydrogels of potential interest for various biomedical applications such
   as drug delivery vehicles or tissue engineering matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Site-specific analytical electron microscopy was performed on a corroded
   sand-cast AM50 alloy. Areas close to partially divorced eutectic were
   the regions with less corrosion damage. The corrosion product layer in
   these areas consisted of a columnar section of predominantly amorphous
   MgO. At the alloy interface, an aluminum-rich layer was identified.
   Electron energy-loss spectroscopy suggests this layer is metallic in
   character. The corrosion product film on the primary alpha-Mg grains
   possessed a bi-layer morphology: a thin columnar film and a thicker,
   porous sub-layer. The formation of the Al-rich layer depends on the Al
   content in solid solution at a specific location. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The concept of space mapping is applied, for the first time, to the
   design of microwave dispersive delay structures (DDSs). DDSs are
   components providing specified group delay versus frequency responses
   for real-time radio systems. The DDSs considered in this paper are
   formed by cascaded coupled C-sections. It is first shown that aggressive
   space mapping does not provide sufficient accuracy in the synthesis of
   DDSs. To address this issue, we propose a predistortion space mapping
   technique. Compared to aggressive space mapping, this technique provides
   enhanced accuracy, while compared to output space mapping, it provides
   greater implementation simplicity. Two full-wave and one experimental
   examples are provided to illustrate the proposed predistortion space
   mapping technique.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter is a multitarget tracker
   that can alleviate the computational intractability of the optimal
   multitarget Bayes filter. The PHD filter recursively estimates the
   number of targets and their PHD from a set of observations and works
   well in scenarios with false alarms and missed detections. Two distinct
   PHD filter implementations are available in the literature: the
   Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis Density (SMC-PHD) and the
   Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filters. While
   particle-based PHD implementations may suffer from degeneracy, GM-based
   methods may not be suitable for highly nonlinear non-Gaussian systems.
   This paper proposes a B-Spline based Spline Probability Hypothesis
   Density (SPHD) filter, which has the capability to better approximate
   any arbitrary probability density function. The resulting algorithm can
   handle linear, non-linear, Gaussian, and non-Gaussian models. The SPHD
   filter can provide continuous estimates of the probability density
   function of the system state and it is immune to the degeneracy problem.
   The SPHD filter can maintain highly accurate tracks by taking advantage
   of dynamic knot movement, but at the expense of higher computational
   complexity, which makes it suitable for tracking a few high-value
   targets under difficult conditions. The SPHD filter derivations and
   simulations are provided in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Hot-melt granulation (HMG) by twin screw extrusion is a novel technology
   for the continuous processing of pharmaceuticals but confidence must
   still be gained regarding whether the environment affects drug
   properties. In this preliminary study, granulation was studied for a
   model product containing lactose monohydrate and active ingredients of
   differing water solubility, namely ibuprofen versus caffeine. The
   formulations were granulated at 220rpm and 100 degrees C with
   polyethylene glycol binders of differing molecular weights and at
   concentrations between 6.5\% and 20\%. In terms of granule properties,
   the low melting point of ibuprofen had a dominant influence by producing
   larger, stronger granules, whereas the caffeine products were more
   comparable to a blank containing no active ingredient. Drug degradation
   was study by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and
   high-pressure liquid chromatography. The only detected change was the
   dehydration of lactose monohydrate for the caffeine and blank products,
   whereas the lubricating influence of the ibuprofen protected its
   granules. The short residence time (approximate to 60s) was consider to
   be influential in minimizing damage of the drug despite the high
   temperature and shear attributed to HMG inside a twin screw extruder.

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3286-3296}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We propose two procedures to extract information about the trapping
   processes that occur in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) that
   exhibit both contact and hysteresis effects. In particular, the
   variation of trapped charge during hysteresis cycles is determined by
   the separate analysis of current-voltage curves for the intrinsic
   transistor and for the contact region. The extraction of these curves is
   done with the help of our previous compact model that reproduces the
   current-voltage characteristics of OTFTs with contact effects. The model
   is used to fit experimental output characteristics with hysteresis and
   to extract the parameters of the model, such as the mobility and the
   threshold voltage. The variation of the threshold voltage with trapped
   charges during voltage cycling and using existing transistor models
   results in different sets of parameters needed to reproduce the
   experimental data. However, not all these parameters have proper
   physical meanings. In order to find a unique physical solution, the
   current-voltage curves of the contacts and current- voltage curves of
   the intrinsic transistor, extracted from the output characteristics
   measured at the transistor terminals, are separately analyzed. The study
   of the evolution with the gate voltage of the free-charge density in the
   contact allows for finding this unique solution. The results of this
   method are compared with published results that use more elaborate
   experimental techniques, such as the four-terminal method or transient
   experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present electron microscopy, electrical measurement and secondary ion
   mass spectroscopy (SIMS) characterization of silicon doped with indium
   to concentrations well above the assumed solid solubility. Samples have
   been prepared using ion implantation at an energy of 40 keV to achieve
   as-implanted indium concentrations up to 1 x 10(20) cm(-3), with
   post-implantation annealing performed at temperatures between 600 and
   1050 degrees C. We provide direct evidence for nano-scale indium
   precipitates in the silicon matrix and on the sample surface after
   annealing. Precipitates having a tetragonal crystal structure and a
   rectangular shape were observed in all of the samples implanted at the
   highest dose of 1 x 10(15) cm(-2), and some of the samples implanted
   with a lower dose. Comparing SIMS and electron microscopy data allows us
   to conclude a solid solubility of approximate to 1018 cm(-3), consistent
   with previously published work (Solmi et al 2002 J. Appl. Phys. 92
   1361-6). This paper determines the limitations of indium utility as a

Abstract = {{Cells are known to respond differently when grown on materials of
   varying stiffness. However, the mechanism by which a cell senses
   substrate stiffness is unknown. Lower crosslink density elastomers
   formed from acrylated star-poly(D,L lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)
   have previously been shown to support higher smooth muscle cell
   proliferation in in vitro culture. This difference in growth was
   hypothesized to be due to differences in protein adsorption that
   resulted from differences in polymer chain mobility at the surface.
   Therefore, layer mass and viscoelastic properties were measured for HSA,
   IgG, fibronectin, vitronectin, and serum supplemented media adsorbed to
   elastomers of two crosslink densities. Significantly more fibronectin
   adsorbed to the lower crosslink density surface while significantly more
   IgG adsorbed to the higher crosslink density surface. Furthermore,
   differences in fibronectin and IgG layer shear moduli were observed,
   suggesting that there was a difference in the conformation of the
   adsorbed protein. ATR-FTIR analysis showed that the lower crosslink
   density elastomer absorbed more surface water. The increased amount of
   water may cause greater entropic gains upon protein adsorption to the
   lower crosslink density surface, which increases total protein
   adsorption from serum and may cause differences in protein conformation
   and thus cell behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A digital back propagation (DBP) scheme with optimal step size for
   polarization division multiplexed transmission system is proposed. For a
   fixed number of steps in DBP, the optimum step size is calculated by
   minimizing the mismatch between the area under the exponentially

   simulations, the vector nonlinear Schodinger equation or Manakov
   equations are used for forward propagation and Manakov equations are

Abstract = {{Connective tissue rapidly proliferates on and around biomaterials

   tissue ingrowth, but can only be used for a limited time because they
   nonselectively arrest cell proliferation in the local environment. The
   present study examined use of a prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor,
   1,4-dihydrophenonthrolin-4-one-3-carboxylic acid (1,4-DPCA), to suppress
   connective tissue ingrowth in porous PLGA discs implanted in the
   peritoneal cavity for 28 days. The prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor was
   found to be effective at inhibiting collagen deposition within and on
   the outer surface of the disc, and also limited connective tissue
   ingrowth, but not to the extent of glucocorticoid inhibition. Finally,
   it was discovered that 1,4-DPCA suppressed Scavenger Receptor A
   expression on a macrophage-like cell culture, which may account for the
   drug's ability to limit connective tissue ingrowth in vivo. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{It was recently shown that a high-speed optoelectronic display, via a

   enhanced by jointly optimizing the backlight intensity and the image
   signal at a negligible extra computational cost. For real-time
   applications of low-cost consumer electronics, this work also provides a

Abstract = {{In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of deposition of polypyrrole
   (PPy) films by electropolymerization on stainless steel substrates and
   fabrication of PPy powders by chemical polymerization using sulfanilic
   acid azochromotrop (SPADNS) as a new anionic dopant. The problem of low
   adhesion of PPy films to stainless steel substrates is addressed by the
   use of SPADNS, which exhibits chelating properties, promoting film
   formation. The use of fine particles, prepared by the chemical
   polymerization method, allows impregnation of Ni foams and fabrication
   of porous electrodes with high materials loading for electrochemical
   supercapacitors (ES). PPy films and Ni foam based PPy electrodes show
   capacitive behaviour in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electron microscopy
   studies, impedance spectroscopy data and analysis of the SPADNS
   structure provide an insight into the factors, controlling capacitive
   behaviour. The Ni foam based electrodes offer advantages of improved
   capacitive behaviour at high materials loadings and good cycling
   stability. The area normalized and volume normalized specific
   capacitances are as high as 5.43 F cm(-2) and 93.6 F cm(-3),
   respectively, for materials loading of 35.4 mg cm (-2). The capacitance
   retention of Ni foam based electrodes is 91.5\% after 1000 cycles. The
   Ni foam based PPy electrodes are promising for application in ES. (c)

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{12, SI}},
Pages = {{3278-3289}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper,(1) we examine the problem of robust power control in a
   downlink beamforming environment under uncertain channel state
   information (CSI). We suggest that the method of power control using the
   lower bounds of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is too
   pessimistic and will require significantly higher power in transmission
   than is necessary in practice. Here, a new robust downlink power control
   solution based on worst-case performance optimization is developed. Our
   approach employs the explicit modeling of uncertainties in the downlink
   channel correlation (DCC) matrices and optimizes the amount of
   transmission power while guaranteeing the worst-case performance to
   satisfy the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all users. This
   optimization problem is non-convex and intractable. In order to arrive
   at an optimal solution to the problem, we propose an iterative algorithm
   to find the optimum power allocation and worst-case uncertainty
   matrices. The iterative algorithm is based on the efficient solving of
   the worst-case uncertainty matrices once the transmission power is
   given. This can be done by finding the solutions for two cases: (a) when
   the uncertainty on the DCC matrices is small, for which a closed-form
   optimum solution can be obtained and (b) when the uncertainty is
   substantial, for which the intractable problem is transformed into a
   convex optimization problem readily solvable by an interior point
   method. Simulation results show that the proposed robust downlink power
   control using the approach of worst-case performance optimization
   converges in a few iterations and reduces the transmission power
   effectively under imperfect knowledge of the channel condition. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We consider a broadcast channel in which the base station is equipped
   with multiple antennas and each user has a single antenna, and we study
   the design of transceivers based on Tomlinson-Harashima precoders with
   probabilistic quality of service (QoS) requirements for each user, in
   scenarios with uncertain channel state information (CSI) at the
   transmitter. Each user's QoS requirement is specified as a constraint on
   the maximum allowed outage probability of the receiver's mean square
   error (MSE) with respect to a specified target MSE, and we demonstrate
   that these outage constraints are associated with constraints on the
   outage of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR).
   We consider four different stochastic models for the channel
   uncertainty, and we design the downlink transceiver so as to minimize
   the total transmitted power subject to the satisfaction of the
   probabilistic QoS constraints. We present three conservative approaches
   to solving the resulting chance constrained optimization problems. These
   approaches are based on efficiently solvable deterministic convex design
   formulations that guarantee the satisfaction of the probabilistic QoS
   constraints. We also demonstrate how to apply these approaches in order
   to obtain computationally efficient solutions to some related design
   problems. Our simulations indicate that the proposed methods can

Abstract = {{Considering the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)
   supported by a graphene monolayer can be effectively controlled via
   electrostatic gating, we propose a graphene monolayer on a graded
   silicon-grating substrate with dielectric spacer as an interlayer for
   plasmonic rainbow trapping in the infrared domain. Since the dispersive
   relation of SPPs is dependent on the width of dielectric spacer filling
   the silicon grating, the guided SPPs at different frequencies can be
   localized at different positions along the graphene surface, associated
   with the period of silicon grating. The group velocity of slow SPPs can
   be made to be several hundred times smaller than light velocity in
   vacuum. We also predict the capability of completely releasing the
   trapped SPPs by dynamically tuning the chemical potential of graphene by
   means of gate voltage. The advantages of such a structure include
   compact size, wide frequency tunability, and compatibility with current
   micro/nanofabrication, which holds great promise for applications in
   graphene-based optoelectronic devices. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{An ideal optical backpropagation (OBP) scheme to compensate for
   dispersion and nonlinear effects of the transmission fibers is proposed.
   The scheme consists of an optical phase conjugator (OPC), N spans of
   dispersion-decreasing fibers (DDFs) and amplifiers, placed at the end of
   the fiber optic link. In order to compensate for the nonlinear effects
   of the transmission fibers exactly, the nonlinear coefficient of the
   backpropagation fiber has to increase exponentially with distance or
   equivalently the power in the backpropagation fiber should increase
   exponentially with distance if the nonlinear coefficient is constant. In
   this paper, it is shown that a combination of DDFs and amplifiers can
   compensate for the nonlinear effects exactly. An analytical expression
   for the dispersion profile of the DDF is derived. Numerical simulation
   of a long haul wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) fiber optic system
   with the proposed OBP scheme shows that the system reach can be enhanced
   by 54\% as compared to digital backpropagation (DBP). (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{The accurate description of the O 1s excitation in BaTiO3 has been
   elusive so far. In this Rapid Communication, the electronic structure
   and the high-resolution electron energy-loss near-edge structures of the
   O K edge in tetragonal BaTiO3 are investigated using first-principles
   calculations. The results demonstrate a clear correlation between the
   broadening of the lower energy fine structure and the anisotropic
   effects induced by the core-hole potential, which are directly related
   to the structural distortion occurring in tetragonal BaTiO3. Moreover,
   we show that a significant improvement of the description of
   higher-lying structures can be obtained when correcting the energy
   position of the Ba 4f states. This demonstrates that the O 1s spectrum
   can be a very effective probe of the distortion and changes in the local
   electronic structure, and be used as a sensitive tool for studying new

   alloys: Influence of the Si and Fe concentrations, and solidification
   rate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{577}},

Abstract = {{Al-Si-Fe hypoeutectic cast alloy system is very complex and reported to
   produce numerous Fe based intermetallic phases in conjunction with Al
   and Si. This publication will address the anomalies of phase evolution
   in the Al-Si-Fe hypoeutectic casting alloy system; the anomaly lies in
   the peculiarities in the evolution and nature of the intermetallic
   phases when compared to the thermodynamic phase diagram predictions and
   past publications of the same. The influence of the following
   parameters, in various combinations, on the evolution and nature of the
   intermetallic phases were analyzed and reported: concentration of Si
   between 2 and 12.6 wt\%, Fe between 0.05 and 0.5 wt\% and solidification
   rates of 0.1, 1, 5 and 50 K s(-1). Two intermetallic phases are observed
   to evolve in these alloys under these solidification conditions: the
   tau(5)-Al8SiFe2 and tau(6)-Al9Fe2Si2. The tau(5)-Al8SiFe2 phase evolves
   at all levels of the parameters during solidification and subsequently
   transforms into the tau(6)-Al9Fe2Si2 through a peritectic reaction when
   promoted by certain combinations of solidification parameters such as
   higher Fe level, lower Si level and slower solidification rates.
   Further, it is also hypothesized from experimental evidences that the
   theta-Al13Fe4 binary phase precludes the evolution of the tau(5) during
   solidification and subsequently transforms into the tau(6) phase during
   solidification. These observations are anomalous to the publications as
   prior art and simulation predictions of thermodynamic phase diagrams of
   these alloys, wherein, only one intermetallic phases in the
   tau(6)-Al9Fe2Si2 is predicted to evolve and be retained as the terminal
   phase at the end of solidification. Several analysis methods such as
   light optical microscope, scanning electron microscope equipped with a
   dual beam focused ion beam milling machine and energy dispersive X-ray
   diffraction system, transmission electron microscope equipped with high
   resolution digital imaging system, energy dispersive X-ray diffraction
   system, and high energy synchrotron beam source for nano-diffraction
   coupled with X-ray fluorescence imaging system was used in this study.

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis (PCA) based pattern matching methods have
   been applied to process monitoring and fault detection. However, the
   conventional pattern matching approaches do not specifically take into
   account the non-Gaussian dynamic features in chemical processes.
   Furthermore, those techniques are more focused on fault detection
   instead of fault diagnosis. In this study, a non-Gaussian pattern
   matching based fault detection and diagnosis method is developed and
   applied to monitor cryogenic air separation process. First, independent
   component analysis (ICA) models are built on the normal benchmark and
   monitored data sets along sliding windows. The IC subspaces from the
   benchmark and monitored data are then extracted to evaluate the
   non-Gaussian patterns and detect process faults through a mutual
   information based dissimilarity index. Further, a difference subspace
   between the two IC subspaces is computed to characterize the divergence
   of the dynamic and non-Gaussian patterns between the benchmark and
   monitored data. Subsequently, the mutual information between the IC
   difference subspace and each process variable direction is defined as a
   new non-Gaussian contribution index for fault identification and
   diagnosis. The presented approach is applied to a simulated cryogenic
   air separation plant and the monitoring results are compared against
   those of PCA based pattern matching techniques and ICA based monitoring
   method. The application study demonstrates that the developed
   non-Gaussian pattern matching approach can effectively monitor the
   complex air separation process with superior fault detection and
   diagnosis capability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic `distances' (also called divergences), which in some sense
   assess how `close' two probability distributions are from one another,
   have been widely employed in probability, statistics, information
   theory, and related fields. Of particular importance due to their
   generality and applicability are the Renyi divergence measures. This
   paper presents closed-form expressions for the Renyi and
   Kullback-Leibler divergences for nineteen commonly used univariate
   continuous distributions as well as those for multivariate Gaussian and
   Dirichlet distributions. In addition, a table summarizing four of the
   most important information measure rates for zero-mean stationary
   Gaussian processes, namely Renyi entropy, differential Shannon entropy,
   Renyi divergence, and Kullback-Leibler divergence, is presented. Lastly,
   a connection between the Renyi divergence and the variance of the
   log-likelihood ratio of two distributions is established, thereby
   extending a previous result by Song {[}J. Stat. Plan. Infer. 93 (2001)]
   on the relation between Renyi entropy and the log-likelihood function. A

Abstract = {{Posterior capsule opacification is the most common complication of
   cataract surgery. Lens epithelial cells remaining in the capsular bag
   following surgery can undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
   migrate from the anterior to the posterior capsule, leading to fibrosis,
   capsular wrinkling, and ultimately vision loss. Transforming growth
   factor-beta 2 has been shown to play a major role in
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Covalent tethering of
   anti-transforming growth factor-beta 2 to the surface of the intraocular
   lens material may inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the
   subsequent events, thus leading to a reduction in posterior capsule
   opacification. In this work, the antibody was tethered to the surface of
   polydimethylsiloxane as a model lens material via a poly(ethylene)
   glycol spacer. Surface characterization using a variety of methods
   demonstrated successful modification. The surface density of the
   anti-transforming growth factor-beta 2 was approximately 0.5 mu g/cm(2).
   The presence of transforming growth factor-beta 2 in cell culture medium
   stimulated production of extracellular matrix components such as
   collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and the fibrotic marker -smooth muscle
   actin, by HLE-B3 cells. These effects were decreased but not completely
   eradicated by the presence of the anti-transforming growth factor-beta 2
   antibody on the polydimethylsiloxane surface. These results suggest that
   surface modification with appropriate antifibrotic molecules has the
   potential to modulate cellular changes following cataract surgery and
   lead to a reduction in posterior capsule opacification.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) utilize sloshing fluid to absorb and
   dissipate structural vibrational energy. TLDs of irregular or complex
   tank geometry may be required in practice to avoid tank interference
   with fixed structural or mechanical components. The literature offers
   few analytical models to predict the response of this type of TLD,
   particularly when the fluid depth is small. In this paper, a multimodal
   model is developed utilizing a Boussinesq-type modal theory which is
   valid for small TLD fluid depths. The Bateman-Luke variational principle
   is employed to develop a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations which describe the fluid response when the tank
   is subjected to base excitation. Energy dissipation is incorporated into
   the model from the inclusion of damping screens. The fluid model is used
   to describe the response of a 2D structure-TLD system when the structure
   is subjected to external loading and the TLD tank geometry is irregular.
   Shake table experiments are conducted on a rectangular and chamfered
   tank subjected to unidirectional base excitation. Comparisons of the
   experimental and predicted sloshing forces and energy dissipation per
   cycle indicate that the model is able to predict the fluid response at
   fluid depth ratios greater than h/L=0.10. Next, structure-TLD system
   tests are conducted and it is found that the model can predict the
   structural and TLD responses. The simulated and experimental results
   show that the TLD tank transfers energy between orthogonal structural
   sway modes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   drag coefficient}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{271-286}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The amplitude-dependent damping associated with a tuned liquid damper
   (TLD) equipped with slat-type screens produces a device that performs
   optimally at a targeted response amplitude. Increasing the slat height
   produces a screen whose drag coefficient is dependent on the
   Keulegan-Carpenter number (RC), which may improve the TLD performance.
   This new type of TLD is modeled as an equivalent mechanical model with
   damping that is dependent on both KC and the response amplitude. An
   experimental shake table testing program is undertaken to study the
   influence of KC on the TLD response and to validate the model. A power
   fit is performed on the experimentally determined screen drag
   coefficient and MC values to express the drag coefficient as a function
   of KC and the steady flow drag coefficient. Predicted frequency response
   plots of sloshing forces and energy dissipation per cycle are in
   agreement with experimental results. A structure-TLD system model is
   developed to theoretically study the performance of this new TLD.
   Nonlinear shallow water wave theory is used to validate the output of
   the mechanical model. Results indicate that a KC-dependent screen drag
   coefficient produces a more robust TLD whose performance is maintained
   over a broader range of structural response amplitudes. (C) 2013

Title = {{Modeling of the phase lag causing fluidelastic instability in a parallel
   triangular tube array}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{371-384}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fluidelastic instability is considered a critical flow induced vibration
   mechanism in tube and shell heat exchangers. It is believed that a
   finite time lag between tube vibration and fluid response is essential
   to predict the phenomenon. However, the physical nature of this time lag
   is not fully understood. This paper presents a fundamental study of this
   time delay using a parallel triangular tube array with a pitch ratio of
   1.54. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and
   validated experimentally in an attempt to investigate the interaction
   between tube vibrations and flow perturbations at lower reduced
   velocities U-r = 1-6 and Reynolds numbers Re=2000-12 000. The numerical
   predictions of the phase lag are in reasonable agreement with the
   experimental measurements for the range of reduced velocities
   U-g/fd=6-7. It was found that there are two propagation mechanisms; the
   first is associated with the acoustic wave propagation at low reduced
   velocities, U-r < 2, and the second mechanism for higher reduced
   velocities is associated with the vorticity shedding and convection. An
   empirical model of the two mechanisms is developed and the phase lag
   predictions are in reasonable agreement with the experimental and
   numerical measurements. The developed phase lag model is then coupled
   with the semi-analytical model of Lever and Weaver to predict the
   fluidelastic stability threshold. Improved predictions of the stability
   boundaries for the parallel triangular array were achieved. In addition,
   the present study has explained why fluidelastic instability does not
   occur below some threshold reduced velocity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper deals with application of a non-linear continuum model for
   reinforced concrete affected by alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) to

   as well as that involving localized deformation, associated with
   formation of macrocracks. The formulation is applied to examine the
   mechanical behaviour of some reinforced concrete structures in nuclear
   power facilities located in Quebec (Canada). First, a containment
   structure is analyzed subjected to 45 years of continuing AAR. Later, an
   inelastic analysis is carried out for the spent fuel pool taking into
   account the interaction with the adjacent jointed rock mass foundation.
   In the latter case, the structure is said to be subjected to continuing

Abstract = {{The effect of low-energy ion irradiation on the nanolaminated Ti3AlC2 is

   regression approach for long-term wind speed prediction}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing wind power generation and controlling the operation of wind
   turbines to efficiently harness the renewable wind energy is a
   challenging task due to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of
   wind speed, which has significant influence on wind power production. A
   new approach for long-term wind speed forecasting is developed in this
   study by integrating GMCM (Gaussian mixture copula model) and localized
   GPR (Gaussian process regression). The time series of wind speed is
   first classified into multiple non-Gaussian components through the
   Gaussian mixture copula model and then Bayesian inference strategy is
   employed to incorporate the various non-Gaussian components using the
   posterior probabilities. Further, the localized Gaussian process
   regression models corresponding to different non-Gaussian components are
   built to characterize the stochastic uncertainty and non-stationary
   seasonality of the wind speed data. The various localized CPR models are
   integrated through the posterior probabilities as the weightings so that
   a global predictive model is developed for the prediction of wind speed.
   The proposed GMCM GPR approach is demonstrated using wind speed data
   from various wind farm locations and compared against the GMCM-based
   ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) and SVR (support
   vector regression) methods. In contrast to GMCM-ARIMA and GMCM-SVR
   methods, the proposed GMCM-GPR model is able to well characterize the
   multi-seasonality and uncertainty of wind speed series for accurate
   long-term prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding changes in microbial structure due to biodiesel storage is
   important both for protecting integrity of storage systems and fuel
   quality management. In this work a simulated storage system was used to
   study the effect of biodiesel (0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%) on a
   microbial population, which was followed by community level
   physiological profiling (CLPP), 16s rDNA analysis and plating in
   selective media. Results proved that structure and functionality were
   affected by biodiesel. CLPP showed at least three populations: one
   corresponding to diesel, one to biodiesel and one to blends of diesel
   and biodiesel. Analysis of 16s rDNA revealed that microbial composition
   was different for populations growing in diesel and biodiesel. Genera
   identified are known for degradation of hydrocarbons and emulsifier
   production. Maximum growth was obtained in biodiesel; however, microbial
   counts in standard media were lower for this samples. Acidification of
   culture media was observed at high biodiesel concentration. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the effect of Ar concentration and shadow
   mask material on the etch rate, surface roughness, and micromask pit
   density and depth for reactive ion etching (RIE) of x-cut alpha quartz.
   The ratio of SF6 to Ar is varied at constant power and pressure to find
   an optimum Ar concentration for thinning x-cut quartz while maintaining
   good surface quality. The recipe is used with an STS320 RIE system to
   produce smooth, through-hole-free, insulating quartz membranes of 7 mu m
   thickness in selective locations on 100 mu m thick x-cut quartz wafers.
   We demonstrate that surface quality is much improved by replacing at
   least 75\% of the SF6 by volume with Ar, and that for non-inductively
   coupled plasma RIE the standard mask material nickel is detrimental to
   surface quality for long etch times.}},

   water emulsions exhibiting multiple crystal morphologies have been
   studied experimentally by DSC and polarized light microscopy. The
   induction time of nucleation increases with the increase of the
   isothermal temperature under which crystallization occurred. Crystal
   growth has been observed by microscopy showing that both crystal
   morphologies, fibers and rosettes, grow linearly at the initial stage of
   crystallization and then slow down to reach a plateau value. The Avrami
   model, which has been widely used in kinetics studies of triacylglycerol
   systems, was employed to fit experimental results at different
   isothermal temperatures. It was found that experimental trends could be
   captured by introducing the volume fraction of each type of morphology

Abstract = {{A systematic strategy for optimal plant operation during partial
   shutdowns is proposed. We consider the situation where one or more
   process units are shut down due to failure or maintenance but where the
   remaining units are able to continue operation to some degree. The goal
   of the strategy is to manipulate the plant degrees-of-freedomduring and
   after the shutdownsuch that production is restored in a cost-optimal
   fashion while meeting safety and operational constraints. Optimal
   control trajectories are obtained through the solution of a dynamic
   optimization problem. A novel multitiered optimization approach allows
   the prioritization of multiple competing objectives and the
   specification of trade-offs between them. Uncertainty in the downtime
   estimate, a crucial parameter in shutdown optimization, is addressed
   through reoptimization. We employ a transient predictive control
   algorithm for implementing the computed control policy under feedback.

   directly on Si are presented. At 100 K, a single-photon detection
   efficiency of 4\% at 1310 nm wavelength was measured with a dark count
   rate of similar to 6 megacounts/s, resulting in the lowest reported
   noise-equivalent power for a Ge-on-Si single-photon avalanche diode
   detector (1 x 10(-14) WHz(-1/2)). The first report of 1550 nm wavelength
   detection efficiency measurements with such a device is presented. A
   jitter of 300 ps was measured, and preliminary tests on after-pulsing
   showed only a small increase (a factor of 2) in the normalized dark
   count rate when the gating frequency was increased from 1 kHz to 1 MHz.
   These initial results suggest that optimized devices integrated on Si

Abstract = {{With the improvements in Diesel engine injection systems, the
   fueling-path, which is more accurate, flexible, and faster than the
   air-path, can be actively utilized in conventional and advanced
   combustion mode controls, especially for enhancing the combustion
   transient performance. In this paper, fuel injection split models are
   proposed to describe the relationship between fuel split ratio and two
   combustion outputs, i.e., the crank angle at 50\% heat released (CA(50))
   and the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). The model parameters
   are related to the engine in-cylinder thermal boundary conditions,
   referred to as the in-cylinder conditions (ICCs). The models were
   verified by engine experimental data with identical and different ICCs
   under different engine operating conditions. Such models can be
   potentially utilized in active fueling control for Diesel engine
   combustion control, and therefore benefit engine fuel efficiency and
   reduce engine-out emissions.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical granular drag force on objects held stationary in a moving
   bed of nickel pellets with diameters in the range 1-10 mm has been
   measured and compared with Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations.
   Experiments were carried out with horizontal wooden rods, and horizontal
   and vertical thin plates made of mild steel or Teflon. The experimental
   data are correlated by semi-empirical equations based on the ``supported
   mass{''} of pellets in the region above the object, and dynamic friction
   coefficients acting on vertical surfaces from least-squares regression.
   Dynamic coefficients of friction for nickel on steel and nickel on
   Teflon are reported. The correlation is compared with an expression
   based on Janssen's equation using the experimentally determined
   coefficients of friction. These results are compared with DEM
   simulations, which examine the effects of particle size distribution,
   mass flow rate, plate friction coefficient mu and the simulation
   parameter K-1, which is analogous to a spring constant. The correlation
   follows the trends of the data and the DEM results agree well with the
   experimental data over a wide range of conditions. The DEM simulations
   were carried out on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) that enabled a
   speed-up factor of similar to 40, and some aspects of the implementation
   on GPUs are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Automated segmentation of touching or overlapping chromosomes in a
   metaphase image is a critical step for computer-aided chromosomes
   analysis. Conventional chromosome imaging methods acquire single-band
   grayscale images, and such a limitation makes the separation of touching
   or overlapping chromosomes challenging. In the multiplex fluorescence in
   situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique, each class of chromosomes can
   bind with a different combination of fluorophores. The M-FISH technique
   results in multispectral chromosome images, which has distinct spectral
   signatures. This paper presents a novel automated chromosome analysis
   method to combine the pixel-level geometric and multispectral
   information with decision-level pairing information. Our chromosome
   segmentation method uses the geometric and spectral information to
   partition the chromosome cluster into three regions. There will be
   ambiguity when combining these regions into separated chromosomes by
   using only spectral and geometric information. Then a graph-theoretical
   pairing method is introduced to resolve any remaining ambiguity of the
   aforementioned segmentation process. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed joint segmentation and pairing method outperforms
   conventional grayscale and multispectral segmentation methods in
   separating touching and overlapping chromosomes.}},

Abstract = {{The floor joists of cold-formed steel (CFS) structures often require
   large web openings. Reinforcement of such openings may mitigate the
   detrimental effects arising from such web openings. This paper is based
   on an experimental investigation conducted to establish reinforcement
   schemes for CFS joists with a large web opening located in high shear
   zones. The investigation considered a large web opening cut out in the
   middle of the web of a lipped channel section. Circular and square large
   web openings of about 65\% web depth were considered. The shear tests
   involved short span specimens, simply supported at the ends, and
   subjected to a mid-span point load. This paper presents the experimental
   set-up, and the test results associated with 27 individual tests
   consisting of nine sets of three identical tests. These test sets
   consist of cold-formed steel joists sections with (a) no web opening,
   (b) webs having circular or square openings, (c) webs having reinforced
   openings. Three different reinforcement schemes were investigated,
   however, the test results indicated that the proposed ``Vierendeel truss
   type reinforcement scheme{''} can restore the original shear strength of
   such sections having circular or square openings. Overall, this study
   establishes a cost-effective reinforcement scheme for cold-formed steel
   joists having a large web opening in high shear zone. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Sulfadiazine modified PDMS as a model material with the potential for
   the mitigation of posterior capsule opacification (PCO)}},
Journal = {{COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Cataract surgery, while the most common surgical procedure performed,
   leads to posterior capsule opacification in approximately 30\% of cases.
   Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta(2)) and matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown to play important roles in the
   cellular processes leading to posterior capsule opacification. Delivery
   of inhibitors to MMPs may have the potential to inhibit the initial
   cascade of events that lead to PCO. However, delivery of these molecules
   via tethering has proven difficult. In this work, sulfadiazine was
   tethered to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via a polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   spacer as a potential MMPI mimic. Surface characterization using a
   variety of methods demonstrated successful modification with the
   antibiotic. The surfaces were examined with lens epithelial cells to
   determine their effect on these cellular processes, including cell
   transdifferentiation and production of extracellular matrix components.
   The presence of TGF-beta(2) in the cell culture media was found to
   stimulate the production of ECM components such as collagen,
   fibronectin, and laminin, as well as alpha smooth muscle actin
   (alpha-SMA), and the migration marker Rho by HLE-B3 and FHL124 cells. In
   all cases, these effects were decreased but not completely eradicated by
   the presence of sulfadiazine on the PDMS surface. While the level of
   inhibition necessary for inhibition of PCO in vivo is unknown, these
   results suggest that IOL surface modification with sulfadiazine has the
   potential to reduce cellular changes associated with PCO. Furthermore,
   the results demonstrate for the first time that changes consistent with
   inhibition of fibrosis may be elicited by surfaces modified with
   sulfadiazine. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Determining an object location in a specific region is an important task
   in many machine vision applications. Different parameters affect the
   accuracy of the localization process. The quantization process in
   charge-coupled device of a camera is one of the sources of error that
   causes estimation rather than identifying the exact position of the
   observed object. A cluster of points, in the field of view of a camera
   are mapped into a pixel. These points form an uncertainty region. In
   this paper, we present a geometrical model to analyze the volume of this
   uncertainty region as a criterion for object localization error. The
   proposed approach models the field of view of each pixel as an oblique
   cone. The uncertainty region is formed via the intersection of two
   cones, each emanating from one of the two cameras. Because of the
   complexity in modeling of two oblique cones' intersection, we propose
   three methods to simplify the problem. In the first two methods, only
   four lines are used. Each line goes through the camera's lens, modeled
   as a pinhole, and then passes one of the four vertices of a square that
   is fitted around the circular pixel. The first proposed method projects
   all points of these four lines into an image plane. In the second
   method, the line-cone intersection is used instead of intersection of
   two cones. Therefore, by applying line-cone intersection, the boundary
   points of the intersection of the two cones are determined. In the third
   approach, the extremum points of the intersection of two cones are
   determined by the Lagrangain method. The validity of our methods is
   verified through extensive simulations. In addition, we analyze effects
   of parameters, such as the baseline length, focal length, and pixel
   size, on the amount of the estimation error.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the in-plane free vibration of a rectangular plate with

   To this end, the two-scale asymptotic expansion method is employed to

   repetitive unit composed of two different materials at a fixed volume
   ratio, we compare the natural frequencies of the homogenized model with
   those of the original plate calculated by the finite element method, and
   good agreement is obtained. We also demonstrate that the plate can be
   designed to have particular frequencies through a proper selection of
   the material distribution law in each unit. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper extends the material point method to analyze coupled dynamic,
   two-phase boundary-valued problems via a velocity formulation, in which
   solid and fluid phase velocities are the variables. Key components of
   the proposed approach are the adoption of Verruijt's sequence of update
   steps when integrating over time and the enhancement of volumetric
   strains. The connection between fractional step method and the
   time-stepping algorithm presented in this paper is addressed.
   Enhancement of volumetric strains allows lower order variations in
   pressure and mitigates spurious pressure fields and locking that plague
   low-order finite-element implementations. A stress averaging technique
   to smoothen stress variations is proposed, and the local damping
   procedure adopted by FLAC is extended to handle two-phase problems.
   Special Kelvin-Voigt boundaries are developed to suppress reflections at
   artificial boundaries. Idealized examples are presented to demonstrate
   the capability of the proposed framework to accurately capture the
   physics of wave propagation, consolidation and wave attack on a sea

Abstract = {{The treatment of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels with
   aqueous bleach (NaClO) at pH 10.5 resulted in the partial conversion of
   the amide hydrogen to the corresponding chloramide. N-Chlorinated
   microgels poly(NIPAM-co-NIPAMCl) are more hydrophobic than the parent
   PNIPAM microgels. Thus, the volume phase transition temperature
   decreases with increasing chlorination. During chlorination, the
   microgels coagulate once they undergo a volume phase transition. The
   chlorination reaction stops once the microgels dehydrate and coagulate,
   presumably as a result of the decreased diffusion rate of the ClO- anion
   into the microgels. The microgels are reversibly dechlorinated by
   glutathione (GSH), first giving PNIPAM shell + poly(NIPAM-co-NIPAMCl)
   core microgels. Because GSH is an important redox actor in biological
   cells, this work suggests that chlorinated microgels may be employed to
   deliver active chlorine to targeted cells.}},

Abstract = {{The control of the doping in nanowires (NWs) is of fundamental

   growth, and in the resulting core-shell structures and axial junctions.
   The method also revelaed the strong dependence of the resulting doping
   on the morphology of the single NW (orientation, shell thickness). This
   approach can be easily applied to other nanoscale objects, allowing the
   direct observation of how doping (or junctions, or adsorbates,.) may
   locally affect the position of the Fermi level at the surface, which is
   a crucial factor in several application fields, such as photovoltaic and
   photocatalysis. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of electrodeposition of
   adherent polypyrrole (PPy) films on Ni substrates using Tiron as an
   anionic dopant. Compared to other aromatic sulfonate dopants, Tiron
   offers the advantages of higher charge to mass ratio and chelating
   properties, which are beneficial for the efficient charge transfer
   during electropolymerization and fabrication of adherent films. The use
   of Ni plaque current collectors allows higher capacitance and higher PPy
   loading compared to Ni foil current collectors. Moreover, the use of Ni
   plaques allows significant improvement in capacitance retention at high
   scan rates. The problem of poor cycling stability of PPy films on Ni
   foil current collectors is successfully addressed by the use of Ni
   plaques. The electron microscopy studies and impedance spectroscopy
   measurements during cycling provide an insight into the factors,
   controlling capacitance retention. The results indicate that for pure
   PPy electrodes the mass normalized specific capacitance of 339-451 F
   g(-1), and area normalized specific capacitance of 0.4-0.95 F cm(-2) can
   be achieved for material loadings of 0.84-2.80 mg cm(-2). The PPy
   electrodes formed on Ni plaque current collectors are promising for
   applications in electrochemical supercapacitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Factors that Influence In Vitro Cholesterol Deposition on Contact Lenses}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact that
   incubation time, lipid concentration, and solution replenishment have on
   silicone hydrogel (SiHy) and conventional hydrogel (CH) contact lens
   cholesterol deposition via in vitro radiochemical experiments.
   Methods. Four SiHy (senofilcon A, lotrafilcon B, comfilcon A, balafilcon
   A) and two CH(etafilcon A and omafilcon A) contact lenses were incubated
   in an artificial tear solution (ATS) that contained major tear film
   proteins, lipids, salts, salts, and a trace amount of radioactive
   C-14-cholesterol. Lenses were incubated for various incubation times (1,
   3, 7, 14, or 28 days), with three concentrations of lipid (0.5x, 1x, 2x
   tear film concentration) and with or without solution replenishment to
   assess each variable's impact on cholesterol deposition. After
   incubation, the lenses were extracted using 2:1 chloroform: methanol,
   extracts were analyzed in a beta counter and masses (micrograms per
   lens) were extrapolated from standard curves.
   Results. Within the SiHy materials, balafilcon A deposited the greatest
   amount of cholesterol (p < 0.001) and lotrafilcon B the lowest (p <
   0.001). The CH lens materials showed significantly lower uptake amounts
   than any of the SiHy lens materials (p < 0.001). The uptake of
   cholesterol ranged from 0.01 +/- 0.01 mu g/lens to 3.22 +/- 0.34 mu
   g/lens for all lens materials. Kinetic uptake of cholesterol was shown
   to be continuous throughout the 28 days of incubation without plateau (p
   < 0.001), and varying the lipid concentration did impact the resulting
   cholesterol deposition (p < 0.001). Replenishing the ATS every other day
   also affected cholesterol deposition throughout the experiment. Overall,
   the deposition pattern was 2x > replenishing > 1x > 0.5x.
   Conclusions. Overall, SiHy lenses deposit significantly more cholesterol
   than CH lens materials, and the mass of lipid deposited is dependent on
   the contact lens material, length of incubation, concentration of lipids
   in the ATS, and the replenishment of ATS.}},

Abstract = {{A series of human factors experiments involving maneuvering and grasping
   tasks are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel
   asymmetric semiautonomous teleoperation (AST) control design framework
   for teleoperation of mobile twin-arm robotic manipulators. Simplified
   configurations are examined first to explore control strategies for
   different aspects of such teleoperation tasks. These include
   teleoperation of a nonholonomic mobile base, telemanipulation of a
   dual-arm robot, and dual-arm/dual-operator teleoperation task scenarios.
   In two sets of experiments with a planar nonholonomic mobile base,
   teleoperation via a 3DOF planar haptic interface with position mapping
   and force reflection of the nonholonomic constraint decreases
   task-completion-time (TCT) and reduces unwanted collisions. In dual-arm
   and dual-operator teleoperation maneuverability experiments, the
   assignment of decoupled and nonconflicting control frames reduces TCT
   and unwanted contacts. The use of so-called ``soft{''} constraints via
   passive semiautonomous control reduces TCT and unwanted block drops in
   telegrasping experiments with a twin-arm manipulator. A final
   comprehensive experiment encompassing elements of the simplified
   configurations demonstrates the effectiveness of AST control framework

Abstract = {{Ordered arrays of vertically aligned self-catalyzed GaAs nanowires have
   been grown by gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GS-MBE) on silicon
   substrates using nano-patterned oxide templates. Several growth
   processes of different duration were performed under identical
   conditions and with identical sample preparation. To determine the
   influence of pattern parameters, the samples were prepared with 20
   patterned areas, each with progressively increasing hole diameters and
   pitch. Measurements of the average lengths and diameters of the
   vertically oriented nanowire areas were then used to calculate the
   overall axial and radial growth rates. These experiments confirm that
   significant accompanying radial growth occurs. Furthermore, the rate of
   radial growth increases with increasing pattern pitch. We propose that
   gallium-rich conditions may increase the size of the liquid droplet,
   resulting in an inverse tapered morphology which promotes step-flow
   radial growth via secondary adsorption on the nanowire sidewalls. The
   pitch dependence of the radial growth rate may therefore be due to
   shadowing or competition for the flux of material desorbing from the
   oxide surface between the nanowires. ((c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

Abstract = {{Optical biopsy techniques offer a minimally invasive, real-time
   alternative to traditional biopsy and pathology during tumor resection
   surgery. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is a commonly used
   technique in optical biopsy. Optical property recovery from spatially
   resolved DRS data allows quantification of the scattering and absorption
   properties of tissue. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to
   evaluate a unique fiber-optic probe design for a DRS instrument to be
   used specifically for optical biopsy of the brain. The probe diameter
   was kept to a minimum to allow usage in small surgical cavities at least
   1 cm in diameter. Simulations showed that the close proximity of fibers
   to the edge of the probe resulted in boundary effects due to reflection
   of photons from the surrounding air-tissue interface. A new algorithm
   for rapid optical property recovery was developed that accounts for this
   reflection and therefore overcomes these effects. The parameters of the
   algorithm were adjusted for use over the wide range of optical
   properties encountered in brain tissue, and its precision was evaluated
   by subjecting it to random noise. This algorithm can be adapted to work
   with any probe geometry to allow optical property recovery in small
   surgical cavities. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{In this paper, several novel polygeneration systems are presented which
   convert natural gas, coal, and a carbonless heat source such as
   high-temperature helium to gasoline and diesel. The carbonless heat
   source drives a natural gas reforming reaction to produce hydrogen rich
   syngas, which is mixed with coal-derived syngas to produce a syngas
   blend ideal for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Simulations and
   techno-economic analyses performed for 16 different process
   configurations under a variety of market conditions indicate significant
   economic and environmental benefits. Using a combination of coal, gas,
   and carbonless heat, it is possible to reduce CO2 emissions (both direct
   and indirect) by 79\% compared to a traditional coal-to-liquids process,
   and even achieve nearly zero CO2 emissions when carbon capture and
   sequestration technology is employed. Using a carbonless heat source,
   the direct fossil fuel consumption can be reduced up to 22\% and achieve
   a carbon efficiency up to 72\%. Market considerations for this analysis
   include prices of coal, gas, high-temperature helium, gasoline, and CO2
   emission tax rates. The results indicate that coal-only systems are
   never the most economical choice, unless natural gas is more than 5
   \$/MMBtu. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for multitarget detection and tracking with Doppler
   ambiguity is presented. Ambiguous Doppler measurements, in addition to
   the position measurements, are directly used in data association and
   tracking. Based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), the multiple

   association (PDA) algorithm, three different methods for solving the
   ambiguity, independent of the choice of particular pulse repetition
   frequency (PRF) values, in the tracking level are proposed. First, the
   UKF is modified to handle explicitly the ambiguous Doppler measurement.
   It is shown that the modified UKF can achieve better tracking
   performance than the standard UKF. On the other hand, the MHT and PDA
   algorithms, both of which are usually used to solve the
   measurement-to-track association problem, are modified here to handle
   the Doppler ambiguity problem. Simulations are performed to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the new algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The cardinality balanced multitarget multi-Bernoulli (CBMeMBer) filter
   is a recursive, multitarget tracking mechanism based on the random
   finite set (RFS) theory using the finite set statistics (FISST)
   framework. It provides an estimate of the number of targets in a given
   scenario space, along with the most likely locations of those targets.
   It also provides this estimate without the expensive operation of
   multidimensional assignment between measurements and target estimates.
   Unlike other RFS methods, the CBMeMBer filter outputs an estimate of the
   actual multitarget probability density function. Current implementations
   include a nonlinear sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approximation, as well
   as an analytical Gaussian mixture (GM) solution. A new MeMBer recursion
   for tracking multiple targets traveling under multiple motion models is
   introduced. The multiple model CBMeMBer (MM-CBMeMBer) filter presented
   here uses jump Markov models (JMM) to extend the standard CBMeMBer
   recursion to allow for multiple target motion models. This extension is
   implemented using both the SMC- and GM-based CBMeMBer approximations.
   The recursive prediction and update equations are presented for both
   implementations. Each multiple model implementation is validated against
   its respective standard CBMeMBer implementation, as well as against each
   other. This validation is done using a simulated scenario containing
   multiple manoeuvering targets. A variety of metrics, including estimate
   accuracy, model detection capability, and algorithm computational
   efficiency are used for performance evaluation. The new method is shown
   to improve results in several metrics with only a minor increase in
   computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Current gasoline blend scheduling practice is to optimize blend plans
   via fixed duration (e.g., days) multiperiod NLP or MINLP models and
   schedule blends via interactive simulation. Solutions of multiperiod
   models typically have different blend recipes for each time period. We
   introduce inventory pinch points and use them to construct an algorithm
   based on single-period nonlinear model to minimize the number of
   different blend recipes. The algorithm optimizes multigrade blend
   recipes for each period delimited by the inventory pinch points and then
   uses a fine-grid multiperiod fixed-recipe MILP to compute blend volumes
   profile. If MILP is infeasible, a corresponding period between the pinch
   points is subdivided and recipes are reoptimized. In our case studies,
   solutions are computed in significant less time and are most often
   within 0.01\% of the solutions by multiperiod MINLP. Reduced number of
   blend recipes makes it easier for the blend scheduler to create a
   schedule by interactive simulation. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Title = {{Evaluating forecasting performance for data assimilation methods: The
   ensemble Kalman filter, the particle filter, and the evolutionary-based
   assimilation}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Data assimilation (DA) has facilitated the design and application of
   hydrological forecasting systems. DA methods such as the ensemble Kalman
   filter (EnKF) and the particle filter (PF) remain popular in the
   hydrological literature. But a comparative evaluation of these methods
   to alternative techniques like the evolutionary based data assimilation
   (EDA) has not been thoroughly conducted. Evolutionary algorithms have
   been widely applied in parameter estimation and it appears natural that
   its application in DA be compared to standard methods, particularly, to
   evaluate forecasting performance of these methods. This type of
   evaluation is important for the design of forecasting systems and has
   implications for real-time forecasting operations.
   This study has applied the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA)
   model in the Spencer Creek catchment in southern Ontario, Canada to
   evaluate the performance of three DA methods. The methods assimilate
   streamflow into SAC-SMA, where the updated ensemble members are in turn
   applied to forecast streamflow for up to 30-day lead time after which
   they were compared to observation and open-loop estimates. The results
   showed that the increasing order of performance at assimilation stage
   and forecasting for short lead times of 10-day is the EnKF, the PF and
   the EDA. For longer lead times, the PF performs best and is preferable
   when forecasting for lead times beyond 10-day. The EnKF and the PF
   evolve members once between assimilation time steps whereas the EDA
   evolves members multiple times to improve parameter convergence. The
   high performance of the EDA illustrates that the dynamics of large
   ensemble members can be encapsulated into a small continuously evolved
   population and that these members have high assimilation and forecasting
   capability. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Early-stage clustering in quenched/aged supersaturated Al-Cu alloys is
   simulated and characterized at the atomic scale to study the structural
   and compositional evolution of clusters. A three-dimensional analysis of
   the nucleation and growth mechanisms of early clusters in binary alloys
   is built upon a phase-field crystal (PFC) methodology previously
   developed in two dimensions by Fallah et al. {[}Phys. Rev. B. 86, 134112
   (2012)]. The dislocation-mediated nucleation of clusters, reproduced in
   three dimensions, is compared against new results of atomistic
   characterization using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (HRSTEM). Consistent with the simulation results, analysis of HRTEM
   micrographs reveals the association of quenched-in dislocations with the
   early clusters. Moreover, the PFC model and HRSTEM observations show
   remarkable agreement on the non-equilibrium evolution of composition
   within the early clusters as well as their preferred growth orientation
   and spherical-to-ellipsoidal morphological transition. (C) 2013 Acta

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{280-288}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer in 90 degrees angle bends was measured using a
   dissolvable wall technique using test sections cast from gypsum. The
   method allows the surface morphology to evolve producing a roughened
   surface to mimic practical mass transfer situations. The experiments
   were performed for standard 90 degrees pipe bends, with a diameter of
   2.54 cm and radius of curvature r/D = 1.5 at a Schmidt number of 1280
   and Reynolds number in the range Re = 40,000-130,000. A mass transfer
   enhancement relative to the upstream pipe was observed on the bend inner
   wall near the inlet, on the side walls throughout much of the bend and
   on the bend outer wall near the outlet. A maximum mass transfer
   enhancement of approximately 1.85 times was observed on the bend outer
   wall near the bend outlet, which was independent of Reynolds number. The
   Sherwood number at the high mass transfer locations is found to scale as
   Re-0.92. The surface roughness in the upstream pipe and in the bend is
   found to decrease slightly with Reynolds number. The roughness scale
   e(+) is estimated to be approximately 30-70 for the different Reynolds
   numbers. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) theory dictates that a sparse signal can be
   reconstructed from a few random measurements. An important issue of
   compressive image recovery (CIR) is that the optimal sparse space is
   usually unknown and/or it often varies spatially for non-stationary
   signals (e.g., natural images). In this paper, apart from fixed sparse
   spaces, prior models, specifically a set of piecewise autoregressive
   (AR) models that encode the common statistics of image micro-structures,
   are learned from example image patches, and they are then used to
   construct adaptive sparsity regularizers for CIR. Furthermore, a
   complementary non-local structural sparsity regularizer is also
   incorporated into the CIR process to improve the robustness. The
   regularization by local AR model and non-local redundancy makes the
   proposed CIR very effective. Experimental results on benchmark images
   validate that the proposed algorithm can outperform significantly
   previous CIR methods in terms of both PSNR and visual quality. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Fabrication, current-voltage characterization and analytical modeling of
   an AlInP-passivated GaAs nanowire (NW) ensemble device are presented.
   During fabrication, sonication was used as a novel and crucial step to
   ensure effective contacting of the NWs. Current-voltage characteristics
   of the passivated NW devices were fitted using an analytical surface
   depletion and transport model which improves upon established models by
   implementing a non-uniform density of GaAs surface states and including
   a NW diameter distribution. Scanning electron microscopy,
   capacitance-voltage characterization and secondary ion mass spectrometry
   were used to fix key parameters in the model. A 55\% decrease in surface
   state density was achieved upon passivation, corresponding to an
   impressive four order of magnitude increase in the effective carrier
   concentration of the NWs. Moreover, the thickest NWs in the ensemble
   were found to dictate the device characteristics, which is a behavior
   that should be common to all ensemble NW devices with a distribution in
   radius. As final confirmation of effective passivation, time-resolved
   photoluminescence measurements showed a 25x improvement in carrier
   lifetime upon passivation. The fabrication and passivation methods can
   be easily implemented into future optoelectronic applications.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Periodic arrays of self-catalyzed GaAs nanowires (NWs) were grown on Si
   substrates by gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GS-MBE) using patterned
   oxide templates. The various challenges of the patterning process that
   result in undesired outcomes are described, such as pattern transfer by
   wet/dry etching, oxide thickness variations, and native oxide re-growth.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results are used to illustrate
   each case. In particular, we show that a linearly increasing
   length-radius distribution, analogous to that observed for unpatterned
   self-catalyzed growth on substrates with thin oxides, may be obtained
   even when using patterned oxide masks due to an unintended residual
   layer of oxide, as confirmed by TEM analysis. We explain how a linear
   length-radius dependence can result from the individual NWs beginning
   their growth at different times, accompanied by significant radial
   growth. The spread in obtained NW dimensions was decreased by improving
   the patterning method.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The problem of identifying, in advance, the most effective
   treatment agent for various psychiatric conditions remains an elusive
   goal. To address this challenge, we investigate the performance of the
   proposed machine learning (ML) methodology (based on the pre-treatment
   electroencephalogram (EEG)) for prediction of response to treatment with
   a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication in subjects
   suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods: A relatively small number of most discriminating features are
   selected from a large group of candidate features extracted from the
   subject's pre-treatment EEG, using a machine learning procedure for
   feature selection. The selected features are fed into a classifier,
   which was realized as a mixture of factor analysis (MFA) model, whose
   output is the predicted response in the form of a likelihood value. This
   likelihood indicates the extent to which the subject belongs to the
   responder vs. non-responder classes. The overall method was evaluated
   using a ``leave-n-out'' randomized permutation cross-validation
   procedure.
   Results: A list of discriminating EEG biomarkers (features) was found.
   The specificity of the proposed method is 80.9\% while sensitivity is
   94.9\%, for an overall prediction accuracy of 87.9\%. There is a 98.76\%
   confidence that the estimated prediction rate is within the interval
   {[}75\%, 100\%].
   Conclusions: These results indicate that the proposed ML method holds
   considerable promise in predicting the efficacy of SSRI antidepressant
   therapy for MDD, based on a simple and cost-effective pre-treatment EEG.
   Significance: The proposed approach offers the potential to improve the
   treatment of major depression and to reduce health care costs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Thin films of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), graphene and
   polypyrrole (PPy) nanofibers were prepared by cathodic electrophoretic
   deposition (EPD) from aqueous suspensions, containing safranin (SAF) as
   a new dispersant. The results of Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy studies and sedimentation tests,
   coupled with deposition yield and electron microscopy data showed that
   SAF adsorbed on MWCNT, graphene and PPy, provided their dispersion and
   charging in the suspensions and allowed efficient EPD. The deposition
   yield can be controlled by the variation of SAF concentration in the
   suspensions and deposition time. The use of SAF as a co-dispersant for
   MWCNT, graphene and PPy, allowed controlled EPD of composite
   graphene-MWCNT and graphene-PPy films. The proposed approach for the
   deposition of PPy paves the way for EPD of neutral polymers using
   organic dyes as dispersing and charging agents. The composite films were
   investigated for application in electrochemical supercapacitors (ES).
   The graphene-MWCNT and graphene-PPy films showed significant increase in
   capacitance, decrease in resistance and increase in capacitance
   retention at high charge-discharge rates compared to the films of
   individual components. The analysis of electrochemical testing results
   and electron microscopy data provided an insight into the influence of
   composite microstructure on electrochemical performance. The composites,
   prepared by EPD are promising materials for electrodes of ES. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{An experimental procedure for tracking corrosion on lightweight alloys
   has been developed using a combination of microscopy and corrosion
   studies using commercial sand cast magnesium AM50 alloys. Corrosion
   penetration depths were measured and characterized with CLSM and
   SEM/XEDS, respectively. Corrosion depths on alpha-grains in the alloys
   were expressed as a function of their Al content. Al-rich beta-phases
   and eutectic alpha-phase microstructures were observed to be most
   corrosion resistant due to an enrichment of Al, identified with TEM,
   near the oxide/alloy interface. Sand cast alloys were found to be
   susceptible to major corrosion events in regions with depleted Al
   content. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A crystal plasticity model for hexagonal close packed (HCP) crystals
   including twinning and de-twinning mechanisms}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{36-52}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Together with slip, deformation twinning and de-twinning are the plastic
   deformation mechanisms in hexagonal close packed (HCP) crystals, which
   strongly affect texture evolution and anisotropic response. As a
   consequence, several twinning models have been proposed and implemented
   in the existing polycrystalline plasticity models. De-twinning is an
   inverse process with respect to twinning, which is relevant to cycling,
   fatigue and complex loads but is rarely incorporated into
   polycrystalline plastic models. In this paper, we propose a
   physics-based twinning and de-twinning (TDT) model that has the
   capability of dealing with both mechanisms during plastic deformation.
   The TDT model is characterized by four deformation mechanisms
   corresponding to twin nucleation, twin growth, twin shrinkage and
   re-twinning. Twin nucleation and twin growth are associated with
   deformation twinning, and twin shrinkage and re-twinning are associated
   with de-twinning. The proposed TDT model is implemented in the
   Elasto-Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (EVPSC) model. We demonstrate the
   validity and the capability of the TDT model by simulating cyclic
   loading of magnesium alloys AZ31B plate and AZ31 bar. Comparison with
   the measurements indicates that the TDT model is able to capture the key
   features observed in experiments, implying that the mechanical response
   in the simulated materials is mainly associated with twinning and
   de-twinning. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{High-resolution multispectral imaging with random coded exposure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{For multispectral image acquisition in remote sensing, high spatial
   resolution requires a small instantaneous field of view (IFOV). However,
   the smaller the IFOV, the lower the amount of light exposure to imaging
   sensors, and the lower the signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome this
   weakness, we propose a new random coded exposure technique for acquiring
   high-resolution multispectral images without reducing IFOV. The new
   image acquisition system employs a highspeed rotating mirror controlled
   by a random sequence to modulate exposure to an ordinary imager without
   increasing the sampling rate. The proposed high-speed coded exposure
   strategy makes it possible to maintain sufficient light exposure even
   with a small IFOV. The randomly sampled multispectral image can be
   recovered in high spatial resolution by exploiting the signal sparsity.
   The recovery algorithm is based on the compressive sensing theory.
   Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.

Abstract = {{The phase-field-crystal (PFC) modeling paradigm is rapidly emerging as
   the model of choice when investigating materials phenomena with
   atomistic scale effects over diffusive time scales. Recent variants of
   the PFC model, so-called structural PFC (XPFC) models introduced by
   Greenwood et al., have further increased the capability of the method by
   allowing for easy access to various structural transformations in pure
   materials {[}Greenwood, Provatas, and Rottler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105,

   expansion of these XPFC models, leading to a mesoscale complex order
   parameter, i.e., phase-field, model for two-dimensional
   square-triangular structures. Amplitude models retain the salient atomic
   scale features of the underlying PFC models, while resolving
   microstructures on mesoscales as traditional phase-field models. The

   islands are sparse and three dimensional, AlSb islands are numerous and
   flattened. The introduction of 3D island-forming AlSb buffer layer
   facilitates the nucleation of GaSb islands. The AlSb islands-assisted
   nucleation of GaSb islands results in the formation of drastically
   higher quality planar film at a significantly smaller thickness of
   films. The interface of the AlSb and GaSb epilayers with the Si
   substrate was further investigated with energy dispersive X-ray
   spectrometry to elucidate the key role of the AlSb buffer layer in the
   growth of GaSb epilayers on Si substrates. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{The liquid-liquid dispersion of two immiscible viscous fluids was
   studied in an SMX static mixer in the laminar flow regime. The dispersed
   and continuous liquid phases were silicone oils and aqueous solutions of
   high fructose corn syrup, respectively. Several different phase
   viscosities were used and the effect of interfacial tension was examined
   by adding different concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate in the
   aqueous phase. Flow rates of the two phases were varied, and the effect
   of the volume fraction (holdup) of dispersed phase was explored for a
   few cases. The droplets were photographed with backlighting and the
   images were analysed using the Hough transform method. The drop size
   distributions for each set of conditions were typically obtained on the
   basis of about 200 images. Mean drop size was expressed as the mass mean
   diameter D-43.
   It was found that the ``tail{''} at the higher end of the droplet size
   distribution decreased with increasing superficial velocity and
   continuous phase viscosities and the same effect was seen in the values
   of D-43. It was also found that D-43 decreased with lowering of the
   interfacial tension. The effect of the dispersed phase viscosity was
   significant only at non-zero surfactant concentrations. The holdup was
   found to have a minimal effect on D-43.
   A two-stage breakup model has been developed relating D-43 to the
   capillary number. The model uses the concept that primary drops are
   formed near the entry to the mixer, with a size determined by the
   spacing between the cross bars in the element. They are then further
   broken up by a hydrodynamic mechanism based on an energy balance between
   the energy input clue to the viscous flow, and the surface energy
   increase clue to the breakup of the primary drops. This model provides
   an approximate basis for correlating the data on D-43. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Specific heat of hydrated lysozyme, water's contribution to its
   dynamics, and criteria for glass formation of biomaterials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies of the dynamics of hydrated proteins had shown a
   feature resembling an exceptionally broad glass-softening endotherm. Its
   onset temperature, denoted as T-g, was indefinable in one calorimetric
   study of hydrated lysozyme and was in the 148-218 K range in another
   study, depending upon hydration. Other methods reported this T-g as
   similar to 170 K. We argue that glass-formation of biomaterials should
   be studied by measuring a property on both the cooling and heating paths
   and it should be ascertained (i) that there is thermal hysteresis of the
   measured property, (ii) that the real and imaginary components of a
   dynamic property obey the Kramers-Kronig relations, and (iii) that there
   is an effect of annealing that is consistent with the glass
   phenomenology. We report the real and imaginary components of the
   dynamic specific heat, C'(p) and C `'(p), of dry and two hydrated
   lysozyme samples on the cooling and the heating paths as well as the
   effects of annealing and changing the frequency. For the most hydrated
   (34.6 g water per 100 g lysozyme) sample, C-p,C-app does not show
   thermal hysteresis in the 160-230 K range, C'(p) varies in a
   sigmoid-shape manner with T while C `'(p) remains close to zero, and
   there is no effect of annealing. We interpret these findings in terms of
   continuous development of ice-like aggregates of immobile H2O as more
   H-bonds form on cooling, and continuous deterioration of the aggregates
   on heating. As the equilibrium constant between the aggregates and
   mobile H2O increases on cooling, configurational degrees of freedom of
   H2O molecules and lysozyme segments decrease. Consequently, the net
   change in enthalpy is small but the change in Cp is large. Mobility of
   the lysozyme segments still depends upon the mobility of H2O molecules.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{137-144}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Hydrophobic polystyrene nanoparticles (latex) were evaluated as
   replacement collectors for pentlandite flotation with a view to
   improving processing of ultramafic ores. Nanoparticles adsorb onto
   pentlandite particles, rendering them sufficiently hydrophobic to induce
   flotation. Polystyrene nanoparticles bearing surface imidazole groups
   specifically bind nickel ions and appear to improve selectivity (i.e.
   nickel grade), presumably because of chelation interactions between the
   imidazole groups and the pentlandite surface. Very high nanoparticle
   concentrations were required for high pentlandite recoveries under the
   high ionic strength conditions typically used in industry because the
   nanoparticles were'coagulating. The path to commercially relevant
   nanoparticle flotation collectors involves increasing the colloidal
   stability of the nanoparticles while minimally impacting hydrophobicity.

Abstract = {{Considering the dielectric permittivity of graphene can be tuned to be
   negative by external electric field, we propose to construct alternating
   graphene/dielectric multilayer based optical hyperlens for far-field
   subdiffraction imaging at mid-infrared frequencies. For such a scheme,
   hyperbolic dispersion curve can be achieved under the condition that the
   thickness of dielectric layer is made comparable to that of graphene
   layer, which is capable of supporting the propagation of evanescent wave
   with large wave vector. Simulation results by finite-element method
   demonstrate that two point sources with separation far below the
   diffraction limit can be magnified by the systems to the extent that
   conventional far-field optical microscopy can further manipulate. Such a
   hyperlens has the advantage of operating in a wideband region due to the
   tunability of graphene's dielectric permittivity as opposed to previous
   metal based hyperlens, enabling the potential applications in real-time
   super-resolution imaging, nanolithography, and sensing. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{Cathodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of methyl violet (MV) was
   performed from aqueous solutions. The film microstructure and deposition
   mechanism were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   cyclic voltammetry (CV). MV allowed efficient dispersion of multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and graphene in aqueous suspensions. Thin films
   of MWCNT and graphene were obtained by cathodic EPD using MV as a
   charging, dispersing and film forming agent. The deposition yield was
   varied by variation of MV concentration in the suspensions and
   deposition voltage. The possibility to deposit both MWCNT and graphene
   using MV as a dispersing and charging agent allowed the fabrication of
   MWCNT-graphene composites by EPD. The film microstructures and
   advantages of cathodic EPD were discussed. The films were investigated
   for application in electrochemical supercapacitors (ES).
   Electro-chemical investigation showed capacitive behavior of the films
   in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance (SC) of similar to
   130 F g(-1) was obtained at a scan rate of 2 mVs(-1), and the
   capacitance retention in the range of 2-100 mVs(-1) was similar to 50\%.
   The impedance spectroscopy data were in agreement with simulation
   results, obtained using equivalent circuit model. The composite films
   showed improved capacitive behavior compared to the films of individual

Abstract = {{A centralized optimization strategy is proposed to determine optimal raw
   material purchasing and plant operation practices as applied to primary
   steelmaking in the steel processing industry. Raw materials are
   purchased on the open market and include coal, iron ore pellets, and
   scrap steel. There are many raw material vendors, providing products
   varying in quality and price. It is desired to determine the least
   costly method of both purchasing and Processing the raw materials to
   make steel of acceptable quality. A model for primary steelmaking is
   developed using a combination of mass balances and empirical
   relationships. The model, in addition to process constraints, is
   combined with an economic objective function and the resulting
   optimization problem solved using a mixed integer nonlinear programming
   (MINLP) solver. Case studies illustrate the strong connection between
   plant sections, and the significant impact that the carbon, volatile
   matter, and phosphorus content of the coals and pellets have on raw
   material, selection. Raw material uncertainty is incorporated using two
   stage stochastic programming. The results indicate that by making a
   slightly more expensive raw material purchase, the frequency of
   constraint violation during processing can be significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{New dispersants were investigated for the preparation of MnO2 and
   composites by electrophoretic deposition (ED). The investigation of
   molecules from salicylate, phenolate, catecholate, and phthalate
   families allowed the comparison of different mechanisms, which provided
   dispersant bonding to the MnO2. The deposition yield was studied at
   various experimental conditions. Catecholate bonding resulted in
   significantly higher colloidal stability and deposition rate, compared
   to salicylate bonding. It was shown that agglomeration of MnO2
   nanoparticles can be avoided when MnO2 synthesis is performed in the
   presence of dispersants. MnO2-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)
   composites for ultracapacitors were obtained by ED. The use of Ni plaque
   current collectors allowed high capacitance and low electrochemical
   impedance at higher material loadings, compared to stainless steel foil
   current collectors. The electrodes showed a capacitance of 185 Fg(-1).
   The MnO2-MWCNT electrodes can be used for applications in
   ultracapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{All biomedical materials are recognized as foreign entities by the host
   immune system despite the substantial range of different materials that
   have been developed by material scientists and engineers. Hydrophobic
   biomaterials, hydrogels, biomaterials with low protein binding surfaces,
   and those that readily adsorb a protein layer all seem to incite similar
   host responses in vivo that may differ in magnitude, but ultimately
   result in encapsulation by fibrotic tissue. The recognition of medical
   materials by the host is explained by the very intricate pattern
   recognition system made up of integrins, toll-like receptors, scavenger
   receptors, and other surface proteins that enable leukocytes to perceive
   almost any foreign body. In this review, we describe the various pattern
   recognition receptors and processes that occur on biomedical material

Abstract = {{We present a novel multiwavelength laser array with a sampled grating

   grating as well as the laser operation conditions, all the even order,
   including the zeroth-order reflections, can be effectively suppressed,
   leaving only the first-order reflection wavelength to lase. Unlike in
   the conventional sampled grating where part of the base grating will
   have to be removed, the whole base grating is retained in the proposed
   structure; hence, the side-mode suppression ratio will not be
   jeopardized due to the weakened grating coupling strength. As an
   example, an array of 12 lasers has been designed to cover a wavelength
   range from 1542 to 1560 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a sustainable nanomaterial with
   applications spanning composites, coatings, gels, and foams. Surface
   modification routes to optimize CNC interfacial compatibility and
   functionality are required to exploit the full potential of this
   material in the design of new products. In this work, CNCs have been
   rendered pH-responsive by surface-initiated graft polymerization of
   4-vinylpyridine with the initiator ceric(IV) ammonium nitrate. The
   polymerization is a one-pot, water-based synthesis carried out under
   sonication, which ensures even dispersion of the cellulose nanocrystals
   during the reaction. The resultant suspensions of
   poly(4-vinylpyridine)-grafted cellulose nanocrystals (P4VP-g-CNCs) show
   reversible flocculation and sedimentation with changes in pH; the loss
   of colloidal stability is visible by eye even at concentrations as low
   as 0.004 wt \%. The presence of grafted polymer and the ability to tune
   the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of P4VP-g-CNCs were characterized
   by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis,
   electrophoretic mobility, mass spectrometry, transmittance spectroscopy,
   contact-angle measurements, thermal analysis, and various microscopies.
   Atomic force microscopy showed no observable changes in the CNC
   dimensions or degree of aggregation after polymer grafting, and a liquid
   crystalline nematic phase of the modified CNCs was detected by polarized
   light microscopy. Controlled stability and wettability of P4VP-g-CNCs is
   advantageous both in composite design, where cellulose nanocrystals
   generally have limited dispersibility in nonpolar matrices, and as
   biodegradable flocculants. The responsive nature of these novel
   nanoparticles may offer new applications for CNCs in biomedical devices,
   as clarifying agents, and in industrial separation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Cotton-source cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with a range of surface
   charge densities were fluorescently labeled with 5-(4,
   6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF) in a facile, one-pot
   reaction under alkaline conditions. Three CNC samples were labeled: (I)
   anionic CNCs prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis with a sulfur content
   of 0.47 wt \%, (II) a partially desulfated, sulfuric acid-hydrolyzed CNC
   sample, which was less anionic with an intermediate sulfur content of
   0.21 wt \%, and (III) uncharged CNCs prepared by HCl hydrolysis. The
   DTAF-labeled CNCs were characterized by dynamic light scattering, atomic
   force microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy. and microscopy, and
   polarized light microscopy. Fluorescent CNCs exhibited similar colloidal
   stability to the starting CNCs, with the exception of the HCl-hydrolyzed
   sample, which became I less agglomerated after the labeling reaction.
   The degree of labeling depended on the sulfur content of the CNCs,
   indicating that the presence of sulfate half-ester groups on the CNC
   surfaces hindered labeling. The labeling reaction produced CNCs that had
   1 detectable fluorescence, without compromising the overall surface
   chemistry or behavior of the materials, an aspect relevant to studies
   that require a fluorescent cellulose substrate with intact native
   properties. The DTAF-labeled CNCs were proposed as optical markers for
   the dispersion quality of CNC-loaded polymer composites. Electrospun
   polyvinyl alcohol fibers loaded with DTAF-labeled CNCs appeared
   uniformly fluorescent by fluorescence microscopy, suggesting that the
   nanoparticles were well dispersed within the polymer matrix.}},

Abstract = {{A half-duplex amplify-and-forward two-way relay network consisting of
   two single-antenna sources and N relays with each having two antennas is
   considered in this paper. For such a system, a tight lower bound of
   pairwise error probability (PEP) of a maximum likelihood (ML) detector
   for any distributed linear dispersion code with a fixed average
   amplifier is derived, revealing that diversity gain function cannot
   decay faster than ln(N) SNR/SNR2N, where SNR is signal to noise ratio.
   Particularly for the network having two relays, a novel distributed
   quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (QO-STBC) is proposed with two
   significant advantages. One is that the equivalent channel matrices at
   both source nodes turn out to be the block-circulant matrices, with each
   block being a product of the two Alamouti channel matrices. The other is
   that the equivalent noises at the both source nodes are Gaussian and
   white. Therefore, like QO-STBC for a multi-antennas system, the proposed
   code for the relay system still maintains low-decoding complexity for
   the ML detector. Asymptotic PEP formula is attained to show that the
   proposed code enables the optimal diversity gain function, i.e., meeting
   the lower bound of diversity gain, and the optimal coding gain. In
   addition, a near optimal power allocation that maximizes the received
   SNR of the worse link is presented and examined through comprehensive
   computer simulations for various kinds of asymmetric relay channels.}},

Abstract = {{A hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) instrument is
   developed to study endogenous fluorophores in biological tissue as an
   optical biopsy tool. This instrument is able to spectrally, temporally,
   and spatially resolve fluorescence signal, thus providing
   multidimensional information to assist clinical tissue diagnosis. An
   acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) is used to realize rapid wavelength
   switch, and a photomultiplier tube and a high-speed digitizer are used
   to collect the time-resolved fluorescence decay at each wavelength in
   real time. The performance of this instrument has been characterized and
   validated on fluorescence tissue phantoms and fresh porcine skin
   specimens. This dual-arm AOTF design achieves high spectral throughput
   while allowing microsecond nonsequential, random wavelength switching,
   which is highly desirable for time-critical applications. In the results
   reported here, a motorized scanning stage is used to realize spatial
   scanning for two-dimensional images, while a rapid beam steering
   technique is feasible and being developed in an ongoing project. (C)

Abstract = {{Atom probe tomography stands out from other materials characterisation
   techniques mostly due to its capacity to map individual atoms in
   three-dimensions with high spatial resolution. The methods used to
   transform raw detector data into a three-dimensional reconstruction
   have, comparatively to other aspects of the technique, evolved
   relatively little since their inception more than 15 years ago. However,
   due to the importance of the fidelity of the data, this topic is
   currently attracting a lot of interest within the atom probe community.
   In this review we cover: (1) the main aspects of the image projection,
   (2) the methods used to build tomographic reconstructions, (3) the
   intrinsic limitations of these methods, and (4) future potential
   directions to improve the integrity of atom probe tomograms. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This feature article focuses on the synthesis of amphiphilic
   hyperbranched polymers. There is a growing interest in the properties of
   these nanostructured materials and the copolymerization of a vinyl and
   divinyl monomer in the presence of a chain transfer agent, provides a
   simple, versatile and scalable synthesis route. In particular the use of
   catalytic chain transfer (CCT) will be highlighted. CCT is a very
   efficient and versatile chemistry for molecular weight control and the
   synthesis of vinyl omega-end functionalized polymers (e.g.
   macromonomers) in free radical polymerization. This makes CCT an
   interesting option for the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers as the
   use of cobaloxime complexes allows for control over the polymer
   architecture as well as omega-endgroup functionality. An overview of the
   synthesis of hyperbranched polymers via the copolymerization of a vinyl
   and divinyl monomer is presented, followed with a number of examples of
   amphiphilic hyperbranched polymers and their applications. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In recent years, a fundamental understanding of solidification and its
   behavior has been gained through molecular dynamics simulations and the
   phase-field method, the first of which is limited to short time scales
   and the latter of which does not represent interface and elastoplastic
   properties accurately. Recently, the phase-field-crystal (PFC) method, a
   continuum method operating on atomistic length scales and diffusive time
   scales, has helped bridge the multiple scale gap between molecular
   dynamics and phase field. This review surveys the advances of PFC models
   in the context of various solidification phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical experience and research findings suggest that schizophrenia is
   a disorder comprised of multiple genetic and neurophysiological subtypes
   with differential response to treatment. Electroencephalography (EEG) is
   a non-invasive, inexpensive and useful tool for investigating the
   neurobiology of schizophrenia and its subtypes. EEG studies elucidate
   the neurophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying clinical
   symptomatology. In this review article recent advances in applying EEG
   to study pathophysiology, phenomenology, and treatment response in
   schizophrenia are discussed. Investigative strategies employed include:
   analyzing quantitative EEG (QEEG) spectral power during the resting
   state and cognitive tasks; applying machine learning methods to identify
   QEEG indicators of diagnosis and treatment response; and using the
   event-related brain potential (ERP) technique to characterize the
   neurocognitive processes underlying clinical symptoms. Studies
   attempting to validate potential EEG biomarkers of schizophrenia and its
   symptoms, which could be useful in assessing familial risk and treatment
   response, are also reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new inversion approach to estimate the depth
   profile of a fatigue crack from the output signal of an alternating
   current field measurements (ACFM) probe. We first show that the mapping
   between the ACFM signals and corresponding crack depth profiles can be
   expressed by an affine transformation, then we utilize a generalized
   version of the fuzzy alignment algorithm (FAA) to find this mapping more
   efficiently. The proposed method is then extended using the Dave's
   objective function previously proposed for the fuzzy clustering. To
   evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed inversion technique
   we reconstruct cracks of arbitrary shapes from both simulated and
   measured ACFM signals. The results show that the proposed approach is
   more robust and accurate than existing methods and gives reasonable
   results even in the absence of sufficient training data.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main tools for early diagnosis of breast cancer is digital
   mammography. These images require large storage space and are difficult
   to be transmitted over communication links. In this paper we propose a
   context-based method for lossless compression of these images. Some
   modifications are performed to customize the activity level
   classification model (ALCM) predictor to work best in mammograms. The
   function of the modified predictor changes for different main regions of
   these images. Also, best qualities of two other predictors are exploited
   and the results of the fittest predictor are selected adaptively for the
   prediction of a pixel. Moreover, context modeling is used for a better
   categorization of the prediction errors. The proposed algorithm was
   tested using images from a well-known database and the results were
   compared with two standard compression methods of lossless mode of
   JPEG2000 and JPEG-LS. The proposed method was proved to produce better
   compression results than those of the standard algorithms. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Conventional and silicone hydrogels as models for contact lenses were
   prepared to determine the effect of the presence of hyaluronic acid on
   lysozyme sorption and denaturation. Hyaluronic acid was loaded into
   poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate)/TRIS - methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy silane)
   hydrogels, which served as models for conventional and silicone hydrogel
   contact lens materials. The hyaluronic acid was cross-linked using
   1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide in the presence of
   dendrimers. Active lysozyme was quantified using a Micrococcus
   lysodeikticus assay while total lysozyme was determined using 125-I
   radiolabeled protein. To examine the location of hyaluronic acid in the
   gels, 6-aminofluorescein labeled hyaluronic acid was incorporated into
   the gels using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide chemistry
   and the gels were examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy.
   Hyaluronic acid incorporation significantly reduced lysozyme sorption in
   poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (p<0.00001) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate)/TRIS - methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy silane)
   (p<0.001) hydrogels, with the modified materials sorbing only 20\% and
   16\% that of the control, respectively. More importantly, hyaluronic
   acid also decreased lysozyme denaturation in poly(2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate) (p<0.005) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)/TRIS -
   methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy silane) (p<0.02) hydrogels. The
   confocal laser scanning microscopy results showed that the hyaluronic
   acid distribution was dependent on both the material type and the
   molecular weight of hyaluronic acid. This study demonstrates that
   hyaluronic acid incorporated as a wetting agent has the potential to
   reduce lysozyme sorption and denaturation in contact lens applications.
   The distribution of hyaluronic acid within hydrogels appears to affect
   denaturation, with more surface mobile, lower molecular weight
   hyaluronic acid being more effective in preventing denaturation.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation offers a detailed analysis of solutions to the
   two-dimensional Oseen problem in the exterior of an obstacle for large
   Reynolds numbers. It is motivated by mathematical results highlighting
   the important role played by the Oseen flows in characterizing the
   asymptotic structure of steady solutions to the Navier-Stokes problem at
   large distances from the obstacle. We compute solutions of the Oseen
   problem based on the series representation discovered by Tomotika and
   Aoi (Q J Mech Appl Math 3:140-161, 1950) where the expansion
   coefficients are determined numerically. Since the resulting algebraic
   problem suffers from very poor conditioning, the solution process
   involves the use of very high arithmetic precision. The effect of
   different numerical parameters on the accuracy of the computed solutions
   is studied in detail. While the corresponding inviscid problem admits
   many different solutions, we show that the inviscid flow proposed by
   Stewartson (Philos Mag 1:345-354, 1956) is the limit that the viscous
   Oseen flows converge to as Re -> a. We also draw some comparisons with
   the steady Navier-Stokes flows for large Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring iron content in the brain has important implications for a
   number of neurodegenerative diseases. Quantitative susceptibility
   mapping (QSM), derived from magnetic resonance images, has been used to
   measure total iron content in vivo and in post mortem brain. In this
   paper, we show how magnetic susceptibility from QSM correlates with
   total iron content measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging and by
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The relationship
   between susceptibility and ferritin iron was estimated at 1.10 +/- 0.08
   ppb susceptibility per mu g iron/g wet tissue, similar to that of iron
   in fixed (frozen/thawed) cadaveric brain and previously published data
   from unfixed brains. We conclude that magnetic susceptibility can
   provide a direct and reliable quantitative measurement of iron content
   and that it can be used clinically at least in regions with high iron
   content. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have fabricated monolithic silicon avalanche photodiodes capable of
   10 Gbps operation at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The photodiodes are
   entirely CMOS process compatible and comprise a p-i-n junction
   integrated with a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) rib waveguide.
   Photo-generation is initiated via the presence of deep levels in the
   silicon bandgap, introduced by ion implantation and modified by
   subsequent annealing. The devices show a small signal 3 dB bandwidth of
   2.0 GHz as well as an open eye pattern at 10 Gbps. A responsivity of 4.7
   +/- 0.5 A/W is measured for a 600 mu m device at a reverse bias of 40 V.

   Specific cases were analyzed to extract pertinent underlying physics,

Title = {{Evidence against the Involvement of Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous

Abstract = {{Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative
   disease of the CNS. Recently a controversial vascular hypothesis for MS,
   termed chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), has been
   advanced. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative
   prevalence of the venous abnormalities that define CCSVI.
   Methods: A case-control study was conducted in which 100 MS patients
   aged between 18-65 y meeting the revised McDonald criteria were randomly
   selected and stratified into one of four MS subtypes:
   relapsing/remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive and
   benign. Control subjects (16-70 y) with no known history of MS or other
   neurological condition were matched with the MS cases. All cases and
   controls underwent ultrasound imaging of the veins of the neck plus the
   deep cerebral veins, and magnetic resonance imaging of the neck veins
   and brain. These procedures were performed on each participant on the
   same day.
   Results: On ultrasound we found no evidence of reflux, stenosis or
   blockage in the internal jugular veins (IJV) or vertebral veins (VV) in
   any study participant. Similarly, there was no evidence of either reflux
   or cessation of flow in the deep cerebral veins in any subject. Flow was
   detected in the IJV and VV in all study participants. Amongst 199
   participants there was one MS subject who fulfilled the minimum two
   ultrasound criteria for CCSVI. Using MRI we found no significant
   differences in either the intra- or extra-cranial venous flow velocity
   or venous architecture between cases and controls.
   Conclusion: This case-control study provides compelling evidence against
   the involvement of CCSVI in multiple sclerosis.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Relaxation phenomenon, thermodynamics, and phase transformation of water
   in nanopores has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry,
   usually on heating a precooled sample. Interpretation of such results is
   ambiguous, because the data do not indicate whether or not there is a
   thermal hysteresis between the heating and cooling paths. We argue that
   measurements on both the cooling and heating paths are needed,
   particularly for complex systems, and also measurements of the complex
   quantity are needed to ascertain that the Kramers-Kronig relations for a
   relaxation process are obeyed. We report a study of the real and
   imaginary components of the complex specific heat, C-p' and C-p `', and
   the time-dependent C-p,C-app of water confined to 2.4 nm diameter
   cylindrical pores on both the cooling and heating paths, and use
   different thermal histories. C-p,C-app of nanoconfined water shows two
   exothermic peaks during cooling below 255 K at 12 K/h and only one
   endothermic peak on heating, and the enthalpy change determined from the
   exotherm is more than that determined from the endotherm. C-p,C-app and
   C-p' of the partially crystallized water is higher at 240 K than at 275
   K on the cooling path, and C-p,C-app and C-p' of the partially
   crystalline water are lower at 240 K than at 275 K on the heating path,
   thus showing a thermal hysteresis in this range. Studies by using 60 K/h
   cooling and heating rates and the effect of heat treatment at selected
   temperatures confirm that the features observed are due to slow
   crystallization and slow melting. The endotherm observed on the heating
   path with onset at 220 K and peak at 227 K is due to gradual melting of
   the ice in nanopores, and not due to glass-softening transition, a
   liquid-liquid transition, or an approach toward the conjectured critical
   point of the supercooled water in the 2.4 nm pores. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{A multi-scale, dynamic, two-dimensional, heterogeneous model for

   diffusional limitations have been incorporated, not by the conventional
   method of computing the effectiveness factor, but by accounting for the
   transfer of species as a function of the concentration and temperature
   gradients existing between the gas phase and catalyst surface along the
   reactor length. The model has been validated with available industrial
   steady-state data from literature. The model was then used to study the

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{31}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a simple, low-cost process to grow GaAs
   nanostructures of a few nm diameter and similar to 50 nm height in Pyrex
   glass wafers. These nanostructures were grown by sequential plasma
   activation of GaAs and Pyrex glass surfaces using a low-temperature
   hybrid plasma bonding technology in air. Raman analyses of the activated
   surfaces show gallium oxide and arsenic oxide, as well as suppressed
   non-bridging oxygen with aluminate and boroxol chains in glass. The flow
   of alkaline ions toward the cathode and the replacement of alkaline ions
   by Ga and As ions in glass result in the growth of GaAs nanostructures
   in nanopores/nanoscratches in glass. These nanopores/nanoscratches are
   believed to be the origin of the growth of the nanostructures. It was
   found that the length of the GaAs nanostructures may be controlled by an
   electrostatic force. Cross-sectional observation of the bonded interface
   using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms the
   existence of the nanostructures. A possible application of the
   nanostructures in glass is a filtration system for biomolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Gasoline is produced by blending several different components in ratios
   such that the blended mixture meets the required quality specifications.
   The blender produces different batches of gasoline by switching
   operation from one grade of gasoline to another. Blend planning horizon
   usually spans 10 to 14 days. Blend plan optimization minimizes the total
   blend costs by solving a multiperiod problem, where demands need to be
   satisfied in each period and some inventory is carried into the future
   time periods to meet the demands. Since blend component production is
   determined by a longer range refinery production plan, inventory
   carrying costs are not included in the objective function. It is shown
   that nonlinear programming (NLP) as well as mixed integer nonlinear
   programming (MINLP) solvers lead to different blend recipes and
   different blend volume patterns for the same total cost. The new
   algorithm described in this work systematically searches for multiple
   optimum solutions; this opens the way for blend planners to select from
   different blend plans based on additional considerations (e.g., blend
   more of regular gasoline earlier in the planning horizon thereby
   creating an opportunity to meet more demand for it in early periods)
   instead of having to use only one solution that varies with the choice
   of the solver. Inherent structure of the proposed algorithm makes it
   well suited for implementation on parallel CPU machines.}},

Abstract = {{An electrically tunable Au/N-ZnO/ZnO/Al film bulk acoustic resonator
   (FBAR) is proposed. The stack resonator is Au-piezoelectric ZnO layer-Al
   while Schottky diode junction is Au/N-ZnO semiconductor layer. The
   FBAR's resonance frequency changes as the junction capacitance decreases
   with reverse bias. Our experiments gave a frequency shift of similar to
   30 kHz/V at 1.46GHz, maximum insertion loss similar to 0.7 dB, and a
   very high Q factor above 1200. Circuit simulations indicated a tunable
   range of similar to 3.8 MHz from optimizing the FBAR's structure and
   doping concentration of N-ZnO. Electrical tunability decreases from 27
   kHz/V to 1.5 kHz/V with temperatures from 30 degrees C to 105 degrees C.

Abstract = {{Ultra-low power radio frequency (RF) transceivers used in short-range
   application such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require efficient,
   reliable and fully integrated transmitter architectures with minimal
   building blocks. This paper presents the design, implementation and
   performance evaluation of single-chip, fully integrated 2.4 GHz and 433
   MHz RF transmitters using direct-modulation power voltage-controlled
   oscillators (PVCOs) in addition to a 2.0 GHz phase-locked loop (PLL)
   based transmitter. All three RF transmitters have been fabricated in a
   standard mixed-signal CMOS 0.18 m technology. Measurement results of the
   2.4 GHz transmitter show an improvement in drain efficiency from 27\% to
   36\%. The 2.4 GHz and 433 MHz transmitters deliver an output power of 8
   dBm with a phase noise of -122 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, while drawing
   15.4 mA of current and an output power of 6.5 dBm with a phase noise of
   -120 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, while drawing 20.8 mA of current from 1.5 V
   power supplies, respectively. The PLL transmitter delivers an output
   power of 9 mW with a locking range of 128 MHz and consumes 26 mA from
   1.8 V power supply. The experimental results demonstrate that the RF
   transmitters can be efficiently used in low power WSN applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new approach for video super resolution problem.
   To this end Compressive Sensing (CS) theory along with contourlet
   transform has been used. In CS framework the signal is assumed to be
   sparse in a transform domain. An approach has been suggested using this
   fact in which contourlet domain is used as the transform domain and a CS
   algorithm helps to find the high resolution frame. A post processing
   step is applied afterward to the estimated outputs to increase the
   quality. The post processing step consists of a deblurring term and a
   Bilateral Total Variation (BTV) filter for increasing the consistency.
   This method helps to relax the conditions on hardware and increase the
   quality of the video after capturing, in fact the quality of the video
   streams in consumer applications can be increased even the capturing
   device represents the scene in a low resolution format. Experimental
   results show significant improvement over existing super resolution
   methods in both objective and subjective quality.}},

Abstract = {{Polyelectrolyte complexes formed between laccase and polyvinylamine with
   grafted TEMPO moieties, PVAm-T, adsorb onto cellulose, causing

   primer layer promoting wet cellulose-to-cellulose adhesion in the
   presence of PVAm adhesive. The cellulose modification occurs at ambient
   temperatures and pH 5. The adhesion improvements with mixtures of PVAm-T
   and laccase are remarkable because both components are macromolecular,
   which should inhibit the ability of the TEMPO to act as a shuttle
   between the enzyme and the primary hydroxyl groups on cellulose. It is
   proposed that PVAm-bound oxoammonium ions exchange with neighboring
   TEMPO moieties, providing a mechanism for the transfer of oxidation
   activity from immobilized enzyme to the cellulose surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors (SCs), also called electric double-layer capacitors or
   ultracapacitors, nowadays have a considerable applicability as fast
   energy storage systems. Mostly, because of its low rated voltage, they
   are connected in series to reach the required voltage. The most usual
   approach for SC strings modeling is either the simplification of the
   whole string to an equivalent RC network, or the concatenation of
   individual models. However, these approaches lose accuracy because of
   electrical unbalances between cells. This paper proposes a new modeling
   approach that defines a new grouping strategy to improve the modeling of
   an SC string. It implies defining the string modeling around the
   combination of SCs and voltage balancing circuits. The resulting model
   is capable of reproducing the dynamic performance of an SC string with
   better accuracy. Experimental validation corroborates the improved
   dynamic response of the proposed modeling unit.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a pulsed tangential-flow ultrafiltration technique for rapid
   analysis of protein-drug binding. A protein-drug pulse was injected into
   a tangential-flow membrane device and made to flow parallel to the
   surface of a protein-retaining ultrafiltration membrane. The protein and
   protein-drug complexes were flushed out of the device in the retentate
   stream, whereas the free drug present in the permeate stream was
   quantified using on-line UV detector. The height of the permeate drug
   peak and its area under the curve were both found to be proportional to
   the free drug concentration in the injected sample. The fraction of
   bound drug was determined by comparison with peak obtained with
   protein-free drug sample. The characteristics of the permeate drug peak
   such as residence time, peak width, and peak height depended on both
   feed and permeate flow rates. The proposed technique in addition to
   being fast was self-priming in nature because the injected samples were
   flushed out of the module along with the retentate and permeate. This
   feature makes this technique particularly suitable for automated sample
   analysis. The technique was validated using three-model protein-drug
   combinations: bovine serum albumin (BSA)-antipyrine, BSA-tryptophan, and
   BSA-aspirin. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{Batch process monitoring is a challenging task, because conventional
   methods are not well suited to handle the inherent multiphase operation.
   In this study, a novel multiway independent component analysis (MICA)
   mixture model and mutual information based fault detection and diagnosis
   approach is proposed. The multiple operating phases in batch processes
   are characterized by non-Gaussian independent component mixture models.
   Then, the posterior probability of the monitored sample is maximized to
   identify the operating phase that the sample belongs to, and, thus, the
   localized MICA model is developed for process fault detection. Moreover,
   the detected faulty samples are projected onto the residual subspace,
   and the mutual information based non-Gaussian contribution index is
   established to evaluate the statistical dependency between the
   projection and the measurement along each process variable. Such
   contribution index is used to diagnose the major faulty variables
   responsible for process abnormalities. The effectiveness of the proposed
   approach is demonstrated using the fed-batch penicillin fermentation
   process, and the results are compared to those of the multiway principal
   component analysis mixture model and regular MICA method. The case study
   demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to detect the abnormal
   events over different phases as well as diagnose the faulty variables
   with high accuracy. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{The problem of driving a batch process to a specified product quality
   using data-driven model predictive control (MPC) is described. To
   address the problem of unavailability of online quality measurements, an
   inferential quality model, which relates the process conditions over the
   entire batch duration to the final quality, is required. The accuracy of
   this type of quality model, however, is sensitive to the prediction of
   the future batch behavior until batch termination. In this work, we
   handle this missing data problem by integrating a previously developed
   data-driven modeling methodology, which combines multiple local linear
   models with an appropriate weighting function to describe
   nonlinearities, with the inferential model in a MPC framework. The key
   feature of this approach is that the causality and nonlinear
   relationships between the future inputs and outputs are accounted for in
   predicting the final quality and computing the manipulated input
   trajectory. The efficacy of the proposed predictive control design is
   illustrated via closed-loop simulations of a nylon-6,6 batch
   polymerization process with limited measurements. (c) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition method has been developed for the
   electrodeposition of linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) films. The
   deposition mechanism is based on the electrophoresis of protonated
   LPEI-H+, base generation at the cathode surface, charge neutralisation
   and formation of insoluble LPEI films. Quartz crystal microbalance data,
   coupled with the results of electron microscopy, showed that deposition
   rate and film thickness can be varied and controlled by the variation of
   deposition time and voltage. LPEI films provided corrosion protection of
   stainless steel substrates. LPEI was used for the dispersion, charging
   and electrophoretic deposition of TiO2, hydrotalcite and MnO2 particles
   and fabrication of composite films. Scanning electron microscopy and
   thermogravimetric analysis showed the formation of composite films,
   containing 45.4\% TiO2, 53.1\% hydrotalcite and 33.3\% MnO2 in the LPEI
   matrix. The film thickness was varied in the range of 0.1-4 mu m by
   variation of the deposition time at a constant deposition voltage. The
   proposed approach paves the way for the fabrication of organic-inorganic
   composite films combining functional properties of LPEI and inorganic
   materials.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{655-669}},

Abstract = {{Signal classification is an important issue in many branches of science
   and engineering. In signal classification, a feature of the signals is
   often selected for similarity comparison. A distance metric must then be
   established to measure the dissimilarities between different signal
   features. Due to the natural characteristics of dynamic systems, the
   power spectral density (PSD) of a signal is often used as a feature to
   facilitate classification. We reason in this paper that PSD matrices
   have structural constraints and that they describe a manifold in the
   signal space. Thus, instead of the widely used Euclidean distance (ED),
   a more appropriate measure is the Riemannian distance (RD) on the
   manifold. Here, we develop closed-form expressions of the RD between two
   PSD matrices on the manifold and study some of the properties. We
   further show how an optimum weighting matrix can be developed for the
   application of RD to signal classification. These new distance measures
   are then applied to the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)
   signals for the determination of sleep states and the results are highly
   encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Electrical stimulation of denervated muscle has been shown
   to minimize atrophy and fibrosis and increase force in animal and human
   models. However, electrical stimulation after nerve repair is
   controversial due to questions of efficacy. Methods: Using a rat model,
   we investigated the efficacy of short-term electrical muscle stimulation
   for increasing reinnervation and preventing muscle atrophy. After tibial
   nerve transection and immediate repair with the fibular nerve, 1 month
   of electrical stimulation was applied 5 days/week for 1 hour to the
   gastrocnemius muscle via implanted electrodes. Results: After 2 months
   of further recovery without stimulation, muscle weights, twitch forces,
   and type I fiber areas were significantly greater in stimulated animals
   than in repaired controls without stimulation. Motor unit size and
   numbers were not different between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Short-term
   electrical muscle stimulation after nerve repair significantly reduces
   muscle atrophy and does not affect motor reinnervation.}},

Abstract = {{The interacting multiple model (IMM) strategy is particularly useful for
   systems that behave according to a number of different operating modes.
   In this strategy, each operating mode is described by a model and has
   its own filter. The filters are run in parallel, and an overall
   operating mode probability is calculated that provides an indication of
   the current operating regime of the system. The smooth variable
   structure filter (SVSF) is a relatively new estimation method based on
   the sliding mode concept, formulated in a predictor-corrector form. For
   systems with modeling uncertainties, the SVSF has shown to be more
   accurate and robust when compared with other methods such as the
   extended Kalman filter (EKF). A newer form of the SVSF makes use of a
   time-varying smoothing boundary layer (SVSF-VBL). This paper introduces
   new model-based estimators; based on the IMM strategy combined with the
   SVSF and SVSF-VBL, referred to as the IMM-SVSF and IMM-SVSF-VBL,
   respectively. The new strategies are applied to a type of aerospace
   actuator referred to as an electrohydrostatic actuator, which provides a
   comprehensive system for fault detection and diagnosis. The results are
   compared with the popular IMM-EKF strategy.}},

   loading-unloading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{49-64}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The inelastic behavior presenting in magnesium alloys during cyclic
   loading-unloading have been investigated through the finite strain
   elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) model for polycrystals
   (EVPSC-TDT), which has been updated by implementing the twinning and
   de-twinning (TDT) model. Corresponding to the existing experiments of
   extruded bars of Mg alloys, we constructed the extruded bars of
   magnesium alloys with different initial textures in our simulations to
   study the effects of initial textures and deformation processes (tension
   and compression) on inelastic behavior during cyclic loading and
   unloading. Taking the advantage of numerical modeling, the evolution of
   the instantaneous gradients, the activity of the deformation mechanisms
   and the evolution of twin volume fraction are characterized to interpret
   the inelastic behavior. We found that the alternation of deformation
   mechanisms corresponds to the inelastic behavior; in particular, the
   inelastic behavior becomes more pronounced when twinning and de-twinning
   are activated. Thus, a strong extrusion texture reduces the hysteresis
   loops of the loading-unloading cycle under uniaxial tension, while
   magnifies the inelastic behavior under uniaxial compression, because
   twinning and de-twinning are more active for extrude bars with the
   strong extrusion texture under compression. The simulated results are in
   agreement with the available experimental observations. Published by

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Experiments have shown that plate-shaped precipitates in alloys most
   often grow by a ledge mechanism where mobile steps at the particle
   matrix interface propagate at constant velocity in the growth direction
   and the steps are separated by immobile terraces. In this work the
   concentration field in the matrix phase during growth is formulated by a
   boundary integral technique, which correctly accounts for the
   step-terrace structure. By examining the behavior at the precipitate tip
   and using a stability criterion to determine the plate thickness, a
   relationship is established between the growth velocity, the radius of
   curvature of the plate tip and the supersaturation. When compared with
   previous theoretical treatments based on the Horvay-Cahn, Ivantsov,
   Trivedi solution, the boundary integral result is able to describe the
   velocities obtained in previous experiments on the Al-Ag system more
   accurately, and the improved agreement does not depend on the assumption
   of a finite kinetic attachment term. However, the new criterion is not
   able to reproduce data for Fe-C alloys. Possible reasons for the
   discrepancy are discussed. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   Methods}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive review of a fundamental and
   challenging issue in hydrology: the regionalization of streamflow and
   its advances over the last two decades, specifically 1990-2011. This
   includes a discussion of developments in continuous streamflow
   regionalization, model parameter optimization methods, the application
   of uncertainty analysis in regionalization procedures, limitations and
   challenges, and future research directions. Here, regionalization refers
   to a process of transferring hydrological information from gauged to
   ungauged or poorly gauged basins to estimate the streamflow. Huge
   efforts have been devoted to regionalization of flood peaks, low flow,
   and flow duration curves (FDCs) in the literature, while continuous
   streamflow regionalization is helpful in deriving each of these
   variables. Continuous streamflow regionalization can be conducted
   through rainfall-runoff models or hydrologic model-independent methods.
   In the former case, model parameters are used as instruments to transfer
   hydrological information from gauged to ungauged basins, whereas the
   latter case transfers streamflow directly through data-driven methods.
   According to the reviewed regionalization studies, streamflow
   regionalization has been done mostly through hydrologic models, whereas
   the focus of these studies is on identifying the best methods to
   transfer the model parameters. Conceptual rainfall-runoff models, such
   as Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) and Identification of
   Unit Hydrographs and Component Flows from Rainfall, Evaporation and
   Streamflow Data (IHACRES) have emerged as the most frequently used
   models in this category. Physiographic attributes (e.g.,catchment area,
   elevation, and slope of basins or channels) and meteorological
   information (e.g.,daily time series of rainfall and temperature) are the
   most commonly used in the regionalization studies. Diversity in
   catchment physical attributes and climatic variability produces
   different performances for each regionalization method's application in
   various regions. However, overall, spatial proximity and physical
   similarity have shown satisfactory performance in arid to warm temperate
   climate (e.g.,Australia) and regression-based methods have been
   preferred in warm temperate regions (e.g.,most European countries).
   Similarly, in cold and snowy regions (e.g.,Canada) spatial proximity and
   physical similarity approaches seemed to be good options among the
   hydrologic model-dependent methods. Hydrologic model-independent methods
   have been applied only in few cases, and the results have indicated that
   in warm temperate regions linear and nonlinear regression methods
   perform well. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   studied the effects of gate-to-source and drain-to-source voltages on
   the DMR by calculating the electron density using flux theory. We
   observed that above the threshold the non-parabolic dispersion increases

Abstract = {{European options can be priced when returns follow a log Student's
   t-distribution, provided that the asset is capped in value or the
   distribution is truncated. We call pricing of options using a log
   Student's t-distribution a Gosset approach, in honour of W.S. Gosset. In
   this paper, we compare the Greeks for Gosset and Black-Scholes formulae
   and we discuss implementation. The t-distribution requires a shape
   parameter to match the fat tails' of the observed log returns. For large
   , the Gosset and Black-Scholes formulae are equivalent. The Gosset
   formula removes the requirement that the volatility be known, and in
   this sense can be viewed as an extension of the Black-Scholes formula.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The focus of this study is the analysis of the onset of a shear band in
   saturated soils under biaxial stress conditions taking into account
   bifurcation in both pore pressure and soil skeleton. By considering the
   saturated soil as a two-phase medium, the inhomogeneous displacement and
   pore pressure fields are assumed to be nonlinear and satisfy the
   continuity conditions of displacements, displacement gradients and
   excess pore pressure on the boundaries of the band. It is shown that
   bifurcation may take place in loose, contractive soils in the form of
   two-phase diffuse mode or localized mode of soil skeleton deformation.
   For low permeability saturated soils, the onset of a shear band occurs
   at peak friction, with the shear band parallel to Coulomb's failure
   plane. Numerical examples using a simple stress strain model are given
   to demonstrate the occurrence of the onset of a shear band and its
   inclination, as a function of the void ratio and the initial
   consolidation pressure. (C) 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Abstract = {{The identification of gene coding regions of DNA sequences through
   digital signal processing techniques based on the so-called 3-base
   periodicity has been an emerging problem in bioinformatics. The signal
   to noise ratio (SNR) of a DNA sequence is computed after mapping the DNA
   symbolic sequence into numerical sequences. Typical mapping schemes
   include the Voss, Z-curve and tetrahedron representations and the like,
   which have been used to construct gene coding region detecting
   algorithms. In this paper, an extended definition of SNR is proposed,
   which has less computational cost and wider applicability than its
   original ones. Furthermore, we analyze the SNRs of different mapping
   schemes and derive the general relationship between Voss based SNR and
   that of its general affine transformations. We conclude that the SNRs of
   Z-curve and tetrahedron map are also linearly proportional to that of
   Voss map. Not only is our conclusion instructional for the design of
   other affine transformations, but it is also of much significance in
   understanding the role of the symbolic-to-numerical mapping in the
   detection of gene coding regions.}},

Abstract = {{A self-consistent model for non-partitioning planar ferrite growth from
   alloyed austenite is presented. The model captures the evolution with
   time of interfacial contact conditions for substitutional and

   terms of the dissipation of free energy within the interface, and an
   estimate is provided for the rate of buildup of the alloying element
   ``spike{''} in austenite. The transport of the alloying elements within
   the interface region is modeled using a discrete-jump model, while the
   bulk diffusion of C is treated using a standard continuum treatment. The
   model is validated against ferrite precipitation and decarburization
   kinetics in the Fe-Ni-C, Fe-Mn-C, and Fe-Mo-C systems.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of ferrite growth in the Fe-C-Co and Fe-C-Si systems has
   been quantified using controlled decarburization experiments. The
   Fe-C-Co system is a particularly interesting system since a large range
   of Co contents can be considered providing a suitable data set for
   examination of the composition dependence of the solute drag effect. Six
   Fe-C-Co alloys containing Co from 0.5 to 20 pct have been considered.
   Three Fe-C-Si alloys have also been considered and each has been
   transformed at three temperatures proving a suitable data set for
   examining the temperature dependence of the solute drag effect. This
   data set, along with ferrite growth data from decarburization
   experiments on an Fe-C-2Cr alloy has been used to test the ferrite
   growth model proposed in the companion article by Zurob et al. It is
   shown that this model for ferrite growth, that includes diffusional
   dissipation due to interaction between the solute and the migrating
   boundary, quantitatively captures both the temperature and composition
   dependence of the deviation of experimental ferrite growth kinetics from
   the PE and/or LENP models.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the photoluminescence spectra of silicon nanocrystals doped
   with and without phosphorus as a function of isothermal annealing time.
   Silicon nanocrystals were prepared by the implantation of 80 keV Si+
   into a 500 nm SiO2 film to an areal density of 8 x 10(16) at/cm(2). Half
   of the samples were co-implanted with P+ at 80 keV to 5 x 10(15)
   at/cm(2). The photoluminescence of the annealed samples were
   photo-excited at wavelength of 405 nm. For short anneal times, when the
   nanocrystal size distribution has a relatively small mean diameter,
   formation in the presence of phosphorus yields an increase in the
   luminescence intensity and a blue shift in the emission peak compared
   with intrinsic nanocrystals. As the mean size increases with annealing
   time, this enhancement rapidly diminishes and the peak energy shifts to
   the red. Our results indicate the donor electron generation depends
   strongly on the nanocrystal size. We also found a critical limit above
   which it allows dopant activation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The pore-size dependence of liquid diffusivity in mesopores has been
   under much debate as two opposite views have been developed. It is
   especially meaningful in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because the
   ion diffusivity in electrolyte is closely related to the cell
   performance. Using DC polarization measurements, pore-size dependence of
   ion diffusivity in DSSCs was investigated based on TiO2 thin films with
   variable average pore diameters, which were prepared from TiCl4
   post-treatments. The respective valid ranges of pore-size dependent and
   independent regimes were obtained from the trend of normalized
   diffusivities, which were separated by the transition point located at
   5-7 nm in between. In addition, we showed that DSSC fabrication
   processes, e.g., dye loading, TiCl4 post-treatment will not trigger the
   transition of diffusion behaviors. Furthermore, the unexpected drop of
   diffusivity after one TiCl4 treatment is attributed to the involvement
   of surface diffusion in untreated TiO2 matrix. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   increasing recent interest on developing a clearer understanding of what

   rationally design a microgel to deliver a specific drug at a specific
   rate in a specific physiological context. In this contribution, we
   outline these key design parameters associated with engineering
   responsive microgels for drug delivery and discuss several recent
   examples of how these principles have been applied to the synthesis of
   microgels or microgel-based composites. Overall, we suggest that in vivo
   assessment of these materials is essential to bridge the existing gap

Abstract = {{Here we report the wet-chemical synthesis of asymmetric one-dimensional
   (1D) silver nanocarrot structures that exhibit mixed twins and stacking
   fault domains along the < 111 > direction. Oriented attachment is the
   dominant mechanism for anisotropic growth. Multipolar plasmon resonances
   up to fourth order were measured by optical extinction spectroscopy and
   electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and are in agreement with
   theoretical calculations. Compared with those of symmetric 1D
   nanostructures of similar length, the dipole modes of the nanocarrots
   show a clear red shift, and the EELS maps show an asymmetric
   distribution of the resonant plasmonic fields and a compression of the
   resonance node spacing toward the tail. In addition, increasing the
   length of the nanocarrots causes an increase in the intensity and a
   steady red shift of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance peaks.
   The silver nanocarrots also show very high sensitivity to the refractive
   index of their environment (890 +/- 87 nm per refractive index unit).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To demonstrate intraocular drug delivery using a novel device
   fabricated by embedding hollow glass microneedles within a soft and
   flexible poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrate for ease of device
   insertion into the eye.
   Methods: Hollow glass microneedles (5 mm ID tips), fabricated using
   standard glass drawing techniques, were assembled into a
   photolithographically micropatterned PDMS substrate. The microneedles
   were fluidically coupled to a drug reservoir through a 300 mm
   microchannel to test for in vitro release of 6-aminoquinolone (144 Da)
   and Rose Bengal (1044 Da). Intravitreal delivery in ex vivo bovine eyes
   was also studied.
   Results: The microneedles penetrated UV-crosslinked collagen and excised
   bovine sclera without breaking or delaminating from the PDMS matrix. A
   total of 45 ng of 6-aminoquinolone and 16 mu g of Rose Bengal was
   released into buffered saline over a 20-min infusion at a delivery rate
   of 50 mu L/min. Microinjection of Rose Bengal for 8 h into ex vivo
   bovine vitreous resulted in a total mass accumulation of 0.0202 mg into
   both phases of the vitreous humor and to the uveal face of the sclera
   without clogging of the internal needle microchannel.
   Conclusions: PDMS-embedded microneedles offer an integrated method of
   drug targeting to the intraocular tissues using a less invasive and less
   painful approach when compared with macroscale hypodermic needles. The
   release rates from the microneedles were controllable on demand using a
   syringe pump and were independent of the properties of the drugs tested.
   The device demonstrated a new hybrid approach of coupling rigid
   microneedles strong enough to penetrate the tough, fibrous sclera with a
   soft and pliable PDMS substrate that could conform to the contours of
   the eye.}},

Abstract = {{The group velocity of long-range surface plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) in

   surface plasmons in ``rainbow trapping{''} systems based on plasmonic
   Bragg gratings. Compared with dielectric gratings of graded thickness on
   a single side of a metal film, the proposed structure is able to guide
   slow light with a much longer propagation distance for the same group
   index factor. Finite-difference time-domain simulation results show that
   slow LRSPPs with the group velocity of c/14.5 and the propagation
   distance of 10.4 mu m are achieved in dielectric gratings of uniform

Abstract = {{In this study, a robust current switching control of converters is
   proposed. It is proved that the controller is able to guarantee global
   current regulation, as well as the maximum voltage and current ripple,
   simultaneously. Such features make it ideal for implementing
   power-management strategies and to be used along fuel cells. The control
   scheme is shown to be robust against model uncertainty and since it is
   based on the piece-continuous model instead of average models, it is
   suitable for operation under a wide range of conditions. Moreover, its
   complexity does not increase with the number of cells. Experimental
   evidence of the advantages and features of the proposed control is
   presented in a two-cell boost converter.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-tuning nanocatalysts to enhance their catalytic activity and
   durability is crucial to commercialize proton exchange membrane fuel
   cells. The structural ordering and time evolution of ordered Pt3Fe2
   intermetallic core-shell nanocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction
   that exhibit increased mass activity (228\%) and an enhanced catalytic
   activity (155\%) compared to Pt/C has been quantified using
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. These
   catalysts were found to exhibit a static core-dynamic shell regime
   wherein, despite treating over 10 000 cycles, there is negligible
   decrease (9\%) in catalytic activity and the ordered Pt3Fe2 core
   remained virtually intact while the Pt shell suffered a continuous
   enrichment. The existence of this regime was further confirmed by X-ray
   diffraction and the compositional analyses using energy-dispersive
   spectroscopy. With atomic-scale two-dimensional (2-D) surface relaxation
   mapping, we demonstrate that the Pt atoms on the surface are slightly
   relaxed with respect to bulk. The cycled nanocatalysts were found to
   exhibit a greater surface relaxation compared to noncycled catalysts.
   With 2-D lattice strain mapping, we show that the particle was about
   -3\% strained with respect to pure Pt. While the observed enhancement in
   their activity is ascribed to such a strained lattice, our findings on
   the degradation kinetics establish that their extended catalytic
   durability is attributable to a sustained atomic order.}},

Abstract = {{A phase-sampling method has been developed to measure periodic flows at
   a high temporal resolution using conventional micro-particle image
   velocimetry (PIV). In this technique, the sampling is set such that each
   velocimetry dataset represents a unique point in phase of a periodic
   flow. The flow characteristics over a single cycle are reconstructed
   from measurements over a number of cycles, thus allowing measurement at
   a higher temporal resolution than the PIV system. The flow measurements
   were performed for AC electroosmotic flows and verified with results
   from the phase-locking technique. The temporal resolution is limited by
   the shortest camera exposure time and the time separation between laser
   pulses. The theoretical sampling resolution can be as low as 20 mu s for
   100 Hz periodic flows. A resolution of 200 mu s was obtained in the
   experiment using 40 velocimetry datasets.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a wide-band power divider/combiner configuration to
   facilitate light access and manipulation in planar nano-plasmonic
   devices. Light is incident from a standard silicon nanowire (negligible
   propagation losses) to be accessed by a nano-plasmonic circuit providing
   subwavelength confinement. The structure circumvents the inherent losses
   associated with long distance light propagation in nano-plasmonic
   splitters as coupling and splitting are performed at the same interface
   with small splitting losses. Plasmonic slot waveguides (PSWs) are
   utilized for subwavelength confinement. Two PSWs placed orthogonally to
   a silicon nanowire are utilized for the power division/combining
   functionality. The power splitter has been analyzed by the
   finite-difference time-domain numerical method. The proposed device is
   of compact size and wide-band operation. The relative displacement of
   the silicon nanowire from the PSWs is optimized. A splitting of 34\%,
   over most of the wavelength spectrum from 0.8-2.5 mu m, is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A handset antenna modeling and design technique using space mapping (SM)

   algorithms, while the fine models are high-accuracy electromagnetic

   antennas but are not as accurate as the fine model. On the other hand,
   they are computationally cheap when analyzed by the method of moments
   solvers. Detailed guidelines for building thin-wire models are provided.
   Two SM algorithms are employed: 1) implicit, input and output space
   mapping and 2) implicit and output space mapping. An internal dual-band
   patch antenna and an arm-folded planar inverted F antenna are designed
   through our approach. For comparison, direct optimizations have been
   performed in each example.}},

Abstract = {{A photonic integrated microfluidic device is demonstrated to perform
   optical excitation and forward scatter collection all on-chip in a
   planar format. Integrated on-chip optics formed a tailored beam geometry
   for optimal excitation of particles while a special design modification
   allowed for on-chip forward collection with the beam shaping
   capabilities. A notch was placed in the lens system that caused a dark
   spot on the facet of a collection waveguide while not affecting the beam
   geometry at the point of interrogation. The modified device with the
   ability to form a 10 mu m beam geometry was demonstrated to detect the
   forward scatter from blank 5 mu m diameter polystyrene beads. Free-space
   collection of side scatter signals was performed simultaneously with the
   on-chip collection and the designs demonstrated and enhanced SNR while
   the reliability of detection was determined to be appropriate for many
   applications. Excellent performance was confirmed via a false positive
   rate of 0.4\%, a missed events rate of 6.8\%, and a coincident rate of
   96.3\% as determined between simultaneously performed free-space and
   on-chip detection schemes. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The production of transuranic actinide fuels for use in current thermal
   reactors provides a useful intermediary step in closing the nuclear fuel
   cycle. Extraction of actinides reduces the longevity, radiation, and
   heat loads of spent material. The burning of transuranic (TRU) fuels in
   current reactors for a limited amount of cycles reduces the
   infrastructure demand for fast reactors and provides an effective
   synergy that can result in a reduction of as much as 95\% of spent fuel
   waste while significantly reducing the fast reactor infrastructure
   needed. This paper examines the features of actinide mixed-oxide (MOX)
   fuel, TRUMOX, in a CANDU (R)(a) nuclear reactor. The actinide
   concentrations used were based on extraction from 30-year-cooled spent
   fuel and mixed with natural uranium in 3.1 wt\% actinide MOX fuel. Full
   lattice cell modeling was performed using the WIMS-AECL code, supercell
   calculations were analyzed in DRAGON, and full-core analysis was
   executed in the RFSP two-group diffusion code. A time-average full-core
   model was produced and analyzed for reactor coefficients, reactivity
   device worth, and online fueling impacts. The standard CANDU operational
   limits were maintained throughout operations. The TRUMOX fuel design
   achieved a burnup of 29.91 MWd/kg heavy element and an actinide
   transmutation rate of 35\% for a single pass. A fully TRUMOX-fueled
   CANDU was shown to operate within acceptable limits and provided a
   viable intermediary step for burning actinides. The recycling,
   reprocessing, and reuse of spent fuels produces a much more sustainable
   and efficient nuclear fuel cycle.}},

Abstract = {{A novel networked process monitoring, fault propagation identification,
   and root cause diagnosis approach is developed in this study. First,
   process network structure is determined from prior process knowledge and
   analysis. The network model parameters including the conditional
   probability density functions of different nodes are then estimated from
   process operating data to characterize the causal relationships among
   the monitored variables. Subsequently, the Bayesian inference-based
   abnormality likelihood index is proposed to detect abnormal events in
   chemical processes. After the process fault is detected, the novel
   dynamic Bayesian probability and contribution indices are further
   developed from the transitional probabilities of monitored variables to
   identify the major faulty effect variables with significant upsets. With
   the dynamic Bayesian contribution index, the statistical inference rules
   are, thus, designed to search for the fault propagation pathways from
   the downstream backwards to the upstream process. In this way, the
   ending nodes in the identified propagation pathways can be captured as
   the root cause variables of process faults. Meanwhile, the identified
   fault propagation sequence provides an in-depth understanding as to the
   interactive effects of faults throughout the processes. The proposed
   approach is demonstrated using the illustrative continuous stirred tank
   reactor system and the Tennessee Eastman chemical process with the fault
   propagation identification results compared against those of the
   transfer entropy-based monitoring method. The results show that the
   novel networked process monitoring and diagnosis approach can accurately
   detect abnormal events, identify the fault propagation pathways, and
   diagnose the root cause variables. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Journal = {{AICHE JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2435-2453}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This work considers the problem of designing an active fault-isolation
   scheme for nonlinear process systems subject to uncertainty. The faults
   under consideration include bounded actuator faults and process
   disturbances. The key idea of the proposed method is to exploit the
   nonlinear way that faults affect the process evolution through
   supervisory feedback control. To this end, a dedicated fault-isolation
   residual and its time-varying threshold are generated for each fault by
   treating other faults as disturbances. A fault is isolated when the
   corresponding residual breaches its threshold. These residuals, however,
   may not be sensitive to faults in the operating region under nominal
   operation. To make these residuals sensitive to faults, a switching rule
   is designed to drive the process states, upon detection of a fault, to
   move toward an operating point that, for any given fault, results in the
   reduction of the effect of other faults on the evolution of the same
   process state. This idea is then generalized to sequentially operate the
   process at multiple operating points that facilitate isolation of
   different faults for the case where the residuals are not simultaneously
   sensitive to faults at a single operating point. The effectiveness of
   the proposed active fault-isolation scheme is illustrated using a
   chemical reactor example and demonstrated through application to a
   solution copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate. (c)

Abstract = {{Phase images reflect local field variations including susceptibility
   contributions and play a key role in a number of imaging applications.
   However, due to the limited dynamic range of phase values, phase
   wrapping invariably occurs at long echo times. High pass filtering and
   region-growing approaches have been common themes in the effort of
   removing phase wraps. In this article, a novel voxel-by-voxel phase
   unwrapping scheme taking advantage of short interecho spacing of
   multiecho gradient echo imaging is proposed. By removing spurious
   sources of phase variations and exploiting the special features of the
   flow-induced phase component, phase increments during adjacent echoes
   can be unveiled that exhibit no phase aliasing. This unaliased phase
   information is then used to unwrap all the phase images at all of the
   echoes. Data of 15 volunteers scanned at 3 and 1.5T were processed with
   the proposed algorithm and two other algorithms in the literature (PhUN
   and branch cut). It is shown that the proposed approach is fast and
   effective in unwrapping all the phase values even for voxels in the eyes
   and the skull, which the other algorithms failed to unwrap. Thus, in
   multiecho gradient echo imaging, the proposed algorithm has major
   potential in various applications involving phase processing. Magn Reson

Abstract = {{This paper presents a singular perturbation based method for controlling
   the dual-loop exhaust gas recirculation (DL-EGR) air-path systems on
   advanced diesel engines. A DL-EGR air-path system, consisting of a
   high-pressure loop EGR (HPL-EGR) and a low-pressure loop EGR (LPL-EGR),
   has significantly different time-scales (fast and slow) due to the
   inherent difference in the HPL-EGR's and LPL-EGR's corresponding control
   volumes. Such a feature of the DL-EGR systems makes the cooperative
   control of intake manifold gas conditions challenging. By considering
   the DL-EGR air-path system as a singularly perturbed system, a composite
   control law was devised to achieve systematic control of the air-path
   conditions including gas pressure, temperature, and oxygen fraction in
   the intake manifold. The effectiveness of the control method is
   experimentally evaluated on a medium-duty diesel engine. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Development of methodologies for the geometric characterization of

   profound influence that the edge geometry wields on virtually every
   machining response, and the evolving capability for generating tailored
   edges. This paper proposes the parametric modeling of the tool edge
   geometry through the application of free-knot B-splines that comprise
   three piecewise segments corresponding to the cutting edge profile and
   the two tool faces. The transition points that demarcate the cutting
   edge from the tool faces are objectively and robustly identified by the
   adaptive placement of the knots that minimizes the residual error from
   fitting the B-spline to the tool profile data. On identification of the
   cutting edge, the edge profile is modeled by parametric quadratics to
   yield four geometrically relevant, contour-based parameters that
   characterize both symmetric and asymmetric honed edges. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present a two-dimensional analytical solution of an orthotropic
   multilayered rectangular plate, which, in addition, has a small periodic
   structure along one in-plane direction. The two-scale asymptotic
   expansion method is first employed to develop a homogenized model of
   each individual layer in the plate. The laminated plate with homogenized
   layers is then analyzed exactly using the state-space approach. Two sets
   of approximate stresses (i.e. the homogenized model stresses and the
   zeroth-order two-scale model stresses) are presented analytically.
   Numerical examples are considered and comparison with the finite element
   simulation is made. It is shown that the two-scale model can give
   accurate predictions of the transverse normal stress even it varies
   sharply in a unit cell. It is also confirmed that the developed
   analytical solution can be used to investigate the effect of
   microstructure on the macroscopic behavior of the multilayered composite
   plate. This work presents an effort to take both advantages of the
   two-scale asymptotic expansion method and the state space method in the
   analyses of laminated composite structures with in-plane small

Abstract = {{Fabrication of hierarchical materials, with highly optimized features
   from the millimeter to the nanometer scale, is crucial for applications
   in diverse areas including biosensing, energy storage, photovoltaics,
   and tissue engineering. In the past, complex material architectures have
   been achieved using a combination of top-down and bottom-up fabrication
   approaches. A remaining challenge, however, is the rapid, inexpensive,
   and simple fabrication of such materials systems using bench-top
   prototyping methods. To address this challenge, the properties of
   hierarchically structured electrodes are developed and investigated by
   combining three bench-top techniques: top-down electrode patterning
   using vinyl masks created by a computer-aided design (CAD)-driven
   cutter, thin film micro/nanostructuring using a shrinkable polymer
   substrate, and tunable electrodeposition of conductive materials. By
   combining these methods, controllable electrode arrays are created with
   features in three distinct length scales: 40 m to 1 mm, 50 nm to 10 m,
   and 20 nm to 2 m. The electrical and electrochemical properties of these
   electrodes are analyzed and it is demonstrated that they are excellent
   candidates for next generation low-cost electrochemical and electronic

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{13-26}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) utilize sloshing fluid to absorb and
   dissipate structural vibrational energy. A prerequisite to TLD design is
   establishing a suitable model to describe the fluid response. Numerous
   fluid models have been presented in literature; each utilizes
   simplifying assumptions which make the model valid under certain flow
   conditions. TLDs are often designed with fluid depth to tank length
   ratios less than 25\%. At these depths, response characteristics change
   relatively rapidly with decreasing fluid depth, making it unlikely that
   one model is suitable over the entire range. The goal of this study is
   to determine when certain fluid models can be used.
   Three fluid models are considered: shallow water wave theory, a small
   depth multimodal model, and an intermediate depth multimodal model. The
   models are briefly presented and their basic assumptions are identified.
   A parametric shake table testing program is conducted which varies the
   fluid depth of a rectangular tank equipped with damping screens.
   Experimental time history and frequency response plots are created for
   comparison with each fluid model at several fluid depth ratios and
   excitation amplitudes. The range of validity for each model is described
   in terms of the fluid depth ratio, and the Ursell parameter. The results
   of this study will help TLD designers determine a suitable fluid model
   for dynamic analysis of a structure-TLD system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the formation of stable arches in frictional soils.
   A series of laboratory tests are performed to explore the formation of
   arches in granular materials, either cohesionless or with small apparent
   cohesion. By considering the stable soil arch as a stress-free surface,
   the analysis in the framework of continuum mechanics reveals that such
   an arch can only form in cohesive frictional materials. The shape of the
   arch mainly depends on the material's friction angle, while the critical
   width of the arch is primarily dominated by cohesion. The formation of
   stable arches in cohesionless materials is interpreted by taking into
   account the discrete nature of the material, with the failure of the
   arch being considered as buckling of particle columns. It is shown that
   the width of stable arches in cohesionless materials is generally five
   to seven times of the particle size. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Nonlinear cluster analysis techniques including Self Organizing Maps
   (SOMs), standard Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) and
   Compact Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis (Compact-NLPCA) are
   investigated for the identification of hydrologically homogeneous
   clusters of watersheds across Ontario, Canada. The results of
   classification based on catchment attributes and streamflow series of
   Ontario watersheds are compared to those of two benchmarks: the standard
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means classification based on
   recently proposed runoff signatures. The latter classified the 90
   watersheds into four homogeneous groups used as a reference
   classification to evaluate the performance of the nonlinear clustering
   techniques. The similarity index between the first largest group of the
   reference classification and the one from the NLPCA based on streamflow,
   is about 0.58. For the Compact-NLPCA the similarity is about 0.56 and
   for the SOM it is about 0.52. Furthermore, those results remain slightly
   the same when the watersheds are classified based on watershed
   attributes - suggesting that the nonlinear classification methods can be
   robust tools for the classification of ungauged watersheds prior to
   regionalization. Distinct patterns of flow regime characteristics and
   specific dominant hydrological attributes are identified in the clusters
   obtained from the nonlinear classification techniques - indicating that
   the classifications are sound from the hydrological point of view. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability of polymeric nanoparticles to promote glass bead and
   pentlandite (Pn, nickel sulfide mineral) attachment to air bubbles in
   flotation was measured as a function of the nanoparticle glass
   transition temperature using six types of nanoparticles based on
   styrene/N-butylacrylate copolymers. Nanoparticle size, surface charge
   density, and hydrophobicity were approximately constant over the series.
   The ability of the nanoparticles to promote air bubble attachment and
   perform as flotation collectors was significantly greater for softer
   nanoparticles. We propose that softer nanoparticles were more firmly
   attached to the glass beads or mineral surface because the softer
   particles had a greater glass/polymer contact areas and thus stronger
   overall adhesion. The diameters of the contact areas between polymeric
   nanoparticles and glass surfaces were estimated with the Young-Laplace
   equation for soft, liquidlike particles, whereas JKR adhesion theory !
   was applied to the harder polystyrene particles. The diameters of the
   contact areas were estimated to be more than an order of magnitude
   greater for the soft particles compared to harder polystyrene particles.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Effective electron mobilities are obtained by transport measurements on
   InAs nanowire field-effect transistors at temperatures ranging from 10
   to 200 K. The mobility increases with temperatures below similar to
   30-50 K, and then decreases with temperatures above 50 K, consistent
   with other reports. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the
   observed mobility can be explained by Coulomb scattering from ionized
   surface states at typical densities. The behaviour above 50 K is
   ascribed to the thermally activated increase in the number of
   scatterers, although nanoscale confinement also plays a role as higher
   radial subbands are populated, leading to interband scattering and a
   shift of the carrier distribution closer to the surface. Scattering rate
   calculations using finite-element simulations of the nanowire transistor
   confirm that these mechanisms are able to explain the data.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the number of output channels in pixelated positron emission
   tomography (PET) detectors is an effective way to minimize cost and
   complexity while minimizing the impact on detector performance. This
   paper compares the system performance of two multiplexing schemes by
   using both simulation and experimental studies, with respect to spatial,
   time and energy resolutions. Simulations were performed using the SPICE
   environment to investigate differences in resulting flood histograms and
   rising edge slopes. Experiments were performed using lutetium-yttrium
   oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals coupled to a SensL ArraySL-4 silicon
   photomultiplier (SiPM) connected to interchangeable circuit boards
   containing the two multiplexing schemes of interest. Three crystal
   configurations were tested: a single crystal element (3 x 3 x 20 mm(3)),
   2 x 2 array (crystal pitch: 3 x 3 x 20 mm(3)) and 6 x 6 array (crystal
   pitch: 2.1 x 2.1 x 20 mm(3)). Good agreement was found between the
   simulations and experiment results. It is found that the capacitive
   multiplexing is able to achieve an improved time resolution of good
   uniformity (average of 1.11 +/- 0.01 ns and 1.90 +/- 0.03 ns for the
   arrays, respectively) and crystal separation, compared to the resistive
   multiplexing (average of 1.95 +/- 0.03 ns and 3.33 +/- 0.10 ns). On the
   other hand, the resistive multiplexing demonstrates slightly improved
   energy resolution (11 +/- 0.1\% and 22 +/- 0.6\%, compared to 12 +/-
   0.1\% and 24 +/- 0.4\% for the capacitive array), which is believed to
   be caused by the RC circuit formed between the splitting capacitors and
   the input impedance of amplifiers. The relevancy of this work to the PET
   block detector design using SiPM arrays is also discussed, including
   light sharing, edge compression and gain variation among SiPM pixels.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental investigation of the flow perturbations
   associated with tube vibrations along the interstitial flow path are
   presented. A parallel triangular tube array consisting of seven rows and
   six columns of aluminum tubes with a pitch ratio of 1.54 was studied.
   Measurements of the interstitial flow perturbations along the flow lane
   were recorded using a hot-wire anemometer while monitoring the tube
   vibration in the longitudinal and transverse directions. A single
   flexible tube located in the third row of a rigid array was instrumented
   with pressure transducers to monitor the surface pressure variations.
   The flow perturbation amplitude and phase with respect to the tube
   vibrations were obtained at a number of locations along the flow lane in
   the array. The effects of tube vibration amplitude and frequency,
   turbulence level, location of measurements, and mean gap velocity on the
   flow perturbation amplitude and relative phase were investigated. It is
   found that the flow perturbations are most pronounced at the point of
   flow separation from the tube and decay rapidly with distance from this
   point. It appears that the time delay between tube vibration and flow
   perturbation is associated with flow separation and vorticity generation
   from the vibrating tube.}},

Title = {{On the Damping in Tube Arrays Subjected to Two-Phase Cross-Flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of
   damping in tube arrays subjected to two-phase cross-flow, mainly
   focusing on the influence of void fraction and flow regime. The model
   tube bundle had a parallel-triangular configuration, with a pitch ratio
   of 1.49. The two-phase flow loop used in this research utilized
   Refrigerant 11 as the working fluid, which better models steam-water
   than air-water mixtures in terms of vapour-liquid mass ratio as well as
   permitting phase changes due to pressure fluctuations. The void fraction
   was measured using a gamma densitometer, introducing an improvement over
   the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM). Three different damping
   measurement methodologies were implemented and compared in order to
   obtain a more reliable damping estimate: the traditionally used
   half-power bandwidth, the logarithmic decrement and an exponential
   fitting to the tube decay response. The experiments showed that the
   half-power bandwidth produces higher damping values than the other two
   methods, due to the tube frequency shifting triggered by fluctuations in
   the added mass and coupling between the tubes, which depend on void
   fraction and flow regime. The exponential fitting proved to be the more
   consistent and reliable approach to estimating damping. A dimensional
   analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship between damping
   and two-phase flow related parameters. As a result, the inclusion of
   surface tension in the form of the capillary number appears to be useful
   when combined with the two-phase component of the damping ratio
   (interfacial damping). A strong dependence of damping on flow regime was
   observed when plotting the interfacial damping versus the void fraction,
   introducing an improvement over the previous results obtained by
   normalizing the two-phase damping, which does not exhibit this behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory insufficiency is a major cause of neonatal mortality and
   long-term morbidity, especially in very low birth weight infants. Today,
   non-invasive and mechanical ventilation are commonly accepted procedures
   to provide respiratory support to newborns, but they can reach their
   limit of efficacy To overcome this technological plateau and further
   reduce mortality rates, the technology of an ``artificial placenta{''},
   which is a pumpless lung assist device connected to the umbilical
   vessels, would serve to expand the therapeutic spectrum when mechanical
   ventilation becomes inadequate to treat neonates with severe respiratory
   insufficiency.
   The first attempts to create such an artificial placenta took place more
   than 60 years ago. However, there has been a recent renaissance of this
   concept, including developments of its major components like the
   oxygenator, vascular access via umbilical vessels, flow control, as well
   as methods to achieve hemocompatibility in extracorporeal circuits. This
   paper gives a review of past and current development, animal experiments
   and human case studies of artificial placenta technology.}},

   complexities and uncertainties in a noise control system. Parameters in
   the IBP Model can be expressed as intervals, and uncertainties are
   effectively incorporated within the model solution process. The
   modelling approach is applied to a representative control measure
   selection problem for noise reduction in an urban environment. Results
   of the application indicate that useful solutions for noise control
   practices can be generated. A number of decision alternatives have been
   obtained and analyzed under different acceptable noise levels for two
   communities, and they reflect complex tradeoffs between environmental
   and economic considerations.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{16-19}},

Abstract = {{Although the interaction parameter formalism serves the needs of
   steelmakers quite well, it is thermodynamically inconsistent, because
   corresponding expressions for the activity coefficients do not satisfy
   the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Pelton and Bale amended the formalism and made
   it thermodynamically consistent. That new modified interaction parameter
   formalism preserved the expediency of original Wagner's formulae,
   because it required nothing in addition to already compiled abundant
   data on the interaction parameters. It seemed that metallurgists had
   been given a numerically straightforward and thermodynamically sound
   approach to handle solutes' activities in steels at finite
   concentrations.
   In this work, it is demonstrated that,although the Pelton-Bale
   modification undoubtedly works, there exists an infinite number of
   corrections bringing a thermodynamic consistency into Wagner's
   formalism. Such an ambiguity suggests that too much confidence should
   not be put in numerical values of activities calculated in non-dilute
   liquid iron solutions with the modified interaction parameter formalism.

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible
   for pool boiling heat transfer, a numerical solution to the capillary
   equation is used to describe bubble shape evolution. Indeed, any
   analysis of thermal transport due to nucleate pool boiling requires
   bubble frequency and volume predictions, which are intimately linked to
   bubble shape. To this end, a numerical treatment of the capillary
   equation is benchmarked to profiles measured from captured images of
   vapour bubble formations. The bubble growth is quasi-static in a
   quiescent liquid with a triple contact line fixed to the perimeter of a
   needle orifice. This investigation provides insight into the dependence
   the bubble shape evolution has on the physical mechanisms quantified in
   the Bond number with characteristic length equal to the cavity radius.

Abstract = {{When exposed to concentrated sulfuric acid, stainless steel exhibits
   unique electrochemical behavior. This behavior can be observed as an
   oscillation in open-circuit potential between the active and passive

Abstract = {{Phase-field crystal methodology is applied, for the first time, to study
   the effect of alloy composition on the clustering behavior of a

   al. to describe the dislocation-mediated nucleation and growth
   mechanisms of early clusters in binary alloys {[}Phys Rev B
   2012;86:134112]. Consistent with the experiments, we demonstrate that
   the addition of Mg to an Al-1.1Cu alloy increases the nucleation rate of
   clusters in the quenched/aged state by increasing the effective driving
   force for nucleation, enhancing the dislocation stress relaxation and
   decreasing the surface energy associated with the Cu-rich co-clusters of
   Cu-Mg. Furthermore, we show that it is thermodynamically favorable for
   small subcritical clusters to have higher affinity for Mg than larger
   post-critical Cu-rich clusters, particularly depicting a two-stage
   clustering phenomenon. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Changes in the O2 reduction activity (ORR) and structure of
   carbon-supported catalysts upon electrochemical stress testing are
   investigated. Focus is placed on two alloy catalysts of nominal Pt3Fe/C
   and Pt3Fe2/C compositions. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS)
   spot and line analyses reveal a dependence of the Fe composition on the
   particle size, particularly for the two as-prepared catalysts. The
   catalyst particles are shown to have a Pt-enriched shell and a PtxFey
   alloy core. Larger (>approximate to 10nm) particles are shown to have a
   higher Fe content that approaches the nominal composition, which
   suggests that the smaller (<approximate to 6nm) Pt catalyst particles
   are more difficult to alloy. High-angle annular dark-field scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), XRD, and SEM with EDXS
   show that Fe is lost gradually from the catalyst particles as a result
   of extensive potential (E)-cycling. Changes upon E-cycling are observed
   most clearly for the small (<3nm) particles, in which Fe is almost
   entirely depleted. However, the catalytic ORR activities remain constant
   over an extensive cycling period for the PtxFey/C catalysts and the mass
   ORR activities decrease proportionally with Pt surface area (APt). The
   histograms before and after cycling are compared to observed changes in
   APt and are discussed in comparison to E-holding experiments. It is
   concluded that the dissolution of Pt is a strong contributor for the
   observed decrease in APt and mass ORR activity for the PtxFey/C
   catalysts. The continuous transition between Pt oxide formation and its
   reduction to Pt metal is suggested to play a major role in the
   degradation of the PtxFey/C catalysts studied in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Most conventional target tracking algorithms assume that a target can
   generate at most one measurement per scan. However, there are tracking
   problems where this assumption is not valid. For example, multiple
   detections from a target in a scan can arise due to multipath
   propagation effects as in the over-the-horizon radar (OTHR). A
   conventional multitarget tracking algorithm will fail in these
   scenarios, since it cannot handle multiple target-originated
   measurements per scan. The Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter
   (JPDAF) uses multiple measurements from a single target per scan through
   a weighted measurement-to-track association. However, its fundamental
   assumption is still one-to-one. In order to rectify this shortcoming,
   this paper proposes a new algorithm, called the Multiple-Detection Joint
   Probabilistic Data Association Filter (MD-JPDAF) for multitarget
   tracking, which is capable of handling multiple detections from targets
   per scan in the presence of clutter and missed detection. The
   multiple-detection pattern, which can account for many-to-one
   measurement set-to-track association rather than one-to-one
   measurement-to-track association, is used to generate multiple detection
   association events. The proposed algorithm exploits all the available
   information from measurements by combinatorial association of events
   that are formed to handle the possibility of multiple measurements per
   scan originating from a target. The MD-JPDAF is applied to a multitarget
   tracking scenario with an OTHR, where multiple detections occur due to
   different propagation paths as a result of scattering from different
   ionospheric layers. Experimental results show that multiple-detection
   pattern based probabilistic data association improves the state
   estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the tracking performance of the
   proposed filter is compared against the Posterior Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
   (PCRLB), which is explicitly derived for the multiple-detection scenario
   with a single target.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an optimization-based approach to the problem of
   reconstructing temperature- dependent material properties in complex
   thermo-fluid systems described by the equations for the conservation of
   mass, momentum and energy. Our goal is to estimate the temperature
   dependence of the viscosity coefficient in the momentum equation based
   on some noisy temperature measurements, where the temperature is
   governed by a separate energy equation. We show that an elegant and
   computationally efficient solution of this inverse problem is obtained
   by formulating it as a PDE-constrained optimization problem which can be
   solved with a gradient-based descent method. A key element of the
   proposed approach, the cost functional gradients are characterized by
   mathematical structure quite different than in typical problems of
   PDE-constrained optimization and are expressed in terms of integrals
   defined over the level sets of the temperature field. Advanced
   techniques of integration on manifolds are required to evaluate
   numerically such gradients, and we systematically compare three
   different methods. As a model system we consider a two-dimensional
   unsteady flow in a lid-driven cavity with heat transfer, and present a
   number of computational tests to validate our approach and illustrate
   its performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previously we presented (McNally et al., 2012) a model for the

   hundreds of nanometers long oriented parallel to the fibrils. Here we
   use high-angle annular dark-field electron tomography in the scanning
   transmission electron microscope to confirm this model and further
   elucidate the composite structure. Views of a section cut parallel to
   the fibril axes show bundles of mineral structures extending parallel to
   the fibrils and encircling them. The mineral density inside the fibrils
   is too low to be visualized in these tomographic images. A section cut
   perpendicular to the fibril axes, shows quasi-circular walls composed of
   mineral structures, wrapping around apparently empty holes marking the
   sites of fibrils. These images confirm our original model that the
   majority of mineral in bone resides outside the collagen fibrils. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of substrate bias on magnetron sputter-deposited TiN-coated
   carbide inserts were examined with a focus on the property changes that
   occur near the cutting tool edge. Sandvik SPG-422 polished carbide
   inserts were coated with TiN using substrate bias levels ranging from
   -25 to -150 V. The hardness was measured using the nano-indentation
   method and x-ray diffraction was used to measure residual stress. The
   bias strongly affected the appearance of the region 1-2 mm from the tool
   edge with defect formation, cracking, and delamination observed at the
   higher substrate bias levels. For samples deposited at bias levels of up
   to -50 V, the coating composition was not strongly affected by edge
   proximity and the hardness exhibited only a small increase with bias of
   about 3 GPa. The residual stresses were measured using the sin(2)psi
   method, and it was found that both the increasing bias level and
   proximity to the edge increased the degree of compressive stress,
   reaching -3.2 GPa at edge location of the -50 V bias sample. The
   machining performance was assessed by turning hardened 4340 steel, and
   only the samples deposited at -25 and -35 V exhibited substantial
   improved tool wear in comparison to an uncoated edge. These results
   correlated well with the appearance of the cutting tool edge and the
   measured stress levels.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, the design of reinforced masonry (RM) shear walls as a
   seismic force-resisting system (SFRS) is very conservative in terms of
   quantifying the wall's shear strength and ductility capacity. In the
   current study, eight full-scale squat RM walls were tested at McMaster
   University under quasi-static reversed cyclic loading to quantify their
   shear strength, idealized displacement ductility, drift-damage
   relationships, lateral stiffness degradation, and hysteretic damping.
   The test walls demonstrated shear-strength capacities up to 200\% of
   those predicted by the Canadian Standards Association's (CSA) masonry
   design code. In addition, the results demonstrated that the Canadian
   shear strength expression was, on average, 32 and 34\% more conservative
   than the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) and the New Zealand
   Standards (NZS) design codes for masonry, respectively. Moreover, the
   simplified modified compression field theory (SMCFT), adopted directly
   from the Canadian concrete design code, gave the most accurate
   predictions of the tested walls' shear strength compared with masonry
   code expressions. Using bilinear idealization, the wall displacement
   ductility levels were found to range from 3.8 to 9.0 with corresponding
   equivalent viscous damping ratios of 8.7-19.2\%, respectively.
   Design-oriented expressions were developed to relate the lateral
   stiffness degradation to ductility and drift levels. The wall
   drift-damage relationships were presented in fragility curve format for
   two predefined damage states. In general, the study attempts to shed
   some light on the behavior of this understudied SFRS (i.e., RM squat
   walls) to facilitate its adoption in the next generation of
   performance-based seismic design codes in North America. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{An extensive statistical analysis is conducted on experimental data to
   achieve a formula for the strength and stiffness of masonry-infilled
   frames having central openings. For this, most of the available
   experimental data were collected and categorized based on their
   confining frames and opening types. The reliability of existing
   empirical relations was investigated, in which a reduction factor was
   suggested that shows the ratio of strength or stiffness of perforated
   infill to a similar solid one. The study shows that the relation
   recommended by the literature is the most accurate, among others, to
   estimate the lateral strength and stiffness of perforated infilled
   frames. Modified formulas derived from trend analysis of collected
   experimental data were proposed to determine the mechanical properties
   of perforated infilled frames. It is also shown that the reduction
   factor of the ultimate strength of infilled frames caused by the
   presence of openings depends highly on the material of the confining
   frames ( steel or concrete), but the reduction factor of stiffness is
   not affected by the frame type. Therefore, different equations are

Abstract = {{This paper explores the long-term effects that an ageing biodiesel fuel
   blended with low sulfur diesel fuel at concentrations of 0\%, 15\%,
   50\%, 85\%, and 100\% (v/v) can have on polyethylene materials.
   Rotationally molded fuel tanks made of linear low density polyethylene
   or crosslinked polyethylene were used to appropriately mimic the storage
   environment of fuels, though the study also considered immersed polymer
   specimens as this test approach is more commonly reported on in the
   literature. The extent of oxidation for the fuels was monitored by
   determination of its peroxide value and acid number over time, with both
   values being consistently higher for blends with higher biodiesel
   content. Storage at 80 degrees C for up to 56 days resulted in
   significant oxidation of the fuel while testing up to 380 days at 23
   degrees C produced no change in peroxide or acid concentration. The
   change in mechanical properties for the polyethylenes due to fuel was
   determined by tensile testing. Comparing the tensile data to the
   oxidation species in the stored fuels revealed that noted mechanical
   losses did not correspond with higher concentration of hydroperoxides or
   acid species but rather occurred as a result of fuel absorption. No
   difference was found in this regards between the two polyethylene
   species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cathodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for
   the fabrication of thin films from aqueous solutions of crystal violet
   (CV) dyes. The films contained rod-like particles with a long axis
   oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface. The proposed deposition
   mechanism involved cataphoresis of cationic CV+ species, base generation
   in the cathodic reactions, and charge neutralization at the electrode
   surface. The assembly of rod-like particles was governed by pi-pi
   interactions of polyaromatic CV molecules. The deposition kinetics was
   studied by quartz crystal microbalance. CV dyes allowed efficient
   dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene in
   water at relatively low CV concentrations. The feasibility of cathodic
   EPD of MWCNT and graphene from aqueous suspensions, containing CV, has
   been demonstrated. The deposition yield was investigated at different CV
   concentrations and deposition voltages. The relatively high deposition
   yield of MWCNT and graphene indicated that CV is an efficient
   dispersing, charging, and film forming agent for EPD. Electron
   microscopy data showed that at low CV concentrations in MWCNT or
   graphene suspensions and low deposition voltages, the films contained
   mainly MWCNT or graphene. The increase in the CV concentration and/or
   deposition voltage resulted in enhanced co-deposition of CV. The EPD
   method developed in this investigation paves the way for the fabrication
   of advanced nanocomposites by cathodic electrodeposition. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Adaptive steganography methods tend to increase the security against
   attacks. Most of adaptive methods use LSB flipping (LSB-F) for embedding
   part of their algorithms. LSB-F is very much vulnerable against simple
   steganalysis methods but it allows the adaptive algorithms to be
   extractable at the receiver side. Use of LSB matching (LSB-M) could
   increase the security but extraction of data at the receiver is
   difficult or, in occasions, impossible. There are numerous attacks
   against LSB-M. In this paper we are proposing an adaptive algorithm
   which, unlike most adaptive methods, uses LSB-M as its embedding method.
   The proposed method uses a complexity measure based on a local
   neighborhood analysis for determination of secure locations of an image.
   Comparable adaptive methods that use LSB-M suffer from possible changes
   in the complexity of pixels when embedding is performed. The proposed
   algorithm is such that when a pixel is categorized as complex at the
   transmitter and is embedded the receiver will identify it as complex
   too, and data is correctly retrieved. Better performance of the
   algorithm is shown by obtaining higher PSNR values for the embedded
   images with respect to comparable adaptive algorithms. The security of
   the algorithm against numerous attacks is shown to be higher than LSB-M.
   Also, it is compared with a recent adaptive method and is proved to be
   advantageous for most embedding rates.}},

   Atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark field contrast reveals the
   presence of a nonuniform diffusion of Ge from the substrate into the
   strained Si thin film. On the basis of multislice calculations, a model
   is proposed to quantify the experimental contrast, showing that the Ge
   concentration in the thin film reaches about 4\% at the interface and
   decreases monotonically on a typical length scale of 10 nm. Diffusion
   occurring during the growth process itself therefore appears as a major
   factor limiting the abruptness of interfaces in the Si-Ge system.}},

Abstract = {{Platinum-nanoparticle-based catalysts are widely used in many important
   chemical processes and automobile industries. Downsizing catalyst
   nanoparticles to single atoms is highly desirable to maximize their use
   efficiency, however, very challenging. Here we report a practical
   synthesis for isolated single Pt atoms anchored to graphene nanosheet
   using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. ALD offers the
   capability of precise control of catalyst size span from single atom,
   subnanometer cluster to nanoparticle. The single-atom catalysts exhibit
   significantly improved catalytic activity (up to 10 times) over that of
   the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. X-ray absorption fine
   structure (XAFS) analyses reveal that the low-coordination and partially
   unoccupied densities of states of 5d orbital of Pt atoms are responsible
   for the excellent performance. This work is anticipated to form the
   basis for the exploration of a next generation of highly efficient
   single-atom catalysts for various applications.}},

Abstract = {{To improve susceptibility quantification, a threshold-based
   k-space/image domain iterative approach that uses geometric information
   from the susceptibility map itself as a constraint to overcome the
   ill-posed nature of the inverse filter is introduced. Simulations were
   used to study the accuracy of the method and its robustness in the
   presence of noise. In vivo data were processed and analyzed using this
   method. Both simulations and in vivo results show that most streaking
   artifacts inside the susceptibility map caused by the ill-defined
   inverse filter were suppressed by the iterative approach. In simulated
   data, the bias toward lower mean susceptibility values inside vessels
   has been shown to decrease from around 10\% to 2\% when choosing an
   appropriate threshold value for the proposed iterative method.
   Typically, three iterations are sufficient for this approach to converge
   and this process takes less than 30 s to process a 512 x 512 x 256
   dataset. This iterative method improves quantification of susceptibility
   inside vessels and reduces streaking artifacts throughout the brain for
   data collected from a single-orientation acquisition. This approach has
   been applied to vessels alone as well as to vessels and other structures
   with lower susceptibility to generate whole brain susceptibility maps
   with significantly reduced streaking artifacts. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this work, the dynamic behaviors of a complex pneumatic reducer valve
   have been studied through the pseudobond graph modeling technique. This
   modeling approach graphically describes the energy and mass flows among
   pneumatic valve components during real operational conditions. State
   equations have been derived from the pseudobond graph model and have
   been numerically solved by MATLAB-SIMULINK. To validate the accuracy of
   the model, simulation results are compared with the real data of an
   experimental setup and good agreements between them are reported. The
   main advantage of the proposed model over other conventional approaches
   such as fluid dynamics theories is that it provides a physical model
   which accurately predicts the system's dynamic responses without any
   need to run huge computer programs or establish expensive experimental
   setups.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance of multi-beam free-space optical (FSO)
   communication systems are studied through an accurate analytical
   approach which does not rely on far-field assumptions commonly used in
   the literature. A framework is presented for analytical and numerical
   performance analyses of multi-beam FSO systems employed in a diversity
   or multiplexing scheme. The performance analyses show that the far-field
   assumptions may not correctly estimate the system behavior in many
   geometrical scenarios within practical interest. The results demonstrate
   the degrading effects of diffraction and spatial correlation of
   atmospheric turbulence in the form of diversity gain reduction in
   diversity systems and crosstalk in multiplexing systems. These effects
   have been mostly neglected in the literature by applying far-field
   assumptions. Our results can thus be useful in the design of practical
   diversity or multiplexing FSO systems especially when a compact design
   is desired.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{67-70}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of electropolymerization of
   polypyrrole (PPy) films on stainless steel substrates using alizarin red
   (AR) and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt (AQ) as anionic
   dopants. The results indicate that AR offers the advantage of reduced
   electropolymerization potential. The comparison of experimental data for
   AR and AQ provides an insight into the influence of the dopant molecular
   structure on electropolymerization of PPy. The chelating properties of
   AR allow the fabrication of adherent films. Moreover, the use of AR
   allows the dispersion and charging of multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNT) and their electrochemical incorporation into the PPy films
   during electropolymerization. Scanning electron microscopy observations
   show the formation of porous films, containing MWCNT, coated with PPy.
   The composite PPy-MWCNT films offer advantages, compared to pure PPy
   films, for application in electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors
   (ES), due to higher specific capacitance (SC), improved SC retention
   with increasing film mass and lower impedance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Existing buildings consume most of our non-transportation related energy

   Improving their energy efficiency by applying energy conservation

   accounts for climate, occupancy, building operation, heating and cooling
   systems, distribution systems, envelope properties, building geometry,
   and cost of ECMs. The tools screen the complete building set for optimal
   retrofit opportunities. The methodology adopted in developing the
   computational tools includes characterization of the office building
   stock into a manageable set of archetypes; simulation of building
   operation using specific occupancy characteristics and local climate
   data; development of energy prediction models for lights, equipment,
   pumps, fans, domestic hot water, chillers, and boilers; and application

Abstract = {{In this study the concepts of reliability are used to derive blast load
   factors. First, some objective criteria are proposed for the proper
   interpretation of pressure data gathered in arena tests. These criteria
   are applied to the pressure-time histories recorded during field tests
   involving live explosive detonated in contact with the ground. Three
   major shock wavefront parameters, including peak pressure, impulse, and
   positive phase duration are calculated. Next, statistical analysis is
   performed on these metrics to estimate their probability density
   functions and goodness-of-fit tests are carried out to gauge the
   appropriateness of each estimate. Using the best-fitting distribution
   for each wavefront metric, load factors are derived on the basis of two
   approaches. The first approach employs the percentiles of the three load
   metrics, each estimated using the pertinent probability distribution.
   The second approach uses concepts of reliability and presents load
   factors for low, medium, and high level of protection. The two sets of
   load factors are compared and the limitations of each approach are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Constitutive equations for fresh mortar and fresh concrete provide the
   characterization of the mixture's flow and the quantification of the

   model for mortar and concrete that builds on previous research. It
   postulates that (a) the shear stress is the sum of three components:
   static interaction between particles, dynamic interaction between
   particles, and collision of particles; and (b) the cell is a
   representative volume of the mixture. For fresh concrete, the effects of
   particle collisions are negligible due to high concentration, and the
   equation reduces to the Bingham model. Experimental data reported in the
   literature was employed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of the
   constitutive equations. The model results are found to compare very well

Abstract = {{There are considerable data in the literature dealing with deformation
   mechanisms in AZ31 sheets. However, there is little information on the
   damage and fracture processes in this material. In this contribution,
   digital image correlation is used to follow deformation patterns

   variety of surface analysis techniques and three-dimensional x-ray
   tomography have been used to examine the relationship between
   deformation, damage initiation, and the final fracture processes. The
   results show that premature diffuse necking occurs in the tensile tests
   without transit into localized necking. Deformation twins cluster by an
   autocatalytic process to form shear bands serving as preferential sites
   for strain localization and crack initiation. Damage appears in the form
   of microcracks within the shear bands at a late stage of necking and
   lead to the final fracture. The presence and the distribution of
   second-phase particles and their distributions help accelerate the final
   fracture processes.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple detector events (MDEs) in atom probe data, which are the result
   of simultaneous field evaporation of atomic species, have been
   investigated by correlating the temporal, chemical and spatial
   information from the raw detector data. We have applied this analysis to
   the investigation of microalloyed steels containing atomic clusters of
   Nb, C and N. As the degree of clustering increases, so does the tendency
   for simultaneous field evaporation of the clustered atoms. Although
   local magnification effects cause spatial distortions thereby lowering
   the spatial resolution of these ions specifically, strong correlations
   between their time of field evaporation and their chemistry are
   observed. Highlighting simultaneously field-evaporated atomic species is
   demonstrated to be a useful way to identify and visualize preferred
   solutesolute interactions. The timechemical correlation introduced here
   is conceptually different to conventional spatial-chemical based
   analyses, but can also reflect changes in the atomic arrangements in
