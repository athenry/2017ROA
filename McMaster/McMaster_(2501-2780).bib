Abstract = {{Polypyrrole (PPy) films were deposited on stainless steel substrates by
   electropolymerization from pyrrole solutions containing 5-sulfosalicylic
   acid (SSA) as an anionic additive. The deposition yield was studied at
   galvanostatic and pulse deposition conditions. The films were
   investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The
   films prepared by pulse deposition method showed finer particle size,
   lower resistance and higher capacitance compared to the films deposited
   galvanostatically. The highest specific capacitance (SC) of 545 F g(-1)
   was obtained at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1). The films prepared by the
   pulse deposition method on stainless steel substrates are promising
   electrode materials for application in electrochemical supercapacitors
   (ES). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   demonstrate the principle of atomic resolution coordination mapping.
   Analysis of the Co-L-2,L-3 and the Fe-L-2,L-3 edges shows small

   Co/Fe in tetrahedral or in octahedral coordination. Using internal

Abstract = {{We propose a surface plasmon polarization-controlled beam splitter based
   on plasmonic slot waveguides (PSWs). It couples light of different
   polarizations from a silicon nanowire into multilevel plasmonic
   networks. Two orthogonal PSWs are utilized as the guiding waveguides for
   each polarization. The proposed structure overcomes inherent
   polarization limitation in plasmonic structures by providing multilevel
   optical signal processing. This ability of controlling polarization can
   be exploited to achieve 3-D multilevel plasmonic circuits and
   polarization controlled chip to chip channel. Our device is of a compact
   size and a wide band operation. The device utilizes both quasi-TE and
   quasi-TM polarizations to allow for increased optical processing
   capability. The crosstalk is minimal between the two polarizations
   propagating in two different levels. We achieve good transmission
   efficiency at a wavelength of 1.55 mu m for different polarizations. We
   analyze and simulate the structure using the FDTD method. The proposed
   device can be utilized in integrated chips for optical signal processing
   and optical computations. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{536}},
Pages = {{41-46}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Fictive temperature of a glass, T-f(H) is determined by matching the C-p
   dT integrals in a single DSC heating scan (method I), a method also
   useful for determining the fictive temperature T-f(sigma) by matching
   the C-p dln T integrals. But for quench-formed glasses, the heating scan
   contains a broad minimum that prevents one from determining T-f(H) and
   T-f(sigma) by method I. Therefore, an additional heating scan is used
   for the purpose (method II). For some quench-formed glasses, method II
   has yielded T-f(sigma) considerably different from T-f(H,) causing
   concerns on the use of the method and on the conclusions on the entropy
   of glass. To resolve it, we use method II to determine T-f(H) and
   T-f(sigma) of normally formed and annealed glasses of acetaminophen,
   carbamazepine and griseofulvin, and find that both the T-f(H) and
   T-f(sigma) values are identical to the values obtained by using method
   I. This confirms that the entropy production on the liquid-glass path is
   too small to affect the residual entropy of glass. Contribution from
   dynamically heterogeneous, beta or JG relaxation is not observed for
   these low-energy glasses. The difference between T-f(H) and T-f(sigma)
   previously observed for quench-formed glasses is due to data errors
   and/or extrapolation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of operating temperature on performance and aging of Zebra
   cells was investigated. The cells were cycled at 260 degrees C and 350
   degrees C using a modified charging regime to accelerate damage. The
   cathode and solid electrolyte of degraded cells at the end of cycling
   were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive
   spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. It is hypothesized that the
   formation of AlF3 on the surface of the beta `' alumina electrolyte
   contributes to the failure of cells at low temperatures. A mechanism
   based on the overcharge reaction is proposed for the formation of this
   phase. At 350 degrees C, a significant capacity loss was observed with
   cycle life, which correlates to nickel particle growth as the cause of
   this phenomenon. The factors responsible for Ni grain growth are
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{GaAs nanowires were passivated by AlInP shells grown by the Au-assisted

Abstract = {{The microstructure of magnesium alloys usually presents a sixfold
   symmetry that is not amenable to the usual characterization of fourfold
   symmetric alloys. A more systematic and quantitative description can be
   achieved through Fourier analysis of the spatial distribution of the
   microstructure. Through this analysis, the microstructures obtained from
   phase-field simulations reveal self-affine regions with different
   scaling dimensions and crossover regions between them. The time
   evolution of these spatial scales and the analysis of local
   microstructural events reveal that isolated liquid pools are created
   through the merging of dendrite branches that follow the universal
   dynamics of merging predicted by Aagesen et al., and proceed to contract
   following the dynamics dictated by late stage cooling and back
   diffusion. Our results are consistent with new experiments that reveal a
   correlation between the dependence on cooling rate of the length scales
   associated with the spacing of main branches, and the distribution and
   average size of constituent phases that form during late stages of
   solidification. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Efficient Rate-Distortion Optimal Packetization of Embedded Bitstreams

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{2653-2666}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the rate-distortion (R-D) optimal packetization
   (RDOP) of embedded bitstreams into independent source packets, in order
   to limit error propagation in transmission of images over packet noisy
   channels. The input embedded stream is assumed to be an interleaving of
   K independently decodable basic streams. To form N (N < K) independent
   source packets, the set of basic streams is partitioned into N groups.
   The streams within each group are then interleaved to generate a source
   packet. Error/erasure protection may be further applied along/across
   source packets, to produce the channel packets to be transmitted.
   The RDOP problem previously formulated by Wu et al. has the goal of
   finding the partitioning that minimizes the distortion when all source
   packets are decoded. We extend the problem formulation such that to also
   include the minimization of the expected distortion for general
   transmission scenarios that may apply uneven erasure/error protection.
   Further, we show that the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm of Wu et
   al. can be extended to solve the general RDOP problem.
   The main contribution of this paper is a fast divide-and-conquer
   algorithm (D\&C) to find the globally optimal solution, under the
   assumption that all basic streams have convex R-D curves. Instrumental
   in obtaining the fast solution is our result which proves that the
   problem can be formulated as a series of matrix search problems in
   totally monotone matrices. The proposed D\&C reduces the running time
   from O(K-2 LN) where L is the size of each packet achieved by the DP
   solution to O(N K L log K). Experiments on SPIHT coded images
   demonstrate that the speedup is significant in practice.}},

Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{To maintain the effectiveness of a storm-water detention/retention pond,
   the sediments accumulating at the bottom the pond must be periodically
   removed and treated for ultimate disposal. The required pond clean-outs
   may be executed during the winter months to minimize the impact on the
   pond's operation and the recreational use of surrounding areas. However,
   the difference in trace element concentrations of storm-water sediments
   between the winter and summer months has not been fully investigated
   because most earlier studies focused on the summer season and sediment
   samples were seldom collected during the winter months. In this study,
   sediment samples were deliberately collected during both the winter and
   summer seasons at the same location. Neutron activation analysis (NAA)
   and prompt gamma ray techniques were used to determine the trace element
   concentration in the sediment samples, while a laser diffraction
   particle size analyzer and an optical microscope were used to analyze
   the sizes and shapes of sediment particles. The results show that the
   concentrations of Al, Na, and Cl in the winter samples are higher than
   those in the summer samples, while the concentrations of Ca and Mg in
   the summer sediment samples are higher than those in the winter sediment
   samples. The five regulated elements in both the summer and winter
   samples are higher than the Lowest Effect Level defined for sediment
   quality by the Government of Ontario, Canada. In the winter sample, the
   concentration of Cr is even higher than the Severe Effect Level. The
   concentrations of other detected elements are same level of
   concentration between the winter and summer sampled sludges.

Title = {{Determination of pressure-dependent friction coefficient from draw-bend
   test and its application to cup drawing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{69-78}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Friction under lubricated conditions is known to depend on pressure, and
   experimental determination of this dependence has typically quantified
   pressure as a uniform value over the contact area. However, non-uniform
   pressure distributions at the contact interfaces of draw-bend tests have
   been reported from various experiments and simulations. A previous study
   by the authors had evaluated the conventional methodology, which assumes
   uniform pressure distribution to estimate friction coefficients from
   draw-bend friction tests, and has concluded that the conventional
   methodology is only valid for measuring an average friction coefficient
   over the pressure range, which exists in a specific draw-bend system. In
   this paper, a new methodology to determine friction coefficients from
   draw-bend friction tests considering the pressure non-uniformity is
   suggested. In the methodology, contact pressure maps obtained from
   simulations, instead of the uniform pressure assumption, are included in
   the analysis of test data to measure the pressure dependency of friction
   coefficient. The proposed method is applied to friction measurement of
   aluminum sheets with anisotropic mill-finish surface and friction
   coefficients were obtained as functions of contact pressure, sliding
   velocity and sliding direction. Lastly, the obtained friction data were
   implemented into a finite element code, and circular cup drawing
   experiments and simulations were performed to validate the methodology.

Title = {{Flow separation on a high Reynolds number, high solidity vertical axis
   wind turbine with straight and canted blades and canted blades with
   fences}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{13-22}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The aerodynamics of a high solidity vertical axis wind turbine was
   investigated through wind tunnel tests of a full size turbine operating
   at Reynolds numbers of Re >= 500,000 (where the power production has
   been shown to be Re independent). Flow visualization using light-weight
   tufts attached to the inner surface of a blade was used to gain insight
   on the operating aerodynamics, which is related to the measured power
   performance. The tufts proved to be an effective and simple technique to
   observe the flow characteristics on the large scales involved where
   other flow measurement techniques like particle image velocimetry or
   laser Doppler velocimetry would be challenging and expensive.
   Straight blades on the H-Darrieus turbine operating at peak power showed
   large regions of flow separation on the upwind blade pass extending from
   early in the upwind pass from an azimuthal angle theta = 40-50 degrees
   (where the blade is moving directly upwind at theta = 0 degrees) to over
   60 degrees into the downwind pass. The effect of preset blade pitch was
   also investigated where a 6 degrees leading edge toe-out pitch showed a
   delay in separation initiation and a reduction in the maximum fraction
   of chord with flow reversal as well as increased power performance. The
   overall separation behaviour of the straight blades shows the importance
   of dynamic stall and the interaction of the separated vortex with the
   blade as mechanisms in lift generation.
   Performance and flow separation results are presented for canted blades.
   The flow separation behaviour was considerably different from straight
   blades, with canted blades experiencing less flow reversal on their
   upwind pass, and recovering attached flow before theta = 180 degrees.
   The installation of fences on the canted blades increased the power and
   reduced the blade speed ratio at which peak power occurred, suggestive
   of a reduction in spanwise flow on the swept blades (so that they
   locally behave more like straight blades). However, the location and
   amount of flow separation did not trend toward that seen with the
   straight blades, but rather the fences further reduced the amount of
   separation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Approach for Complex Chemical Process Monitoring and Fault Detection}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{5506-5514}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{For complex chemical processes with multiple operating conditions and
   inherent system uncertainty, conventional multivariate process
   monitoring techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and
   independent component analysis (ICA) are ill-suited because they are
   unable to characterize shifting modes and process uncertainty. In this
   article, a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) based ICA approach is
   proposed for process monitoring and fault detection. First the hidden
   Markov model is built from measurement data to estimate dynamic mode
   sequence. Further the localized ICA models are developed to characterize
   various operating modes adaptively. HMM based state estimation is then
   used to classify the monitored samples into the corresponding modes, and
   the HMM based I-2 and SPE statistics are established for fault
   detection. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is
   demonstrated through the Tennessee Eastman Chemical process. The
   comparison of monitoring results shows that the proposed HMM-ICA
   approach is superior to the conventional ICA method and can achieve
   accurate detection of various types of process faults with minimized
   false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the nature of the membrane surface, the presence of
   hydroxyl radical scavengers, and temperature, on bromate formation in a
   hybrid ozonation membrane filtration reactor was studied. The presence
   of tertiary butyl alcohol, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, suppressed the
   indirect bromate formation pathway and less bromate was formed. Bromate
   formation was less with the Mn oxide coated membrane than when using the
   uncoated TiO2 membrane. As the temperature was increased, bromate
   formation was enhanced, which was attributed to faster reaction rates.
   An empirical model was developed to predict bromate formation in a
   hybrid ozone-ceramic membrane filtration system. The model takes into
   account the effects of important experimental variables including
   initial bromide concentration, inlet ozone injection mass rate, pH.
   temperature, and reaction time. The coefficients in the model were
   determined using multiple linear regression with logarithmic
   transformations. The model indicated that bromate formation was favored
   at high bromide concentration, ozone dose, pH, and temperature. Good
   correlation was achieved between the model predictions and the

Abstract = {{InAs nanowires were grown on GaAs substrates by the Au-assisted
   vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) method in a gas source molecular beam epitaxy
   (GSMBE) system. Passivation of the InAs nanowires using InP shells
   proved difficult due to the tendency for the formation of axial rather
   than core-shell structures. To circumvent this issue, AlxIn1-x or
   AlxIn1-xP shells with nominal Al composition fraction of x=0.20, 0.36,
   or 0.53 were grown by direct vapour-solid deposition on the sidewalls of
   the InAs nanowires. Characterisation by transmission electron microscopy
   revealed that the addition of Al in the shell resulted in a remarkable
   transition from the VLS to the vapour-solid growth mode with uniform
   shell thickness along the nanowire length. Possible mechanisms for this
   transition include reduced adatom diffusion, a phase change of the Au
   seed particle, and surfactant effects. The InAs-AllnP core-shell
   nanowires exhibited misfit dislocations, while the InAs-AllnAs nanowires
   with lower strain appeared to be free of dislocations. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamics simulations, disorder trapping associated with
   solidification is studied for the (100), (110), and (111) growth
   directions in the B2 NiAl ordered alloy compound. At the high interface
   velocities studied we observe pronounced disorder and defect trapping,
   i.e., the formation of antisite defects and vacancies in the crystal at
   higher than equilibrium concentrations upon rapid solidification. The
   vacancies are located primarily on the Ni sublattice and the majority of
   antisite defects are Ni atoms on the Al sublattice, while the
   concentration of Al on the Ni sublattice is negligibly small. The defect
   concentration is found to increase in an approximately linear
   relationship with increasing the interface velocity. Further there is no
   significant anisotropy in the defect concentrations for different
   interface orientations. Our results suggest that the currently available
   models of disorder trapping should be extended to include both antisite
   defects and vacancies.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a robust method for the synthesis of highly
   monodisperse microgels cross-linked with degradable covalent bonds
   offers the potential for fabricating microgels with the highly
   controllable porosities, cell interactions, and degradation half-lives
   required for biomedical applications. A microfluidic chip is designed
   that enables the on-chip mixing and emulsification of two reactive
   polymer solutions (hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized carbohydrates)
   to form monodisperse, hydrazone cross-linked microgels in the size range
   of approximate to 40-100 mu m. The device can be run continuously for at
   least 30 h without a significant drift in particle size. The resulting
   microgels have a homogeneous bulk composition and can swell and deswell
   as the solvent conditions change in predictable ways based on the
   chemistry of the reactive polymers used, thereby enabling improved
   control over both the chemistry and morphology of the resulting
   microgels relative to other reported approaches. The in situ gelation
   chemistry used facilitates rapid microgel formation within the droplets
   without requiring the use of UV light or heating to initiate
   polymerization, thus making this approach of particular potential
   utility in cell encapsulation or drug delivery (as demonstrated).}},

Abstract = {{Void growth and coalescence/linkage, which play significant roles during
   ductile fracture processes, are strongly influenced by stress
   triaxiality in a deforming solid. The stress state can be changed by
   cutting notches in a tensile sample. In the current paper, void growth
   and linkage of an artificial void array embedded in a notched model
   material was studied by X-ray computed tomography, coupled with in situ
   tensile deformation. The cross-sectional shape of the tensile specimens
   was square, and a pair of notches was cut along only one direction.
   Thus, the lateral principal stress does not have an isotropic
   distribution: the principal stress along the notch direction is
   considered to be higher. This technique allowed us to explore the entire
   process of growth and linkage events of a void array embedded in a metal
   matrix. The notch effect creates a marked acceleration in void growth,
   leading to a large reduction in the linkage strains, as compared with
   similarly fabricated unnotched samples. The standard models for
   coalescence could not provide consistent predictions of the measured
   notch effect. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the covalent
   incorporation of hyaluronic acid (HA) into conventional hydrogel and

   the uptake and release of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin
   and the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone phosphate. A 3 mg/mL
   ciprofloxacin solution (0.3\% w/v) and a 1 mg/mL dexamethasone phosphate
   solution (0.1\%) was prepared in borate buffered saline. Three hydrogel
   material samples (pHEMA; pHEMA TRIS; DMAA TRIS) were prepared with and
   without the covalent incorporation of HA of molecular weight (MW) 35 or
   132 kDa. Hydrogel discs were punched from a sheet of material with a
   uniform diameter of 5 mm. Uptake kinetics were evaluated at room
   temperature by soaking the discs for 24 h. Release kinetics were
   evaluated by placing the drug-loaded discs in saline at 34 C in a
   shaking water bath. At various time points over 6-7 days, aliquots of
   the release medium were assayed for drug amounts. The majority of the
   materials tested released sufficient drug to be clinically relevant in
   an ophthalmic application, reaching desired concentrations for
   antibiotic or anti-inflammatory activity in solution. Overall, the
   silicone-based hydrogels (pHEMA TRIS and DMAA TRIS), released lower
   amounts of drug than the conventional pHEMA material (p < 0.001).
   Materials with HA MW132 released more ciprofloxacin compared to
   materials with HA MW35 and lenses without HA (p < 0.02). Some HA-based
   materials were still releasing the drug after 6 days.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, based on Poisson point processes, two new methods for
   joint nonhomogeneous clutter background estimation and multitarget
   tracking are presented. In many scenarios, after the signal detection
   process, measurement points provided by the sensor (e.g., sonar,
   infrared sensor, radar) are not distributed uniformly in the
   surveillance region as assumed by most tracking algorithms. On the other
   hand, in order to obtain accurate results, the target tracking filter
   requires information about clutter's spatial intensity. Thus,
   nonhomogeneous clutter spatial intensity has to be estimated from the
   measurement set and the tracking filter's output. Also, in order to take
   advantage of existing tracking algorithms, it is desirable for the
   clutter estimation method to be integrated into the tracker itself.
   Nonhomogeneous Poisson point processes, whose intensity function are
   assumed to be a mixture of Gaussian functions, are used to model clutter
   points here. Based on this model, a recursive maximum likelihood (ML)
   method and an approximated Bayesian method are proposed to estimate the
   nonhomogeneous clutter spatial intensity. Both clutter estimation
   methods are integrated into the probability hypothesis density (PHD)
   filter, which itself also uses the Poisson point process assumption. The
   mean and the covariance of each Gaussian function are estimated and used
   to calculate the clutter density in the update equation of the PHD
   filter. Simulation results show that both methods are able to improve
   the performance of the PHD filter in the presence of slowly time-varying
   nonhomogeneous clutter background.}},

Abstract = {{Particle filters are used in state estimation applications because of
   their capability to solve nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems
   effectively. However, they have high computational requirements,
   especially in the case of multitarget tracking, where data association
   is the bottleneck. In order to perform data association and estimation
   together, an augmented state vector, whose dimensions depend on the
   number of targets, is typically used in particle filters. With data
   association, the computational load increases exponentially as the
   number of targets increases. In this case, parallelization is a
   possibility for achieving real-time feasibility in large-scale
   multitarget tracking applications. In the work presented here, an
   optimization-based scheduling algorithm, that is suitable for parallel
   implementation of particle filter, is presented. This proposed
   scheduling algorithm minimizes the total computation time for the
   bus-connected heterogeneous primary-secondary architecture. Further,
   this scheduler is capable of selecting the optimal number of processors
   from a large pool of secondary processors and mapping the particles
   among the selected ones. A new distributed resampling algorithm suitable
   for parallel computing is also proposed. Furthermore, a less
   communication-intensive parallel implementation of the particle filter
   without compromising tracking accuracy using an efficient load balancing
   technique, in which optimal particle migration among secondary
   processors is ensured, is presented. Simulation results demonstrate the
   tracking effectiveness of the new parallel particle filter and the
   speedup achieved using parallelization.}},

Abstract = {{Typical electrical substation equipment items are usually connected to

   the performance of different flexible conductor configurations used
   mostly in the interconnected substation items, as well as the effects of
   parameters. A set of three synthetic ground motions, which are matched
   with IEEE Standard 693 design spectrum, was created as the design input
   motions and two sample cases of interconnected equipment were considered
   to put the proposed method into practice. In order to evaluate the
   reliability of the proposed approach, two sets of real ground motions
   recorded on stiff soil were used to assess designed conductor
   configurations. The capability of the OpenSees model in simulating
   static and dynamic behavior of conductors is studied as well.}},

Abstract = {{Glucose is an ideal renewable fuel for fuel cells, because it is cheap,
   abundant in nature, and easy to produce. Conventional glucose fuel cells
   that use enzymes and microorganisms as the catalysts are limited by
   their extremely low power output and rather short durability. In the
   present work, a direct oxidation glucose fuel cell that uses an
   anion-exchange membrane and Ag/Ni foam electrodes is developed. The
   results show that this type of direct glucose fuel cell with a
   relatively cheap membrane and catalysts can produce a maximum power
   density of 2.03 mW/cm(2) at 80 degrees C. The current density and power
   density of the fuel cell were remarkably increased using the preheating
   anolyte. The high performance of the fuel cell is mainly attributed to
   the increased kinetics of both the glucose oxidation reaction and oxygen
   reduction reaction, rendered by a better electrocatalytic activity of
   Ag/Ni foam and higher operating temperature, and the transformation of
   glucose to an enediol form. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   second-order statistics of natural images, the preservation of which is
   crucial to the perceptual quality of coded images. Although being edge
   based, the codec does not explicitly code the edge geometry. To save
   bits on edge descriptions, a background layer of the image is first
   coded and transmitted, from which the decoder estimates the trajectories
   of significant edges. The edge regions are then refined by a residual
   coding technique based on edge dilation and sequential scanning in the
   edge direction. Experimental results show that the new image coding
   technique outperforms the existing ones in both objective and perceptual
   quality, particularly at low bit rates.}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics simulation was performed for a

   turbine. Two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged NavierStokes
   equations were solved for the turbine numerical model, which has a large
   stationary domain and smaller rotating subdomain connected by a sliding
   mesh interface. The simulation results were first validated against
   steady-state airfoil data. The model was then used to solve for three
   rotating blades with constant ambient flow velocity (Re?=?360,000) over
   numerous blade speed ratios. The high solidity and the associated low
   blade speed ratio and rotational speed of the turbine result in complex
   flowblade interaction mechanisms. These include dynamic stall resulting
   in vortex shedding, vortex impingement on the source blade and
   significant flow momentum extraction causing reduced power production

Abstract = {{An experimental study was carried out to investigate fluidelastic
   instability in finned tube bundles in normal and parallel triangular
   arrays. Three arrays of each geometry type were studied experimentally:
   two arrays with serrated, helically wound finned tubes of different fin
   densities, and a bare tube array with the same base diameter as the
   finned tubes. All six tube arrays studied had the same tube pitch. The
   finned tubes under consideration were commercial finned tubes typically
   used in the fossil and process industries. For the purpose of the
   present investigation, the concept of ``effective diameter{''} of a
   finned tube, as previously used to predict vortex shedding, was used to
   compare the finned tube results with other finned tube results as well
   as the existing bare tube world data. The experimental results for the
   triangular arrays show that the fin's structure strongly influences the
   fluidelastic stability of finned tube bundles and the fin pitch is
   demonstrated to reduce the difference in the stability threshold between
   the tube array geometries as the fin density increases. Overall, the
   effect of serrated fins on fluidelastic instability is very complex and
   array geometry dependent, stabilizing some arrays and destabilizing
   others. Clearly, the effect of fins cannot be accounted for by the
   simple use of an effective diameter of an equivalent bare tube. An
   earlier version of this paper appeared at the ASME 2010 FSI Conference,

Abstract = {{The use of functional nanogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) for
   effectively scavenging compounds (here, the model drug bupivacaine) is
   demonstrated using an in vitro cell-based assay. Nanogels containing
   higher loadings of acidic functional groups or more core-localized
   functional group distributions bound more bupivacaine, while nanogel
   size had no significant effect on drug binding. Increasing the dose of
   nanogel applied also facilitated more bupivacaine binding for all
   nanogel compositions tested. Binding was driven predominantly by
   acid-base interactions between the nanogels (anionic) and bupivacaine
   (cationic) at physiological pH, although both non-specific absorption
   and hydrophobic partitioning also contributed to drug scavenging.
   Nanogels exhibited minimal cytotoxicity to multiple cell types and were
   well tolerated in vivo via peritoneal injections, although larger
   nanogels caused limited splenic toxicity at higher concentrations. The
   cell-based assay described herein is found to facilitate more robust
   drug uptake measurements for nanogels than conventional
   centrifugation-based assays, in which nanogels can be compressed (and
   thus drug released) during the measurement. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{A novel approach for high-speed measurement of surface grid line
   intersection points across multiple video frames is described. Grids are
   printed or etched onto otherwise featureless surfaces for applications
   that include 3-D surface reconstruction, sheet metal surface strain
   measurement, and others. To achieve the necessary subpixel location
   accuracy, close-range imaging is used with data collected by a
   hand-guided digital video camera mounted on a portable articulated arm
   coordinate measuring machine. Grid extraction is based on ridge
   detection in a parallelized scale space, implemented with a 480-core
   graphical processing unit (GPU). The close-range narrow-depth-of-field
   focus variations within the video sequence are intrinsically handled by
   the scale space. Ridge linking, filtering, and parabola fitting are used
   to accurately extract the grid intersection points. While
   computationally intensive, experimental implementation using the
   parallel GPU hardware has achieved sustained throughput exceeding 15
   frames per second, with more than 100 intersections extracted per frame.
   Experimental results are presented for both synthetically generated and
   actual video sequences.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the bioactivity and
   protein-resistant properties of dual functioning surfaces modified with
   PEG for protein resistance and corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) for
   anticoagulant effect. Surfaces on gold substrate were prepared with
   varying ratios of free PEG to CTI-conjugated PEG. Two methods
   designated, respectively, sequential and direct were used. For
   sequential surfaces, PEG was first immobilized on gold and the surfaces
   were incubated with CTI at varying concentration. For direct surfaces, a
   PEGCTI conjugate was synthesized and gold surfaces were modified using
   solutions of the conjugate of varying concentration. The CTI density on
   these surfaces was measured using radiolabeled CTI. Water contact angles
   were measured and the thickness of PEGCTI layers was determined by
   ellipsometry. Fibrinogen adsorption from buffer and human plasma, and
   adsorption from binary solutions of fibrinogen and a-lactalbumin were
   investigated using radiolabeling methods. Bioactivity of the surfaces
   was evaluated via their effects on FXIIa inhibition and plasma clotting
   time. It was found that as the ratio of CTI-conjugated PEG to free PEG
   increased, bioactivity increased but protein resistance was relatively
   constant. It is concluded that on these surfaces conjugation of PEG to
   CTI does not greatly compromise the protein resistance of the PEG but
   results in improved interactions between the CTI and the target protein
   FXIIa. At the same CTI density, sequential surfaces were more effective
   in terms of inhibiting FXIIa and prolonging clotting time. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The morphological microstructure, the density and dispersion of high
   angle boundaries, morphology and micro chemical composition of
   precipitates and the volume fraction of retained austenite of a
   commercial super martensitic stainless steel (SMSS) normalized and
   tempered at various temperatures were characterized by optical
   microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron backscattered
   diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) in the light of equilibrium phase diagram of the alloy
   calculated using Thermo-Calc software. The mechanical properties and
   pitting corrosion resistance were determined to correlate with
   microstructures. Two kinds of morphology of precipitate were observed in
   tempered commercial super martensitic stainless. Besides the globular Nb
   and V rich carbo-nitride precipitates, rod-like Cr rich nitrides were
   formed due to excess N content. While high density of high angle
   boundaries and precipitates contribute to strength properties, the
   dislocation softening of the matrix and retained austenite from
   tempering restore the ductility and impact toughness properties. The
   poor resistance to pitting corrosion is attributed to the occurrence of
   Cr rich precipitates. It is demonstrated that by lowering the nitrogen
   content and adding niobium, the Cr rich precipitates can be suppressed
   and the mechanical properties and resistance to pitting corrosion can be
   significantly improved. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{507-513}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic and other latency-tolerant data sources form
   a large portion of present-day backbone traffic. Traffic shaping has
   been introduced to reduce the amount of P2P traffic at the expense of
   the end-user experience. In this work, free-space optical (FSO) links
   are proposed as a means to connect internet service providers to the
   backbone to carry latency-tolerant traffic. Although FSO links are less
   reliable than fibre, they are inexpensive and able to provide high
   throughput for traffic, which is able to tolerate delay. Single and
   adaptive modulation schemes are designed with the goal of maximising the
   throughput of the FSO link over a period of time rather than maximising
   the instantaneous reliability. Real world weather and visibility data
   from a major Canadian city are used to evaluate various techniques in
   terms of throughput, availability and outage. For a fixed modulation FSO
   system, four-pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) supports a yearly average
   rate of near 1.5 Gbps for a 1 km range, whereas conventional
   on-off-keying (OOK) achieves 880 Mbps. With additional channel feedback
   data, adaptive modulation has over double the average throughput of OOK
   using four different PAM modulation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured adhesive layers were prepared by adsorbing and/or
   grafting polyvinylamine (PVAm) onto carboxylated
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels that were then assembled
   between layers of wet oxidized cellulose. The wet delamination force was
   measured as functions of PVAm content, PVAm molecular weight, coverage
   (mass adhesive/joint area), and the distribution of carboxyl groups in
   the PNIPAM microgels. The use of microgels is attractive because simple
   physical adsorption onto the cellulose surfaces before lamination gives
   much higher adhesive content and strength compared to the corresponding
   adsorbed linear PVAm. Wet adhesion increased with PVAm content in the
   microgels and the quantity of microgels in the joint whereas adhesion
   was independent of PVAm molecular weight. Physical adsorption of the
   PVAm onto/into the microgels gave the same adhesion as covalently
   coupled PVAm. Finally, the roles of microgel diameter, elasticity, and
   coverage were simulated by a simple peel adhesion model in which the
   microgels were treated as ideal springs.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the
   deposition of carbon nanotube, graphene, TiO2 and composite films. The
   method is based on the use of aluminon as an organic charging agent. It
   was found that aluminon can be used as a common dispersing and charging
   agent for different materials. Aluminon offers advantages of pH
   dependent charge, pH dependent solubility and exhibits good film forming
   properties. The film deposition from aluminon solutions was studied
   potentiodynamically and at constant voltage deposition conditions. The
   deposition yield was studied by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The
   films were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis (DTA), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The method
   allows co-deposition of different materials and control of deposit
   composition. The deposition mechanism is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Mechanism of adaptability for the nano-structured TiAlCrSiYN-based hard
   physical vapor deposition coatings under extreme frictional conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a family of hard mono-and multilayer TiAlCrSiYN-based coatings
   have been introduced that exhibit adaptive behavior under extreme
   tribological conditions (in particular during dry ultrahigh speed
   machining of hardened tool steels). The major feature of these coatings
   is the formation of the tribo-films on the friction surface which
   possess high protective ability under operating temperatures of 1000
   degrees C and above. These tribo-films are generated as a result of a
   sel-forganization process during friction. But the mechanism how these
   films affect adaptability of the hard coating is still an open question.
   The major mechanism proposed in this paper is associated with a strong
   gradient of temperatures within the layer of nano-scaled tribo-films.
   This trend was outlined by the performed thermodynamic analysis of
   friction phenomena combined with the developing of a numerical model of
   heat transfer within cutting zone based on the finite element method.
   The results of the theoretical studies show that the major
   physical-chemical processes during cutting are mostly concentrated
   within a layer of the tribo-films. This nano-tribological phenomenon
   produces beneficial heat distribution at the chip/tool interface which
   controls the tool life and wear behavior. Results of x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy studies indicate enhanced formation of protective
   sapphire-and mullite-like tribo-films on the friction surface of the
   multilayer TiAlCrSiYN/TiAlCrN coating. Comprehensive investigations of
   the structure and phase transformation within the coating layer under
   operation have been performed, using high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy, synchrotron radiation technique: x-ray absorption
   near-edge structure and XRD methods. The data obtained show that the
   tribo-films efficiently perform their thermal barrier functions
   preventing heat to penetrate into the body of coated cutting tool. Due
   to this the surface damaging process as well as non-beneficial phase
   transformation (formation of AlN hex phase) drastically diminishes
   within the layer of the adaptive coating. Micro-mechanical properties
   measurements performed at room and elevated temperatures show that the
   hardness of the multilayer TiAlCrSiYN/TiAlCrN coating appears stable to
   500 degrees C and then drops a little at 600 degrees C but still remains
   high. It means that if the surface tribo-films can reduce actual
   temperature down to this level the coating underneath is able to
   efficiently withstand heavy loads under operation. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new concept to achieve improved probe-target
   recognition has been devised by introducing a novel class of
   DNA-functionalized three-dimensional (3D), stand-free, and
   nanostructured electrodes. The gold nanofibrous electrodes were created
   using MHZ ultrafast laser material processing in air at ambient
   conditions. The developed nanofibrous DNA biosensor was characterized by
   cyclic voltammetry with the use of ferrocyanide as an electrochemical
   redox indicator. Currently, electrochemical signal enhancement which is
   of great significance for improving the sensitivity in DNA detection
   remains a great challenge. Through, enhanced surface area-to-volume
   ratio and more efficient arrangement of probe molecules on nanofibrous
   electrodes, our newly developed electrode system overcomes some of the
   sensitivity challenges of the existing systems. This nanofiber-based
   system realizes femtomolar (fM) sensitivity toward complementary target
   DNA, and demonstrates a very wide dynamic range (from 1 fM to 1 nM). (C)

   shell and InN core, respectively. The InN/InGaN core/shell nanoscale
   heterostructures exhibit a very high internal quantum efficiency of
   similar to 62\% at room temperature, which is attributed to the strong

Abstract = {{Continuous-simulation water balance models may be used to study the soil
   moisture dynamics of small urban areas. These models require as input
   many soil-texture and land-use-related parameters. Difficulties
   encountered in determining the values of these input parameters warrant
   an investigation on their relative importance. In this study, a series
   of global sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the response
   of selected outputs from a continuous-simulation soil moisture model to
   variations of specified input parameters. Using randomly generated input
   parameter values representing various site conditions, the soil moisture
   model was run with meteorological data from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
   Three output statistics, namely, average soil moisture, the standard
   deviation, and skewness of the output daily soil moisture distributions,
   were determined from each model run. Four types of sensitivity indices
   between the output statistics and the input parameters were calculated.
   Based on these sensitivity indices, it was concluded that the wilting
   and hygroscopic-point soil moisture levels and the soil moisture level
   below which plants start to endure water stress are the most important
   input parameters for all three output statistics. The relative
   importance of soil's porosity, saturated conductivity, and the runoff
   curve number of the study area becomes greater and almost reaches the
   same level as the most important parameters when the skewness of the
   output daily soil moisture distributions is the output statistic of
   interest. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000461. (C) 2012 American

   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydro gels have been designed. by
   mixing aldehyde and hydrazide-functionalizee PNIPAM oligomers with

   gel formation within seconds. The resulting hydrazone cross-links
   hydrolytically degrade over several weeks into low molecular weight
   oligomers The characteristic reversible thermoresponsive

   demonstrated. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo toxicity assays
   indicated that the hydrogel as well as the precursor well as the

Abstract = {{Titanium and its alloys are generally considered as difficult-to-machine
   materials due to their poor thermal conductivity and high strength,
   which is maintained at elevated temperatures. This paper examines the
   tool wear mechanisms involved in ultra-precision machining of titanium.
   In this study single-crystal diamond tools were used to machine
   commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Industrial
   expectations for surface quality and tool life based on optical grade
   applications are presented. Results obtained from the characterization
   of the tool, chip and workpiece led to the identification of
   graphitization as the mechanism that initiates tool wear. As the cutting
   edge rounds-off due to graphitization the rate of adhesion of the
   workpiece material onto the tool increased, which caused the quality of
   the surface finish to deteriorate. To reduce this wear mechanism a
   protective barrier made of Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) polymer, was
   explored. Tribometer studies with PFPE coated diamond tools and titanium
   pins showed a reduction in the coefficient of friction (COF). Subsequent
   machining tests using PFPE coated diamond tools showed promising results
   in extending the tool life and enhancing the surface quality to a point
   where Ti can now be considered as a viable option for applications
   involving optical grade surfaces. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the outage behavior of a decode-and-forward

   degraded by atmospheric turbulence. We assume that perfect channel side
   information (CSI) is available at the receiver side and consider both
   cases of perfect CSI and no CSI at the transmitter side. We solve the
   outage probability minimization problem subject to a peak power
   constraint as well as a short-or long-term average sum power constraint.
   As a result, optimal power control strategies are presented for
   different scenarios under consideration. A sub-optimal yet
   low-complexity solution is further proposed under the short-term power
   constraint. Our results demonstrate that multi-hop relaying yields
   significant performance improvements which are particularly important
   for long-range FSO links.}},

Volume = {{369}},

Abstract = {{Polyvinylamine (PVAm) binding (absorption and adsorption) to
   carboxylated microgels gave colloidally stable, cationic microgels that
   can be centrifuged, washed, freeze dried, and redispersed in water with
   no loss in colloidal stability. Because both PVAm and the carboxylated
   microgels are pH sensitive, changes in microgel swelling and
   electrophoretic mobility in response to pH change can be positive or
   negative depending upon pH and the PVAm content of the microgels. For a
   given PVAm molecular weight, the steady-state saturated mass fraction of
   bound PVAm in the microgels varied by a factor of four in our
   experiments. We proposed that the PVAm content at saturation was
   controlled by the relative rates of the initial attachment of PVAm
   chains versus the rate of attached chain spreading on and into the
   microgel structure. This explanation was further supported by a series
   of quartz crystal microbalance measurements.
   Finally, PVAm binding to two types of PN1PAM microgels shows general
   features recently reported for other polyelectrolyte types.
   Specifically: (1) for surface localized anionic charges on the
   microgels, the mass fraction of bound PVAm increased with PVAm molecular
   weight and vice versa; (2) in virtually all conditions, the quantity of
   adsorbed cationic ammonium groups was much greater than the carboxylate
   content of the microgel; and (3) sodium chloride additions lowered the
   mass fraction of bound PVAm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition method has been developed for the deposition
   of TiO2 nanoparticles modified with organic dyes. Alizarin red, alizarin
   yellow and pyrocatechol violet dyes were used for the dispersion and
   charging of TiO2 in ethanol and anodic electrophoretic deposition of
   TiO2 films. The deposition yield was varied by the variation of dye
   concentration in suspensions and deposition time. Aurintricarboxylic
   acid dye was used for the deposition of TiO2 from aqueous suspensions.
   It was found that thin films of pure aurintricarboxylic acid and
   composite aurintricarboxylic acid TiO2 films can be obtained. The
   deposition yield was studied by quartz crystal microbalance. Dye film
   thickness was varied in the range of 0.1-2 mu m by variation in the
   deposition time at a constant voltage. The composition of the films and
   the amount of the deposited material can be varied by the variation of
   TiO2 and dye concentration in suspensions and deposition time. The films
   were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis and electron
   microscopy. The deposition mechanisms were discussed. The

Abstract = {{A novel biodegradable material derived from thermoplastic potato starch
   was prepared with intended uses in high moisture environments where its
   high water sorption characteristics are beneficial, such as wound
   dressing, transdermal patches or food packaging. A modified composite
   was prepared for this purpose by reactive extrusion whereby potato
   starch and 2.5-25\% (w/w) sisal cellulose fibers were compounded
   together in the presence of 2.7\% (w/w) sodium trimetaphosphate. The
   fibers were included to increase the wet strength of the material. A low
   degree of substitution (0.088-0.113) was sought by bound phosphate
   groups with anionic character in order to overcome a reduction in
   moisture absorption capacity resulting from fiber incorporation, yet
   being insufficient to cause embrittlement via crosslinking. The results
   showed the approach has sufficient merit to minimize the influence of
   the hydrophobic fibers on the water absorption capacity of the starch
   material but adhering to so low of a degree of substitution could not
   fully prevent a reduction. The results also suggested that the fibers
   may have participated in the crosslinking reaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The volume of bone erosions in the metacarpophalangeal joints is a
   radiological feature that can be used to track the progression of
   rheumatoid arthritis. We introduce a hybrid segmentation algorithm that
   combines region growing and level-set segmentation algorithms to
   semiautomatically measure the volume of bone erosions in magnetic
   resonance images. A total of 40 rheumatoid arthritis patients were
   included in the study. The scans of eight patients were used for
   training, whereas the remaining 32 scans were used to determine the
   accuracy, precision, and speed of the technique. The reproducibility of
   the semiautomated technique and that of manual segmentation was defined
   in terms of intraclass correlation coefficients. Both techniques were
   equally precise with intraclass correlation coefficient values greater
   than 0.9. The hybrid algorithm was highly accurate: the least squares
   fit between the semiautomated segmentations to those manually traced by
   a musculoskeletal radiologist resulted in a slope of 1.030 with an
   x-intercept of 1.385 mm3 and an R2 value of 0.923. The semiautomated
   technique was significantly faster than manual segmentation, which took
   two to four times longer to complete. Our hybrid algorithm shows promise
   in the quantitative assessment of radiological features of rheumatoid
   arthritis in a clinical setting. Magn Reson Med, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the existence of the critical force chain length
   and the buckling of unconfined grain columns in dense granular
   materials. Tests on assemblies of flat pentagon photoelastic particles
   were first carried out to demonstrate the maximum length of force
   chains. Then, the theoretical buckling analysis and distinct element
   method (DEM) simulations for grain columns composed of mono-sized
   elliptical particles were performed. The results revealed the existence
   of critical column length, which is generally affected by the particle
   shapes, the rotational resistance at particle contact points and the end
   constraints to the grain columns. The interparticle friction does not
   have explicit effect on the critical force chain length, but it has
   significant influence on the grain column's curvature when collapse
   takes place. The thickness of shear band in granular soils can be
   determined as the critical length of grain columns by appropriately
   imposing the constraints on the boundaries, as confirmed by DEM
   simulations and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Motion estimation using multiple reference frames is widely used as the
   basis for recent video coding standards (eg. H.264/AVC) to achieve
   increased coding efficiency. However, this increases the complexity of
   the encoding process. In this paper, a new technique for efficient
   motion estimation is proposed. A combination of multiple reference frame
   selection and image residue-based mode selection is used to improve
   motion estimation time. By dynamic selection of an initial reference
   frame in advance, the number of reference frames to be considered is
   reduced. In addition, from examination of the residue between the
   current block and reconstructed blocks in preceding frames, variable
   block size mode decisions are made. Modified initial motion vector
   estimation and early stop condition detection are also adopted to speed
   up the motion estimation procedure. Experimental results compare the
   performance of the proposed algorithm with a state of the art motion
   estimation algorithm and demonstrate significantly reduced motion
   estimation time while maintaining PSNR performance.}},

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1104-1118}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The newly-emerging sparse representation-based classifier (SRC) shows
   great potential for pattern classification but lacks theoretical
   justification. This paper gives an insight into SRC and seeks reasonable
   supports for its effectiveness. SRC uses L-1-optimizer instead of
   L-0-optimizer on account of computational convenience and efficiency. We
   re-examine the role of L-1-optimizer and find that for pattern
   recognition tasks, L-1-optimizer provides more classification meaningful
   information than L-0-optimizer does. L-0-optimizer can achieve sparsity
   only, whereas L-1-optimizer can achieve closeness as well as sparsity.
   Sparsity determines a small number of nonzero representation
   coefficients, while closeness makes the nonzero representation
   coefficients concentrate on the training samples with the same class
   label as the given test sample. Thus, it is closeness that guarantees
   the effectiveness of the L-1-optimizer based SRC. Based on the closeness
   prior, we further propose two kinds of class L-1-optimizer classifiers
   (CL1C), the closeness rule based CL1C (C-CL1C) and its improved version:
   the Lasso rule based CL1C (L-CL1C). The proposed classifiers are
   evaluated on five databases and the experimental results demonstrate
   advantages of the proposed classifiers over SRC in classification
   performance and computational efficiency for large sample size problems.

Abstract = {{Vacancy-type defects created by single-energy implantation of
   Czochralski-grown single-crystal silicon by 4 MeV silicon ions at doses
   of 10(12) and 10(13) cm(-2) have been compared with those created by an
   energy chain of implants of 0.4, 0.9, 1.5, 2.2 and 4 MeV ions, each at
   one-fifth of the single-energy dose. Measurements were taken for
   as-implanted samples and after annealing to temperatures up to 600
   degrees C. In contrast to the expectation that a more uniform depth
   distribution of interstitials and vacancies would lead to a more
   efficient recombination and consequently fewer surviving vacancies,
   vacancy-related damage survived in the chain-implanted samples to higher
   temperatures, before almost complete annealing at 600 degrees C. It is
   therefore concluded that it is the absolute initial monovacancy
   concentration, rather than any initial separation of vacancy- and
   interstitial-rich regions, that determines the probability of survival
   as divacancies, and that there exists a threshold divacancy

Abstract = {{Space mapping (SM) has been used in microwave engineering for some 17
   years and demonstrated as one of the most efficient simulation-driven
   design techniques available to date. By exploiting a fast and physically
   based surrogate model, SM allows rapid optimisation of an
   electromagnetic-simulated structure of interest (fine model). Several
   variations of SM algorithms have been proposed including input, output,
   implicit and frequency SM, as well as recently introduced tuning space
   mapping (TSM). However, TSM is an invasive technique that requires
   modification to the designable structure under consideration (i.e. the
   `cutting' and inserting of the tuning ports). Here, for the first time,
   a comparative study of various SM and TSM algorithms is carried out.

Abstract = {{The local and average crystal structures and magnetic properties of the
   oxygen-deficient perovskite Sr2Fe1.5Cr0.5O5+y were studied using powder
   X-ray and neutron diffraction, neutron-pair distribution function
   analysis, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. This material
   crystallizes in the cubic Pm (3) over barm space group, with a =
   3.94491(14) angstrom. The oxygen vacancies are distributed randomly
   throughout the perovskite-type structure, and the average coordination
   number of the Fe(Cr) sites is S. Refinement of the neutron diffraction
   data indicates y similar to 0.05. This is in discordance with an earlier
   report on a material with the same nominal composition and cell
   constant. Electron energy-loss Cr L-2,L-3-edge spectroscopy shows that
   Cr3+ is Present, which is also contrary to previous speculation.
   Neutron-pair distribution function studies show that a
   brownmillerite-like model involving ordered vacancies and alternating
   octahedral and tetrahedral coordination at the metal sites, gives a
   better description of the local structure out to similar to 5 angstrom.
   A remarkable phenomenon determined by neutron diffraction in
   Sr2Fe1.5Cr0.5O5 is the occurrence of a long-range G-type
   antiferromagnetic ordering with T-c approximate to 565 K because cubic
   oxygen-deficient perovskites with B-site disorder usually do not undergo
   transitions to magnetically ordered states. The observation of
   long-range antiferromagnetic order and the T-c value are in accordance
   with previous Mossbauer spectroscopic studies.}},

Volume = {{390}},

Abstract = {{Protein-A affinity chromatography is the standard capture technique used
   for purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A major problem with
   this technique is its inability to remove monoclonal antibody aggregates
   from the monomeric form of the antibody. Moreover, the elution of mAbs
   from a protein-A column is carried out using acidic conditions which in
   turn could accelerate the formation of antibody aggregates and causes
   leaching of protein-A from its supporting media. These impurities have
   to be removed using appropriate separation methods before the mAb can be
   used for therapeutic applications. There is currently a limited
   repertoire of polishing techniques which simultaneously remove both mAb
   aggregates and protein-A. In this paper, we describe a polishing method
   based on hydrophobic interaction membrane chromatography for
   simultaneously removing these impurities. The flow-through mode was used
   whereby monomeric mAb flowed through a membrane stack while impurities
   were retained by reversible adsorption. These impurities were
   subsequently eluted by lowering the salt concentration and the membrane
   stack was thus regenerated. The operating conditions for this method
   were systematically optimized using pure mAb, aggregates, protein-A, and
   mAb/protein-A complexes. The mechanisms by which aggregates and leached
   protein-A were simultaneously removed are hypothesized. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Self-assembly from mixed dispersions of three sizes of monodisperse
   polystyrene nanoparticles, large (L), medium (M), and small (S), was
   controlled by coating each particle type with either a monofunctional or
   bifunctional polymer capable of participating in specific complexation
   reactions. The complexation reactions were (1) complexation between
   phenolic polymers and polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing polymers and
   (2) condensation of phenylboronic acid containing polymers with polyols.
   These complexation reactions function independently and can be ``turned
   off{''} independently; phenylboronic acid complexation was reversed by
   lowering the pH, whereas the interactions of phenolic copolymers with
   PEG copolymers could be reversed by adding excess PEG homopolymer. The
   specificity and reversibility of the interactions was demonstrated by
   the formation of simple binary aggregates from mixtures. The
   bifunctional copolymers were poly(vinyl phenol-co-diallyldimethyl
   ammonium chloride), Ph-DADMAC, and poly(3-acrylamide phenylboronic
   acid-co-PEG methacrylate), PBA-PEG. The monofunctional polymer was
   polyvinylalcohol, PVA. Ph-DADMAC forms complexes with PBA-PEG
   (H-bonding) and with anionic surfaces or polymers
   (electrostatic/polyelectrolyte complexation). PBA-PEG complexes with
   Ph-DADMAC (H-bonding) and with PVA (boronate ester formation). PVA does
   not interact with Ph-DADMAC; therefore, PVA coated particles do not

Abstract = {{Surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization has been widely used
   for grafting polymers from various surfaces. However, how the
   surface-constrained radicals are terminated remains to be further
   elucidated. In this work, a simple kinetic model is developed for
   surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) with
   addition of excess deactivator in solution. The model describes the
   development of polymer layer thickness, as well as the concentrations of
   radical, dormant and dead chains. A simple but accurate analytical
   solution is obtained for the polymer layer thickness as a function of
   time. The model accounts for the effects of equilibrium constant,
   activator/deactivator concentration ratio, monomer concentration,
   grafting density and rate constants of propagation and termination. The
   model is verified with the experimental data of 2-methacryloyloxythyl
   phosphorylcholine (MPC), methyl acrylate, acrylamide, and
   N-isopropylacrylamide under various conditions. In correlating thickness
   versus time experimental curves at different catalyst concentrations, it
   is clearly demonstrated that the termination of radicals on surface is
   facilitated by diffusion of catalyst species in solution. Although
   radical chains are immobilized, radical centers ``migrate{''} and
   terminate through activation and deactivation reactions. The termination
   rate constant is therefore proportional to catalyst concentration. It is
   also found that the termination is influenced by chain conformation and
   the rate constant is grafting density dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Many systems used in buildings for heating, ventilating, and
   air-conditioning waste energy because of the way they are operated or
   controlled. This paper explores the application of model predictive
   control (MPC) to air-conditioning units and demonstrates that the
   closed-loop performance and energy efficiency can be improved over
   conventional approaches. This work focuses on the problem of controlling
   the vapor compression cycle (VCC) in an air-conditioning system,
   containing refrigerant which is used to provide cooling. The VCC
   considered in this work has two manipulated variables that affect
   operation: compressor speed and the position of an electronic expansion
   valve. The system is subject to constraints, such as the range of
   permissible superheat, and also needs to regulate temperature variables
   to set points. An MPC strategy is developed for this type of system
   based on linear models identified from data obtained from a
   first-principles model of the VCC. The MPC strategy incorporates
   economic measures in the objective function as well as control
   objectives. Tests are carried out on a simulated VCC system that is
   linked to a simulation of a realistic building that is developed in the
   U.S. Department of Energy Computer Simulation Program, EnergyPlus. The
   MPC demonstrated significantly better tracking control relative to
   conventional approaches (a reduction of 70\% in terms of the integral of
   squared error for step changes in the temperature set-point), while
   reducing the VCC energy requirements by 16\%. The paper describes the
   control approach in detail and presents results from the tests. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic changes on transformations of water in MCMs of 1.4 and 1.8
   nm diameter cylindrical pores were investigated by measuring the
   specific heat, C-p,C-app, during cooling and during heating at 12 K/h
   rate in the 160-280 K range. The nature of the slow transformation was
   further investigated by measuring the dynamic specific heat by using
   temperature-modulated calorirnetry. It led us to establish whether or
   not contributions to C-p,C-app are thermally reversible. We found that a
   thermally reversible, monotonic change in C-p,C-app of water occurs in
   1.4 nm pore-MCM and a sigmoid-shape change occurs in 1.8 nm pore-MCM.
   C-p,C-app measured during cooling and during heating is found to be the
   same at T < 227 K for 1.4 nm pore-MCM, and at T < 232 K for 1.8 nm
   pore-MCM, as is the real component of the complex specific heat, C-p'.
   This shows that the sigmoid-shape change in C-p,C-app is not due to
   glass liquid transition of water in the pores. This is further confirmed
   by showing that the C-p,C-app features observed for water differ
   characteristically from the C-p,C-app features of glycerol measured at
   the same 12 K/h rate. The continuous change in C-p,C-app of water in the
   MCMs with change in T is reversible, and this indicates that water
   gradually converts to distorted ice-like structures on cooling, a
   process that is reversed on heating, until their fractional amounts
   reach a reversible equilibrium. The large sigmoid shape increase in
   C-p,C-app on heating is attributed to the latent heat, similar to that
   seen on premelting of fine grain crystals. The findings put into
   question a conclusion from neutron scattering and NMR studies that water
   in 1.8 nm pores undergoes a structural and kinetic transition at similar
   to 225 K, while remaining a liquid. Thermodynamic indication for a
   reversible low-density to high-density transition in water is not found.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrashort pulsed lasers in bone ablation show promise for many
   orthopedic applications. To minimize collateral tissue damage and
   control the ablation process, the ablation threshold fluence must be
   well characterized. Using an amplified femtoseconcl laser (170 fs, 800
   nm, 1 kHz), the ablation threshold on unaltered porcine cortical bone
   was measured using the D-2 method at multiple incident pulse numbers
   ranging from 25 to 1000 pulses per spot. The lowered threshold at
   greater pulse numbers indicated an incubation effect. Using a power law
   model, the incubation coefficient of unaltered porcine cortical bone was
   found to be 0.89 +/- 0.03. Through extrapolation, the single-pulse
   ablation threshold was found to be 3.29 +/- 0.14 J/cm(2). (c) 2012

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A phase-field model of alloy solidification is coupled to a new heat
   transfer finite element model of the laser powder deposition process.
   The robustness and accuracy of the coupled model is validated by
   studying spacing evolution under the directional solidification
   conditions in laser powder deposition of Ti-Nb alloys. Experimental
   Ti-Nb samples reveal the microstructure on a longitudinal section with
   significant change in the size of the dendrites across the sample.
   Quantitative phase-field simulations of directional solidification under
   local steady-state conditions extracted from the results of the finite
   element thermal model confirmed this behavior. Specifically, the
   phase-field simulations agree with the results of the analytical model
   of Hunt in predicting a minimum spacing value, which is due to the
   mutual effects of the increasing temperature gradient and decreasing
   solidification velocity towards the bottom of the microstructure. This
   work demonstrates the potential of coupling the phase-field method to
   complex heat transfer conditions necessary to simulate topologically
   complex microstructure morphologies present in laser powder deposition
   and other industrially relevant casting conditions. (C) 2011 Acta

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline tungsten carbide (WC) with a high surface area and
   containing minimal free carbon was synthesized via a polymer route. Its
   physical properties, including solubility in acid solution, electronic
   conductivity, and thermal stability, were thoroughly studied at two
   elevated temperatures: 95 degrees C and 200 degrees C. Compared to
   commercially available WC, this in-house synthesized WC showed lower
   solubility in acidic media at 200 degrees C, higher electronic
   conductivity (comparable to that of carbon black), as well as higher
   thermal stability. However, this material exhibited low electrochemical
   stability in acidic media when subjected to potential cycling at
   potentials larger than 0.7 V vs. RHE, due to the electrooxidation of WC.
   The major product of WC electrooxidation is WO3, which was confirmed by
   X-ray photon spectroscopy measurements. Pt was uniformly deposited on
   the high surface area WC to form a 20 wt\% of Pt supported catalyst for
   the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR mass activity was then
   obtained using the rotating disk electrode technique. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{The performance of a newly developed three dimensional (3-D) reactor
   kinetic model for CANDU reactor is evaluated in this paper. The
   evaluation is carried out in a closed-loop environment with the help of
   an existing reactor regulating system (RRS). The 3-D model is obtained
   based on a modal synthesis method, which represents the neutron flux
   distribution inside the reactor in both time and space. Throughout this
   paper, a special attention has been paid to compare the performance of
   the developed 3-D model with that of traditional coupled point kinetic
   models. The dynamic behavior of the reactor model in a practical
   load-following mode has also been examined. The accuracy of the model
   has been validated against actual plant measurements under both
   transient and steady-state conditions. Through the analysis and the
   simulation studies, it has convincingly demonstrated that the developed
   3-D model has significant advantages over traditional coupled point
   kinetic models in terms of the improved accuracy and the higher
   resolution in modeling the reactor internal dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has produced broad application of the health concept to
   regional ecosystems, including the Great Lakes. The attention is
   warranted, as new and recurring stresses on the health of the Great
   lakes undermine our understanding and hinder our ability to manage and
   restore critical ecological functions. There is widespread agreement
   that the Great Lakes are presently exhibiting symptoms of extreme stress
   and potentially irreversible and catastrophic damage. Historical command
   and control management has resulted simultaneously in environmental
   benefits to people and a loss of resilience in Great Lakes ecosystems.
   Surprising system responses often prompt further control, and the
   continued decline in resilience has been called the pathology of natural
   resource management. The pathology is also suggested to affect human
   systems of organization such as management authorities. We use published
   criteria of institutional pathologies and illustrate their occurrence in
   the Great Lakes with evidence of non-existent program evaluation,
   program incompatibility, lack of coordination among programs,
   authorities that establish and then abandon public participatory
   initiatives, and inappropriate choice of policy mechanisms or inadequate
   level of support for an appropriate mechanism (either of which creates
   disincentives for stakeholders). Learning is an element of resilience,
   as managed systems are inherently dynamic and our understanding is
   therefore always incomplete. Policy mechanisms that mimic learning
   techniques to improve understanding are therefore central to avoiding
   pathologies in management. But learning (individually or
   institutionally) can be threatening and very difficult, and its proper
   conduct necessarily involves a continuous process of feedback,
   interpretation, and reformulation. Double-loop learning processes that
   institutionalize learning in policy are recommended, as these will be
   required to overcome pathologies in management and maintain resilience
   of the Great Lakes system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of imperfections on the electrical performance of four-gate
   field-effect transistors (G4-FETs) have been studied. Variations in the
   oxide trap distribution and in the metallurgical boundary of the
   junction gates impact the low-frequency noise and the static (dc)
   performance of the G4-FET. By modeling, iterative characterization of
   published experimental data, and extensive simulations, it is shown that
   these effects originate from trap distributions in the gate oxides and
   in the depleted regions of the semiconductor channel. The proposed
   models are based on established models, such as the unified flicker
   noise model, with modifications and improvements that extend to trap
   distributions with gradients, variable frequency slope alpha of
   1/f(alpha) noise spectra, and are applicable for gate stacks with high-k
   dielectrics, such as HfO2 and HfSiON. The characterization procedures
   allowed for identifying optimum profiles of the metallurgical boundary
   of junction gates, which simultaneously improve the dc and noise
   performances of the G4-FET, such as subthreshold swing and low noise.
   The results indicate the importance of the precise control of depletion
   and conduction in the channels of multiple-gate FETs.}},

Abstract = {{A novel statistical channel model for multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) free-space optical (FSO) communication systems impaired by
   atmospheric and misalignment fading is developed. A slow-fading channel
   model is considered and the outage probability is derived as a
   performance measure. The diversity gain defined as the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) exponent at high SNR is analyzed. Interestingly in the
   presence of misalignment fading the diversity gain depends only on the
   misalignment variance and is independent of the number of transmitters M
   and receivers N. Increasing the number of transmitters and receivers
   only results in a lower probability of outage for a given SNR, however,
   the rate of change is unaffected. Contrary to this case, the diversity
   gain of MIMO FSO systems in the presence of atmospheric fading and no
   misalignment is shown to be proportional to the number of transmitters
   and receivers, in particular the product MN.}},

Abstract = {{In compressive sensing (CS), a challenge is to find a space in which the
   signal is sparse and, hence, faithfully recoverable. Since many natural
   signals such as images have locally varying statistics, the sparse space
   varies in time/spatial domain. As such, CS recovery should be conducted
   in locally adaptive signal-dependent spaces to counter the fact that the
   CS measurements are global and irrespective of signal structures. On the
   contrary, existing CS reconstruction methods use a fixed set of bases
   (e.g., wavelets, DCT, and gradient spaces) for the entirety of a signal.
   To rectify this problem, we propose a new framework for model-guided
   adaptive recovery of compressive sensing (MARX) and show how a 2-D
   piecewise autoregressive model can be integrated into the MARX framework
   to make CS recovery adaptive to spatially varying second order
   statistics of an image. In addition, MARX offers a mechanism of
   characterizing and exploiting structured sparsities of natural images,
   greatly restricting the CS solution space. Simulation results over a
   wide range of natural images show that the proposed MARX technique can
   improve the reconstruction quality of existing CS methods by 2-7 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Results of an experimental study on the bond performance of deformed

   proportioning method for RCA concrete that results in the strength to

   having the same amount of total mortar and coarse aggregate. In this
   method, the properties and volume fractions of natural aggregate and
   residual mortar in RCA are quantitatively included as part of the total
   aggregate and total mortar content of the RCA concrete. Twelve beam-end
   bond specimens were prepared and tested according to ASTM A944-99
   standard. The test variables comprised mix proportioning method, bar
   size, and aggregate type. The results showed that the bond strength
   between the reinforcing steel bars and the RCA concrete proportioned by
   the new method is comparable to their bond strength with regular
   concrete but 18\% to 33\% higher than their strength with RCA concrete
   proportioned by conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure public safety, existing bridges are often evaluated for their
   load-bearing capacity. Realistic evaluation must take into account the
   actual nonlinear stress-strain characteristics of the bridge materials
   and the interaction among its structural components at all stages of
   loading up to failure. The finite element method is particularly
   suitable for this type of analysis, but nonlinear finite element
   formulations involve many assumptions that must be verified before any
   practical application. In this study, the accuracy of a nonlinear finite
   element program developed by the authors for the analysis of composite
   steel-concrete bridges is checked by comparing its results with
   experimental data from simply supported and continuous beams tested by
   others and from a 1/3 scale multi-girder composite bridge tested by the
   authors. Good agreement is observed between the measured and the
   computed load-deflection responses and strains at all stages of loading
   up to the maximum load, which demonstrates the accuracy of the finite
   element formulation and the validity of its assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{A series of synthetic oligomers (based on the thermosensitive polymer
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and carbohydrate polymers (including
   hyaluronic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, and methylcellulose)
   were functionalized with hydrazide or aldehyde functional groups and
   mixed using a double-barreled syringe to create in situ gelling,
   hydrazone-cross-linked hydrogels. By mixing different numbers and ratios
   of different reactive oligomer or polymer precursors, covalently
   cross-linked hydrogel networks comprised of different polymeric
   components are produced by simple mixing of reactive components, without
   the need for any intermediate chemistries (e.g, grafting). In this way,
   hydrogels with defined swelling, degradation, phase transition, drug
   binding, and mechanical properties can be produced with properties
   intermediate to those of the mixture of reactive precursor polymers
   selected. When this modular mixing approach is used, one property can
   (in many cases) be selectively modified while keeping other properties
   constant, providing a highly adaptable method of engineering injectable,

   range of temperatures (40-140 degrees C) and relative humidities (RH,
   30-90\%) using both unmodified filter paper and the same paper
   impregnated with polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) as supports. Antibody
   stability decreased with increasing temperature, as expected, but also
   decreased with increasing RH. At 40 degrees C, the half-life was more
   than 10 days, with little dependence on RH. However, at 80 degrees C,
   the half-life varied from similar to 3 days at low RH to less than half
   an hour at 90\% RH, demonstrating that hydration of the antibody
   promotes unfolding. Antibody stability was not influenced by the PAE
   paper surface treatment. This work shows that antibodies are good
   candidates for development of bioactive paper as they have sufficient
   stability at high temperature to withstand printing and other
   roll-to-roll processing steps, and sufficient low temperature stability
   to allow long-term storage of bioactive paper materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, surface activated nanointegration of computational,
   electrical, optical, and mechanical structures for intelligent
   telemetry, communication, and sensing systems is described. The design
   approach and integration of top-down systems and bottom-up devices is
   considered with the need for biologically compatible bonding. For the
   simplified interface between bottom-up and top-down design a bus-bar
   unit architecture is presented. Emerging biomedical applications using
   intelligent sensors for remote patient monitoring and systems for
   rehabilitation comparing surface vs. implanted sensors are considered.
   Requirements for nanointegration of biomedical systems are suggested.
   Diverse combinations of rigid and flexible substrates of copper, gold,
   gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide and liquid crystal polymer were
   bonded by using two different nanobonding techniques. In these
   techniques, the surface cleaning with/without simultaneous deposition of
   nano-adhesion layers and contact in ultra-high vacuum/high vacuum were
   accomplished. These nanobonding technologies provide void-free, strong,
   and nanometer scale covalent bonding at room temperature or at low
   temperatures (similar to 240 degrees C), and do not require chemicals,
   adhesives, or high external pressure. A considerable electrical current
   conduction and low loss of the nanobonded laminate was observed at high
   frequency. This investigation reveals that a biocompatible, high
   performance, and miniaturized systems may be realized for intelligent,
   implantable biomedical sensors because of the strong bond, low toxicity
   and favorable electrical properties in surface activated nanobonding.

Abstract = {{Through a series of experiments conducted on three kinds of high Mn
   steels with different Nb content, including stress relaxation tests,
   physical metallurgical modeling, and observation of prior austenite
   grains and precipitates, the effect of Nb on recrystallization and
   precipitation behaviors were investigated. The results indicate the
   existence of a novel deformation temperature range for grain refinement
   resulting from complete static recrystallization (SRX) in high Mn, high
   Nb steel, whereas slow SRX kinetics can be accelerated by a finer
   initial grain size. In this deformation temperature range, the effect of
   precipitation is too weak to prohibit SRX nucleation efficiently, but
   solute drag is still large enough to slow down growth rate. As a
   consequence, shorter incubation and homogeneous recrystallized
   nucleation can be realized at relative low temperature, and the
   coarsening rate of grains is much slower because of the high solute drag
   effect in the rolling of low C high Mn, high Nb line pipe steel.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling an anaerobic digester to a microalgal culture has received
   increasing attention as an alternative process for combined bioenergy
   production and depollution. In this article, a dynamic model for
   anaerobic digestion of microalgae is developed with the aim of improving
   the management of such a coupled system. This model describes the
   dynamics of inorganic nitrogen and volatile fatty acids since both can
   lead to inhibition and therefore process instability. Three reactions
   are considered: Two hydrolysisacidogenesis steps in parallel for
   sugars/lipids and for proteins, followed by a methanogenesis step. The
   proposed model accurately reproduces experimental data for anaerobic
   digestion of the freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris with an
   organic loading rate of 1 gCOD?L-1?d-1. In particular, the
   three-reaction pathway allows to adequately represent the observed
   decoupling between biogas production and nitrogen release. The reduced
   complexity of this model makes it suitable for developing advanced,
   model-based control and monitoring strategies. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;

Abstract = {{The effect of adding N (about 0.1\% in mass) to low carbon 16Cr5Ni1Mo
   martensitic stainless steel by adding nitride ferroalloy under argon
   protective atmospheric of near normal pressure on phase transformation
   and microstructure of steels subjected to normalizing and tempering was
   investigated by using dilatometer, laser scanning confocal microscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and its
   consequence on mechanical properties was evaluated by tensile and impact
   tests. N can effectively avoid the occurrence of delta ferrite during
   solidification. N retards the kinetics of the formation of reversed
   austenite and promotes the occurrence of Cr(2)N during tempering above
   550 degrees C. The strength properties of the steel as normalized is
   enhanced by N alloying without much decrease in elongation and toughness
   due to the combined effects of N solution strengthening, suppression of
   8 ferrite and retained austenite. The slight influence of N addition on
   mechanical properties of martensitic stainless steel after tempering
   above 550 degrees C is attributed to the precipitation of coarse
   rod-like Cr(2)N and loss of coherence. While the increase in volume
   fraction of retained austenite originated from reversed austenite with
   tempering temperature contributes to the decrease in strength properties
   and increase in toughness and elongation, the retransformation of
   reversed austenite into martensite affects these properties inversely.

Abstract = {{Polyurethane (PU) was modified using isocyanate chemistry to graft
   polyethylene oxide (PEO) of various molecular weights (range 300-4600).
   An antithrombin-heparin (ATH) covalent complex was subsequently attached
   to the free PEO chain ends, which had been functionalized with
   N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) groups. Surfaces were characterized by water
   contact angle and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the
   modifications. Adsorption of fibrinogen from buffer was found to
   decrease by similar to 80\% for the PEO-modified surfaces compared to
   the unmodified PU. The surfaces with ATH attached to the distal chain
   end of the grafted PEO were equally protein resistant, and when the data
   were normalized to the ATH surface density, PEO in the lower MW range
   showed greater protein resistance. Western blots of proteins eluted from
   the surfaces after plasma contact confirmed these trends. The uptake of
   ATH on the PEO-modified surfaces was greatest for the PEO of lower MW
   (300 and 600), and antithrombin binding from plasma (an indicator of
   heparin anticoagulant activity) was highest for these same surfaces. The
   PEO-ATH- and PEO-modified surfaces also showed low platelet adhesion
   from flowing whole blood. It is concluded that for the PEO-ATH surfaces,
   PEO in the low MW range, specifically MW 600, may be optimal for
   achieving an appropriate balance between resistance to nonspecific
   protein adsorption and the ability to take up ATH and bind antithrombin
   in subsequent blood contact.}},

Abstract = {{Baseflow is an integral component of environmental flow prescriptions to
   mitigate the impacts of flow regime alteration on the ecological
   condition of rivers and often the most contentious issue in project
   planning, particularly for waterpower development. Baseflow
   prescriptions to meet ecological objectives are increasingly derived
   from a natural reference condition, often a simulated streamflow time
   series for an ungauged basin. Accuracy of baseflow estimates is
   important for identifying ecological water requirements and possible
   ecosystem and economic tradeoffs with confidence. Estimating baseflow
   time series in ungauged basins to accurately quantify a natural
   reference condition in all regions of Ontario is particularly difficult
   given the heterogeneity in landscape, climate, and size of the basins
   where simulated time series are required. To identify the optimal
   hydrologic model for baseflow simulation in all regions of Ontario, five
   variants of McMaster University-Hydrologiska Byrans
   Vattenbalansavdelning (MAC-HBV) were tested using a combination of
   possible model parameters, linear and nonlinear storage-discharge
   relationship in deep soil layers, and different criteria for optimizing
   model parameter sets. It was found that the hydrologic model which used
   a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship, a larger range of model
   parameters and included low flow criteria in the optimization procedure
   showed the best performance for baseflow estimates. The optimal model
   was then combined with a coupled regionalization method to improve
   baseflow estimates in ungauged basins compared with the original MAC-HBV
   model. This included a similar to 20\% increase in the median of Nash
   Sutcliffe efficiencies and a 50\% reduction in the volume errors for the
   tested basins. The resulting model provides a tool that can be used
   reliably throughout Ontario to simulate streamflow and baseflow time
   series in ungauged basins and to calculate baseflow indicators and
   criteria for aquatic ecosystem assessments of planned flow regime
   alterations. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear kernel Gaussian mixture model (NKGMM) based inferential
   monitoring method is proposed in this article for chemical process fault
   detection and diagnosis. Aimed at the multimode non-Gaussian process
   with within-mode nonlinearity, the developed NKGMM approach projects the
   operating data from the raw measurement space into the high-dimensional
   kernel feature space. Thus the Gaussian mixture model can be estimated
   in the feature space with each component satisfying multivariate
   Gaussianity. As a comparison, the conventional independent component
   analysis (ICA) searches for the non-Gaussian subspace with maximized
   negentropy, which is not equivalent to the multi-Gaussianity in
   multimode process. The regular Gaussian mixture model (GMM) method, on
   the other hand, assumes the Gaussianity of each cluster in the original
   data space and thus cannot effectively handle the within-mode
   nonlinearity. With the extracted kernel Gaussian components, the
   geometric distance driven inferential index is further derived to
   monitor the process operation and detect the faulty events. Moreover,
   the kernel Gaussian mixture based inferential index is decomposed into
   variable contributions for fault diagnosis. For the simulated multimode
   wastewater treatment process, the proposed NKGMM approach outperforms
   the ICA and GMM methods in early detection of process faults,
   minimization of false alarms, and isolation of faulty variables of
   nonlinear and non-Gaussian multimode processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The relationship between the mineral component of bone and associated

   electron microscopy (TEM) of cryogenically ion milled sections of
   fully-mineralized cortical bone to study the spatial and topological

   hydroxyapatite (HA) occurs largely as elongated plate-like structures
   which are external to and oriented parallel to the collagen fibrils.
   Dark field images suggest that the structures ({''}mineral
   structures{''}) are polycrystalline. They are approximately 5 nm thick,
   70 nm wide and several hundred nm long. Using energy-dispersive X-ray
   analysis we show that approximately 70\% of the HA occurs as mineral
   structures external to the fibrils. The remainder is found constrained
   to the gap zones. Comparative studies of other species suggest that this
   structural motif is ubiquitous in all vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider the problem of designing an integrated fault
   diagnosis and fault-handling framework to deal with actuator faults in
   nonlinear systems. A model-based fault diagnosis design is first
   proposed, which can not only identify the failed actuator but also
   estimate the fault magnitude. The fault information is obtained by
   estimating the outputs of the actuators and comparing them with the
   corresponding prescribed control inputs. This methodology is developed
   under state feedback control and generalized to deal with state
   estimation errors. Then the safe-parking framework developed previously
   (to handle the case where the failed actuator reverts to a known fixed
   value) for fault-tolerant control is extended to handle the case where
   an actuator seizes at an arbitrary value. The estimate of the failed
   actuator position provided by the fault diagnosis design is used to
   choose a safe-park point, at which the system operates temporarily
   during fault repair, from those generated offline for a series of design
   values of the failed actuator position. The discrepancy between the
   actual value of the failed actuator position and the corresponding
   design value is handled through the robustness of the control design.
   The efficacy of the integrated fault diagnosis and safe-parking
   framework is demonstrated through a chemical reactor example. Copyright

   contrast to gel occurrence at 70\% conversion in its corresponding batch
   operation. The polymer molecular weight and polydispersity as well as

Abstract = {{A new short flow technique combining in situ reaction and rapid

   and 2.5 wt\% TiB2) alloys. The effects of in situ reaction conditions,
   cooling rate and solute concentration on the microstructure change of
   Cu-TiB2 alloys were systematically investigated and analyzed by
   modeling. It is shown that the size and distribution of TiB2 particles
   are strongly dependent on the choice of reactor shape, in situ reaction
   conditions and solute concentration, specifically, the size and
   aggregation level of TiB2 particles tend to increase as increasing
   normal volume percent of TiB2 particles when the same in situ reaction
   condition is used. Some different in situ reaction mechanisms, based on
   the microstructure change and TiB2 particle distribution under different
   conditions, were also established and analyzed, which can be used to
   quantitatively predict the size of melt micelles needed for synthesizing
   uniformly distributed TiB2 particles with different sizes in the copper

Abstract = {{We investigate the atomic structure and the chemistry of the Si(111)/AlN
   interface for an AlN film grown at low-temperature (735 degrees C) by
   metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. A heterogeneous interface is formed
   from the alternation of crystallographically abrupt and partly amorphous
   regions. The polarity of the AlN film, along with the projected atomic
   structure of the crystalline interface, is retrieved using high-angle
   annular dark field imaging, and a model, based on these experimental
   observations, is proposed for the bonding at the interface. Electron
   energy-loss spectrum-imaging, however, also reveals a chemical
   intermixing, placing our growth conditions at the onset of SiN(x)
   interlayer formation. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Gold nanostructures, with a wide size distribution, are confined between
   a metal foil and the oxide substrate upon which they were formed. When
   heated the surface energy gradient between the oxide and foil results in
   a net migration of gold atoms from the nanostructure to the foil. With
   time, the nanostructures show a size reduction and a narrowed size
   distribution. The narrowing results from the formation of foil contact
   points with only the largest nanostructures, a characteristic which
   leaves small nanostructures intact while consuming larger ones. Also
   demonstrated is the size reduction of arrayed gold structures to
   nanoscale dimensions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Although resuscitation during pregnancy is relatively uncommon and
   rarely cause deaths they have a particularly large impact in terms of
   the mortality of the unborn child and long-term effects on families and
   society as whole. Although modelling of current density distribution and
   conductive anatomy of the human transthoracic defibrillation has been
   subject of certain research interest the attempts to model this
   phenomenon in pregnant women using 3D finite element have been
   nonexistent. In this paper, we present simplified 3D finite element
   model of a pregnant female torso and calculate current density
   distribution in the uterus. We evaluate the current density a function
   of voltage difference in order to obtain maximum allowed voltage. The
   purpose of our study therefore is to evaluate maximum possible voltage
   for a given position of electrodes which can still be considered safe
   for a fetus.}},

Abstract = {{According to Canadian Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most
   frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Our ability to potentially detect
   breast cancer in an early stage has potential of significantly
   decreasing mortality and hence is a very important issue in healthcare.
   Currently, mammography has been used widely for screening women over 50
   who are statistically more vulnerable. However it suffers from some
   limitations such as false negative and positive results, using ionizing
   radiation and patient's discomfort. Microwave imaging has been
   introduced recently to overcome drawbacks of this method. In breast
   microwave imaging the imaging system consists of an array of antennas
   which can serve both as transmitting and receiving antennas. Therefore
   it is possible to illuminate object of interest (breast) from multiple
   directions thus obtaining a full three dimensional scan whose resolution
   depends only on the number of antennas. One of the most difficult parts
   when detecting potential tumours in breasts is presence of modelling
   noise due to large amount of scattering, which severely deteriorates
   performance of estimation and detection algorithms. In this paper, we
   propose a parametric 3D model of breast microwave propagation, i.e.,
   signal measured on antennas with respect to tumours' and breast
   parameters including electromagnetic properties and geometry (our model
   includes multiple tumours with arbitrary shapes.) We illustrate the
   applicability of our results through numerical examples.}},

   mobile stations (MSs) in a wireless mesh network (WMN) by jointly
   considering the handoff management of the MSs and the resource

   formulated based on long-term proportional fairness, so that all the MSs
   in the entire WMN can receive fair average throughput, while the total
   throughput of the MSs is maximized. The optimum solution is based on the
   assumption of having global information about the channel conditions and
   mobility information of all the MSs, and cannot be easily implemented in
   a practical system. A heuristic scheme is then proposed, which allows
   each AP to allocate its resources based on local information only, and
   the hand off decisions of the MSs are based on information exchanged
   between neighboring APs. Numerical results show that performance of the
   proposed heuristic scheme is very close to the optimum in terms of both

Abstract = {{Manipulation of deformable objects is a field of research that has a
   variety of applications, including medical procedures, food industry,
   and manufacturing. This paper compares the performance of a standard PID
   controller and a robust H-infinity controller, both of which are
   designed to perform the task of indirect deformable object manipulation.
   The H-infinity controller is generated using methods outlined by Doyle
   et al., and the PID controller is tuned in a conventional trial and
   error approach. Unmodelled dynamics of the deformable object system are
   considered disturbance inputs and compensated by both controllers. Loop
   shaping is used to model the robotic actuators and position feedback
   system limitations within the process of generating the H-infinity
   controller. The H-infinity proved to be superior to the PID in both
   simulations and experiments. Maximal steady state error of the
   H-infinity controller was 0.5mm; PID maximal error was 1 mm at steady
   state. The key benefit of the H-infinity approach is that the controller
   generated using the numerical model of the deformable object performed
   well in simulations and experiments; the parameters of the PID
   controller required retuning between simulation and the experimental
   setting.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional cognitive radio networks it is usually assumed that the
   primary network remains unchanged. The onus is then placed on the
   secondary network users to make the best use of any residual radio
   capacity. In some situations however, the primary network operator may
   wish to accommodate secondary user access. This objective has motivated
   recent work which considers simple modifications at the primary user
   stations that would lead to better secondary spectrum availability. In
   this paper primary base station scheduling mechanisms are proposed which
   are designed to be friendly from a secondary network user perspective.
   We focus on packet scheduling algorithms which maximize friendliness
   when the secondary users are transmitting real-time VoIP traffic. An
   optimization problem is first formulated which can maximize friendliness
   over finite time intervals. An on-line scheduling algorithm is then
   proposed which attempts to achieve this goal. This is done by having the
   primary network temporally shape its residual capacity subject to
   satisfying its own packet deadline constraints. Simulation results are
   presented which show that our proposed scheme results in better
   secondary user real-time traffic support compared with conventional
   scheduling.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural creativity almost invariably operates within the
   constraints of functionality, structural and material engineering codes,
   as well as a variety of environmental aspects which as a rule are highly
   specific for a particular architectural project. As a result, an
   eventual public perception and an assigned social value of a particular
   piece of architecture are formed on the basis of numerous parameters
   such as individual and group psychology, existing social frame of
   reference, dominant esthetic and artistic views as well as a variety of
   utilitarian ends. All these factors are highly interactive and subjected
   to complicated geographical, demographical and historical variations,
   not to mention a broad range of individual modes of reflection. This
   paper presents an overview of the above mentioned aspects under the
   angle of psychological, social and technological factors affecting the
   creativity of a designer of environmentally integrated architecture. We
   use analogies from natural sciences (self-organization, chaos theory,
   strange attractors, etc), as well as provide some historical and
   philosophical comments. Of our particular interest are unusual and
   surrealistic architectural solutions which are often in the focus of
   public and touristic interests.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-indentation measurements have been performed on \{10-12\}<10-11>
   twin and adjacent matrix regions of deformed magnesium single crystals
   and the hardness values were analyzed by the Oliver-Pharr method.
   Although the hardness difference between the twin regions and the
   adjacent matrix was insignificantly small, the hardness values showed
   orientation dependence regardless of the twins' size and variants. This
   observation can be interrupted by texture-softening resulting from the
   lattice reorientation in the twin regions. In contrast, the experimental
   evidence for the Basinski hardening mechanism in \{10-12\}<10-11> twins,
   which is an increase in strength/hardness as a result of dislocation
   contributions within twin area, was not obtained from this experiment.
   This presentation provides framework for the discussion of the
   hardening/softening effect of \{10-12\}<10-11> twinning on the plastic
   flow in single crystalline magnesium and quantitative values for
   hardening parameters used in the crystal plasticity modeling.}},

   microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and synchrotron-based X-ray

   characteristic of Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions, respectively, was observed from
   different compositions of films, the emission intensity from samples in
   which Ce2Si2O7 nanocrystallites were formed after high temperature
   annealing was much stronger than in films where the Ce and Tb co-dopants
   were incorporated in an amorphous SiO2 host matrix. Films containing the
   cerium silicate phase also exhibited a very strong enhancement of Tb
   emission. X-ray absorption near edge structure and X-ray excited optical
   luminescence analysis at the Si L-3,L-2-, Si K-, O K-, Ce N-4-, and Ce
   M-5,M-4-edges indicated this enhancement was likely the result of a

Abstract = {{This article discusses the application of a novel model-based fault
   detection method. The method is based on the interacting multiple model
   (IMM) strategy, which makes use of a finite number of known operating
   modes. A filter is used in conjunction with the IMM in order to estimate
   the states and parameters of the system. The smooth variable structure
   filter (SVSF) is a relatively new estimation strategy, and is based on
   sliding mode concepts which introduces an inherent amount of robustness
   and stability. The combined SVSF-IMM strategy is applied on an
   electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA), which is a device used in the
   aerospace industry. Two different operating modes were created, based on
   varying degrees of friction acting on the EHA cylinder The results of
   the friction fault detection were compared with the popular Kalman
   filter (KF) based IMM strategy.}},

   posteriori sequence estimation is proposed. At each missing pixel of the
   high resolution (HR) image we consider an ensemble of candidate
   interpolation methods (interpolator). The interpolators are interpreted
   as states of a finite-state machine (FSM). Accordingly, the up-scaling
   problem is converted to the problem of estimating the optimal sequence
   of interpolators corresponding to the sequence of missing HR pixel
   positions. We derive a parameter-free probabilistic model for this FSM
   to solve the estimation problem using trellis diagrams and Viterbi
   algorithm. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm
   results sharper HR images and higher peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR)
   comparing to many algorithms in this domain.}},

Abstract = {{In multihop cellular networks, mobile users can communicate with the
   base stations via relay stations (RSs), and handoff between different
   RSs. This type of handoffs is referred to as inter-relay handoffs. In
   networks with highly mobile users, the inter-relay handoffs can occur
   very frequently. Making intelligent inter-relay handoff decisions is
   important in order to improve the network performance. In this article,
   we study the inter-relay handoff decision problem in a two-hop cellular
   network with highly mobile vehicles using a semi-Markov decision
   process. The objective is to maximize the total reward, which is defined
   by taking into consideration the transmission rate of the user's link,
   the overheads for performing inter-relay handoffs, and the moving speed
   of the user. Numerical results are shown to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the handoff decisions.}},

   quantified by atom probe tomography. Material deposited radially by a
   vapour-solid process is shown to have a significantly higher dopant

   respectively. Dopant activation is confirmed by electrical
   characterization which demonstrates an orders of magnitude increase in

Abstract = {{De-interlacing is revisited as the problem of assigning a sequence of
   interpolation methods (interpolators) to a sequence of missing pixels of
   an interlaced frame (field). With this assumption, our algorithm
   undergoes transitions from one interpolator to another as it moves from
   one missing pixel position to the next one. We assume that the next
   state depends only on the current state which implies a first-order
   Markov-chain on the sequence of interpolators. For estimation of the
   optimum sequence of interpolators our algorithm introduces a novel cost
   function and then makes use of Forward-Backward algorithm to find the
   global optimum sequence of interpolators. Simulation results prove that
   the proposed method is superior to the well-known de-interlacing
   algorithms proposed in this field.}},

   the pixels are calculated according to the radiometric distance between
   the surrounding areas of them and the pixel being interpolated. To
   calculate the weights, we need an estimate of the progressive frames.
   Therefore, we initially de-interlace frames using a simple and reliable

Abstract = {{Grassmannian quantization codebooks play a central role in a number of
   limited feedback schemes for single and multi-user MIMO communication
   systems. In practice, it is often desirable that these codebooks possess
   additional properties that facilitate their implementation, beyond the
   provision of good quantization performance. Although some good codebooks
   exist, their design tends to be a rather intricate task. The goal of
   this paper is to suggest a flexible approach to the design of
   Grassmannian codebooks based on smooth optimization algorithms for the
   Grassmannian manifold and the use of smooth penalty functions to obtain
   additional desirable properties. As one example, rank-2 codebooks with a
   nested structure and elements from a discrete alphabet are designed. In
   some numerical comparisons, codebooks designed using the proposed
   approach have better Fubini-Study distance properties than some existing
   codebooks, and provide tangible performance gains when applied to a
   simple MIMO downlink scenario with zero-forcing beam-forming,
   (PURC)-R-2, and block diagonalization signalling. Furthermore, the
   proposed approach yields codebooks that attain desirable additional
   properties without incurring a substantial degradation in performance.}},

Abstract = {{Using network coding (NC) in wireless networks can potentially improve
   the throughput and energy efficiency. On the other hand, it may result
   in longer delay because packets arriving early at the relay node have to
   wait to be network coded with other packets. In contrast, using
   traditional relaying allows the data packets to be forwarded as soon as
   possible, while its overall lower throughput (compared to that using NC)
   may result in longer average delay of the transmitted data packages.
   Opportunistic scheduling that takes advantages of both the high
   efficiency of NC and promptness of the traditional relay may help reduce
   the packet transmission delay. In this paper we propose an opportunistic
   packet scheduling scheme that allows the relay node to adaptively decide
   using one-way (traditional) or two-way (network coded) relaying, and
   analyze the average two-hop transmission delay performance. By
   considering both the buffer occupancy at the relay node and the link
   conditions to the end nodes, the proposed opportunistic scheduling
   achieves much lower average packet transmission delay, compared to pure
   one-way and pure two-way relaying. In addition, the simulation results
   verify the accuracy of the analytical model.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of fluidelastic instability forms a major limitation on
   the performance of tube and shell heat exchangers. It is believed that
   fluidelastic instability is attributed to two main mechanisms; the first
   is called the ``Damping Mechanism{''}, while the second is called the
   ``Stiffness Mechanism{''}. It is established in the literature that in
   order to model the damping controlled fluidelastic instability, a finite
   time delay between tube vibration and fluid response has to be
   introduced. Experimental investigation of the time delay between
   structural motion and the induced fluid forces is detailed in the
   present study. A parallel triangular tube array consisting of seven rows
   and six columns of aluminum tubes is built with a pitch ratio of 1.54.
   Hot-wire measurements of the interstitial flow perturbations are
   recorded while monitoring the tube vibrations in the lift and drag
   directions. Pressure transducers are installed inside the instrumented
   tubes to monitor the fluid forces. The phase lag between tube vibration
   and flow perturbation is obtained at different locations in the array.
   The effect of tube frequency, turbulence level, location of
   measurements, and mean gap velocity on the relative phase values is
   investigated. It is found that there are two well-defined regions of
   phase trends along the flow channel. It is concluded from this study
   that the time delay between tube vibration and downstream flow
   perturbation is associated with the vorticity convection downstream,
   while the time delay for upstream perturbations is associated with the
   effect of flow separation and vorticity generation which is propagated
   upstream from the vibrating tube.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical simulation of the flow-excited acoustic resonance for the
   case of two side-by-side cylinders in cross-flow is performed. One
   spacing ratio between the cylinders, T/D = 1.25, is investigated, where
   D is the diameter of the cylinders and T is the center-to-center
   distance between them. The unsteady flow field is simulated using a
   finite-volume method at a Reynolds number of 25000. This simulation is
   then coupled with a finite element simulation of the resonant sound
   field, by means of Howe's theory of aerodynamics sound, to reveal the
   details of flow-sound interaction mechanisms, including the nature and
   the locations of the aeroacoustic sources in the flow field. At the off
   resonance conditions two distinct vortex shedding frequencies are
   observed. These are associated with the wider and narrower wakes of the
   cylinders. However, when acoustic resonance is initiated the bi-stable
   flow phenomenon is eliminated and the vortex shedding from both

   before the onset of acoustic resonance. Moreover, three main
   aeroacoustic sources are observed in the wake of the two cylinders. Two
   aeroacoustic sources are located just downstream of each cylinder and
   one aeroacoustic source is located in the gap between the cylinders. The
   numerical results are compared with the experimental results presented
   in a previous investigation and favourable agreement is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Most target tracking algorithms assume that at most one measurement is
   generated by a target in a scan. However, there are tracking problems
   where this assumption is not valid. For example, multiple detections
   from a target can arise due to multipath propagation where different
   signals scattered from a target arrive at the sensor via different
   paths. With multiple target-originated measurements, most multitarget
   trackers will fail or become ineffective due to the violation of the
   one-to-one assumption. For example, the joint probabilistic data
   association (JPDA) filter is capable of using multiple measurements for
   a single target through weighted measurement-to-track association, but
   its fundamental assumption is still one-to-one. In order to rectify this
   shortcoming, we developed a new algorithm in our previous work, the
   multiple-detection probabilistic data association (MD-PDA) filter, which
   is capable of handling multiple detections from a target in a scan, in
   the presence of false alarm and probability of detection less than
   unity. In this paper, the performance of this MD-PDA filter is compared
   with the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB), which is explicitly
   derived for the multiple-detection scenario. Furthermore, experimental
   results show multiple-detection pattern based probabilistic data
   association improves the state estimation accuracy and reduces the total
   number of false tracks.}},

   the primary objectives are to reduce the simulation time and the pattern

   compensated by the advantage of real-time execution, the objective
   augments to considering hardware complexity when designing in-system

Abstract = {{In this work, the economic and environmental impact of integrating
   nuclear energy into a coal-and-gas-to-liquids process has been
   investigated. Reductions in CO2 emissions are possible because certain
   synergies can be exploited when coal, natural gas, and nuclear heat are
   used in combination, giving efficiency advantages which are unavailable
   when only a single energy source is used. Sixteen different design
   configurations are considered in this study, reflecting different design
   choices such as how to use or recycle light waste gases from the
   Fischer-Tropsch section, whether or not to integrate nuclear energy into
   the system, and also whether or not to include CO2 capture. Compared to
   a ``traditional{''} coal-and-gas-to-liquids process, the results show
   that in some configurations CO2 emitted by the process can be reduced by
   over 99\% with the use of nuclear heat by using the optional carbon
   capture and sequestration (CCS) option. However, even without CCS, the
   use of nuclear heat as a contributing energy source can reduce the CO2
   emissions per gallon of gasoline and diesel produced by 17-42\% from the
   equivalent non-nuclear-heat case. Total fossil fuel use can also be
   reduced by 12-21\% (by higher heating value) per gallon produced.}},

   past four decades, with biocompatibility as the underlying theme, is

   of adsorbed protein layers in both simple systems and real biofluids.
   Investigations on protein resistant surfaces based on surface
   modification with poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl
   phosphorylcholine) (polyMPC) have also been a major theme. Most of our
   work has been done in the context of biomaterials for use in blood
   contact and the hypothesis that blood compatibility, and
   biocompatibility in general, depends on control of protein adsorption
   has guided much of our more recent efforts. Specifically we have
   hypothesized that surfaces which prevent non-specific protein adsorption
   and promote specific adsorption of target proteins, should have improved
   biocompatibility. Blood contacting surfaces that promote fibrinolysis by
   specific adsorption of plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, or
   that prevent coagulation by adsorption of antithrombin have been
   investigated on this basis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate proof-of-principle for a low cost
   paper-based chromatographic device capable of pre-concentrating a target
   analyte by a factor of three thousand fold (assessed using confocal
   laser scanning microscopy (LSCM)). The device consists of a capture zone
   and a passive pump. The capture zone was created by immobilizing
   biotinylated microgel particles onto a selected area of filter paper.
   Due to the presence of biotin on their surface, these particles have the
   ability to specifically bind streptavidin, which was the target analyte
   selected for this study. With the incorporation of a superabsorbent
   passive pump, created using cross-linked poly(acrylic acid), partial
   sodium salt-graft-poly(ethylene oxide), the paper-based device was able
   to process a volume of dilute solution much larger than that associated
   with paper porosity. Flow through the device, including the passive
   pump, could be modeled using Darcy's law. A simple equation was also
   developed to relate the concentration in the pre-concentration device to
   the concentration in the dilute sample. This type of device can be
   useful for sample pre-concentration before analysis using other methods,
   such as mass spectrometry.}},

Abstract = {{With the ability to leak confidential information in a secret manner,
   covert channels pose a significant threat to the confidentiality of a
   system. Due to this threat, the identification of covert channel
   existence has become an important part of the evaluation of secure
   systems. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art survey discussing
   the conditions for covert channel existence found in the literature and
   we point to their inadequacy. We also examine how conditions for covert
   channel existence are handled by information theory. We propose a set of
   necessary and verifiable conditions for covert channel existence in
   systems of communicating agents. We aim to provide an improved
   understanding of covert channel communication and to build a foundation
   for developing effective and efficient mechanisms for mitigating covert
   channels in systems of communicating agents at the early stages of
   software development. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   crosscutting concerns and decomposing a system using more than one
   criterion. This paper proposes an aspect-oriented approach at the

   Based on the specification language of PFA (Product Family Algebra), we
   present a language AO-PFA (Aspect-Oriented Product Family Algebra) that
   extends the aspect-oriented paradigm to feature modeling. The language
   provides full facilities for articulating aspects, advice, and pointcuts

Abstract = {{In the electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) context,
   brain source localization (beamforming) methods often fail when the
   number of observations is small. This is particularly true when
   measuring evoked potentials, especially when the number of electrodes is
   large. Due to the nonstationarity of the EEG/MEG, an adaptive capability
   is desirable. Previous work has addressed these issues by reducing the
   adaptive degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper develops and tests a new
   multistage adaptive processing for brain source localization that has
   been previously used for radar statistical signal processing application
   with uniform linear antenna array. This processing, referred to as the
   fast fully adaptive (FFA) approach, could significantly reduce the
   required sample support and computational complexity, while still
   processing all available Do Fs. The performance improvement offered by
   the FFA approach in comparison to the fully adaptive minimum variance
   beamforming (MVB) with limited data is demonstrated by bootstrapping
   simulated data to evaluate the variability of the source location.}},

Abstract = {{Clozapine (CLZ) is uniquely effective as a treatment for medication
   resistant schizophrenia. Information regarding its mechanism of action
   may offer clues to the pathophysiology of the disease and to improved
   treatment. In this study we employ a machine learning (ML) analysis of
   P300 evoked potentials obtained from quantitative electroencephalography
   (QEEG) data to identify changes in the brain induced by CLZ treatment.
   We employ brain source localization (BSL) on the EEG signals to extract
   source waveforms from specified regions of the brain. A subset of 8
   features is selected from a large set of candidate features (consisting
   of spectral coherences between all identified source waveforms at
   multiple frequencies) that discriminate (by means of a classifier)
   between the pre- and post-treatment data for the schizophrenics (SCZ)
   most responsive to CLZ. We show these same selected features also
   discriminate between pre-treatment most responsive SCZ and healthy
   volunteers (HV), but not after treatment. Of note, these same features
   discriminate the least responsive SCZ from HV both pre- and
   post-treatment. This analysis suggests that the net beneficial effects
   of CLZ in SCZ are reflected in a normalization of P300 brain-source
   generators.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study transmission scheduling in a bidirectional
   communication link, where two end nodes are communicating with each
   other through a relay node. Each of the two end nodes injects data into
   a separate buffer at the relay node, which can either forward the data
   from one end node to the other at a given time (referred to as one-way
   relay), or simultaneously forwarding the data to both the end nodes by
   using network coding (referred to as two-way relay). An optimization
   problem is formulated to find the optimum scheduling in order to
   maximize the total transmission throughput in both communication
   directions, and a heuristic scheduling scheme is proposed to
   opportunistically take advantages of both the channel conditions between
   the two end nodes and the one-way and two-way relays. Numerical results
   show that the proposed scheme achieves high and close-to-optimum
   throughput.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel full generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)
   for signal detection in a sensor array environment. The multiple
   hypothesis test approach is well known to have excellent detection
   performance among several popular methods. Existing multiple test
   procedures consider the relation between two adjacent models. When the
   number of signals or the assumed number of signals is large, it tends to
   overestimate the number of signals. The proposed full GLRT procedure
   overcomes this disadvantage by employing complete information between
   candidate models and leads to gain in test power. A further advantage is
   that a confidence interval for the true number of signals can be
   constructed based on the outcome of the GLRT procedure. Numerical
   results show that the full GLRT procedure improves detection performance
   significantly in comparison with existing multiple test based approaches
   in challenging scenarios.}},

   build a sparse solution to an underdetermined linear system of

   Shrinkage Algorithms (ISA). ISA algorithms depend on a thresholding
   parameter, which is usually provided by the user. In this paper we
   develop a new approach for automatically estimating this thresholding
   parameter. The proposed approach is general in a sense that it does not
   assume any distribution on the entries of the dictionary matrix, nor on
   the nonzero coefficients of the solution vector. In addition, the
   proposed approach is simple and can be adapted for use with newly
   evolving ISA algorithms. Moreover, the simulation results show that
   these proposed algorithms outperform their previous counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{An effective strategy for transmitter adaptation on slow block-fading
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links is for the receiver to
   inform the transmitter of the subspace over which transmission should
   take place, and for the transmitter to allocate power uniformly over
   that subspace. The design of a feedback scheme to implement this
   strategy can be viewed as a (lossy) source compression problem on a
   Grassmannian manifold. Memoryless vector quantization on each fading
   block is one approach to that problem, but it neglects any correlation
   between blocks. In some recent work, several approaches have been
   proposed to take advantage of this correlation. In this paper we propose
   an alternative technique that leverages existing Grassmannian codebooks
   from memoryless schemes and employs a quantized form of geodesic
   interpolation. Distinguishing features of the proposed technique include
   the fact that it only requires a single codebook, and the fact that it
   enables the step length of the geodesic interpolation to be adapted to
   the channel realization, rather than the channel statistics. In some
   straightforward simulation experiments, the proposed approach provides
   better performance than an existing scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal pump scheduling allows for computing the most economical
   energy costs and provides more efficient operations for complex water
   distribution systems (WDS) with multiple pumping stations. The proposed
   technique employs the latest advances in multi-agent Particle Swarm
   Optimization (MOPSO) to automatically determine the most cost-effective
   solutions for scheduling/operation multiple pumps in multiple pumping
   stations, while satisfying both loading conditions and hydraulic
   performance requirements. The present work considers a bi-objective
   pump-scheduling problem, where the objectives are: minimize the
   electrical energy cost (\$/KW.h) and minimize the maintenance costs in
   terms of the total number of pump switches. In additional to the
   bi-objective pump-operational problem, pressure and tank levels (i.e.,
   initial, minimum, and maximum) are considered as constraints in this
   paper for computing the most cost-effective solutions. The
   constraint-handling method, the Modified MOPSO (M-MOPSO) algorithm, and
   the modified EPANET Toolkit 2.0 are used to solve the constrained
   multi-objective problem. The results showed that the new MOPSO algorithm
   produced the most economical pump scheduling solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Miniature and Micro devices represent the new frontier for advanced heat
   and mass transfer technology. Due to the small length scales, the use of
   CFD is very useful for designing and optimizing microfluidic devices
   since experimentation and visualization at these scales can be
   difficult. In this work a high temperature air microfluidic cooling
   strategy for applications such as compact waste heat recovery, exhaust
   gas recirculation and fuel cell thermal management is proposed.
   Initially, the application of a simple straight microchannel is
   considered. In an effort to partially compensate for the poor thermal
   properties of air, right-angle bends are introduced in order to induce
   Dean vortices which periodically restart the thermal boundary layer
   development, thus improving the heat transfer and fluid mixing.
   Numerical simulations in the range of 100 <= Re-Dh <= 1000 have been
   carried out for channels of square cross-section. Channel wall lengths
   of 1 0 mm are investigated for elbow spacings of 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm
   High temperature air (300 degrees C) at atmospheric inlet pressure is
   the working fluid. The results indicate that the elbows substantially
   improve the local and average heat transfer in the channels while
   increasing the pressure drop. Design considerations are discussed which
   take into account the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of
   the channels.}},

Abstract = {{In the pursuit of sustainability, a change to the standard building
   design process, which normally starts with an architect followed by a
   civil engineer then lastly a mechanical engineer designing the HVAC and
   energy system, has been suggested. The proposed design process will have
   a mechanical engineer design the thermal envelop, HVAC and related
   energy systems first so that operational energy efficiency was the first
   goal achieved in the design. Next, the civil engineer would do analysis
   on the structural components, and determine the most sustainable
   construction materials to be used in the building. Finally, the
   architect would have to work within the constraints set by the
   mechanical and civil engineer when designing the layout of the building.
   With this new approach, the goal of sustainability would be entrenched
   in the design process and not an afterthought.
   To start implementing the proposed design process, work on the first
   step of the new building design process was started on the proposed
   Engineering Center for Experiential Learning (ExCEL) to be located at
   McMaster University in Southern Ontario. Student teams were given the
   task of designing the energy related components of the building to see
   if it was possible to reach a net-zero energy building. The work was
   split into two phases, Part 1 was to determine the building's thermal
   and electrical loads and reduce these through conservation measures. The
   second stage, discussed in the subsequent Part 2 paper, was to analyze
   the various site generation and HVAC systems that could meet the loads
   determined in the current paper.
   The student team looked at thermal envelop factors such as insulating
   properties, air tightness and building orientation to utilize passive
   solar heating and day lighting. Solar and internal gains were
   considered, and the design tried to minimize solar gains in the summer
   and reduce internal electrical gains year round with high efficiency
   lighting andequipment. Infiltration loads were reduced by increasing air
   tightness of the building. Ventilation loads were minimized by a
   combination of heat recovery ventilators.
   With the various conservation measures implemented, a daily energy
   balance was done to find the annual electrical, heating and cooling
   loads of the building. With the combination of many methods to reduce
   building loads and site generation and thermal load meeting system
   combinations, presented in the Part 2 paper, it was shown that a
   net-zero energy institutional building is possible.}},

Abstract = {{A new sustainability focused approach to the building design process has
   been proposed where first mechanical engineers design the building
   energy systems, next the civil engineers determine the most sustainable
   construction materials and finally the architect works within these
   constraints to come up with the building layout. The first step in the
   proposed design process was started on a building to be located at
   McMaster University in Southern Ontario, the proposed Engineering Center
   for Experiential Learning (ExCEL). To meet the Center's objectives,
   which is to provide hands on learning experience, student teams worked
   on designing the energy related components of the building to see if it
   was possible to reach a net-zero energy building. Split into two stages,
   the design first focused on determining the building's thermal and
   electrical loads and reducing these through conservation measures, as
   discussed in the Part 1 paper. The second phase, which is the discussion
   of this paper, was to analyze the various site generation and HVAC
   systems that could meet the predetermined building loads. To achieve the
   goal of net-zero energy, site generation from renewable resources has to
   be larger than all the building loads. For generation of electrical
   energy on site the renewable resources of wind, geothermal and solar
   were considered. It was found that solar photovoltaic system was the
   only practical form of electrical generation. With a system selected for
   the electrical loads, the thermal loads of the building had to be met by
   an HVAC system. Besides a conventional natural gas furnace and roof
   mounted cooling system, a geothermal heat pump system was analyzed. It
   was found that with a high performance geothermal system and a novel
   continuous surface solar array, it was possible to meet all the
   buildings electrical and thermal loads with electricity generated on
   site over the course of a year, allowing for the net-zero energy
   designation.
   In addition, a tri-generation system consisting of a micro natural gas
   turbine with heat recovery on the exhaust and an absorption chiller
   system was considered for meeting the electrical, heating and cooling
   loads of the building. Due to the use of non-renewable natural gas, the
   system could not achieve the net-zero energy goal. However, the system
   allowed for a more sustainable use of natural gas due to the higher
   efficiently of the natural gas consumed over conventional natural gas
   power plants. Therefore the tri-generation was considered a comparable
   alternative for showcasing sustainable technologies within the building
   for the students and general public to learn from.}},

Title = {{Influence of selective comorbidity predictors on functional recovery
   after hip fracture in an older population}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL PAPERS-OLOMOUC}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{365-370}},
Abstract = {{Aim. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of four
   comorbidities from the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics
   (CIRS-G) and their severity on functional status outcome after a
   rehabilitation program measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) in
   patients with hip fracture.
   Methods. The study included 203 patients whose functional status was
   evaluated by the BBS at admission (Group 1), at discharge (Group 2) and
   3 months after discharge (Group 3). Further comorbidity parameters from
   the CIRS-G were assessed: musculoskeletal impairment, neurological,
   vascular and cognitive impairment. For the evaluation of CIRS-G severity
   degree we used the range 0-4.
   Results. At admission there were non-significant differences in mean
   values of BBS between parameters for the same CIRS-G severity degree.
   Significant differences between BBS values were noticed in the period
   after discharge (Group 2((musculoskeletal)); P<0.05, Group
   2((neurological and cognitive)); P<0.01) and after 3 months of follow-up
   (Group 3((musculoskeletal, neurological and cognitive)); P<0.01). Higher
   effects of CIRS-G severity degree on BBS values in Group 2 and Group 3
   for neurological impairment (eta(2)(Group2)=29.76 and
   eta(2)(Group3)=28.35) and even higher for cognitive impairment
   (eta(2)(Group2)=34.35 and eta(2)(Group3)=40.63) were noticed.
   Conclusion. Increase in CIRS-G severity degree of cognitive and
   neurological impairment in patients after hip fracture that were
   included in the rehabilitation program correlates closely with
   functional status after discharge and after 3 months of follow-up.
   Rehabilitation of patients after hip fracture should be mandatory for
   functional recovery regardless of the comorbidity and functional status.}},

Abstract = {{In the presence of turbulence, magnetic field lines lose their dynamical
   identity and particles entrained on field lines diffuse through space at
   a rate determined by the amplitude of the turbulence. In previous work
   (Lazarian and Vishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009; Eyink et al., 2011) we
   showed that this leads to reconnection speeds which are independent of
   resistivity. In particular, in Kowal et al. (2009) we showed that
   numerical simulations were consistent with the predictions of this
   model. Here we examine the structure of the current sheet in simulations
   of turbulent reconnection. Laminar flows consistent with the
   Sweet-Parker reconnection model produce very thin and well ordered
   currents sheets. On the other hand, the simulations of Kowal et al.
   (2009) show a strongly disordered state even for relatively low levels
   of turbulence. Comparing data cubes with and without reconnection, we
   find that large scale field reversals are the cumulative effect of many
   individual eddies, each of which has magnetic properties which are not
   very different from turbulent eddies in a homogeneous background. This
   implies that the properties of stationary and homogeneous MHD turbulence
   are a reasonable guide to understanding turbulence during large scale
   magnetic reconnection events. In addition, dissipation and high energy
   particle acceleration during reconnection events take place over a
   macroscopic volume, rather than being confined to a narrow zone whose
   properties depend on microscopic transport coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic diblock copolymers consisting of linear or hyperbranched
   polyethylene (PE) and poly{[}oligo (ethylene glycol) methyl ether
   methacrylate] (POEGMA) were synthesized via atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) initiated by PE macroinitiators (MIs). The MIs
   contained an end-capping 2-bromoisobutyryl group per chain. Their linear
   and hyperbranched structures were first synthesized through a
   ``living{''} polymerization of ethylene under pressure of 27.6 and 1
   atm, respectively, using Pd-diimine catalyst,

   SbF6- (Ar = 2,6-(iPr)(2)C6H3) (1). In the ATRP of OEGMA, the effect of
   solvent, ligand, and MI concentration on the block copolymer formation
   were studied. The macroinitiator and block copolymer samples were
   characterized by GPC, 1H NMR, and DSC measurements. All samples
   possessed well-defined topologies/structures with narrow molecular
   weight distributions and controlled lengths of PE and POEGMA blocks. The
   block structures were verified by an intrinsic viscosity study. Micelle
   formation and its temperature sensitivity were also analyzed by dynamic
   light scattering.}},

   through use of an optic flow estimator on a peripheral ring about a
   foveal region centered on a target. A centroid measure of the target is
   used to govern remaining degrees of freedom. The biomimetic controller
   builds upon locomotor studies and uses a PID control to govern error
   corrections for each separate axis. In turn, the corrective motions of
   each axis are combined through a thrust matrix, which projects the
   desired thrust on a series of pre-learned signals in cardinal directions
   about the RUAV. Experimental implementation and results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The design, modeling and control of a novel hybrid pneumatic-electric
   actuator for applications in robotics and automation is presented. The
   design incorporates a pneumatic cylinder and DC motor connected in
   parallel. By avoiding the need for a high ratio transmission, the design
   greatly reduces the joint friction torque that contributes to the danger
   associated with robot arms. A novel discrete-valued model-predictive
   control (DVMPC) algorithm is proposed for controlling the position of
   the pneumatic cylinder with on/off valves, rather than costly
   proportional or servo valves. A variant of inverse dynamics control is
   proposed for the DC motor. A prototype was built for validating the
   actuator design and control algorithms. It is used to rotate a
   single-link robot arm. Experimental results are presented for vertical
   cycloidal and sinusoidal position trajectories. Even with the poor
   quantization caused by the on/off valves, the pneumatic cylinder
   controlled by the proposed DVMPC algorithm achieved a 2.5\% maximum
   absolute error (MAE) for the vertical cycloidal trajectory. The DVMPC
   algorithm also switches the valves less often than the PWM method,
   reducing valve wear. With the addition of the DC motor to form the
   hybrid actuator, the performance improvement was significant. For the
   vertical cycloidal trajectory, the MAE was reduced to 0.37\%. With the
   vertical sinusoidal trajectory, the MAE was 1.1\%. These results compare
   favorably to the 5\% MAE achieved by previous researchers for a
   horizontal sinusoidal trajectory using a hybrid pneumatic-electric
   actuator controlled by servo valves.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of driving a batch process to a
   specified product quality using model predictive control (MPC) with
   data-driven models. To address the problem of unavailability of online
   quality measurements, an inferential quality model, which relates the
   process conditions over the entire batch duration to the final quality,
   is required for this problem. At a given sampling instant, the accuracy
   of this type of quality model, however, is sensitive to the prediction
   of the future (unknown) batch behavior. That is, errors in the predicted
   future data are propagated to the quality prediction, adding uncertainty
   to any control action based on the predicted quality. To address this
   ``missing data{''} problem, we integrate a previously developed
   data-driven modeling methodology, which combines multiple local linear
   models with an appropriate weighting function to describe
   nonlinearities, with the inferential model in a predictive control
   framework. The key benefit of this approach is that the causality and
   nonlinear relationship between the future inputs and outputs are
   accounted for in predicting the final quality, resulting in more
   effective control action. The efficacy of the proposed predictive
   control design is illustrated via closed-loop simulations of an
   industrially relevant nylon-6,6 batch polymerization process.}},

   variable models are proposed. It is shown that in many situations, it is
   possible to identify the batch process models only from historical
   batches without the need for external excitation of the closed-loop
   system. However, adding one or two batch runs with only slight set-point
   trajectory changes is an efficient approach to enhance the data for the
   identification of the batch dynamic models. The issue of model bias in
   closed-loop identification using nonparametric or highly parameterized
   modeling approaches is also investigated and it is shown that closed

Abstract = {{In this work, we generalize a previously developed multi-model,
   data-based modeling approach for batch processes to account for
   time-varying dynamics by incorporating online learning ability into the
   model. The application of the standard recursive least squares (RLS)
   algorithm with a forgetting factor for the model form leads to
   unnecessary updates for some of the models. We address this issue by
   developing a probabilistic RLS (PRLS) estimator (also with a forgetting
   factor) for each model that takes the probability of the model being
   representative of the current plant dynamics into account in the update.
   The main advantage of adopting this local update approach is adaptation
   tuning flexibility. Specifically, the model adaptations can be made more
   aggressive while maintaining better parameter precision compared to the
   the standard RLS algorithm. The benefits from using the PRLS algorithm
   for model adaptation are demonstrated via simulations of a nylon-6,6
   batch polymerization reactor. The model adaptation is shown to be
   crucial for achieving acceptable control performance when encountering
   large disturbances in the initial conditions.}},

   predicting temperature distribution within the load and the belt. It has
   been validated using real-life data obtained from test runs carried out

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new state and parameter estimation method is introduced
   based on the particle filter (PF) and the smooth variable structure
   filter (SVSF). The PF is a popular estimation method, which makes use of
   distributed point masses to form an approximation of the probability
   distribution function (PDF). The SVSF is a relatively new estimation
   strategy based on sliding mode concepts, formulated in a predictor
   corrector format. It has been shown to be very robust to modeling errors
   and uncertainties. The combined method, referred to as the smooth
   particle variable structure filter (SPVSF), utilizes the estimates and
   state error covariance of the SVSF to formulate the proposal
   distribution which generates the particles used by the PF. The SPVSF
   method is applied on two computer experiments, namely a nonlinear target
   tracking scenario and estimation of electrohydrostatic actuator
   parameters. The results are compared with other popular Kalman-based
   estimation methods.}},

Abstract = {{New types of cellular nanocomposites can be created by carburizing the

   architectures are designed to resist externally applied loads through

   strength and stiffness when compared to conventional metal foams. They
   can also exhibit multifunctional characteristics such as energy
   absorption and thermal management. This study used the high formability
   of simple low carbon sheet steels to create an initial microtruss
   cellular architecture by plastic deformation. Mechanical strength was
   imparted via a graded composite structure wherein an external skin of
   ultrafine internal length scale martensite was created by carburizing.
   The microtruss nanocomposites exhibited up to a five-fold increase in
   compressive strength when compared to the conventional low carbon steel
   microtruss reference. The failure mechanisms were investigated in order

Abstract = {{Ultra-thin single-crystalline (sc-Si) solar cells are one possible route
   towards the goal of low-cost high-efficiency photovoltaics. The main
   motivation for such solar cells is cost-reduction due to the drastic
   reduction of high-purity silicon required for fabrication. This
   reduction is typically an order of magnitude from that of conventional
   cells, while still maintaining a reasonable efficiency. In this work,
   novel ultra-thin solar cells were fabricated on a large-area 10 mu m
   thick sc-Si free standing membrane using a novel lithography-free
   laboratory process that is simpler and more versatile than that reported
   elsewhere. The procedure allows for high temperature front and rear-side

Abstract = {{The efficiency improvements achieved by adding idealized, top-mounted,
   down-conversion (DC) and luminescent down-shifting (LDS) layers to a
   commercial grade silicon solar cell are studied. A comparison is then
   made to silicon nanocrystals (Si-NC) LDS layer coupled to a silicon
   solar cell, where the optical properties of the Si-NC are based on
   measured data. Since the modeled DC and LDS layers are electrically
   isolated from the solar cell, the devices are studied by modifying the
   incident AM1.5G spectrum according to the bandgap, absorption and
   emission profiles, and global efficiency of the DC and LDS layers.
   Simulation results indicate that a minimum DC/LDS efficiency of 1\% is
   required to enhance the solar cell efficiency, and that this threshold
   rises to 38\% for a Si-NC based LDS layer. Additionally, the
   incorporation of an optimal, perfectly efficient DC layer (200\%) is
   shown to enhance the photovoltaic efficiency from 14.1\% to 16.6\% as
   opposed to 16.3\% for a perfect LDS layer (100\%).}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the development of a method to control the flow rate
   of fluids within paper-based microfluidic analytical devices. We
   demonstrate that by simply sandwiching paper channels between two
   flexible films, it is possible to accelerate the flow of water through
   paper by over 10-fold. The dynamics of this process are such that the
   height of the liquid is dependent on time to the power of 1/3. This
   dependence was validated using three different flexible films (with
   markedly different contact angles) and three different fluids (water and
   two silicon oils with different viscosities). These covered channels
   provide a low-cost method for controlling the flow rate of fluid in
   paper channels, and can be added following printing of reagents to
   control fluid flow in selected fluidic channels. Using this method, we
   redesigned a previously published bidirectional lateral flow pesticide
   sensor to allow more rapid detection of pesticides while eliminating the
   need to run the assay in two stages. The sensor is fabricated with sol-
   gel entrapped reagents (indoxyl acetate in a substrate zone and
   acetylcholinesterase, AChE, in a sensing zone) present in an uncovered
   ``slow'' flow channel, with a second, covered ``fast'' channel used to
   transport pesticide samples to the sensing region through a simple
   paper-flap valve. In this manner, pesticides reach the sensing region
   first to allow preincubation, followed by delivery of the substrate to
   generate a colorimetric signal. This format results in a uni-directional
   device that detects the presence of pesticides two times faster than the
   original bidirectional sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The current challenge in catalyst development is to produce highly
   active and economical catalysts. This challenge cannot be overcome
   without an accurate understanding of catalyst structure, surfaces and
   morphology as the catalytic reactions occur on the surface active sites.
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is an excellent tool for
   understanding the structures of the nanoparticles down to the atomic
   level in determining the relationship with the catalyst's performance in
   fuel cell applications. This paper describes a detailed structural
   characterization of Pt-Fe nanoparticles using aberration corrected TEM.
   Detailed analysis regarding the morphology, structural ordering, facets,
   nature of the surfaces, atomic displacements and compositions was
   carried out and presented in the context of their electrochemical
   performances. In addition, the effects of electrochemical cycling in
   terms of morphology and composition evolution of the nanoparticles were
   analyzed. Lastly, along with data from X-ray diffractometry, two
   different crystallographic models of the unknown Pt3Fe2 nanoparticle
   phase are proposed. The detailed characterization by TEM provides useful
   insights into the nanoparticle chemistry and structure that contributes
   to catalyst development for next generation fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{Materials such as hydrogels have a long history of use in the eye. The
   need for ophthalmic coatings arises because desired surface properties,

   inconsistent with the properties necessary in the bulk materials.
   Commercially, a host of different modifications are used to generate the
   desired surface characteristics. Contact lens materials have been
   modified with internal wetting agents or with plasma coatings.
   Intraocular lenses are often modified to improve implantability and
   outcomes. Furthermore, while there is much research on `typical'
   modifications, novel modifications to alleviate such problems as
   endophthalmitis and posterior capsule opacification show promise in the
   lab and may ultimately lead to better and longer lasting materials. Such
   modifications may also prove useful in the development of ophthalmic

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new track initialization method for the track-oriented
   multiple hypothesis tracking (TOMHT) is proposed. An auxiliary
   cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter, which is
   modified to estimate the distribution of the number of target-originated
   measurements, is proposed. After obtaining the maximum a posteriori
   (MAP) estimate of the number of target-originated measurements, the
   K-cardinality 2-D assignment technique is used to find the optimal
   measurement-to-track association hypothesis, which is not only subjected
   to the standard ``one-to-one{''} feasibility constraints, but also the
   constraint that a given number of measurements are associated to newly
   initialized tracks. Furthermore, by assuming that the velocities of the
   initial tracks are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with
   a probability distribution determined by the output of the auxiliary
   CPHD filter, the information about the target state from the auxiliary
   CPHD filter is integrated into the track initialization. After the
   K-cardinality 2-D assignment, the results from the TOMHT are fed back to
   the CPHD filter to remove the measurements being associated with the
   confirmed and the tentative tracks. Then the CPHD will be updated again
   using the reduced measurement set. Simulation results show that the
   proposed track initialization method is able to decrease the false track
   rate by adaptively controlling the track initiation latency, based on
   the information about the clutter spatial intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Void fraction and DNB calculations conducted using ASSERT-PV V3R1 are
   evaluated against data from the NUPEC database as part of the OECD/NEA
   Pressurized Water Reactor Subchannel Benchmark Tests (PSBT). Void
   fraction measurements were well represented in the isolated single
   subchannel cases, with 77.0\% of all predicted values falling within +/-
   2 sigma(exp) = 0.06 of the experimental value. In the B5 type bundle, an
   average void fraction error of (epsilon) over bar (alpha) = -0.0540 was
   reported at the lower elevation, while this value was (epsilon) over bar
   (alpha) = -0.0405 at the upper measurement location. ASSERT was able to
   predict the steady state DNB power of the bundles to within +/- 10\% of
   the measured value for a total of 344 times out of 432. Sensitivity
   studies conducted indicate that the Ahmad correlation with the
   Groeneveld 1995 CHF lookup table yielded the most accurate results,

   for signal classification for which a distance measure must be chosen to
   compare the similarity between the signal features. We reason that PSD
   matrices have structural constraints and describe a manifold in the
   signal space. Thus, instead of the widely used Euclidean distance (ED),
   a more appropriate measure is the Riemannian distance (RD) on the
   manifold. Here, we develop a closed-form RD between two PSD matrices on
   the manifold and also an optimum weighting matrix for the purpose of
   signal classification. We then apply this new measure for
   electroencephalogram (EEG) classification for the determination of sleep
   states and the results are very encouraging.}},

Title = {{New Bifurcation Critical Criterion of Flip-Neimark-Sacker Bifurcations
   for Two-Parameterized Family of n-Dimensional Discrete Systems}},
Journal = {{DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{A new bifurcation critical criterion of flip-Neimark-Sacker bifurcation
   is proposed for detecting or anticontrolling this type of
   codimension-two bifurcation of discrete systems in a general sense. The
   criterion is built on the properties of coefficients of characteristic
   equations instead of the properties of eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix of
   nonlinear system, which is formulated using a set of simple equalities
   and inequalities consisting of the coefficients of characteristic
   polynomial equation. The inequality conditions enable us to easily pick
   off the fake parameter domain whereas the equality conditions are used
   to accurately locate the critical bifurcation point. In particular,
   after the bifurcation parameter piont is determined, the inequality
   conditions can be used to figure out the feasible region of other system
   parameters. Thus, the criterion is suitable for two-parameterized family
   of n-dimensional discrete systems. As compared with the classical
   critical criterion (or definition) of flip-Neimark-Sacker bifurcation
   stated in terms of the properties of eigenvalues, the proposed criterion
   is preferable in anticontrolling or detecting the existence of
   flip-Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in high-dimension nonlinear systems, due
   to its explicit parameter mechanism of the bifurcation.}},

Pages = {{817-826}},
Abstract = {{Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) provides an opportunity for treatment of
   various invasive tumors by the use of a cancer targeting
   photosensitizing agent and light of specific wavelengths. However,
   real-time monitoring of drug localization is desirable because the
   induction of the phototoxic effect relies on interplay between the
   dosage of localized drug and light. Fluorescence emission in PDT may be
   used to monitor the uptake process but fluorescence intensity is subject
   to variability due to scattering and absorption; the addition of
   fluorescence lifetime may be beneficial to probe site-specific
   drug-molecular interactions and cell damage. We investigated the
   fluorescence lifetime changes of Photofrin (R) at various intracellular
   components in the Mat-LyLu (MLL) cell line. The fluorescence decays were
   analyzed using a bi-exponential model, followed by segmentation analysis
   of lifetime parameters. When Photofrin (R) was localized at the cell
   membrane, the slow lifetime component was found to be significantly
   shorter (4.3 +/- 0.5 ns) compared to those at other locations
   (cytoplasm: 7.3 +/- 0.3 ns; mitochondria: 7.0 +/- 0.2 ns, p < 0.05).}},

Abstract = {{In many service applications, mobile robots need to share their work
   areas with obstacles. Avoiding moving obstacles with unpredictable
   direction changes, such as humans, is more challenging than avoiding

   navigation algorithms. Furthermore, humans should be able to pursue
   their activities unhindered and without worrying about the robots around
   them. An enhanced virtual force field-based mobile robot navigation
   algorithm (termed EVFF) is presented for avoiding moving obstacles with
   unpredictable direction changes. This algorithm may be used with both
   holonomic and nonholonomic robots. It incorporates improved virtual
   force functions and an improved method for selecting the sense of the
   detour force to better avoid moving obstacles. For several challenging
   obstacle configurations, the EVFF algorithm is compared with five
   state-of-the-art navigation algorithms for moving obstacles. The
   navigation system with the new algorithm generated collision-free paths
   consistently. Methods for solving local minima conditions are proposed.
   Experimental results are also presented to further verify the avoidance
   performance of this algorithm. (c) 2012 Taylor \& Francis and The

Abstract = {{Dendrimer cross-linking has been achieved with pepsin digested over 80\%
   type-I bovine collagen to create strong hydrogels with good cell
   compatibility. Herein we investigate the use of commercially available
   collagen-based products with the dendrimer cross-linking technology.
   Specifically PureCol (R) (PC), a 97\% bovine type-I collagen, human
   collagen (HC) and human extracellular matrix (hECM) were concentrated,
   and then cross-linked with polypropyleneimine octaamine generation two
   dendrimers using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide
   hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry. PC gels
   with 30 and 20 mg/ml bovine collagen were fabricated, and despite
   similar concentrations to >80\% type-I bovine collagen dendrimer
   cross-linked gels (CG), PC gels demonstrated increased swelling and
   decreased stability, as determined with collagenase digestion. The
   highly purified bovine (PC) and human sourced-collagen (HC) gels were
   similar in performance, but not as stable as the CG gels, which may
   correlate to the manufacturer's collagen purification and storage.
   Finally, the addition of hECM components to PC to create PC-hECM gels,
   resulted in a looser gel network, compared to heparinized dendrimer
   crosslinked bovine >80\% type-I collagen gels (CHG). However, all
   collagen-based gels supported 3T3 fibroblast cell growth over 4 days,
   indicating these gels may be suitable for tissue-engineering
   applications. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011}},

Title = {{Modification of Polyurethane with Polyethylene Glycol-Corn Trypsin

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{In previous work using gold as a model substrate, we showed that
   modification of surfaces with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and corn
   trypsin inhibitor (CTI) rendered them protein resistant and inhibitory
   against activated factor XII. Sequential attachment of PEG followed by
   CTI gave superior performance compared to direct attachment of a
   preformed PEG-CTI conjugate. In the present work, a sequential method
   was used to attach PEG and CTI to a polyurethane (PU) substrate to
   develop a material with applicability for blood-contacting medical
   devices. Controls included surfaces modified only with PEG and only with
   CTI. Surfaces were characterized by water contact angle and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface density of CTI was in the range
   of a monolayer and was higher on the PU substrate than on gold reported
   previously. Biointeractions were investigated by measuring fibrinogen
   adsorption from buffer and plasma, factor XIIa inhibition and plasma
   clotting time. Both the PU-PEG surfaces and the PU-PEG-CTI surfaces
   showed low fibrinogen adsorption from buffer and plasma, indicating that
   PEG retained its protein resistance when conjugated to CTI. Although the
   CTI density was lower on PU-PEG-CTI than on PU modified only with CTI,
   PU-PEG-CTI exhibited greater factor XIIa inhibition and a longer plasma
   clotting time, suggesting that PEG facilitates the interaction of CTI
   with factor XIIa. Thus sequential attachment of PEG and CTI may be a
   useful approach to improve the thromboresistance of PU surfaces. (C)

Abstract = {{The increased availability of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) in
   personal computers has made parallel programming worthwhile, but not
   necessarily easier. This paper will take advantage of the power of a
   GPU, in conjunction with the Central Processing Unit (CPU), in order to
   simulate target trajectories for large-scale scenarios, such as
   wide-area maritime or ground surveillance. The idea is to simulate the
   motion of tens of thousands of targets using a GPU by formulating an
   optimization problem that maximizes the throughput. To do this, the
   proposed algorithm is provided with input data that describes how the
   targets are expected to behave, path information (e.g., roadmaps,
   shipping lanes), and available computational resources. Then, it is
   possible to break down the algorithm into parts that are done in the CPU
   versus those sent to the GPU. The ultimate goal is to compare processing
   times of the algorithm with a GPU in conjunction with a CPU to those of
   the standard algorithms running on the CPU alone. In this paper, the
   optimization formulation for utilizing the GPU, simulation results on
   scenarios with a large number of targets and conclusions are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive TiAlCrSiYN-based coatings show promise under the extreme
   tribological conditions of dry ultra-high-speed (500-700 m min(-1))
   machining of hardened tool steels. During high speed machining,
   protective sapphire and mullite-like tribo-films form on the surface of
   TiAlCrSiYN-based coatings resulting in beneficial heat-redistribution in
   the cutting zone. XRD and HRTEM data show that the tribo-films act as a
   thermal barrier creating a strong thermal gradient. The data are
   consistent with the temperature decreasing from similar to 1100-1200
   degrees C at the outer surface to similar to 600 degrees C at the
   tribo-film/coating interface. The mechanical properties of the
   multilayer TiAlCrSiYN/TiAlCrN coating were measured by high temperature
   nanoindentation. It retains relatively high hardness (21 GPa) at 600
   degrees C. The nanomechanical properties of the underlying coating layer
   provide a stable low wear environment for the tribofilms to form and
   regenerate so it can sustain high temperatures under operation (600
   degrees C). This combination of characteristics explains the high wear
   resistance of the multilayer TiAlCrSiYN/TiAlCrN coating under extreme
   operating conditions. TiAlCrSiYN and TiAlCrN monolayer coatings have a
   less effective combination of adaptability and mechanical
   characteristics and therefore lower tool life. The microstructural
   reasons for different optimum hardness and plasticity between monolayer
   and multilayer coatings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Local backlight dimming in Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) is a technique
   for reducing power consumption and simultaneously increasing contrast
   ratio to provide a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image reproduction. Several
   backlight dimming algorithms exist with focus on reducing power
   consumption, while other algorithms aim at enhancing contrast, with
   power savings as a side effect. In our earlier work, we have modeled
   backlight dimming as a linear programming problem, where the target is
   to minimize the cost function measuring the distance between ideal and
   actual output. In this paper, we propose a version of the abovementioned
   algorithm, speeding up execution by decreasing the number of input
   variables. This is done by using a subset of the input pixels, selected
   among the ones experiencing leakage or clipping distortions. The
   optimization problem is then solved on this subset. Sample reduction can
   also be beneficial in conjunction with other approaches, such as an
   algorithm based on gradient descent, also presented here. All the
   proposals have been compared against other known approaches on simulated
   edge-and direct-lit displays, and the results show that the optimal
   distortion level can be reached using a subset of pixels, with
   significantly reduced computational load compared to the optimal
   algorithm with the full image.}},

Abstract = {{Past research has shown contradicting trends in the rate of heat
   transfer during pool boiling of nanofluids, which could be attributed
   either to their stability or to their method of preparation or to both.
   An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effects of
   electrostatic stabilization and preparation method of nanofluids on
   their pool boiling rate of heat transfer. Nanofluids made from water and
   alumina nanoparticles at 0.1 vol\% concentration were used. The effect
   of electrostatic stabilization was investigated by changing the pH value
   from 6.5, neutral, to 5, acidic. The effect of preparation method has
   been investigated by using nanofluids prepared from dry particles and
   from ready-made suspensions. Compared with water, all nanofluids
   investigated resulted in deterioration in the rate of heat transfer
   during pool boiling. Neutral nanofluids made from ready-made suspensions
   and from dry particles resulted into almost the same deterioration in
   the rate of heat transfer of 49\% and 45\%, respectively, with respect
   to that of pure water. The most significant effect of electrostatic
   stabilization was found in the case of acidic nanofluids made from dry
   particles, which resulted in deterioration in the rate of heat transfer
   of 31\%. However, acidic nanofluids made from ready-made suspensions
   resulted in a deterioration of 46\%, which is almost the same as that of
   suspension-made and dry particles-made nanofluids. These results
   indicate that electrostatic stabilization using acid addition is most
   effective with nanofluids made from dry particles.}},

Abstract = {{Extending our previous papers (Air Pollution XIII, XVI and XVII), we
   discuss some physical aspects of Air Pollution (AP) and Global Air
   Pollution (GAP) stemming from the range of physical effects. We argue
   that these effects may produce a variety of chaotic and
   self-organizational consequences on GAP which affect the lateral
   dynamics and migratory mechanisms of GAP. Our prime attention is towards
   formation of collective states and collective excitations in AP/GAP
   system. We discuss same aspects of these effects in the context of chaos
   theory and quantum physics. We further discuss the potential purposeful
   structuring of electromagnetic perturbations for possible mitigation and
   passivation of AP effects on global and local scales.}},

   play an important role. Planar micro-/nano-photonic devices seem likely
   to be exploited across a wide spectrum of applications in
   optoelectronics and photonics. This spectrum includes the domains of
   display devices, biomedical sensing and sensing more generally, advanced
   fibre-optical communications systems - and even communications down to
   the local area network (LAN) level. This article will review both device
   concepts and the applications possibilities of the various different

Abstract = {{We propose a simple and accurate technique for the design optimization
   of coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs). The technique is based
   on tapering the coupling coefficients at the CROWs stages to achieve
   arbitrary realizable filter response. A perturbation theory is developed
   for the linearization of the design problem. The coupling coefficients
   are expanded around a known mean coupling value. By dumping the higher
   order perturbation terms, we ignore the effect of multiple reflections
   among the rings introduced by the small adjustment of the coupling
   coefficients. This is a first order accurate approach as it takes into
   account only multiple reflections introduced by the zero order terms.
   The design problem is then formulated as an optimization problem. The
   optimal filter design is achieved by solving a constrained linear least
   square problem. This optimization problem can be solved efficiently to
   get the global optimal design. Our technique is accurate and efficient
   compared to other nonlinear approaches. Our technique has been verified
   using different proposed targeted filter responses utilizing third,
   fifth, and tenth order coupled ring resonators. Highly selective tenth
   order filter with flat response is proposed. We compared our results to
   the existing techniques to prove its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The nematode (worm) C. elegans is one of the widely studied animal model
   organisms in biology. It develops through 4 larval stages (L1-L4) in 2
   to 3 days before becoming a young adult. Biological assays involving C.
   elegans frequently require a large number of animals that are
   appropriately staged and exhibit a similar behaviour. We have developed
   a new method to synchronize animals that relies on the electrotactic
   response (electric field-induced motion) of C. elegans to sort them in
   parallel based on their age, size and phenotype. By using local electric
   field traps in a microfluidic device, we can efficiently sort worms from
   a mixed culture in a semi-continuous flow manner (with a minimum
   throughput of 78 worms per minute per load-run) and obtain synchronized
   populations of animals. In addition to sorting larvae, our device can
   also distinguish between young and old adults efficiently. Unlike
   fluorescent based sorting systems that use active imaging based
   feedback, this method is passive and automatic and uses the innate
   behaviour of the worm. Considering that the entire procedure takes only
   a few minutes to run and is cost-effective, it promises to simplify and
   accelerate experiments requiring homogeneous cultures of worms as well
   as to facilitate isolation of mutants that have abnormal electrotaxis.
   More importantly, our method of isolating and separating worms using
   locomotion as a defining characteristic promises development of advanced
   microfluidics-based systems to study the neuronal basis of
   movement-related defects in worms and facilitate high-throughput
   chemical screening and drug discovery.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an overview of optical wireless (OW) communication
   systems that operate both in the short- (personal and indoor systems)
   and the long-range (outdoor and hybrid) regimes. Each of these areas is
   discussed in terms of (a) key requirements, (b) their application
   framework, (c) major impairments and applicable mitigation techniques,
   and (d) current and/or future trends. Personal communication systems are
   discussed within the context of point-to-point ultra-high speed data
   transfer. The most relevant application framework and related standards
   are presented, including the next generation Giga-IR standard that
   extends personal communication speeds to over 1 Gb/s. As far as indoor
   systems are concerned, emphasis is given on modeling the dispersive
   nature of indoor OW channels, on the limitations that dispersion imposes
   on user mobility and dispersion mitigation techniques. Visible light
   communication systems, which provide both illumination and communication
   over visible or hybrid visible/infrared LEDs, are presented as the most
   important representative of future indoor OW systems. The discussion on
   outdoor systems focuses on the impact of atmospheric effects on the
   optical channel and associated mitigation techniques that extend the
   realizable link lengths and transfer rates. Currently, outdoor OW is
   commercially available at 10 Gb/s Ethernet speeds for Metro networks and
   Local-Area-Network interconnections and speeds are expected to increase
   as faster and more reliable optical components become available. This
   article concludes with hybrid optical wireless/radio-frequency (OW/RF)
   systems that employ an additional RF link to improve the overall system
   reliability. Emphasis is given on cooperation techniques between the
   reliable RF subsystem and the broadband OW system.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the influence of hyaluronic acid
   (HA) on lysozyme sorption in model contact lenses containing varying
   amounts of methacrylic acid (MAA). One model conventional hydrogel
   (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA)) and two model silicone
   hydrogels (pHEMA, methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (pHEMA
   TRIS) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide, TRIS (DMAA TRIS)) lens materials were
   prepared with and without MAA at two different concentrations (1.7 and
   5\%). HA, along with dendrimers, was loaded into these model contact
   lens materials and then cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino
   propyl)-carbodiimide (EDC). Equilibrium water content (EWC), advancing
   water contact angle and lysozyme sorption on these lens materials were
   investigated. In the HA-containing materials, the presence (P < 0.05)
   and amount (P < 0.05) of MAA increased the EWC of the materials. For
   most materials, addition of MAA reduced the advancing contact angles (P
   < 0.05) and for all the materials, the addition of HA further improved
   hydrophilicity (P < 0.05). For the non-HA containing hydrogels, the
   presence (P < 0.05) and amount (P < 0.05) of MAA increased lysozyme
   sorption. The presence of HA decreased lysozyme sorption for all
   materials (P < 0.05). MAA appears to work synergistically with HA to
   increase the EWC in addition to improving the hydrophilicity of model
   pHEMA-based and silicone hydrogel contact lens materials. Hydrogel
   materials that contain HA have tremendous potential as hydrophilic,
   protein-resistant contact lens materials. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV,

   mixed with the enzyme glucose oxidase. The resulting solutions were drop
   cast onto the surface of glassy carbon electrodes, producing uniform
   coatings that contained high concentrations of carbon nanotubes and the
   enzyme. It was found that electrochemical cells comprising the coated
   electrodes were responsive to the addition of glucose, resulting in
   biosensors having a detection limit of 5.0 mu M and a linear dynamic
   range of 0.5 to 5.0 mM glucose. It was shown that sensitivity increased
   with increasing nanotube concentration up to 4 g L-1, and increasing
   enzyme concentration up to 20 g L-1. The high sensitivity of the
   nanotube-based sensors results from an effective increase in the surface
   area of the electrode as a result of contact with a percolation network
   of carbon nanotubes that is in close contact with glucose oxidase
   throughout the coating. By using the anionic conjugated polyelectrolyte
   aPPE in the coating, it was found that charge repulsion of anionic
   interferents such as uric acid and ascorbic acid could be achieved
   without the need for a Nafion overcoat. These results pave the way for
   development of new sensors to a variety of other analytes.}},

   potential applications to high-force crashes in the automotive industry.
   Before it is adopted for use, the MIL-Lx must be evaluated under impact
   loading to ensure that it represents the natural lower leg response.
   Methods: Axial impact loads were applied to both the HIII and the MIL-Lx
   at impact velocities of 2 to 7 m/s using a pneumatic impacting device.
   Testing was also conducted with the foot removed from both surrogates to
   enable comparison with previous tests of isolated cadaveric tibias at
   noninjurious and injurious (i.e., fracture) levels. To evaluate the
   effect of a boot on load attenuation, the HIII was impacted with and
   without a hiking boot.
   Results: Forces in the MIL-Lx were between 25 and 100 percent of those
   in the HIII (depending on impact conditions). The use of a boot reduced
   the peak force by approximately 65 percent at the highest impact
   velocities. The MIL-Lx fit the data from noninjurious cadaveric tibia
   tests with R-2 = 0.83.
   Conclusions: The MIL-Lx is a new surrogate that represents the response
   of the natural tibia under axial impact loading better than the HIII.
   The inclusion of a boot has a significant effect on loads in the leg and
   may influence injury assessment results. The MIL-Lx will be a useful
   tool for predicting lower leg injury risk over a wide range of impact
   velocities.}},

Abstract = {{The research program presented in this paper investigated the effects of
   flange holes and flange fastener holes on the strength and rotation
   capacity of ASTM A992 steel grade I-beams. It involved four point
   flexural testing of twenty five steel beams having circular holes of
   various diameters, ranging from 0\% to 50\% of the gross flange area.
   The tests were divided into four series as follows: solid flanges (no
   holes), holes in tension flanges only, holes in both tension and
   compression flanges, and holes in both flanges with bolt fasteners
   placed in these holes. These experiments reveal that the beam specimens
   having the A(fn)F(u)/A(fg)F(y) >= 1.0 were able to reach the
   gross-section plastic moment and exhibit substantial inelastic rotation
   capacity (R-y of more than 9). If this condition is violated
   (A(fn)F(u)/A(fg)F(y) < 1.0) then the beam specimens failed primarily due
   to rupture of tension flange at the location of the flange holes, which
   substantially reduced the inelastic rotational capacity. Based on the
   experimental results, this research study recommends a design approach
   analogous to the axial tension member design provisions.}},

Abstract = {{The compressive behavior of a steel-concrete composite column encased in
   a fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) tube is evaluated experimentally for
   columns with various slenderness ratios. The composite column consists
   of a FRP tube surrounding a steel I-section that is subsequently filled
   with concrete. A total of nine column specimens were tested ranging
   between 500 and 3,000 mm in height. Confinement and composite action
   resulted in enhanced compressive behavior of the composite columns.
   Maximum confinement occurred in the short column (slenderness ratio less
   than 0.2). Confinement action reduced with increased height of the
   column specimens. The column load-carrying capacity, ultimate axial
   strain, and compressive strength of the confined concrete core in the
   longest specimen (slenderness ratio of 0.9) were reduced to
   approximately 59, 14, and 51\% of the short column values, respectively.
   A buckling strength curve of the composite columns was developed on the
   basis of the experimental results.

Abstract = {{This paper presents detailed analysis of the results of field tests on
   13 full scale wide flange steel beams subjected to blast loads generated
   by the detonation of up to 250 kg of ANFO explosive. The experimental
   results are analyzed using an equivalent Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF)
   model of a beam, which includes material nonlinearity and strain rate
   effects. To account for strain rate effect on beam stiffness and
   strength, its full moment-curvature response is determined by dividing
   its cross-section into a number of layers and a strain rate-dependent
   stress-strain relationship, based on the Cowper-Symonds strain rate
   model, is used to capture the nonlinear stress distribution over the
   section. To determine the effects of higher modes of vibration and the
   variation of beam mechanical properties along its length on its dynamic
   response, the test beams are also analyzed using a
   Multi-Degree-of-Freedom (MDOF) model involving beam finite elements.
   Each element has two nodes and three degrees of freedom and is again
   divided into a number of layers to capture the strain rate effect and
   nonlinear stress distribution over its depth. The predicted
   displacements and strains by the two models are compared with the
   corresponding experimental data and the results show that for the given
   beams, the time-dependant deformations, internal forces, and moments can
   be adequately predicted by either model because the first mode of
   vibration is found to dominate their response; however, the use of a
   constant strain rate through the so-called Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF)
   can lead to highly conservative estimate of the actual strength of such
   members. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations were performed to determine the effect of Reynolds
   number and orifice to pipe diameter ratio (d(o)/d) on the wall mass
   transfer rate downstream of an orifice. The simulations were performed
   for d(o)/d of 0.475 for Reynolds number up to 70,000. The effect of
   d(o)/d was determined by performing simulations at a Reynolds number of
   70,000 for d(o)/d of 0.375, 0.475 and 0.575. The momentum and mass
   transport equations were solved using the Low Reynolds Number (LRN)
   K-epsilon turbulence model. The Sherwood number (Sh) profile downstream
   of the orifice was in relatively good agreement with existing
   experimental results. The Sh increases sharply downstream of the
   orifice, reaching a maximum within 1-2 diameters downstream of the
   orifice, before relaxing back to the fully developed pipe flow value.
   The Sh number well downstream of the orifice was in good agreement with
   results for fully developed pipe flow estimated from the correlation of
   Berger and Hau (1977). The peak Sh numbers from the simulations were
   higher than that predicted from Tagg et al. (1979) and Coney (1980). (C)

Abstract = {{Contact lenses, as an alternative drug delivery vehicle for the eye
   compared to eye drops, are desirable due to potential advantages in
   dosing regimen, bioavailability and patient tolerance/compliance. The
   challenge has been to engineer and develop these materials to sustain
   drug delivery to the eye for a long period of time. In this study, model
   silicone hydrogel materials were created using a molecular imprinting
   strategy to deliver the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Acetic and acrylic
   acid were used as the functional monomers, to interact with the
   ciprofloxacin template to efficiently create recognition cavities within
   the final polymerized material. Synthesized materials were loaded with
   9.06 mM, 0.10 mM and 0.025 mM solutions of ciprofloxacin, and the
   release of ciprofloxacin into an artificial tear solution was monitored
   over time. The materials were shown to release for periods varying from
   3 to 14 days, dependent on the loading solution, functional monomer
   concentration and functional monomer: template ratio, with materials
   with greater monomer: template ratio (8: 1 and 16: 1 imprinted) tending
   to release for longer periods of time. Materials with a lower monomer:
   template ratio (4: 1 imprinted) tended to release comparatively greater
   amounts of ciprofloxacin into solution, but the release was somewhat
   shorter. The total amount of drug released from the imprinted materials
   was sufficient to reach levels relevant to inhibit the growth of common
   ocular isolates of bacteria. This work is one of the first to
   demonstrate the feasibility of molecular imprinting in model silicone
   hydrogel-type materials.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting future flow variability and changes in ungauged basins
   remains a challenging task not only because of data limitation, but also
   the various sources of uncertainty involved. However, for future water
   resources development projects, reliable estimate of future flow
   variability is essential. In this study, future flow variability and
   changes are estimated in 90 selected basins across the Province of
   Ontario using a multi-model approach combining bias correction and
   regional climate models (RCMs), downscaling and global climate models
   (GCMs), dual regionalization method and hydrologic model. Raw RCM
   outputs, bias corrected RCM data, and downscaled GCM outputs are
   compared to identify the most accurate predictor (precipitation,
   temperature) series when compared to the observed data for the current
   period. It is found that the bias correction approach can reduce monthly
   precipitation and daily temperature errors of regional climate models by
   about 90\% and provides the most accurate precipitation and temperature
   time series. The bias-corrected RCM data are used with a rainfall-runoff
   model and a coupled regionalization method to simulate continuous
   streamflow in both gauged and ungauged basins. It is found that
   consistent streamflow and baseflow estimate can be obtained whatever the
   RCM data used. In general, positive (increasing) changes in streamflow
   are observed for all seasons except for March, April and May where
   negative (decreasing) trends are dominant in some basins. Future changes
   in baseflow are mostly positive with smaller amplitude whatever the
   season for almost all the 90 selected basins. Overall, it is shown that
   for northern, central and southern regions of Ontario, the amplitude of
   the variability and changes of future streamflow and baseflow in
   ungauged basins should be in the range of -10 to +10 mm per month based
   on most recent RCM simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Protein adsorption on PDMS surfaces poses a significant challenge in
   microfluidic devices that come into contact with biofluids such as
   blood. Polyurethane (PU) is often used for the construction of medical
   devices, but despite having several attractive properties for
   biointerfacing, it has not been widely used in microfluidic devices. In
   this work we developed two new fabrication processes for making thin,
   transparent and flexible PU-based microfluidic devices. Methods for the
   fabrication and bonding of microchannels, the integration of fluidic
   interconnections and surface modification with hydrophilic polyethylene
   oxide (PEO) to reduce protein adsorption are detailed. Using these
   processes, microchannels were produced having high transparency (96\%
   that of glass in visible light), high bond strength (326.4 kPa) and low
   protein adsorption (80\% reduction in fibrinogen adsorption vs.
   unmodified PDMS), which is critical for prevention of fouling. Our
   findings indicate that PEO modified PU could serve as an effective
   alternative to PDMS in blood contacting microfluidic applications.}},

Abstract = {{By measuring the energy losses of high-energy electrons transmitted

   information on the local electronic structure in materials. Using
   electron beams smaller than 0.1 nm, the technique provides exquisite

   such that local changes in the bonding environment are probed with a
   resolution approaching the Angstrom level, with an energy resolution
   competitive with complementary techniques such as x-ray absorption
   spectroscopy. With the development of spectroscopic imaging in the
   scanning transmission electron microscope, this technique can be used to
   map, at the atomic level, the composition of atomic columns and the
   valence of atoms at defects, interfaces, and surfaces. Recent
   applications of this technique are provided as examples showing the

Volume = {{297}},

Abstract = {{Reactions were carried out between a low molecular weight, highly
   functionalized maleic anhydride-grafted polyethylene and
   hexamethylenediamine in a melt blender at 150 degrees C for various
   stoichiometric ratios of functional groups. For all compositions, two
   peaks were observed in the mixing torque data. The appearance of the
   first peak, observed soon after the introduction of the reactive mixture
   to the melt blender, was independent of composition. The second peak was
   composition-dependent. Gel content and FTIR analyses suggest that the
   first peak is a result of melting functionalized polyethylene and a
   reaction of the anhydride and amine functionalities, while the second
   was mainly a result of crosslinking. The time between the first and
   second peak defines a processing window, in which the reaction mixture
   is thermoplastic. Higher temperature melt processing of the
   thermoplastic reaction products converted these materials to thermosets.
   During this conversion, the progress of the anhydrideamine reaction was
   studied using FTIR, as well as by measuring the generation of the
   insoluble crosslinked material. The FTIR results reveal that the
   reaction between anhydride and amine moieties results in the formation
   of an amide intermediate, which then converts to cyclic imide at higher
   temperatures. The analysis suggests that the use of the FTIR anhydride
   absorption to assess the degree of reaction is misleading in these
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Nonisothermal crystallization behavior of linear and long chain branched
   (LCB) polyethylene (PE) samples having similar molecular weight but
   different long-chain branching densities (LCBD) up to 0.44 C per 1000

   at various scanning rates. The LCB PE samples were prepared in our

   found to affect the PE crystallization behavior considerably. The
   enthalpy of crystallization and the ultimate degree of crystallinity
   decreased with the increase of LCBD. At the relatively low cooling
   rates, the small amount of LCB promoted nucleation but restrained chain
   movement and reduced the crystal growth rate. There was similar to 17\%
   of crystallinity generated from a secondary crystallization. The energy

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{White light-emitting devices based on a donor-acceptor structure were
   fabricated in order to investigate the dependence of the optical
   properties of white light emission on the thickness variance (15, 20,
   25, and 30 nm) of the emissive layer. The emissive layer has a
   donor-acceptor system with the host 4,4',4
   `'-tris(carbasol-l-nyl)triphenylamine molecule doped with
   4,4'-bis(9-ethyl-3-carbazovinylene)-1,1'-biphenyl (BCzVBi) and
   5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphtacene (Rubrene) molecules for blue and
   yellowish-green light activators, respectively. The characteristics of
   current density were analyzed by using a power function of applied
   field, J = sigma E-l(l+1) and the characteristic exponential function, J
   = J(0)(e((V-Vd)/V0) - 1). Through spectroscopic analysis, we obtained
   three physical quantities governing the device performance: 1) an
   effective conductivity, 2) a threshold potential, and 3) a
   characteristic potential barrier, which are associated with the
   trap-charge limited concentration in the bulk layer, the energy gap of
   the organic materials, and the barrier energy at the contact of
   electrodes, respectively. The electroluminescent spectra were studied
   quantitatively using a multi-peak fit with a Gaussian distribution for
   each electromagnetic transition. By this approach, we deduced the energy
   levels of the BCzVBi and Rubrene molecules that give leading information
   on the light emission mechanism and the energy transfer in the
   host-dopant system. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Abstract = {{This article presents the development of a multiple inner-loop control
   strategy for improving the performance of hydrostatic actuation systems.
   In these actuators, the presence of nonlinearities associated with
   pump/motor static friction and backlash, pressure drop in the piping
   system, and nonlinear friction at the load have a significant effect on
   the performance and positional accuracy of the system. The effect of
   nonlinear friction at the pump/motor interface has been overcome by the
   use of a high gain pump-speed inner-loop control strategy. In this
   article, the concept of inner-loop control will be extended to target
   other specific sources of performance degradation. Velocity feedback
   will be incorporated in this manner to decrease the effects of pump
   backlash and nonlinear friction at the load. Simulation results
   supported by theoretical analysis indicate that a considerable
   improvement in performance can be achieved by the implementation of this
   control strategy. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4001338]}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate extracranial venous structural and flow
   characteristics in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Materials and Methods: Two hundred subjects with MS from two sites (n =
   100 each) were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T.
   Contrast-enhanced time-resolved MR angiography and time-of-flight MR
   venography were used to assess vascular anatomy. Two-dimensional
   phase-contrast MR imaging was used to quantify blood flow. The MS
   population was divided into two groups: those with evident internal
   jugular vein (IJV) stenoses (stenotic group) and those without
   (nonstenotic group).
   Results: Of the 200 patients, 136 (68\%) showed IN structural
   abnormalities, including unilateral or bilateral stenoses at different
   levels in the neck (n = 101; 50.5\%) and atresia (n = 35; 17.5\%). The
   total IJV flow normalized to the total arterial flow of the stenotic
   group (56\% +/- 22) was significantly lower than that of the nonstenotic
   group (77\% +/- 14; P < .001). The arterial/venous flow mismatch in the
   stenotic group (12\% +/- 15) was significantly greater than that in the
   nonstenotic group (6\% +/- 12; P < .001). The ratio of subdominant
   venous flow rate (Fsd) to dominant venous flow rate (Fd) for the
   stenotic group (0.38 +/- 0.27) was significantly lower than for the
   nonstenotic group (0.59 +/- 0.23; P < .001). The majority of the
   stenotic group (67\%) also had an Fsd of less than 3 mL/s, a Fd/Fsd
   ratio greater than 3:1, and/or a total IJV flow rate of less than 8
   mL/s.
   Conclusions: MR imaging provides a noninvasive means to separate
   stenotic from nonstenotic MS cases. The former group was more prevalent
   in the present MS population and carried significantly less flow in the
   IJVs than the latter.}},

   data was found to follow a first-order rate dependency and by
   examination using a phase-boundary kinetic model was considered to be
   exterior diffusion limited. The extent of conversion always converged to
   an asymptotic value less than 100\%. The inclusion of 12\%

Abstract = {{Crystal growth has been recognized as a paradigm for non-equilibrium
   pattern formation for decades. Scientific interest in this field has
   focused on the growth rates and curvature of branches in snowflake-like
   structures patterned after a solid's crystallographic orientations. In
   reality, there exists a much richer variety of crystal patterns in
   nature. Investigations of dendritically solidifying alloys reveals
   structures that continuously change orientation between different growth
   directions, some of which are not along preferred crystallographic
   directions. The selection mechanism of such patterns is poorly
   understood. In this paper we demonstrate computationally and
   experimentally that a material's surface tension anisotropy can compete
   with anisotropies present in processing conditions during solidification
   to produce a continuous transition from dendritic to seaweed and
   fractal-like structures. The phase space of such morphologies is
   characterized and the selection principles of the various morphologies
   explored are explained. These results have direct relevance to
   microstructure formation in commercial lightweight metal castings. (C)

   combined an appropriate wireless protocol for data communication with
   capacitive ECG signal sensing and processing. The ANT protocol was used
   as a low-data-rate wireless module to reduce the power consumption and
   size of the sensor. Furthermore, capacitive ECG sensing is a simple
   technique that avoids direct contact with the skin and provides maximum
   convenience to the user. In our work, small capacitive electrodes were
   integrated into a cotton T-shirt together with a signal processing and
   transmitting board on a two-layer standard printed circuit board design
   technology. The entire system has small size, is thin, and has low power
   consumption compared to recent ECG monitoring systems. In addition,
   appropriate signal conditioning and processing were implemented to
   remove motion artifacts. The acquired ECG signals are comparable to ones
   obtained using conventional glued-on electrodes, and are easily read and
   interpreted by a cardiologist.}},

Title = {{A Psychovisual Quality Metric in Free-Energy Principle}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{41-52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new psychovisual quality metric of images
   based on recent developments in brain theory and neuroscience,
   particularly the free-energy principle. The perception and understanding
   of an image is modeled as an active inference process, in which the
   brain tries to explain the scene using an internal generative model. The
   psychovisual quality is thus closely related to how accurately visual
   sensory data can be explained by the generative model, and the upper
   bound of the discrepancy between the image signal and its best internal
   description is given by the free energy of the cognition process.
   Therefore, the perceptual quality of an image can be quantified using
   the free energy. Constructively, we develop a reduced-reference
   free-energy-based distortion metric (FEDM) and a no-reference
   free-energy-based quality metric (NFEQM). The FEDM and the NFEQM are
   nearly invariant to many global systematic deviations in geometry and
   illumination that hardly affect visual quality, for which existing image
   quality metrics wrongly predict severe quality degradation. Although
   with very limited or even without information on the reference image,
   the FEDM and the NFEQM are highly competitive compared with the
   full-reference SSIM image quality metric on images in the popular LIVE
   database. Moreover, FEDM and NFEQM can measure correctly the visual
   quality of some model-based image processing algorithms, for which the
   competing metrics often contradict with viewers' opinions.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we introduce an effective approach for dynamic
   impedance tuning of antenna matching circuits in both the transmitting
   and receiving modes. The tuning problem is described mathematically by a
   system of two nonlinear equations. These nonlinear equations are
   constructed by perturbing the tunable components of the matching
   circuit. We introduce a closed form solution to the proposed system of
   equations in addition to a numerical one. The outcome of our algorithm
   is the exact calculation of the instantaneous antenna input impedance.
   This impedance is then used to determine the optimal matching circuit
   values. The proposed algorithm takes place on the handset in real-time.
   Additionally, it does not limit the number of tunable components of the
   tunable matching circuit as the computational overhead is independent of
   their cardinality. The proposed approach can also be expanded to the
   case of real-time broadband tuning of antennas in a dynamic environment.

Abstract = {{The continuity and Poisson equations are solved numerically to obtain
   J-V characteristics and photoconversion efficiency of a two-junction
   solar cell. The cell consists of a top junction comprised of nanowires

   substrate. The lattice relaxation possible in nanowires permits
   lattice-mismatched III-V material growth on Si, thereby achieving the
   optimum bandgaps in a two-junction cell. The model indicates a limiting
   efficiency of 42.3\% under a concentration of 500 Suns (AM1.5D
   spectrum). This limiting efficiency is similar to that calculated for
   the planar lattice-matched triple-junction Ge/InGaAs/InGaP cell. Methods

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the combined performance of noise-cancellation
   and diversity-combining in an ACO-OFDM system. Noise cancellation and
   diversity combining are two techniques which have each been shown to
   improve the performance of ACO-OFDM, each giving a maximum improvement
   of 3dB. As noise cancellation reduces the noise at the detection point,
   while diversity combining adds two different signal components, it might
   be expected that combining the two techniques could give further
   performance gains. In this paper we show analytically that no additional
   performance gain can be achieved by combining the techniques. Simulation
   results are presented which are consistent with the analysis. It is also
   observed that the noise cancellation is more computationally efficient
   than diversity combining}},

Abstract = {{Standard methods for blast testing of structural materials and
   components are not currently available, but the designer must have a
   sense about the accuracy of the analytical and numerical methods used in
   blast analysis and the justification for accepting the results of
   different models. The objective of this chapter is to present the
   results of field tests conducted by the writers on full scale reinforced
   concrete and structural steel beams and columns. Extensive data captured
   during the test, including incident and reflective pressure, member
   displacements and strains, will be compared with results of some
   empirical and numerical models. The relative accuracy of the models will
   be gauged and the validity of certain assumptions in these models will
   be examined. Finally, recommendations regarding the suitability of each
   model and the need for standardizing test methods to assess the blast
   resistance of structures and the properties of materials under high
   strain rates will be highlighted.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Controlling gene expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) has opened
   the doors to a plethora of therapeutic possibilities, with many
   currently in the pipelines of drug development for various ocular
   diseases. Despite the potential of siRNA technologies, barriers to
   intracellular delivery significantly limit their clinical efficacy.
   However, recent progress in the field of drug delivery strongly suggests
   that targeted manipulation of gene expression via siRNA delivered
   through nanocarriers can have an enormous impact on improving
   therapeutic outcomes for ophthalmic applications. Particularly,
   synthetic nanocarriers have demonstrated their suitability as a
   customizable multifunctional platform for the targeted intracellular
   delivery of siRNA and other hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs in ocular
   applications. We predict that synthetic nanocarriers will simultaneously
   increase drug bioavailability, while reducing side effects and the need
   for repeated intraocular injections. This review will discuss the recent
   advances in ocular siRNA delivery via non-viral nanocarriers and the
   potential and limitations of various strategies for the development of a
   `universal' siRNA delivery system for clinical applications.}},

   drastically reduced to only 10\% of that of the original TLM-based AVM.
   This represents the ultimate memory reduction preserving the same
   accuracy of previously reported AVM approaches. Utilizing this approach,
   we can conduct AVM calculations for dielectric bulk structures 10 times
   larger. Our algorithm has been verified by comparison to the expensive
   finite difference approaches.}},

   investigate the effectiveness of using a neural network to significantly
   reduce the information density of streaming images so that objects can
   be readily identified by a limited set of primary parameters and act as
   an enhanced human machine interface (HMI). Many applications are
   envisioned including use in biomedical imaging, anomaly detection and as
   an assistive device for the visually impaired. A digital circuit was
   designed and tested using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and an
   off the shelf digital camera. Our results indicate that the networks can
   be readily trained when subject to limited sets of objects such as the
   alphabet. We can also separate limited object sets with rotational and
   positional invariance. The results also show that limited visual fields
   form with only local connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in the aspect ratio of silicon platelets grown by Lateral
   Diffusion Epitaxy (LDE) is achieved. Epitaxial growth is achieved by a
   compound graphite slider boat in which an oxidized silicon plate is
   placed above the seed line on the substrate. The function of the plate
   is to i) favor side wall growth by limiting vertical nucleation on the
   platelets, and ii) to enhance the surface smoothness by restricting
   diffusion of silicon to a horizontal direction. We have studied layer
   growth from the In-Si liquid phase by reducing the gap between substrate
   and plate. By reducing the gap, it allows for a more uniform growth of
   silicon from the side wall of the strip. In addition, we investigate
   repositioning the silicon seed line to a downward orientation. In this
   case, the diffusion rate increases due to a gravity effect.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic chain transfer using low-spin cobalt(II) complexes is applied
   in the microemulsion polymerization of methyl and n-butyl methacrylate.
   In the presence of a catalytic chain transfer agent the rate of
   polymerization decreases with an increasing cobalt(II) catalyst loading.
   The course of the polymerization can be captured by the Morgan-Kaler
   model extended with radical desorption and aqueous phase termination.
   Proper molecular weight control (i.e. a molecular weight distribution
   with a dispersity of similar to 2) is achieved, however, proves to be
   strongly dependent on the balance of cobalt(II) molecules and
   propagating radicals. The presence of a cobalt(II) catalyst enhances the
   likelihood of homogeneous nucleation, which decreases the colloidal
   stability in the methyl methacrylate microemulsion polymerizations. The
   n-butyl methacrylate microemulsion polymerizations on the other hand,
   display good colloidal stability and a remarkable increase in the
   nucleation efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a half-duplex amplify-and-forward two-way relaying
   network consisting of two sources with each having a single antenna and
   N relays with each having two antennas is considered. For such a system,
   a tight lower bound of pairwise error probability (PEP) of a maximum
   likelihood (ML) detector for any distributed linear dispersion code with
   a fixed average amplifier is derived, revealing that diversity gain
   cannot decay faster than ln(N) SNR/SNR2N, where SNR is signal to noise
   ratio. Particularly for the network having two relays, a distributed
   concatenated quasi-orthogonal space-time block code is proposed with two
   significant advantages. One advantage is that the equivalent channel
   matrices at the both source nodes turn to be the block-circulant
   matrices, with each block being a product of the two Alamouti channel
   matrices. The other advantage is that the equivalent noises at the both
   source nodes are Gaussian and white. Therefore, like the
   quasi-orthogonal space-time block code for a multi-antennas system, the
   proposed code for the relaying system still maintains low-decoding
   complexity for the ML detector. Furthermore, two asymptotic PEP formulae
   are attained to show that the code presented in this paper achieves the
   maximum diversity gain, i.e., meeting the lower bound of diversity gain,
   as well as the maximum coding gain for the square quadrature amplitude
   modulation (QAM) constellation.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of a relay to assist a source in communicating with its
   intended destination has the potential to provide a significant
   reduction in the power required to achieve a specified level of
   quality-of-service (QoS). In this paper we consider the case in which
   the relay operates in a channel that is orthogonal in time to that used
   by the source, and employs regenerative decode-and-forward (RDF) or
   non-regenerative decode-and-forward (NDF) relaying. We assign a price to
   the power of the relay relative to that of the source, and we consider
   the problem of jointly optimizing the source power, the relay power and,
   in the case of NDF relaying, the fractions of the time block allocated
   to the source and relay, so as to minimize the total cost of the power
   required to achieve a specified target rate, subject to constraints on
   the peak power levels employed by the source and the relay. In the RDF
   case, we obtain a closed-form solution to the problem. This solution
   clearly identifies when the peak power constraints are too tight to
   enable the target rate to be achieved. In the NDF case, the natural
   formulation of the problem is not convex, but we show that it can be
   precisely transformed into a convex problem that can be efficiently
   solved. Our numerical examples show that in a Rician fading environment
   the flexibility in channel resource allocation inherent in the NDF
   relaying strategy enables the target rate to be achieved on a
   significantly larger proportion of the channels.}},

   Our methodology is a two-stage approach is present. In the first stage,
   a Cauchy-based approximation model is constructed using coarsely
   discretized full-wave simulation. The accuracy of this model is improved
   using a space mapping (SM) approach. A limited number of high-fidelity
   antenna simulations are used in the SM phase. We show that our approach
   obtains a modeling accuracy comparable to that provided by direct Cauchy
   approximation of the high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation data. The
   computational cost is, however, much lower. We successfully illustrate
   our approach through a number of antenna modeling examples. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A novel framework for acceleration of particle filtering approaches to
   3D model-based, markerless visual tracking in monocular video is
   described. Specifically, we present a methodology for partitioning and
   mapping the computationally expensive weight-update stage of a particle
   filter to a graphics processing unit (GPU) to achieve particle- and
   pixel-level parallelism. Nvidia CUDA and Direct3D are employed to
   harness the massively parallel computational power of modern GPUs for
   simulation (3D model rendering) and evaluation (segmentation, feature
   extraction, and weight calculation) of hundreds of particles at high
   speeds. The proposed framework addresses the computational intensity
   that is intrinsic to all particle filter approaches, including those
   that have been modified to minimize the number of particles required for
   a particular task. Performance and tracking quality results for rigid
   object and articulated hand tracking experiments demonstrate markerless,
   model-based visual tracking on consumer-grade graphics hardware with
   pixel-level accuracy up to 95 percent at 60+ frames per second. The
   framework accelerates particle evaluation up to 49 times over a
   comparable CPU-only implementation, providing an increased particle
