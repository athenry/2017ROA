Abstract = {{The Multitarget Multi-Bernoulli (MeMBer) filter has been proposed as a
   computationally tractable approximation of the multitarget Bayes filter,
   but with significant bias in the cardinality estimates. In this paper, a
   new improved MeMBer filter is proposed as a solution to address these
   limitations, with stable and accurate cardinality estimates achieved.
   The biases derived from the two approximations used in the derivation of
   the MeMBer filter corrector are analyzed. The proposed filter gives a
   new form of the updated tracks in the filter corrector, and the
   over-estimated cardinality in dense clutter environment is corrected.
   The Gaussian Mixture (GM) approximation is used to implement the
   proposed filter. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave holography has been used as a fast (real-time) qualitative
   inversion method for more than two decades. Recently, a quantitative
   holographic method was proposed. However, since this method involves the
   solution of a large system of linear equations, it requires significant
   processing time. We propose a new reconstruction strategy that is still
   based on the principles of microwave holography but reduces the
   processing time by orders of magnitude. It has the same accuracy and
   spatial resolution as the previously proposed quantitative holography
   method, yet it performs in real time similarly to the qualitative
   methods. Validation is achieved through the inversion on data acquired
   with both simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic silver nanoplates are of interest for their shapedependent
   properties; however, their synthesis often requires surfactants and
   toxic chemicals. We report the first one-pot method for the green
   synthesis of colloidally stable triangular, hexagonal and dendric silver
   nanostructures, enabled by the unique physical and chemical architecture
   of ``hairy{''} cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Silver nanoplates were
   formed by irradiating a suspension of CNCs and silver nitrate in a UV
   chamber for as little as 5 min. Electron microscopy and diffraction
   analysis revealed that CNCs with low carboxyl content resulted in single
   crystal thin triangular nanoprisms. Increasing the CNC carboxyl content
   resulted in hexagonal nanosheets and flower-like/dendric structures. The
   synthesized nanoplates exhibited shape-dependent catalytic performance
   for methylene blue degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium oxide-nitride films was prepared by RF reactive magnetron
   sputtering in presence of helium, oxygen and nitrogen gases. The N-2 gas
   flow rate was varied for each consecutive run of sputtering at values of
   66, 72, 78, 84, and 90 sccm respectively. Zirconium oxide-nitride films
   showed structural variation in evolution of various textures as detected
   by X-ray diffraction. It showed good transmission values above 50\% for
   all samples. Wettability studies of zirconium oxide-nitride films was
   done by contact angle goniometer. All samples depict hydrophobic
   behaviour as all films have contact angle values above 90 degrees and as
   nitrogen gas flow rate increases, the films roughness as well as contact
   angle increases. Tribological test is done on zirconium oxide-nitride
   films coated on aluminium, brass and mild steel pins, which give
   excellent wear resistance compared to uncoated pins.}},

   results show that the location of gas inlet port has a greater influence
   on gas distribution inside the chamber where reactive gas will form
   coating. By having this information, one can able to modify the reactor
   geometry and gas flow openings along with its positions for better gas

   to facilitate the decoding and elimination of these interferences, and
   also to simultaneously deliver useful contents to the intended users.
   The performance of the proposed scheme can be explicitly evaluated, and

   that the runs in x are computable in linear time from lambda(x). Here we
   describe two algorithms for computing lambda(x) based on previous
   results known in different context, but for which no explicit exposition
   in this context had been given. These two algorithms execute in O(n(2))
   time in the worst case. The third algorithm presented that executes in
   Theta(n) time had been suggested and discussed previously, and we
   provide a more substantial discussion and prove of correctness for one
   of its steps. This algorithm achieves its linearity at the expense of
   prior computation of both the suffix array and the inverse suffix array
   of x. We then go on to sketch a new algorithm and its two variants that
   avoids prior computation of global data structures and indicate that in
   worst-case these algorithms perform in O(n log n) time.}},

Abstract = {{Mental vigilance monitoring is useful in helping people improve their
   prowess in situations such as sports, musical performance or
   occupational demands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide
   appropriate information for identification of vigilance lapses; however,
   almost all of the previous EEG based vigilance monitoring studies
   require high density EEG montages, with the added inconvenience of
   conductive gels and the requirement for accurate placement of
   electrodes. In this paper we propose a practical machine learning
   approach for identification of vigilance lapses using EEG signals
   recorded from a very sparse electrode configuration with only 4
   electrodes: 2 electrodes at the forehead and 2 electrodes behind the
   ears. This is a challenging problem since these four electrodes are
   easily contaminated by eye blinks and muscle artifacts. The performance
   of the proposed machine-learning based algorithm is demonstrated in a
   real world scenario where vigilance lapses are identified with about
   95\% accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Human recognition has been an active research area in the past decade.
   As the traditional biometrics such as face, fingerprint and iris have
   been widely deployed around the world, the vulnerability of such systems
   to falsification and spoofing attacks has been admitted. ECG is related
   to electrical activities of heart and is among the newer additions to
   biometric family. In addition to its inherent liveness detection, it is
   easy to collect. It can be easily captured from fingertips. However, ECG
   is a time-varying signal. Unlike most of previous works on ECG biometric
   that are limited to rest condition, we consider the effect of exercise
   on biometric performance of ECG. We consider the case that enrollment
   and testing are in different body conditions: rest and exercise. A
   feature selection is conducted to select features that are less affected
   by exercise. Selected features are then used for enrolling and testing
   the biometric system's users. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed approach performs significantly better than the
   state-of-the-art methods in ECG recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Computational offloading is an effective method to address the limited
   battery power of a mobile device, by executing some components of a
   mobile application in the cloud. In this paper, a novel offloading
   algorithm called `Dynamic Programming with Hamming Distance Termination'
   (denoted DPH) is presented. Our algorithm uses randomization and a
   hamming distance termination criterion to find a nearly optimal
   offloading solution quickly. The algorithm will offload as many tasks as
   possible to the cloud when the network transmission bandwidth is high,
   thereby improving the total execution time of all tasks and minimizing
   the energy use of the mobile device. The algorithm can find very good
   solutions with low computational overhead. A novel and innovative
   approach to fill the dynamic programming table is used to avoid
   unnecessary computations, resulting in lower computation times compared
   to other schemes. Furthermore, the algorithm is extensible to handle
   larger offloading problems without a loss of computational efficiency.
   Performance evaluation shows that the proposed DPH algorithm can achieve
   near minimal energy while meeting an application's execution time
   constraints, and it can find a nearly optimal offloading decision within
   a few iterations.}},

   multispectral images, we explore physically-induced, joint

   used to reveal that the discontinuities of a multi spectral image tend
   to align spatially across different spectral bands; in other words, the
   2D Laplacians of different bands are not only sparse but also agree with
   one the other in positions of significance. This strong prior of natural
   images can be incorporated, as an 6,2-norm regularization term, into an
   inverse problem formulation for superresolution of multispectral images
   Experiments show that exploiting the newly discovered joint
   spectral-spatial sparsities can improve the performance of existing
   methods, especially in spectral fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the level of
   uncertainty associated with the development of extreme weather frequency
   and intensity indices at the local scale. Several different global
   climate models, downscaling methods, and emission scenarios were used to
   develop extreme temperature and precipitation indices at the local scale
   in the Hamilton region, Ontario, Canada. Uncertainty associated with
   historical and future trends in extreme indices and future climate
   projections were also analyzed using daily precipitation and temperature
   time series and their extreme indices, calculated from gridded daily
   observed climate data along with and projections from dynamically
   downscaled datasets of CanRCM4 and PRECIS, and the statistically
   downscaled CIMP5 ensemble. A bias correction technique was applied to
   all raw daily temperature and precipitation time series prior to
   calculation of the indices.
   All climate models predicted increasing trends for extreme temperature
   indices, maximum 1-day and 5-day precipitation (RX1day and RX5day),
   total wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT), very heavy precipitation days
   (R20mm), Summer Days (SU), and Tropical Nights (TR) and decreasing trend
   for Forest Days (FD) and Ice Days (ID) in 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s
   compared to present. CanRCM4 model did consistently project values in
   the upper range of the CMIP5 ensemble while the PRECIS ensemble was more
   in-line with the CMIP5 mean values. This difference may however be a
   function of different emission scenarios used. (C) 2016 The Authors.

   validated, near optimal solutions at the expense of only a few
   high-fidelity full-wave simulations. Simplified models, even coarse
   electromagnetic models, could now be iteratively ``mapped{''} on-the-fly
   to full-wave models through the 1995 aggressive space mapping algorithm.

Abstract = {{A good compromise between size and electrical performance is an
   important design consideration for compact microwave structures.
   Comprehensive information about size/performance trade-offs can be
   obtained through multi-objective optimization. Due to considerable
   electromagnetic (EM) cross-couplings in highly compressed layouts, the
   design process has to be conducted at the level of high-fidelity EM
   analysis which is computationally prohibitive when using conventional
   methods (e.g., population-based metaheuristics). Here, we perform
   multi-objective design of compact structures using a domain patching
   algorithm. It is a low-cost and deterministic procedure for constructing
   the path connecting the extreme Pareto-optimal designs (obtained through
   auxiliary single-objective optimization runs), executed at the level of
   coarse-discretization EM simulations. The final representation of the
   Pareto front is then generated from response correction techniques. Our
   approach is illustrated through a compact impedance matching
   transformer.}},

Abstract = {{A novel methodology for miniaturization-oriented design of a class of
   wideband branch-line couplers is proposed. The initial design is chosen
   from a family of optimized circuits that feature a simplified
   two-section topology. Compact size of the coupler is attained by using
   quasi-periodic slow-wave structures instead of conventional lines. Our
   approach explicitly aims at circuit size reduction by adjusting the
   number of elements within the recurrent slow-wave structure and its
   designable parameters to reach the smallest coupler layout possible.
   This is achieved at a low cost by exploiting a surrogate-based
   optimization (SBO) process with the underlying model of the recurrent
   slow-wave structure composed of multiple response surface approximations
   (RSAs). The SBO scheme incorporates adaptively adjusted design
   specifications to converge in just two iterations. A rapid fine-tuning
   procedure is applied to account for T-junction effects omitted during
   the design process. Our methodology is illustrated through a numerical
   example supported by experimental verification.}},

Abstract = {{A cognition-driven formulation of space mapping (SM) is effective for
   equal-ripple optimization of microwave filter. In this paper, we use
   cognition-driven SM to estimate yield in the design of microwave
   filters. With mappings from the statistical variable space to feature
   parameter spaces, we can find the distribution of these intermediate
   feature parameters with respect to the statistical variables. A
   correction method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the mappings.
   Thus, we can determine the yield by checking whether the ripple height
   parameters and some specific feature frequency parameters satisfy the
   specifications or not. The number of EM simulations of the proposed
   yield estimation method is linear with respect to the number of
   statistical variables. We further propose a yield optimization method
   using our yield estimation. Our method is verified using a waveguide
   filter and Monte Carlo analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Struck-by-equipment hazard is a leading cause of construction
   fatalities. Although several proximity detection systems have been
   developed to alleviate the risks of this type of hazard, the frequently
   generated false alarms which do not represent actual hazardous
   situations have limited their real-world application. Therefore, the
   time-cuboid model is developed to enhance construction safety by
   preventing struck-by-equipment accidents with reduced false alarms. The
   time-cuboid model effectively reduces false alarms by (1) fully
   considering an entities' 3D position, orientation and velocity; (2)
   using a dynamic and adjusted warning distance; and (3) utilizing the
   developed safety rules which use relative position, moving direction,
   speed and a pairwise 3D safety query to identify actual as well as
   impending spatial interferences. Simulation and a controlled field
   experiment were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   time-cuboid model. The time-cuboid model is effective in reducing false
   alarms as no false negatives are generated and all obtained false
   positive rates (FPRs) are zero which are much lower than the FPRs of the
   prevalent proximity detection method (62.1\% averagely). The reduced
   alarm percentages (RAPs) indicate that at least 50.2\% alarms generated
   by the prevalent method can be avoided by the time-cuboid model.
   Reduction of false alarms contributes to enhancing construction safety,
   mobility and productivity.}},

   plasma-activated bonding which is based on physical sputtering followed
   by the formation of chemically reactive surfaces. The
   sequential-plasma-activated surfaces of glass and LCP show high
   hydrophilicity with moderate roughness. The adhesion between the
   activated LCP and glass surfaces is governed by hydroxyl group-mediated
   interfacial Si-OH-C covalent bonds. The post-bonding anodic treatment
   increases the amount of interfacial oxides by generating more
   singly-bonded oxides on the glass surface. The post-bonding thermal
   treatment rearranges the plasma-induced reactive sites and improves the
   conformal contact between the LCP and glass. A high bonding strength of
   6.3 MPa is obtained between the LCP and glass when both anodic and
   thermal treatments are used. This simple and low-temperature direct
   bonding process for LCP and glass provides insights for future bonding
   between polymers and thin glass films.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider retrieving individual wave components in a
   multi-directional sea wave model. To solve this problem, a currently and
   commonly used method is three-dimensional fast Fourier transform (3D
   FFT), which is based on the uniform frequency and the uniform wave
   number in wave number frequency domain. However, these uniformly
   sampling properties do not normally strictly satisfy the dispersion
   relation because of the limited analysis area selected from radar image
   sequence and as a result, the 3D FFT method incurs undesirable error
   performance. By deeply investigating the data structure, we obtain a new
   and decomposable matrix representation for processing the wave
   components and then, a novel iterative method is proposed to efficiently
   and effectively extract individual wave components, whose frequency and
   wave number rigorously satisfy the dispersion relation. Computer
   simulations show that our proposed new method always has better
   performance for retrieving ocean wave components from radar image
   sequences than the 3D FFT method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an inverter topology, which aims to connect several
   DC sources to the same AC output using a single stage of conversion.
   This topology has been given the name of multi-source inverter. This
   concept has been developed for applications such as hybrid electric
   powertrains. Specifically, this topology allows different DC-link
   voltages to drive a traction motor using the battery voltage as one of
   the voltage levels. Thus, the DC/DC converter used in hybrid powertrain
   architectures can be downsized by reducing its power rating. In this
   paper, the multi-source inverter topology is introduced and its
   different operating modes are determined through an analysis of the
   inverter circuit. Closed-loop simulations with an interior permanent
   magnet (IPM) synchronous machine were performed to verify the
   theoretical principles of operation. A scaled-down prototype was built
   and successfully tested in open loop control with an RL load. The
   experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology
   and concept.}},

Abstract = {{In single-phase AC onboard chargers for electrified vehicles,
   second-order harmonic current and corresponding ripple voltage exist on
   the DC bus. The low-frequency harmonic current is normally filtered
   using a bulk capacitor or an additional active filter (AF) circuit. This
   presents an obstacle for improving the power density as well as reducing
   the cost. In this paper, a dual active bridge (DAB)-based
   full-integrated active filter auxiliary power module (AFAPM) is
   presented so that when the high-voltage (HV) battery is charging, the
   DAB converter acts as an active filter; and when the low-voltage (LV)
   battery needs to be charged, the DAB converter works as a LV battery
   charger. Therefore, the required DC-link capacitance in the HV battery
   can be reduced significantly and, hence, the cost and volume of the
   dual-voltage system in the electrified vehicle applications can be
   reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the fabrication of MnO2-multiwalled carbon nanotube
   (MWCNT) electrodes for supercapacitors with high areal capacitances, low
   resistance and good capacitance retention at high charge-discharge
   rates, achieved at high active mass loadings. The key to achieving
   enhanced electrochemical performance was a good mixing of well dispersed
   MnO2 and MWCNT by an electrostatic assembly in the non-aqueous media.
   The approach is based on the use of anionic dispersants for MnO2 and
   cationic dispersants for MWCNT with selective adsorption. Strong
   adsorption of the dispersants on the particle surface was a prerequisite
   for efficient dispersion. The analysis of different adsorption
   mechanisms highlighted the importance of the use of chelating molecules,
   which allow for strong polydentate bonding. Testing results provided an
   insight into the influence of the functional groups and size of the
   dispersant molecules on the electrode performance. The highest
   capacitance of 2.39 F cm(-2) at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1) has been
   achieved for MnO2-MWCNT electrodes. The electrostatic assembly strategy
   has opened a path for the fabrication of efficient supercapacitor
   devices, which showed promising performance for practical applications.}},

   Control with Integral Action}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{A robust attitude motion synchronization problem is investigated for
   multiple 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) helicopters with input
   disturbances. The communication topology among the helicopters is
   modeled by a directed graph, and each helicopter can only access the
   angular position measurements of itself and its neighbors. The desired
   trajectories are generated online and not accessible to all helicopters.
   The problem is solved by embedding in each helicopter some finite-time
   convergent (FTC) estimators and a distributed controller with integral
   action. The FTC estimators generate the estimates of desired angular
   acceleration and the derivative of the local neighborhood
   synchronization errors. The distributed controller stabilizes the
   tracking errors and attenuates the effects of input disturbances. The
   conditions under which the tracking error of each helicopter converges
   asymptotically to zero are identified, and, for the cases with nonzero
   tracking errors, some inequalities are derived to show the relationship
   between the ultimate bounds of tracking errors and the design
   parameters. Simulation and experimental results are presented to
   demonstrate the performance of the controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency are two critical issues
   in the design of wireless communication networks. Energy harvesting
   cognitive radio networks have been recently proposed to attempt to solve
   both the issues simultaneously. In this paper, we consider a cognitive
   radio network in which the secondary transmitter equipped with an energy
   harvesting device is allowed to opportunistically access the primary
   channel. Here, we assume that energy arrival process and primary channel
   state are random process and twostate time-homogeneous discrete Markov
   process, respectively. By using the average throughput for the secondary
   network as a design criterion and jointly optimizing energy harvesting
   and spectrum sensing, we achieve both the energy efficiency and the
   spectrum efficiency. In addition, the corresponding optimal detection
   threshold and the maximum achievable throughput are obtained, which are
   substantiated by our comprehensive computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics model of the transient flow around a
   sprint canoe blade has been developed including the full blade motion in
   the catch and draw phases of the stroke, with the translational and
   rotational path of the blade is obtained from video analysis of a
   national team athlete. Examination of the blade path and associated flow
   patterns around the blade reveals the development of tip and side
   vortices and their interaction with the blade. An interval of reversed
   flow and pressure at the top of the blade late in the catch is seen and
   results in a braking pressure field on the blade surface. On-water
   measurements have also been made using a new instrumented paddle with
   multiple strain gauge full bridges. This level of bending moment
   measurement then allows the tracking of the real centre of pressure of
   the blade force and the determination of the real blade force (and its

   electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors were manufactured using

Pages = {{157-185}},
Abstract = {{Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) play a crucial role in hearing by encoding
   and transporting the synaptic input from inner hair cells into afferent
   spiking information for higher stages of the auditory system. If the
   inner hair cells are degenerated, cochlear implants may restore hearing
   by directly stimulating the ANFs. The response of an ANF is affected by
   several characteristics of the electrical stimulus and of the ANF, and
   neurophysiological measurements are needed to know how the ANF responds
   to a particular stimulus. However, recording from individual nerve
   fibers in humans is not feasible and obtaining compound neural or
   psychophysical responses is often time-consuming. This motivates the
   design and use of models to estimate the ANF response to the electrical
   stimulation. Phenomenological models reproduce the ANF response based on
   a simplified description of ANF functionality and on a limited parameter
   space by not directly describing detailed biophysical mechanisms. Here,
   we give an overview of phenomenological models published to date and
   demonstrate how different modeling approaches can account for the
   diverse phenomena affecting the ANF response. To highlight the success
   achieved in designing such models, we also describe a number of
   applications of phenomenological models to predict percepts of cochlear
   implant listeners.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a cooperative cognitive radio relay network
   (CCRRN), in which there is a pair of primary transmitter (PT) and
   primary receiver (PR) with each having a single antenna, a secondary
   transmitter (ST) equipped with two antennas and a secondary receiver
   (SR) having a single antenna. We assume that ST operates in a
   half-duplex mode with an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative
   transmission scheme adopted. For such a system, a novel transmission
   scheme for CCRRN based on uniquely-factorable constellation pair (UFCP)
   is proposed, which enables ST to transmit its own information to SR
   without knowing its channel links to PR and SR while assisting PT
   transmission. It is shown that one of significant advantages of our
   proposed new scheme is that in a noise-free case, PR and SR are able to
   decode their own signals uniquely and that in a Gaussian noise case,
   they are still able to reliably decode their own signals with full
   diversity. In addition, a tight upper bound of average pairwise error
   probability (PEP) for the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived,
   showing that full diversity is achieved. With this, an optimal power
   allocation strategy is proposed that minimizes the worst-case upper
   bound.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system is
   capable of tracking multiple targets under the ``defocused
   transmit-focused receive{''} (DTFR) operating mode in which each
   transmitter forms a completely defocused beam to illuminate the whole
   surveillance region and each receiver adopts a focused beam to attain a
   higher resolution. However, when operating in this mode, there exists a
   resource optimization problem on the allocation of receive-beams. To
   address this problem, a receive-beam resource allocation (RBRA) strategy
   is proposed in this paper. The key mechanism is to implement the optimal
   allocation between receive-beams and targets based on the feedback
   information in the tracking recursion cycle, for the purpose of
   improving the worst tracking accuracy with multiple targets. Since the
   posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) provides a tight lower bound on
   the accuracy of target state estimates, it is derived and adopted as an
   optimization criterion. It is shown that the optimal RBRA is a
   multidimensional non-convex assignment problem and we propose an
   effective convex relaxation optimization to solve it. Numerical results
   demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Tuning the properties of in situ-gelling injectable hydrogels based on
   synthetic polymers typically involves changing the chemistry of polymer
   backbones or the density of reactive functional groups on precursor
   polymers. Herein, we describe injectable, hydrazone crosslinked
   hydrogels based on well-defined poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate)
   (POEGMA) precursors prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain
   transfer (RAFT). These hydrogels have different molecular weights but
   similar functional group content, enabling engineering of hydrogel
   properties without substantially changing the chemistry of the precursor
   polymer. Specifically, although the number of functional crosslinks
   formed in each gel was found to be equivalent, hydrogels prepared with
   higher molecular weight precursor polymers showed faster gelation times,
   higher compressive and shear moduli, slower degradation, and less
   swelling than gels prepared with lower molecular weight precursor
   polymers. Thus, this approach is particularly attractive in cases in
   which separating the effects of physical and chemical changes to gel
   substrates is critical to understanding or controlling underlying
   biological interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified model of a landing gear is tested in a wind tunnel to
   investigate the effect of the landing light location on the resulting
   noise generation. Examination of the near-field pressure fluctuations,
   combined with phase-locked stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry of
   the unsteady wake identified two distinct sources of pressure
   fluctuations. The higher frequency source has a wide frequency band and
   is situated in the outer regions of the wake near the lights. On the
   other hand, the lower frequency source is found to be stronger, has a
   narrower frequency band and is developed further downstream in the wake,
   closer to the wake centreline. The lower frequency source is observed to
   be rather robust as it is hardly affected by the location of the landing
   lights, whereas the higher frequency source becomes weaker as the
   spacing between the lights is reduced. The effect of a splitter plate
   positioned downstream of the landing gear strut is also investigated as
   a means of reducing the lower frequency pressure fluctuations. Although
   the lower frequency source is considerably weakened by the splitter
   plate, substantial enhancement of the higher frequency source is

Abstract = {{Drug discovery is a long and expensive process, which usually takes
   12-15 years and could cost up to similar to\$1 billion. Conventional
   drug discovery process starts with high throughput screening and
   selection of drug candidates that bind to specific target associated
   with a disease condition. However, this process does not consider
   whether the chosen candidate is optimal not only for binding but also
   for ease of administration, distribution in the body, effect of
   metabolism and associated toxicity if any. A holistic approach, using
   model organisms early in the drug discovery process to select drug
   candidates that are optimal not only in binding but also suitable for
   administration, distribution and are not toxic is now considered as a
   viable way for lowering the cost and time associated with the drug
   discovery process. However, the conventional drug discovery assays using
   Drosophila are manual and required skill operator, which makes them
   expensive and not suitable for high-throughput screening. Recently,
   microfluidics has been used to automate many of the operations (e. g.
   sorting, positioning, drug delivery) associated with the Drosophila drug
   discovery assays and thereby increase their throughput. This review
   highlights recent microfluidic devices that have been developed for
   Drosophila assays with primary application towards drug discovery for
   human diseases. The microfluidic devices that have been reviewed in this
   paper are categorized based on the stage of the Drosophila that have
   been used. In each category, the microfluidic technologies behind each
   device are described and their potential biological applications are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-loop exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with variable geometry
   turbocharger (VGT) provides a flexible architecture for achieving
   desired intake manifold conditions, including temperature, pressure and
   oxygen concentration, which are critical for advanced combustion mode
   control in modern engines. HOW ever, the highly nonlinear system
   dynamics and strong coupling effects between loops make the widely used,
   control oriented model failed to trace the system states well,
   especially in transient situations. This paper presents a control method
   for this nonlinear, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with the
   compensation for modeling error and disturbance. By taking both the
   advantages of the knowledge of system dynamics and the idea of
   disturbance rejection, the modified active disturbance rejection control
   (ADRC) with extended states observer (ESO) was utilized to achieve such
   a control objective. Here, the term ``disturbance{''} lumps all the
   internal and external errors, including the modeling errors and coupling
   effects. By actively estimating the disturbance and compensating its
   effects, the intake manifold conditions can be controlled in a decoupled
   fashion. The proposed method was validated through high-fidelity
   GT-Power model simulations. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

Title = {{Influence of Floor Diaphragm-Wall Coupling on the System-Level Seismic
   Performance of an Asymmetrical Reinforced Concrete Block Building}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the inelastic seismic response of reinforced masonry shear
   walls (RMSW) is the first step to develop predictive models of the
   system-level (i.e.,complete building) response under different levels of
   seismic demand. Such predictive models will not only have to be capable
   of accurately accounting for the different system-level-specific aspects
   but will also have to be easy enough to be adopted by design engineers.
   In this respect, the influence of the floor diaphragms on a building's
   seismic response is typically recognized only through the role of the
   former in distributing the shear forces on the building's seismic force
   resisting system (SFRS) as a result of the diaphragms' in-plane
   stiffness. Subsequently, the current paper focuses on analyzing
   experimental data of a series of RMSW tested as individual components
   and within two asymmetrical building systems. The analyses showed that
   the out-of-plane stiffness of the floor diaphragms played an important
   role in flexurally coupling the RMSW aligned along the loading direction
   with those walls aligned orthogonally. This system-level aspect affected
   not only the different wall strength and displacement demands but also
   the failure mechanism sequence and the building's twist response. For
   the building system under consideration, the diaphragm-wall coupling
   resulted in doubling the building's initial stiffness, and also
   significantly increasing the building's strength. The results of the
   study show that neglecting diaphragm out-of-plane coupling influence on
   the RMSW at the system-level may result in unconservative designs and
   possibly undesirable component-level failure modes as a result of
   violating capacity design principles. To develop an analytical model
   that can account for the aforementioned influences, simplified
   load-displacement relationships were developed to predict RMSW
   component- and system-level responses under lateral seismic loads. In
   the current study, three approaches were proposed to account for the
   diaphragm coupling influences on the RMSW response. The developed
   analytical model presents a useful system-level response prediction tool
   for displacement- and performance-based seismic design of RMSW
   buildings.}},

   Robustness of an Asymmetrical Reinforced Concrete Block Building}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, research interests in studying the response of
   different seismic force-resisting systems have been shifting from
   component-level to system-level studies. Building on the existing
   knowledge of component-level performance of reinforced masonry shear
   walls (RMSW), the current study evaluates some similarities and
   discrepancies between RMSW system-level and component-level responses
   under seismic loading. The study also focuses on evaluating the
   system-level seismic robustness of a RMSW building by quantifying key
   relevant robustness indicators proposed in the literature. To meet the
   study objectives, an experimental asymmetrical two-story reduced-scale
   RMSW building was tested to failure under simulated seismic loading.
   Subsequently, the study first presents a brief summary of the
   experimental program followed by a discussion of the damage sequence and
   the load-displacement hysteretic behavior of the RMSW building. In
   general, the experimental results demonstrated the impact of both the
   floor slab-induced twist and wall flexural coupling through the floor
   slabs on the building response, with the latter significantly
   influencing the building response compared to the former. In addition,
   the robustness indexes quantified for five key robustness indicators
   (drift ratio, strength, stiffness, strain energy, and residual drift
   ratio) can provide a means by which the system-level performance of RMSW
   buildings can be assessed from different perspectives under a wide range
   of seismic demands.}},

Abstract = {{As the interest in functional connectivity continues to increase among
   neuroimaging researchers there becomes a greater need to develop an
   objective method of network identification. The current paper offers a
   solution to this problem by developing a robust decision making
   algorithm that can extract a target neural network from an array of
   spatial maps. We used a probabilistic independent component analysis to
   generate spatial maps of the Default Mode Network (DMN); however, this
   adaptive pipeline can be applied to any network of interest. Different
   template matching algorithms including: Normalized Cross-Correlation,
   Sum of Squared Differences and Dice Coefficient, were applied to the
   spatial and frequency domains of the dataset to identify the components
   that shared the greatest similarity to our DMN template. After
   identifying components within the resting state, the decision making
   pipeline selected the components within each method that had the highest
   matching scores to our DMN template. The final decision of selecting the
   most prototypical DMN components was made by a comparison between
   methods. This resulted in a DMN mask that was generated by the
   components chosen by our decision-making algorithm. To evaluate the
   accuracy of the decision-maker, a cross-correlation between each final
   mask and the template was measured. Results indicated that the
   Normalized Cross Correlation method, using both the spatial and
   frequency domain, and the Dice Coefficient method, generated the optimal
   DMN mask. This demonstrates the utility of our algorithm in providing an
   objective method for network extraction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},

Pages = {{229-243}},
Abstract = {{The connected vehicle is a rapidly emerging paradigm aimed at deploying
   and developing a fully connected transportation system that enables data
   exchange among vehicles, infrastructure, and mobile devices to improve
   mobility, enhance safety, and reduce the adverse environmental impacts
   of the transportation systems. This study focuses on micromodeling and
   quantitatively assessing the potential impacts of the connected vehicle
   (CV) on mobility, safety, and the environment. To assess the benefits of
   CVs, a modeling framework is developed based on traffic microsimulation
   for a real network located in the city of Toronto, Canada, to mimic
   communication between enabled vehicles. In this study, we examine the
   effects of providing real-time routing guidance and advisory warning
   messages to CVs. In addition, to take into account the rerouting in
   nonconnected vehicles (non-CVs) in response to varying sources of
   information such as apps, global positioning systems (GPS), variable
   message signs (VMS), or simply seeing the traffic back up, the impact of
   fraction of non-CV vehicles was also considered and evaluated.
   Therefore, vehicles in this model are divided into;
   uninformed/unfamiliar not connected (non-CV), informed/familiar but not
   connected (non-CV) that get updates infrequently every 5 minutes or so
   (non-CV), and connected vehicles that receive information more
   frequently (CV). The results demonstrate the potential of connected
   vehicles to improve mobility, enhance safety, and reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHGs) at the network-wide level. The results also show
   quantitatively how the market penetration of connected vehicles
   proportionally affects the performance of the traffic network. While the
   presented results are pertinent to the specifics of the road network
   modeled and cannot be generalized, the quantitative figures provide
   researchers and practitioners with ideas of what to expect from vehicle
   connectivity concerning mobility, safety, and environmental
   improvements.}},

   using the hexagonal lattice formed from the Eisenstein integers and the
   recently developed concept of the uniquely factorable constellation

   and efficiently construct unitary hexagonal UFCs of various sizes. In
   addition, an optimal energy scale is found to maximize the coding gain
   for the unitary training hexagonal UFC schemes subject to a transmission

Abstract = {{This paper addresses real-time optimization strategies which can be
   readily implemented in industrial polymerization processes, even in case
   they show very fast dynamics. At the upper layer dynamic and
   steady-state real-time optimizations (D-RTO and RTO) are suggested and
   compared. A novel multistage formulation for the real-time dynamic
   optimization problem is introduced. It relies on a purely economic
   objective without additional stabilizing terms and facilitates an
   integrated treatment of a sequence of alternating dynamic and stationary
   operational stages. A case study shows that closed-loop D-RTO allows
   reducing off-spec material as well as exploiting or rejecting
   disturbances to maximize overall profit. The computational delay not
   only determines closed-loop performance but also significantly impacts
   the profit margin. The results indicate that even the simplest variant
   of the investigated strategies can significantly improve economic
   performance, since the transitions can be completed much faster than in
   current industrial practice. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the synthesis of oxygen (O-2)-switchable
   thermo-responsive random copolymers based on fluorinated acrylamide
   monomer homologues: N-(2-fluoroethyl)acrylamide (F1EA),
   N-(2,2-difluoroethyl)acrylamide (F2EA), and
   N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)acrylamide (F3EA). Copolymerizing these monomers
   with N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMA) via reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization yields
   thermo-responsive random copolymers, which have dual switchability
   towards O-2 and carbon dioxide (CO2). The inherent low critical solution
   temperature (LCST) of these copolymers can be precisely designed in a
   wide range of temperatures by varying their chemical compositions.
   Importantly, this LCST can be reversibly switched to different levels by
   respectively purging O-2 or CO2 into the aqueous solution, and can be
   recovered to its initial state by washing off the trigger gas. This work
   provides a versatile and effective approach for the preparation of
   O-2-responsive polymers, with a big operation window of temperature.}},

Abstract = {{A new model of the effective thermal conductivity of randomly
   distributed loads of mono-sized metal parts of arbitrary geometry heated
   under natural convective and radiation heat transfer has been developed.
   A series of transient heating experiments has been performed in a
   batch-type furnace using loads comprised of parts of various geometries,
   sizes, steel grades, and void fractions and at various furnace set point
   temperatures. Experimental results showed a strong dependency of the
   load effective thermal conductivity on: (1) load void fraction, (2)
   internal radiation between parts, and (3) external radiation between
   parts and furnace enclosure. An assessment of a number of effective
   thermal conductivity models reported in the literature and developed for
   packed beds and porous media has been carried out. This assessment led
   to the development of the present model, which incorporates a new
   additional temperature difference term that accounts for external
   radiation and a new generalized characteristic length scale that can be
   used for parts of any arbitrary geometry. All thermophysical properties
   of solid and gaseous phases have been considered as functions of the
   parts temperature. The proposed model is in good agreement, within +/-
   25 \%, with the experimental data obtained for the various part
   geometries, load void fractions, and the surrounding temperatures
   considered in this investigation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the dynamic 2nd-order Smooth Variable Structure
   Filter (Dynamic 2nd-order SVSF) method for the purpose of robust state
   estimation. Thereafter, it presents an application of this method for
   condition monitoring of an electro-hydrostatic actuator system. The
   SVSF-type filtering is in general designed based on the sliding mode
   theory; whereas the sliding mode variable is equal to the innovation
   (measurement error). In order to formulate the dynamic 2nd-order SVSF, a
   dynamic sliding mode manifold is defined such that it preserves the
   first and second order sliding conditions. This causes that the
   measurement error and its first difference are pushed toward zero until
   reaching the existence subspace. Hence, this filter benefits from the
   robustness and chattering suppression properties of the second order
   sliding mode systems. These help the filter to suppress the undesirable
   chattering effects without the need for approximation or interpolation
   that however reduces accuracy and robustness of the SVSF-type filtering.
   In order to investigate the performance of the dynamic 2nd-order SVSF
   for state estimation, it applies to an Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator
   (EHA) system under the normal and uncertain scenarios. Simulation
   results are then compared with ones obtained by other estimation methods
   such as the Kalman filter and the 1st-order SVSF method.}},

Abstract = {{Car tracking algorithms have recently found a major role in intelligent
   automotive applications. They are mainly based on the state estimation
   techniques to solve the maneuvering car tracking problems. The dynamic
   2nd-order SVSF method is a novel robust state estimation method that is
   based on the variable structure control theory. It benefits from the
   accuracy, robustness, and chattering suppression properties of second
   order sliding mode systems for robust state estimation. The main
   contribution of this paper is to present and implement a new tracking
   strategy that is a combination of the dynamic 2nd\_ order SVSF with the
   IMM filter. It benefits from the robust performance of the dynamic
   2nd-order SVSF and the switching property of the IMM filter. This
   strategy is simulated and examined under several car driving patterns
   and experimental position data that are captured by a GPS device. The
   robustness and efficiency of this strategy is then compared with the

Title = {{Molecular dynamic simulations of pressure-driven water transport through
   polyamide nanofiltration membranes at different membrane densities}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{68}},
Pages = {{63586-63596}},
Abstract = {{In the real membrane manufacture of polyamide (PA) thin-film composite
   membranes, the membrane density is unevenly distributed in the PA active
   layer, and the membrane performance may be influenced by the membrane
   density. Due to the limitation of traditional experimental approaches,
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to investigate the
   effect of PA density on membrane structures and transport properties.
   The amorphous aromatic PA membranes studied in this work were modeled as
   nanofiltration (NF) membranes, and the water flows passing through the
   membranes were driven by 1.0 to 100 MPa pressure difference. Each
   membrane was a cube composed of several linear PA polymeric molecules,
   and the number of linear PA polymers in the cube was varied to give
   different densities. The simulation results show that the fractional
   free-volume and average free-volume pore size of the PA membrane both
   decrease with increasing membrane density, leading to a decrease in
   water permeability. When the membrane is denser than 1368 kg m(-3), the
   membrane is nonporous and the water flow is blocked even at 100 MPa
   pressure difference. The structures and the transport properties of the
   modeled PA membranes are compared with the PA top layer of a commercial
   NF membrane; the FilmTec (R) NF 90 membrane. This comparison shows that
   the simulation results of the modeled PA membrane are similar to the
   experimental results of the real NF 90 membrane. The MD simulations are
   thus feasible as a means of studying pressure-driven water transport
   through an amorphous polymeric membrane on a molecular scale, and
   provide a direct way to reveal the relationship between the free-volume
   property of the polymeric membrane and the pressure-driven water
   transport.}},

Volume = {{141}},

Pages = {{3511-3525}},
Abstract = {{Rapid prototyping is a critical step in the product development cycle of
   miniaturized chemical and bioanalytical devices, often categorized as
   lab-on-a-chip devices, biosensors, and micro-total analysis systems.
   While high throughput manufacturing methods are often preferred for
   large-volume production, rapid prototyping is necessary for
   demonstrating and predicting the performance of a device and performing
   field testing and validation before translating a product from research
   and development to large volume production. Choosing a specific rapid
   prototyping method involves considering device design requirements in
   terms of minimum feature sizes, mechanical stability, thermal and
   chemical resistance, and optical and electrical properties. A rapid
   prototyping method is then selected by making engineering trade-off
   decisions between the suitability of the method in meeting the design
   specifications and manufacturing metrics such as speed, cost, precision,
   and potential for scale up. In this review article, we review four
   categories of rapid prototyping methods that are applicable to
   developing miniaturized bioanalytical devices, single step, mask and
   deposit, mask and etch, and mask-free assembly, and we will focus on the
   trade-offs that need to be made when selecting a particular rapid
   prototyping method. The focus of the review article will be on the
   development of systems having a specific arrangement of conductive or
   semiconductive materials.}},

   predict dispersibility}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{12247-12257}},
Abstract = {{The production of well-dispersed reinforced polymer nanocomposites has
   been limited due to poor understanding of the interactions between
   components. Measuring the cohesive particle-particle interactions and
   the adhesive particle-polymer interactions is challenging due to
   nanoscale dimensions and poor colloidal stability of nanoparticles in
   many solvents. We demonstrate a new cohesive interaction measurement
   method using cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as a model system; CNCs have
   recently gained attention in the composites community due to their
   mechanical strength and renewable nature. Multi-wavelength surface
   plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) was used to monitor the swelling of
   CNC thin films to elucidate the primary forces between CNCs. This was
   achieved by measuring swelling in situ in water, acetone, methanol,
   acetonitrile, isopropanol, and ethanol and relating the degree of
   swelling to solvent properties. Films swelled the most in water where we
   estimate 1.2-1.6 nm spacings between CNCs (or 4-6 molecular layers of
   water). Furthermore, a correlation was found between film swelling and
   the solvent's Hildebrand solubility parameter (R-2 = 0.9068). The
   hydrogen bonding component of the solubility parameters was more closely
   linked to swelling than the polar or dispersive components. The films
   remained intact in all solvents, and using DLVO theory we have
   identified van der Waals forces as the main cohesive interaction between
   CNCs. The trends observed suggest that solvents (and polymers) alone are
   not sufficient to overcome CNC-CNC cohesion and that external energy is
   required to break CNC agglomerates. This work not only demonstrates that
   SPR can be used as a tool to measure cohesive particle-particle
   interactions but additionally advances our fundamental understanding of
   CNC interactions which is necessary for the design of cellulose
   nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{Fully microscopic many-body models are used to determine important
   material characteristics of GaAsBi and InAsBi based devices.
   Calculations based on the band anti-crossing (BAC) model are compared to
   first principle density functional theory (DFT) results. Good agreement
   between BAC-based results and experimental data is found for properties
   that are dominated by states close to the bandgap, like absorption/gain
   and photo luminescence. Using the BAC model for properties that involve
   states in the energetic region of the BAC defect level, like Auger
   losses and free carrier absorption results in a sharp resonance in the
   dependence of these quantities for Bismuth concentrations for which the
   bandgap becomes resonant with the spin-orbit splitting or the
   BAC-splitting of the light and heavy hole bands. DFT calculations show
   that the BAC model strongly over-simplifies the influence of the bismuth
   atoms on the bandstructure. Taking into account the more realistic
   results of DFT calculations should lead to a reduction of the sharp
   resonance and lead to enhancements or suppressions for other Bismuth
   concentrations and spectral regions.}},

Abstract = {{Climate models project a much more substantial warming than the 2
   degrees C target under the more probable emission scenarios, making
   higher-end scenarios increasingly plausible. Freshwater availability
   under such conditions is a key issue of concern. In this study, an
   ensemble of Euro-CORDEX projections under RCP8.5 is used to assess the
   mean and low hydrological states under +4 degrees C of global warming
   for the European region. Five major European catchments were analysed in
   terms of future drought climatology and the impact of +2 degrees C
   versus +4 degrees C global warming was investigated. The effect of bias
   correction of the climate model outputs and the observations used for
   this adjustment was also quantified. Projections indicate an
   intensification of the water cycle at higher levels of warming. Even for
   areas where the average state may not considerably be affected, low
   flows are expected to reduce, leading to changes in the number of dry
   days and thus drought climatology. The identified increasing or
   decreasing runoff trends are substantially intensified when moving from
   the +2 to the +4 degrees of global warming. Bias correction resulted in
   an improved representation of the historical hydrology. It is also found
   that the selection of the observational data set for the application of
   the bias correction has an impact on the projected signal that could be
   of the same order of magnitude to the selection of the Global Climate
   Model (GCM).}},

Abstract = {{A key challenge for silicon photonic systems is the development of
   compact on-chip light sources. Thulium-doped fiber and waveguide lasers
   have recently generated interest for their highly efficient emission
   around 1.8 mu m, a wavelength range also of growing interest to
   silicon-chip based systems. Here, we report on highly compact and
   low-threshold thulium-doped microcavity lasers integrated with
   silicon-compatible silicon nitride bus waveguides. The 200-mu m-diameter
   thulium microlasers are enabled by a novel high quality-factor
   (Q-factor) design, which includes two silicon nitride layers and a

Abstract = {{Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a widely used animal model to
   study mechanisms of biological processes and human diseases. To
   facilitate manipulations of C. elegans in the laboratory, researchers
   have developed various tools that permit careful monitoring of behavior
   and changes in cellular processes. Earlier, we had reported a novel
   microfluidic assay device to study the neuronal basis of movement and to
   investigate the effects of cellular and environmental factors that can
   induce degeneration in certain neurons leading to movement disorder. The
   system involved the use of an electric field to perform electrotaxis
   assays, which allows detailed examination of movement responses of
   animals. One of the potential uses of this system is to perform genetic
   and chemical screenings for neuroprotective factors; however, it could
   not be done due to manual operations and low throughput. In this paper,
   we present an integrated microfluidic system that automates screening of
   C. elegans behavioral response using electrotaxis. The core component of
   system is a multilayer poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) device, which
   enables C. elegans loading, capture, flush, release, electrotaxis, and
   clean sequentially with the help of other components. The system is
   capable of screening C. elegans, at a throughput of more than 20 worms
   per hour, automatically and continually without human intervention. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, C. elegans neuronal mutants
   were screened, and the phenotype data were extracted and analyzed. We
   envision that the automatic screening potential of the system will
   accelerate the study of neuroscience, drug discovery, and genetic
   screens in C. elegans. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{1832-1860}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical model to describe the low temperature magnetoresistivity
   of high purity copper single and polycrystals containing different
   density and distribution of dislocations has been developed. In the
   model, magnetoresistivity tensor is evaluated numerically using the
   effective medium approximation. The anisotropy of dislocation-induced
   relaxation time is considered by incorporating two independent energy
   bands with different relaxation times and the spherical and cylindrical
   Fermi surfaces representing open, extended and closed electron orbits.
   The effect of dislocation microstructure is introduced by means of two
   adjustable parameters corresponding to the length and direction of
   electron orbits in the momentum space, which permits prediction of
   magnetoresistance of FCC metals containing different density and
   distribution of dislocations. The results reveal that dislocation
   microstructure influences the character of the field-dependent
   magnetoresistivity. In the orientation of the open orbits, the quadratic
   variation in magnetoresistivity changes to quasi-linear as the density
   of dislocations increases. In the closed orbit orientation, dislocations
   delay the onset of magnetoresistivity saturation. The results indicate
   that in the open orbit orientations of the crystals, the anisotropic
   relaxation time due to small-angle dislocation scattering induces the
   upward deviation from Kohler's rule. In the closed orbit orientations
   Kohler's rule holds, independent of the density of dislocations. The
   results obtained with the model show good agreement with the
   experimental measurements of transverse magnetoresistivity in deformed
   single and polycrystal samples of copper at 2 K.}},

Journal = {{SOLID EARTH}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{177-190}},
Abstract = {{Soil salinity management can be complex, expensive, and time demanding,
   especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Besides taking no action,
   possible management strategies include amelioration and adaptation
   measures. Here we apply the World Overview of Conservation Approaches
   and Technologies (WOCAT) framework for the systematic analysis and
   evaluation and selection of soil salinisation amelioration technologies
   in close collaboration with stakeholders. The participatory approach is
   applied in the RECARE (Preventing and Remediating degradation of soils
   in Europe through Land Care) project case study of Timpaki, a semiarid
   region in south-central Crete (Greece) where the main land use is
   horticulture in greenhouses irrigated by groundwater. Excessive
   groundwater abstractions have resulted in a drop of the groundwater
   level in the coastal part of the aquifer, thus leading to seawater
   intrusion and in turn to soil salinisation. The documented technologies
   are evaluated for their impacts on ecosystem services, cost, and input
   requirements using a participatory approach and field evaluations.
   Results show that technologies which promote maintaining existing crop
   types while enhancing productivity and decreasing soil salinity are
   preferred by the stakeholders. The evaluation concludes that rainwater
   harvesting is the optimal solution for direct soil salinity mitigation,
   as it addresses a wider range of ecosystem and human well-being
   benefits. Nevertheless, this merit is offset by poor financial
   motivation making agronomic measures more attractive to users.}},

Title = {{Effect of posture on forces and moments measured in a Hybrid III ATD
   lower leg}},
Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{381-385}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) are used to assess real
   injury risk to occupants of vehicles during injurious events. In the
   lower leg, values from load cells are compared to injury criteria
   developed in cadaveric studies. These criteria are typically developed
   with the leg in a neutral posture, whereas the ATD may assume a wide
   range of postures during safety evaluation tests. The degree to which
   the initial posture of an ATD has an effect on the measured forces and
   moments in the lower leg is unknown.
   Methods: A Hybrid III ATD lower leg was impacted in a range of postures
   under conditions representing a crash test, and peak axial force and
   adjusted tibia index injury measures were evaluated. Ankle posture was
   varied in 5 increments using a custom-made footplate, and
   dorsi/plantarflexion (20 degrees DF to 20 degrees PF) and in/eversion
   (20 degrees IV to 5 degrees EV) were evaluated. Tibia angle was also
   varied (representing knee flexion/extension) by +/-10 degrees from
   neutral.
   Results: Peak axial force was not affected by ankle flexion or tibia
   angulation. Adjusted tibia index was lowest for plantarflexion, as well
   as for tibia angles representative of knee extension. Both peak axial
   force and adjusted tibia index were lowest for postures of great
   inversion and were highest in neutral or near neutral postures.
   Conclusions: The range of postures tested herein spanned published
   injury criteria and thus would have made the difference between pass and
   fail in a safety evaluation. In/eversion had the largest influence on
   injury metrics, likely due to the change in axial stiffness and altered
   impact durations in these postures. Results suggest increased injury
   risk at neutral or near-neutral postures, whereas previous cadaveric
   studies have suggested that in/eversion does not influence injury risk.
   It is unclear whether the ATD appropriately represents the natural lower
   leg for impacts in out-of-position testing. Great care must be taken
   when initially positioning ATDs for safety evaluations, because small
   perturbations in posture were shown herein to have large effects on the
   measured injury risk using this tool.}},

Title = {{Effect of Deformation-induced Residual Stress on Peel Strength of
   Polymer Laminated Sheet Metal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADHESION}},

Pages = {{862-876}},
Abstract = {{The adhesion between adhesively bonded polymer film and a metallic sheet
   substrate in a polymer laminated sheet metal (PLSM) subjected to large
   deformation, such as in a forming process, is influenced by two
   deformation-induced factors. These are (i) evolution of surface
   roughness of metallic substrate with applied strain and (ii) development
   of residual stress in the polymer adherend (polymer film with a thin
   uniform adhesive layer on one side) arising from significant differences
   in the deformation behavior of metal and polymeric components. A new
   experimental methodology was devised in this study to decouple the
   effects of substrate surface roughness and residual stress on
   interfacial peel strength (IPS) of uniaxially deformed PLSMs. This
   methodology was based on 180 degrees peel testing of PLSM specimens
   prepared under two different lamination conditions, one involving
   systematic pre-straining in uniaxial tension of the metallic substrate
   prior to laminations and the other involving post-lamination
   pre-straining of the PLSM. The role of pre-strain and peel test speed,
   for the above laminations conditions, were critically analyzed for their
   effect on IPS of two differently tailored PLSM systems. The IPS results
   were attributed to the effect of deformation-induced residual stress and
   metallic surface roughness. The analysis suggests that IPS is strongly
   dependent upon the residual stress induced by uniaxial deformation but
   only marginally on substrate surface roughness depending upon the
   constituents (film and adhesive) of the adherend. The magnitude of
   pre-strain was inversely and non-linearly related to IPS for both
   deformed PLSMs. Peel test speed, on the other hand, showed a more
   complex behavior in terms of IPS for the two PLSM systems.}},

Abstract = {{Post-polymerization modification of poly( allylamine hydrochloride) was
   applied to synthesize a library of amide-linked polyelectrolytes with
   tethered aliphatic, aromatic, and cubyl moieties. The efficacy of
   amidation was determined to be between 12 and 98 \%, depending on the
   electronics, sterics, and solubility of the amide linkage. C-13
   solid-state NMR was used to further validate their structure.
   Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry
   analysis indicated that none of the new polymers displayed a classic
   melt/freeze profile, but all displayed onset decomposition temperatures
   smaller than 215 degrees C. We anticipate that the structure-property
   relationships observed in the resulting library of graft-modified
   polymers can facilitate better understanding of how to design
   polyelectrolytes for the construction of well-defined multilayer
   systems.}},

Title = {{Unexpected Selectivity of UV Light Activated Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
   Gas Sensors by Two Different Redox Processes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The conflict between the two existing models was resolved, to provide a
   clear explanation for the unexpected ``selectivity{''} found in UV light
   activated metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors during the
   detection of reducing agents. A new model based on the dynamic
   equilibrium of adsorbed oxygen concentration was constructed by two
   types of responses: (1) when the MOS surface is adsorbed with oxygen,
   the conductance of the sensor increases upon injection of reducing
   agents (RA) (alpha-type) and (2) when the MOS surface is not covered by
   oxygen, the conductance decreases upon injection of RA (beta-type). The
   proposed model was verified by the experiments of ZnO based MOS gas
   sensors, to reveal the origin of the unexpected ``selectivity{''} found
   by the optimum intensity, where the current drop, due to the reaction
   between RA and MOS, which increases with UV power and levels with the
   reciprocal background current, which decreases with the UV power.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{304-311}},
Abstract = {{Limited access to disinfected drinking water is a critical challenge in
   developing countries. Ionic silver has biocidal capabilities and silver
   ionization is an established method for cooling water disinfection.
   However, silver ionization cannot be used in drinking water treatment
   because of its inherent human health risks. In this proof-of-concept
   study, a laboratory scale electrochemical reactor was developed where
   ionic silver is released via oxidation of metallic silver and
   subsequently recovered through cathodic reduction. Complete inactivation
   of Escherichia coli was demonstrated in 30 min at an application of 1.2
   V. A high silver concentration (>1 mg L-1) was achieved in less than two
   minutes of water residence time within the disinfection reactor. The
   effluent silver concentration was linearly proportional to the electric
   current, allowing reliable estimation of silver concentration and
   corresponding disinfection performance by measuring electric current
   using an electrical multimeter. The disinfected water was further
   treated in a separate silver recovery cell. The silver concentration
   dropped down to safe levels for continued human consumption (0.1 mg L-1)
   via spontaneous cathodic silver reduction coupled with anodic oxidation
   of metallic aluminum. The estimated energy requirement was 6.1 kJ to
   treat 1 m(3) of water; thus, solar panels or bicycle generators can
   provide sufficient energy for disinfection. The electrochemical
   disinfection and subsequent silver recovery methods have a strong
   potential as a prospective method to supply safe drinking water in
   underprivileged and remote societies.}},

Abstract = {{Many biodetection systems employ labile enzymes and substrates that need
   special care, making it hard to routinely use them for point-of-care or
   field applications. In this work we provide a simple solution to this
   challenging problem through the creation of all-inclusive pullulan assay
   tablets. The proposed tablet system not only enhances the long-term
   stability of both enzymes and organic substrates, but also simplifies
   the assay procedure. The enhanced stability is attributed to two
   factors: the restriction of the molecular motion of proteins and
   impermeability to molecular oxygen afforded by the tables. These tablets
   dissolve rapidly upon addition to testing samples, making the test very
   easy to perform. Using the ATP-detecting luciferase-luciferin system as
   an example, we show that the tablet-based assay can achieve highly
   sensitive detection of ATP in biological samples and that the activity
   of the assay tablets remains unchanged for over a month at room
   temperature.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{4387-4394}},
Abstract = {{The modulation of protein activity is of significance for disease
   therapy, molecular diagnostics, and tissue engineering. Nanoparticles
   offer a new platform for the preparation of protein conjugates with
   improved protein properties. In the present work, Escherichia coli (E.
   coli) inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) and poly(methacrylic acid)
   (PMAA) were attached together to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), forming
   AuNP-PPase-PMAA conjugates having controllable multi-biofunctionalities
   and responsiveness to pH. By treating with poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl
   methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and regulating the pH, the bioactivity of the
   conjugate becomes ``on/off{''}-switchable. In addition, by taking
   advantage of the ability of AuNPs to undergo reversible
   aggregation/dispersion, the conjugates can be recycled and reused
   multiple times; and due to the shielding effect of the PMAA, the
   conjugated enzyme has high resistance to protease digestion. This
   approach has considerable potential in areas such as controlled delivery
   and release of drugs, biosensing, and biocatalysis.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{15770-15781}},
Abstract = {{Manipulation of the relative swelling and volume fractions of the
   microgel and bulk hydrogel phases of nanocomposite hydrogels containing
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) is demonstrated to
   enable higher on-off state resolution and enhanced total duration of
   pulsatile drug release potential when the nanocomposites are activated
   by an alternating magnetic field. Adjusting the microgel chemistry to
   create microgels that have less deswelling below 37 degrees C and more
   proportional deswelling between 37 degrees C and 43 degrees C,
   increasing the volume fraction of microgels in the nanocomposite (while
   maintaining the mechanical stability of the nanocomposite), and limiting
   the swelling capacity of the surrounding hydrogel were all found to
   improve the degree of enhanced release that occurs after an
   externally-operated AMF pulse. Collectively, these results serve both to
   optimize the function of these nanocomposite materials for pulsatile
   drug delivery as well as confirm the proposed mechanism of pulsatile
   release, by which free volume is generated within the nanocomposite at
   the thermoresponsive microgel-bulk hydrogel interface upon internal
   heating of the device via SPION-driven hysteresis heating of the
   nanocomposite in an alternating magnetic field. Coupled with the
   injectability, degradability, mechanical stability, and
   cytocompatibility of these nanocomposites, we anticipate potential
   applications as advanced `smart' drug delivery technologies that can be
   operated via an external and non-invasive trigger.}},

Title = {{The microscale flocculation test (MFT)-A high-throughput technique for
   optimizing separation performance}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{85-93}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a new microscale flocculation test (MFT) method was
   developed that is ideally suited for optimizing separation performance.
   A critical and complicated task in wastewater treatment is to identify
   the flocculation conditions that yield the optimal separation of water
   from suspended solid materials. The standard `jar test' method is
   inadequate for conducting a full process optimization because a typical
   set-up only allows for a maximum of 6 tests to be conducted at once and
   fairly large volumes of materials (approximately 1 to 2 L) are needed
   for each individual test. The microplate-based, parallel processing
   format of the MFT method allows for dozens of flocculation tests to be
   conducted simultaneously, with each test requiring only a few
   millilitres of material. As a demonstration of the MFT method, ten
   cationic polymer flocculants were evaluated with various digestate
   types. The optimal separation performance, as determined by the lowest
   capillary suction time (CST), was found by rigorously evaluating the
   effect of flocculent type (including molecular weight and charge
   density) and dosage conditions (including total amount added and single
   versus staged addition). For example, the dose-dependent profiles for
   certain flocculants exhibited a nearly 10-fold greater decrease in CST
   compared to other flocculants. Process optimization in environmental
   separations is not trivial, but rather, is a complicated task that
   requires an extensive amount of experimental work for which the MFT
   method is ideally suited. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that SnO2-based nanocomposites offer excellent
   electrical, optical, and electrochemical properties. In this article, we
   present the facile and cost-effective fabrication, characterization and
   testing of a new SnO2-PbS nanocomposite photocatalyst designed to
   overcome low photocatalytic efficiency brought about by electron-hole
   recombination and narrow photoresponse range. The structure is fully
   elucidated by X-ray diffraction (XRD)/Reitveld refinement, Raman
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
   spectrum imaging analysis demonstrates the intermixing of SnO2 and PbS
   to form nanocomposites. A charge separation mechanism is presented that
   explains how the two semiconductors in junction function
   synergistically. The efficacy of this new nanocomposite material in the
   photocatalytic degradation of the toxic dye Rhodamine B under simulated
   solar irradiation is demonstrated. An apparent quantum yield of 0.217
   mol min(-1) W-1 is calculated with data revealing good catalyst
   recyclability and that charge separation in SnO2-PbS leads to
   significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison to either
   SnO2 or PbS.}},

Abstract = {{Nacre-like structures have attracted great interest in recent years due
   to their outstanding toughness, stiffness and impact resistance.
   However, there is a challenge associated with engineering nacre-like
   calcium phosphate crystals. In this study, thin nacreous-like monetite
   sheets were synthesized in solutions guided by a surfactant. The
   influence of temperature, initial pH, Ca/P ratio, stirring time and the
   concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the nacre-like
   structure has been studied. Findings showed that a nacre-like structure
   could only be formed at a high temperature (90 degrees C), high initial
   pH (11), sufficient stirring time (3 h), and under the presence of CTAB.
   A small-angle X-ray scattering experiment carried out at a synchrotron
   radiation facility showed that the distance between nanolayers was
   around 2.6 nm and TEM confirmed the fine sheet-like structure. The
   mechanism of the formation the nacre-like structure and its

Title = {{Cross sectoral impacts on water availability at+2 degrees C and+3
   degrees C for east Mediterranean island states: The case of Crete}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{532}},
Pages = {{16-28}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ensemble pan-European projections under a 2 degrees C global warming
   relative to the preindustrial period reveal a more intense warming in
   south Eastern Europe by up to +3 degrees C, thus indicating that impacts
   of climate change will be disproportionately high for certain regions.
   The Mediterranean is projected as one of the most vulnerable areas to
   climatic and anthropogenic changes with decreasing rainfall trends and a
   continuous gradual warming causing a progressive decline of average
   stream flow. Many Mediterranean regions are currently experiencing high
   to severe water stress induced by human and climate drivers. Changes in
   average climate conditions will increase this stress notably because of
   a 10-30\% decline in freshwater resources. For small island states,
   where accessibility to freshwater resources is limited the impact will
   be more pronounced. Here we use a generalized cross-sectoral framework
   to assess the impact of climatic and socioeconomic futures on the water
   resources of an Eastern Mediterranean island. A set of representative
   regional climate models simulations from the EURO-CORDEX initiative
   driven by different RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 GCM5 are used to form a
   comparable set of results and a useful basis for the assessment of
   uncertainties related to impacts of 2 warming and above. A generalized
   framework of a cross-sectoral water resources analysis was developed in
   collaboration with the local water authority exploring and costing
   adaptation measures associated with a set of socioeconomic pathways
   (SSPs). Transient hydrological modeling was performed to describe the
   projected hydro-climatological regime and water availability for each
   warming level. The robust signal of less precipitation and higher
   temperatures that is projected by climate simulations results to a
   severe decrease of local water resources which can be mitigated by a
   number of actions. Awareness of the practical implications of plausible
   hydro-climatic and socio-economic scenarios in the not so distant future
   may be the key to shift perception and preference towards a more
   sustainable direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore the effect of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   acquisition parameters on principal and minor eigenvector stability
   within human lower leg skeletal muscles.
   Materials and Methods: Lower leg muscles were evaluated in seven healthy
   subjects at 3T using an 8-channel transmit/receive coil.
   Diffusion-encoding was performed with nine signal averages (NSA) using
   6, 15, and 25 directions (NDD). Individual DTI volumes were combined
   into aggregate volumes of 3, 2, and 1 NSA according to number of
   directions. Tensor eigenvalues ((1), (2), (3)), eigenvectors
   (epsilon(1), epsilon(2), epsilon(3)), and DTI metrics (fractional
   anisotropy {[}FA] and mean diffusivity {[}MD]) were calculated for each
   combination of NSA and NDD. Spatial maps of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   (3):(2) ratio, and zenith angle were also calculated for region of
   interest (ROI) analysis of vector orientation consistency.
   Results: epsilon(1) variability was only moderately related to
   epsilon(2) variability (r = 0.4045). Variation of epsilon(1) was
   affected by NDD, not NSA (P < 0.0002), while variation of epsilon(2) was
   affected by NSA, not NDD (P < 0.0003). In terms of tensor shape, vector
   variability was weakly related to FA (epsilon(1):r = -0.1854,
   epsilon(2): ns), but had a stronger relation to the (3):(2) ratio
   (epsilon(1):r = -0.5221, epsilon(2):r = -0.1771). Vector variability was
   also weakly related to SNR (epsilon(1):r = -0.2873, epsilon(2):r =
   -0.3483). Zenith angle was found to be strongly associated with
   variability of epsilon(1) (r = 0.8048) but only weakly with that of
   epsilon(2) (r = 0.2135).
   Conclusion: The second eigenvector (epsilon(2)) displayed higher
   directional variability relative to epsilon(1), and was only marginally
   affected by experimental conditions that impacted epsilon(1)
   variability.}},

Abstract = {{While base isolation successfully decreases the accelerations
   transmitted to a structure, a tradeoff is large unfavorable
   displacements in the isolation layer. This study investigates an
   innovative system, termed `dual isolation', which applies two layers of
   isolation at the base and at mid-story to resolve this issue. A linear
   analytical solution for the equation of motion of the proposed system is
   developed on the basis of linear isolation theory. This creates a
   foundation to assess the behavior of various types of seismic protection
   systems and to select the damping and mass ratio that optimizes the
   performance of the proposed method. Dynamic response of an example dual
   isolated system to selected suites of ground motions is then examined.
   In addition to decreasing the displacement of the first isolation layer,
   the dual isolation system can greatly decrease floor accelerations of
   the upper portion of the building, further protecting building
   components and enhancing the comfort and safety of residents. Copyright

Abstract = {{The AA7150 aluminum alloy was compressed to various strains at strain
   rate of 10 s(-1) and temperatures of 300 degrees C and 450 degrees C,
   respectively. Flow stress behavior, substructure evolution, morphology
   and spatial distribution of precipitates were studied based on
   differential scanning calorimetry analysis and transmission electron
   microscope observation. The results showed that dynamic flow softening
   occurs during hot deformation. The main softening mechanism could be
   concluded as dynamic recovery at 300 degrees C and continuous dynamic
   recrystallization at 450 degrees C. The clear heterogeneous spatial
   distributions of precipitates are found during deformation and enhanced
   with increased strain. Higher contents of Cu in T phases are found at
   450 degrees C than at 300 degrees C, which present a transformation
   process from T phases to S phases as well. The associated evidence of
   dynamic precipitation on dislocations and particle-stimulated
   nucleation, as well as the detailed microstructural inherited
   relationship and morphological texture (particles preferred orientation)
   were characterized.}},

Abstract = {{Time-to-digital converters (TDCs) are increasingly used as building
   blocks in biomedical imaging, digital communication, and measurement
   instrumentation systems. When fabricated in deep-submicrometer (DSM)
   CMOS technology, TDCs have outstanding time stamping capability on the
   order of picoseconds. Typically, the timing resolution of a TDC directly
   determines the minimum resolvable spatial resolution in time-of-flight
   (ToF) measurements. It also limits the signal-to-noise ratio in ToF
   positron emission tomography and the in-band noise in an all-digital
   phase-locked-loop. In TDCs, good linearity and precision result in high
   measurement accuracy, while the detectable range is limited by its
   dynamic range. In addition, size and power consumption are of
   significant importance in large-scale array implementations such as
   image sensors. Here, we discuss the most recent developments in CMOS
   TDCs, with an emphasis on ring-oscillator-based TDC and its variants,
   due to their suitability for array designs with less area overhead. In
   addition, key performance metrics, and accurate cost-effective
   characterization methods will be discussed. Finally, future perspectives
   of CMOS TDCs will be highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and phenomenological models for predicting the compressive
   strength of concrete proposed in literature have been reviewed. The
   applicability and accuracy of these models in predicting the compressive
   strength of concrete at 28 days and at different ages were investigated
   using experimental data reported in the literature. Assessment of the
   models using visual display and numerical methods have revealed that the
   Average Paste Thickness (APT) compressive strength model, which accounts
   for the type of cement, cement degree of hydration, mixture proportions,
   aggregate proportions, gradations, packing density, and air content,
   provides the highest predictability at 28 days and at different ages.
   The assessment revealed that the majority of models give acceptable
   predictions because strength is mostly affected by water-to-cement ratio
   (w/c) in comparison to aggregates' properties and gradation.}},

Abstract = {{Myofascial pain syndrome is a common musculoskeletal pain disorder
   characterized by the presence of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). The
   diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome is currently made on clinical
   grounds. Numerous diagnostic criteria are used to identify myofascial
   pain syndrome, including the localization of MTrPs. Identifying the
   presence of MTrPs currently requires the physician to palpate the
   symptomatic region. Because the interrater reliability of the palpation
   technique has been found to be poor, numerous groups have been
   interested in finding objective imaging measures to localize the MTrP.
   This comprehensive review focuses on summarizing ultrasound imaging
   techniques that have shown promise in visually localizing the trigger
   point. The authors' literature search identified three sonographic
   approaches that have been used in MTrP localization: conventional
   gray-scale imaging, Doppler imaging, and elastographic ultrasound
   imaging. This review article explains the basic physics behind the
   imaging methods and summarizes the characteristics of the MTrP as
   identified by the ultrasonic techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and an angular embedded atom method
   description of interatomic forces have been utilized to compute the

   temperature range of 1560-1580 K and Al-60\%Si at T = 1190-1220 K. It
   was determined that the higher Si content alloy exhibited attachment
   controlled growth of steps whereas for the lower temperature, higher Al
   concentration alloy step growth is characterized by a diffusion
   controlled or mixed mode mechanism. The step mobility, which is the
   proportionality constant between the velocity and driving force, was
   determined for the Al-90\%Si alloy as a function of temperature and
   composition. It was found that mobility decreases fairly rapidly with
   the addition of Al solute. Also, from the variation with temperature, it
   appears the mobility is proportional to the interdiffusion coefficient
   in the liquid. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TALANTA}},

Abstract = {{Highly sensitive, easy-to-fabricate, and low-cost pH sensors with small
   dimensions are required to monitor human bodily fluids, drinking water
   quality and chemical/biological processes. In this study, a
   low-temperature, solution-based process is developed to prepare
   palladium/palladium oxide (Pd/PdO) thin films for pH sensing. A
   precursor solution for Pd is spin coated onto pre-cleaned glass
   substrates and annealed at low temperature to generate Pd and PdO. The
   percentages of PdO at the surface and in the bulk of the electrodes are
   correlated to their sensing performance, which was studied by using the
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscope. Large amounts of PdO introduced by
   prolonged annealing improve the electrode's sensitivity and long-term
   stability. Atomic force microscopy study showed that the low-temperature
   annealing results in a smooth electrode surface, which contributes to a
   fast response. Nanovoids at the electrode surfaces were observed by
   scanning electron microscope, indicating a reason for the long-term
   degradation of the pH sensitivity. Using the optimized annealing
   parameters of 200 degrees C for 48 h, a linear pH response with
   sensitivity of 64.71 +/- 0.56 mV/pH is obtained for pH between 2 and 12.
   These electrodes show a response time shorter than 18 s, hysteresis less
   than 8 mV and stability over 60 days. High reproducibility in the
   sensing performance is achieved. This low-temperature solution-processed
   sensing electrode shows the potential for the development of pH sensing
   systems on flexible substrates over a large area at low cost without
   using vacuum equipment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of the experimental peel test data for obtaining the
   adhesion fracture energy of an adhesively laminated polymer to the sheet
   metal surface is considered. The experimental results of the 1800 peel
   test on two types of polymer laminated sheet metal at three different
   peel speeds are analyzed by two methodological approaches in cohesive
   zone modeling. These approaches are linear-elastic stiffness approach
   and critical maximum stress approach. Comparing the results of these two
   approaches reveals the significance of the peel test speed on the
   interface strength determination for cohesive zone modeling. It is
   concluded that a ``reference{''} peel speed may exist at which the
   interface strength is equal to the yield strength of the peel arm
   material. A constitutive equation has been proposed which relates the
   interface strength to the peel test velocity by using the reference peel
   speed and its corresponding peel arm yield strength.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the feasibility of the separation of a five-component
   mixture using a semicontinuous distillation process. The results are
   used to generalize semicontinuous separation to N-component mixtures.
   The proposed five-component separation system, called quintenary
   semicontinuous separation, requires just a single distillation column
   with three middle vessels. In contrast, a conventional continuous
   distillation process would require four columns to achieve the same
   separation objectives. This process is an extension of three- and
   four-component semicontinuous separation. These processes are more
   economical at intermediate throughputs when compared to traditional
   continuous separations processes as has been demonstrated in previous
   literature. The feasibility of the process and profitability compared to
   a conventional continuous process was demonstrated using a mixture of
   n-alkanes from C6-C10. Dynamic simulation results show that this system
   is able to remain within safe operating limits. An economic comparison
   between the continuous and semicontinuous processes shows that the
   semicontinuous separation process is economically favorable at
   intermediate flow rates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{118}},

Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{In this work, silicon-rich silicon oxide films containing terbium were
   prepared by means of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The
   influence of hydrogen passivation on defects-mediated non-radiative
   recombination of excited Tb3+ ions was investigated by
   photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and photoluminescence
   decay measurements. Passivation was found to have no effect on shape and
   spectral position of the excitation spectra. In contrast, a gradual
   increase in photoluminescence intensity and photoluminescence decay time
   was observed upon passivation for the main D-5(4)-F-7(5) transition of
   Tb3+ ions. This observation was attributed to passivation of
   non-radiative recombination defects centers with hydrogen. It was found
   that the number of emitted photons increases upon passivation as a
   result of two effects: (1) longer Tb3+ lifetime in the D-5(4) excited
   state and (2) optical activation of new Tb3+ emitters. The obtained
   results were discussed and compared with other experimental reports. (C)

Abstract = {{The generation interval is the interval between the time when an
   individual is infected by an infector and the time when this infector
   was infected. Its distribution underpins estimates of the reproductive
   number and hence informs public health strategies. Empirical
   generation-interval distributions are often derived from contact-tracing
   data. But linking observed generation intervals to the underlying
   generation interval required for modelling purposes is surprisingly not
   straightforward, and misspecifications can lead to incorrect estimates
   of the reproductive number, with the potential to misguide interventions
   to stop or slow an epidemic. Here, we clarify the theoretical framework
   for three conceptually different generation-interval distributions: the
   `intrinsic' one typically used in mathematical models and the `forward'
   and `backward' ones typically observed from contact-tracing data,
   looking, respectively, forward or backward in time. We explain how the
   relationship between these distributions changes as an epidemic
   progresses and discuss how empirical generation-interval data can be
   used to correctly inform mathematical models.}},

Abstract = {{Pt nanoparticles were prepared by a sol immobilization route, deposited
   on supports with different acid/base properties (MgO, activated carbon,
   TiO2, Al-2 O-3, H-Mordenite), and tested in the selective oxidation of
   sorbose to 2-keto-gulonic acid (2-KGUA), an important precursor for
   vitamin C. In general, as the basicity of the support increased, a
   higher catalytic activity occurred. However, in most cases, a strong
   deactivation was observed. The best selectivity to 2-KGUA was observed
   with acidic supports (TiO2 and H-Mordenite) that were able to minimize
   the formation of C-1/C-2 products. We also demonstrated that, by
   alloying Pt to Au, it is possible to enhance significantly the
   selectivity of Pt-based catalysts. Moreover, the AuPt catalyst, unlike
   monometallic Pt, showed good stability in recycling because of the
   prevention of metal leaching during the reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Transmissive and reflective spatial light modulators have been designed
   and simulated for the 1.55 to 2.10 mu m spectral region. An electrically
   actuated layer of phase-change material (PCM) was employed as the
   electro-optical medium for two-state self-holding ``light-to-dark{''}
   intensity modulation of free-space light beams. The PCM was sandwiched
   between transparent conductive N-doped Si or indium tin oxide contact
   layers in a simple planar structure. A 100 to 500 nm PCM layer of
   Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) was employed for optimum performance at 1.55 mu m where
   the transmissive-modulator insertion loss was around 4.5 dB. The GST
   light-dark contrast was found to be 32 dB. For the GST reflection
   device, an included metal film (Ag) improved the 1.55 mu m performance
   metrics to 0.7 dB of insertion loss with a contrast around 26 dB. The
   calculated performance for both types of spatial light modulators was
   robust to changes in the input incidence angle near normal incidence.
   Applications include infrared scene generation and signal processing.

Abstract = {{Poly{[}1-{[}4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-etha
   nediyl, sodium salt] (PAZO) exhibits a number of unique physical
   properties. An electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been utilized
   for the deposition of PAZO films, which exhibited photoinduced
   birefringence. The advantages of EPD, deposition mechanism and kinetics
   of deposition are discussed. PAZO exhibits unique adsorption properties,
   which are related to its chemical structure. The salicylate ligands of
   PAZO monomers with strong chelating properties provide numerous
   adsorption sites for PAZO adsorption on inorganic materials. It was
   found that PAZO can function as a charging, dispersing and film forming
   agent for EPD of a wide array of materials, such as TiO2 (anatase and
   rutile), micron size platelets and submicrometre particles of Al2O3,
   zirconia, MnO2, MgAl2O4, aluminium hydroxide, SiC, Pd metal, carbon
   nanotubes and polypyrrole nanofibers. The feasibility of incorporation
   of other polymers and organic dyes into the PAZO films has been
   demonstrated. PAZO showed superior performance compared to other
   dispersing agents for the EPD method, overcoming their limitations.
   Another major finding of this study was the possibility of EPD of
   composites, using PAZO as a co-dispersant for different materials.
   Testing results showed that composites can be used for optical, energy
   storage, corrosion protection and other applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   fuel bundle geometry}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{305-316}},

Abstract = {{Predicting temperature distributions in fuel rod bundles is an important
   component of nuclear reactor safety analysis. Intersubchannel mixing
   acts to homogenize coolant temperatures thus reducing the likelihood of
   localized regions of high fuel temperature. Previous research has shown
   that intersubchannel mixing in nuclear fuel rod bundles is enhanced by a
   large-scale quasi-periodic energetic fluid motion, which transports
   fluid on the cross-plane between the narrow gaps connecting subchannels.
   This phenomenon has also been observed in laminar flows. Unsteady
   laminar flow simulations were performed in a simplified bundle of three
   rods with a pipe. Three similar geometries of varying gap width were
   examined, and a thermal trace was implemented on the first geometry.
   Thermal mixing was driven by the advection of energy between subchannels
   by the cross-plane flow. Flow through the rod-to-wall gaps in the wall
   subchannels alternated with a dominant frequency, particularly when
   rod-to-wall gaps were smaller than rod-to-rod gaps. Significant
   phase-linking between rod-to-wall gaps was also observed such that a
   peripheral circulation occurred through each gap simultaneously.
   Cross-plane flow through the rod-to-rod gaps in the triangular
   subchannel was irregular in each case. This was due to the fundamental
   irregularity of the triangular subchannel geometry. Vortices were
   continually broken up by cross-plane flow from other gaps due to the odd
   number of fluid pathways within the central subchannel. Cross-plane flow
   in subchannel geometries is highly interconnected between gaps. The flow
   structure through the gaps is more complex than has been previously
   reported and depends very much on the subchannel geometry. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of the microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)
   reactions on anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge from
   municipal wastewater treatment under ambient temperature conditions
   (22-23 degrees C). Two lab-scale digesters, a control anaerobic digester
   and an electrically-assisted digester (EAD - equipped with a MEC
   bioanode and cathode) were operated under three solids retention times
   (SRT = 7, 10 and 14 days) at 22.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. A numerical model
   was also built by including the MEC electrode reactions in Anaerobic
   Digestion Model No.1. In experiments, the EAD showed reduced
   concentration of acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid and
   iso-butyric acid. This improved performance of the EAD is thought to be
   achieved by direct oxidation of the short-chain fatty acids at the
   bioanode as well as indirect contribution of low acetic acid
   concentration to enhancing beta-oxidation. The VSS and COD removal was
   consistently higher in the EAD by 5-10\% compared to the control
   digester for all SRT conditions at 22.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. When compared
   to mathematical model results, this additional COD removal in the EAD
   was equivalent to that which would be achieved with conventional
   digesters at mesophilic temperatures. The magnitude of electric current
   in the EAD was governed by the organic loading rate while conductivity
   and acetic acid concentration showed negligible effects on current
   generation. Very high methane content (-95\%) in the biogas from both
   the EAD and control digester implies that the waste activated sludge
   contained large amounts of lipids and other complex polymeric substances
   compared to primary sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{5019-5024}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we have proposed a novel planar waveguide
   optical-power-splitter design with a large number of splitting channels.
   The design uses the wavefront lateral interference in light propagation
   in a slab waveguide, with its core properly adjusted in different areas
   for achieving different effective indices for the required phase delays.
   Therefore, the whole structure is equivalent to a nonblocking all-pass
   filter, hence, suffers a very small insertion loss. Another unique
   advantage of this structure lies in its weak length dependence on the
   number of splitting channels; although its lateral size has to be scaled
   up as the channel number increases, as opposed to conventional splitters
   with both of its length and lateral size scaled up with increasing
   channel numbers. Our numerical simulation results show that, for a
   1-to-256 channel splitter within a working wavelength band from 1530 to
   1570 nm, the insertion loss is below 1.3 dB. The channel nonuniformity
   is less than 5 dB within the same band. The required size is within 2.5
   mm by 10 mm on the silicon-on-insulator platform. The proposed structure
   can readily be extended to other material platforms, such as the
   silica-based planar lightwave circuit or semiconductors. Its fabrication
   process is fully compatible with standard clean-room technologies, such
   as photolithography and etching, without any complicated and/or costly
   approach involved.}},

Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{5032-5037}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the single
   longitudinal mode (SLM) yield for uniform grating distributed feedback
   (DFB) laser diode by breaking the dual-mode degeneracy. By introducing a
   horn ridged waveguide (HRW) in replace of the conventional straight
   ridge waveguide (RW), we create an effectively chirped grating as well
   as a longitudinally varying modal gain. As such, the field distribution
   along the laser cavity is different for the two possibly lasing
   longitudinal modes on each side of the Bragg stopband, and the field
   having a larger overlap with the gain becomes the only dominant lasing
   mode. We have optimized the ridge width of HRW-DFB lasers with different
   normalized coupling coefficients (kappa L) in terms of the SLM yield.
   Our experimental results show that the SLM yield of the HRW-DFB laser
   with kappa L of 2.9 can reach 65\% as opposed to 19\% obtained by the
   conventional RW-DFB lasers fabricated on the same wafer.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{460}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{To function as flotation collectors for mineral processing, polymeric
   nanoparticles require a delicate balance of surface properties to give
   mineral-specific deposition and colloidal stability in high ionic
   strength alkaline media, while remaining sufficiently hydrophobic to
   promote flotation. Combinatorial nanoparticle surface modification, in
   conjunction with high throughput screening, is a promising approach for
   nanoparticle development. However, efficient automated screening assays
   are required to reject ineffective particles without having to undergo
   time consuming flotation testing. Herein we demonstrate that determining
   critical coagulation concentrations of sodium carbonate in combination
   with measuring the advancing water contact angle of
   nanoparticle-saturated glass surfaces can be used to screen ineffective
   nanoparticles. Finally, none of our first nanoparticle library based on
   poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEG-methacrylate) were
   effective flotation collectors because the nanoparticles were too
   hydrophilic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, reliable, and accurate surrogate modelling technique for
   microwave structures is presented. A hierarchical surrogate model is
   constructed using response surface approximations (RSAs) of suitable
   response features with embedded visible' knowledge. The authors describe
   and discuss a novel scanning algorithm for capturing these desired
   response features. They demonstrate that the dependence of the selected
   features on the designable parameters is much less non-linear than that
   of the original responses taken as functions of the design parameters.
   They illustrate the steps of their algorithm using novel diagrams. They
   simplify the description of their modelling process by exploiting an
   operator notation. They discuss relationships between their method and
   other feature-based approaches such as shape-preserving response
   prediction (SPRP). They provide a wideband microstrip bandstop filter, a
   fourth-order ring resonator bandpass filter and a microstrip bandpass
   filter with open stub inverter examples to demonstrate their approach.
   Using these examples, they compare their approach with two very
   different direct RSA methods (kriging and radial basis function) and an
   SPRP method. The models of all the filter examples are validated using
   design optimisation.}},

   amount increased, LRM tended to aggregate and separate from the
   solutions. LRM films had a water contact angle higher than 80 degrees,
   in comparison to only 52 degrees of the AL film control sample. Due to
   hydrophobicity, the miscibility of LRM with high density polyethylene
   (HDPE) was significantly improved from that of AL with HDPE. Since LRM
   retained the phenolic hydroxyl structure of AL, the HDPE/LRM samples
   showed an excellent UV-absorbing performance. Furthermore, the added LRM
   had little negative influence, but significantly improved the HDPE
   mechanical properties. With 5 wt \% LRM loading, Young's modulus
   increased from 1066 to 2104 MPa and the elongation at break increased

Abstract = {{This work reports thermal and mechanical properties of a series of
   olefin copolymers synthesized by living coordination copolymerization of
   ethylene (E) and 1-hexene (H) with a fluorinated bis(phenoxyimine)
   titanium(IV) catalyst. The EH copolymers have ultrahigh molecular
   weights (UHMW), very narrow molecular weight distributions (MWD) and
   random distributions of ethylene and 1-hexene units along chain
   backbones. It is found that both high molecular weight and high 1-hexene
   incorporation give improved tensile properties, such as high modulus and
   excellent elasticity, in comparison to commercial polyolefin elastomers.
   Samples with M-w > 10(6) g/mol and F-2 > 25 mol\% do not break even at
   an elongation of 1700\%, and still have recoveries of >95\%. An UHMW
   di-block copolymer containing a crystalline PE block and an amorphous EH
   block is also synthesized and compared. DSC, TEM and tensile tests
   reveal some interesting unique properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Australia's Murray-Darling basin (MDB) water plan is an ambitious
   attempt to balance ecological, social and economic benefits, where a key
   aspect of the reform process has been recovery of water for
   environmental use. This paper focuses on a set of initiatives
   established by a local non-governmental organisation and an Indigenous
   community designed to engage with local values and priorities and
   incorporate them into this complex river basin governance system.
   Contrary to expectations that local and basin-scale interests and
   outcomes will diverge, the case studies reveal the ability for local
   groups to collaboratively manage both land and water resources to
   achieve locally important outcomes, and contribute to basin-scale
   outcomes. The analysis also highlights a progressive style of
   community-based environmental management for water management that
   utilises multiple institutional arrangements and planning pathways to
   protect the values that are important to local communities, and to nest
   those values within the broader effort to sustainably manage the basin's
   water resources.}},

   to Rodents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Experimental intranasal (IN) delivery of nanoparticle (NP) drug carriers
   is typically performed using a pipette with or without anesthesia, a
   technique that may be a poor simulation of practical IN administration
   of drug-loaded NPs in humans. Existing IN spray devices suffer from
   drawbacks in terms of variability in dose-control and spray duration as
   well as the application of nonuniform pressure fields when a
   NP-formulated drug is aerosolized. Furthermore, existing spray devices
   require large volumes that may not be available or may be prohibitively
   expensive to prepare. In response, we have developed a novel
   pneumatically driven IN spray device for the administration of NPs,
   which is capable of administering extremely small quantities (50-100 mu
   l) of NP suspension in a fine spray that disperses the NPs uniformly
   onto the tissue. This device was validated using haloperidol-loaded
   Solanum tuberosum lectin (STL)-functionalized, poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) NPs targeted
   for delivery to the brain for schizophrenia treatment. A pneumatic
   pressure of 100 kPa was found to be optimal to produce a spray that
   effectively aerosolizes NP suspensions and delivers them evenly to the
   olfactory epithelium. IN administration of STL-functionalized NPs using
   the IN spray device increased brain tissue haloperidol concentrations by
   a factor of 1.2-1.5x compared to STL-functionalized NPs administered IN
   with a pipette. Such improved delivery enables the use of lower drug
   doses and thus offers both fewer local side-effects and lower costs
   without compromising therapeutic efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to recover the intrinsic fluorescence of biological
   fluorophores is crucial to accurately identify the fluorophores and
   quantify their concentrations in the media. Although some studies have
   successfully retrieved the fluorescence spectral shape of known
   fluorophores, the techniques usually came with heavy computation costs
   and did not apply for strongly absorptive media, and the intrinsic
   fluorescence intensity and fluorophore concentration were not recovered.
   In this communication, an experimental approach was presented to recover
   intrinsic fluorescence and concentration of fluorescein in the presence
   of hemoglobin (Hb). The results indicated that the method was efficient
   in recovering the intrinsic fluorescence peak and fluorophore
   concentration with an error of 3\% and 10\%, respectively. The results
   also suggested that chromophores with irregular absorption spectra
   (e.g., Hb) have more profound effects on fluorescence spectral shape
   than chromophores with monotonic absorption and scattering spectra (e.
   g., black India ink and polystyrene microspheres). (C) 2015 Society of

Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a novel single-mode laser with high immunity to
   external optical feedback following the principle of active-filter-tuned
   oscillator. Within the conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity, a high-Q
   bandpass filter formed by two tilted gratings with detuned Bragg
   wavelengths is embedded, and the resultant mode selection mechanism can
   purify the lasing spectrum by eliminating all but one of the FP cavity
   modes near the peak wavelength of the said filter. The proposed laser
   inherently bears the distinct feature of being robust against any small
   disturbances to oscillation loop. Simulation results from the
   large-signal dynamic model show that a stable single-mode operation has
   been achieved with a side-mode suppression ratio of as high as 50 dB.
   Further, compared with conventional index-coupled distributed feedback
   lasers, the proposed laser exhibits a much higher immunity to external
   optical feedback, even at a very high feedback level of -3 dB, and its
   single-mode yield is also less susceptible to variations of effective
   facet phases caused by cleaving in semiconductor laser fabrications.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a model of pure Fe have been used
   in the investigation of solid-state nucleation of a body-centered-cubic
   (BCC) phase from a polycrystalline face-centered-cubic (FCC) matrix. A
   neighbor vector analysis (NVA) method has been introduced and it is
   shown how the NVA can be used to determine the misorientation of grain
   or interphase boundaries. In particular, the NVA was utilized to
   identify the orientation relationships (ORs) of several BCC nuclei and
   three special ORs were tested, namely the Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS),
   Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) and Pitsch (P). From several quasi-2D
   simulations, it was found that all stable nuclei at grain boundaries
   formed at least one orientation relationship with the parent grains that
   was consistent with either the KS or NW relationship. Several initial MD
   simulation cells, which prohibited the formation of special ORs, were
   also examined and in these simulations no nucleation was observed after
   long run times. In addition, the \{1 1 1\}gamma//\{1 1 0\}alpha
   orientation was detected in all mobile phase boundaries. Consistent with
   experimental findings, these observations demonstrate the importance of
   this high coherency atomic plane during both the nucleation and growth
   process. The nucleation and phase boundary characteristics identified
   here may provide important insights into the nucleation rate and grain
   orientation of more general solid state nucleation processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, methodologies for low-cost and reliable microwave modeling
   are presented using variable-fidelity response features. The two key
   components of our approach are: 1) a realization of the modeling process
   at the level of suitably selected feature points of the responses (e.g.,
   S-parameters versus frequency) of the structure at hand and 2) the
   exploitation of variable-fidelity EM simulation data, also for the
   response feature representation. Due to the less nonlinear dependence
   between the coordinates of the feature points on the geometrical
   parameters of the structure of interest, the amount of training data can
   be greatly reduced. Additional cost reduction is obtained by means of
   generating the majority of the training data at a coarse-discretization
   EM simulation level and exploiting the correlations between the EM
   models of various fidelities. We propose two ways of combining the
   low-and high-fidelity data sets: 1) an external approach, through space
   mapping (simpler to implement) and 2) an internal approach, using
   co-kriging (more flexible and potentially offering better accuracy). The
   operation and performance of our modeling techniques are demonstrated by
   three microstrip filter examples and a compact rat-race coupler. A
   comprehensive verification and comparisons with several benchmark
   techniques, as well as application examples (filter optimization) are
   also provided.}},

Title = {{Should the Desired Heading in Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles be
   the Tangent Direction of the Desired Path?}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The path-following problem for autonomous vehicles is investigated in
   this paper. The desired vehicle heading is commonly chosen as the
   tangent direction on the desired path. This paper points out that the
   traditional definition of the desired heading may deteriorate the
   path-following performance, particularly when the vehicle is tracking a
   path with large curvature. That is because the sideslip angle control
   and the yaw rate control are conflicting in the presence of sliding
   effects, and the sideslip angle does not equal to zero when the vehicle
   is tracking a curve path. This paper further provides an amendment to
   the definition of the desired heading, which realizes a more accurate
   path-following maneuver. In the controller design phase, backstepping is
   used to generate the required yaw rate, and an LQR controller is adopted
   to obtain the optimal active front steering input. The CarSim-Simulink
   joint simulation verifies the reasonability of the amendment to the
   desired heading.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional MRI images which are powerful tools for diagnosis of
   many diseases require large storage space. A number of lossless
   compression schemes exist for this purpose. In this paper we propose a
   new approach for lossless compression of these images which exploits the
   inherent symmetry that exists in 3D MRI images. First, an efficient
   pixel prediction scheme is used to remove correlation between pixel
   values in an MRI image. Then a block matching routine is employed to
   take advantage of the symmetry within the prediction error image.
   Inter-slice correlations are eliminated using another block matching.
   Results of the proposed approach are compared with the existing standard

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new full-automatic approach to content aware image
   retargeting is proposed. Most image retargeting approaches does not
   incorporate content information and only use local appearance
   information. However, there are some approaches which use high level
   information such as saliency regions, objects mask and depth
   information. Such methods do not use semantic labelling for each object.
   In this paper, object masks as well as their semantic class labels are
   used to propose a new approach to image retargeting. To do so, semantic
   segmentation of image is provided. Hence, a nonparametric approach to
   semantic segmentation is employed which is fast with no need to any
   learning model. This makes it simple and applicable to any dataset. To
   evaluate the proposed approach, besides presenting visual examples, we
   performed a set of subjective evaluations too. The obtained results show
   that our method outperforms other retargeting approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A common approach to time-delay estimation (TDE) and joint delay-Doppler
   estimation (JDDE) for target localization is matched filtering, which is
   equivalent to the cross correlation of the received and transmitted
   signals. The conventional correlation in Hilbert space is statistically
   optimal in white Gaussian noise. However, its performance significantly
   degrades in the presence of non-Gaussian noise or clutter. In this
   paper, two new concepts called-correlation and l(p)-ambiguity functions,
   which generalize the conventional matched filtering from Hilbert space
   to l(p)-space, are proposed. In addition, several important mathematical
   properties of the l(p)-correlation and l(p)-ambiguity functions are
   given and proved. Compared with conventional ambiguity function, the
   time-frequency concentration of the l(p)-ambiguity function is
   significantly enhanced, i.e., the delay-Doppler resolution is improved
   and the sidelobes are suppressed. Based on these two newly defined
   functions, a family of TDE and JDDE algorithms that are robust against
   impulsive noise or clutter are developed. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao
   bounds of TDE and JDDE for non-Gaussian noise with arbitrary probability
   distribution are derived. Simulation results under several impulsive
   noise models demonstrate that the performance in terms of robustness,
   resolution, and estimation accuracy is substantially improved when
   compared with the conventional matched filtering and fractional
   lower-order moment based methods.}},

Title = {{Inference of Blast Wavefront Parameter Uncertainty for Probabilistic
   Risk Assessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Probabilistic risk assessment methodologies are typically employed to
   optimize resource allocations for blast risk mitigation schemes, which
   may be necessary for the design of new blast resistant facilities as
   well as the hardening of existing construction. A key aspect of any
   blast risk assessment methodology is the quantification of uncertainty
   inherent in the prediction of shock wave parameters. In this study, a
   blast pressure database that was generated from arena testing using live
   explosives is used to infer the probability distributions that best
   represent the model error affecting the prediction of four key wavefront
   parameters, namely: the peak pressure, specific impulse, duration, and
   waveform coefficient of the positive pressure phase. Confidence
   intervals are given for the descriptors of each distribution and their
   percentiles. In addition, two sets of partial factors are developed for
   the blast-resistant design of structures requiring high level of
   protection (LOP) based on a simplified reliability approach. Two recent
   North American standards addressing the design of buildings subjected to
   blast loads recommend load combinations in which a partial load factor
   of 1.0 is applied to blast induced actions. Although this approach
   aligns with the current design practice followed in the case of rare
   events (e.g., earthquakes), it may not be applicable in the case of
   blast loads as a result of the degree of uncertainty present even when a
   design basis threat is quantified. To account for this uncertainty,
   partial factors for the major wavefront parameters of the reflected
   shock wavefront are presented. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a two-story reinforced concrete block scaled building was
   tested to failure under fully reversed quasi-static
   displacement-controlled loading. The building's seismic force-resisting
   system (SFRS) consisted of eight structural walls in total, with four
   walls, aligned along the loading direction, placed asymmetrically to
   result in a center of rigidity eccentricity from the floor center of
   mass of approximately 20\% of the building width, evaluated on the basis
   of elastic analysis. The other four orthogonal walls were placed
   symmetrically around the building floor center of mass to provide
   torsional restraints to the building. As such, the focus of the paper is
   on evaluating the influence of twist as a system-level aspect on the
   ductility capacity of the building and the ductility and strength
   demands of its wall components. This paper presents the details of the
   building SFRS and wall configurations and characteristics and the main
   test observations and results. This is followed by analyses of the
   experimental results that showed that, at the system level, each wall
   would be subjected to significantly different displacement/strength
   demands throughout the building's loading history. These different
   demand levels are functions of the interaction between the system-level
   twist response and the resulting displacement demands imposed on each
   wall component and the subsequent load redistribution following
   different component damage. The study showed that the variation in the
   inelastic response characteristics of the different walls comprising the
   building's SFRS and wall strength contributions to the overall building
   capacity and the subsequently mobilized ductility levels are all factors
   that should be considered when evaluating the overall building SFRS
   performance. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In traditional tuned liquid damper (TLD) installations, TLD tank(s) are
   tuned to a single optimal frequency as determined by well-known dynamic
   vibration absorber theory. A multiple tuned liquid damper (MTLD) is
   created when the sloshing frequencies are distributed over a range near
   the structural frequency. In this paper, an equivalent mechanical model
   for a structure-MTLD system is developed. A third-order nonlinear
   multimodal model is employed to assess nonlinear fluid affects and serve
   as independent model verification. To the authors' knowledge, this is
   the first time the nonlinear energy dissipation associated with damping
   screens and the nonlinear coupling amongst sloshing modes has been
   considered for MTLD systems. MTLD systems consisting of one (traditional
   TLD), two, and three tanks are used to reduce the resonant response of a
   single degree of freedom structure. The MTLD provides structural control
   that is superior to a traditional TLD. The MTLD is less sensitive to the
   structural excitation amplitude, which enables the device performance to
   be maintained at low amplitude excitations associated with common wind
   events. The MTLD is also shown to be more robust to changes to the
   structure's natural frequency than the traditional TLD. Since many TLD
   installations require multiple tanks to satisfy space restrictions, the
   findings of this paper are highly relevant to structural engineering.
   This paper shows that by slightly altering the fluid depth of each tank,
   improved structural control performance can be achieved at little
   additional cost. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{A GIS-based land-use diversity index model to measure the degree of
   suburban sprawl}},
Journal = {{AREA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-375}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a GIS-based land-use diversity measure for
   residential neighbourhoods - the land-use diversity index (or LDI) model
   - as a possible urban sustainability criterion. The term land-use
   diversity' is proposed as representative of many physical attributes of
   neighbourhood form opposite to typical sprawl patterns. A diverse
   neighbourhood is one with a mixture of compatible land uses and housing
   types, containing an array of amenities in reasonable proximity to where
   people live. The prototype version of the LDI model incorporates 34
   input variables, structured around four sub-indices. Its range of
   expected values are explored through four case study applications.
   Theoretically, index values can vary between 0 and 1, where 1 represents
   a condition of greater land-use diversity'. The two traditional urban
   neighbourhoods fared well (index values ranging between 0.627 and 0.726)
   because they have a greater range of land uses and neighbourhood
   amenities, a better integration of housing types and are more
   concentrated. These two neighbourhoods meet many of the exuberant
   diversity' criteria described by Jacobs. The two suburban neighbourhoods
   scored lower index values (between 0.250 and 0.363), indicating
   variables different to those for traditional urban forms. The LDI model
   differs from existing sprawl measures fundamentally, as it attempts to
   measure sprawl at a finer resolution (i.e. at the neighbourhood scale).
   It is anticipated the LDI model will assist with planning new, and
   reconfiguring old, neighbourhoods as they strive to meet smart growth
   criteria now being considered by many cities.}},

Title = {{Robust Nonlinear Disturbance Observer Design for Estimation of Ammonia

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system is a promising way
   to obtain high NOx reduction and commonly adopted in diesel engine
   aftertreatment systems. The ammonia storage ratio is critical for SCR
   feedback control but it is difficult to be directly measured by sensors.
   This paper aims to effectively estimate the ammonia storage ratio on
   line and reduce the cost of using ammonia sensors. In the proposed
   method, the ammonia storage ratio is treated as an external disturbance
   in the NOx dynamic model and estimated by the nonlinear disturbance
   observer (NDO) methods. Furthermore, to reduce estimation errors of
   ammonia storage ratio caused by the high-frequency measurement noises, a
   novel robust nonlinear disturbance observer (robust NDO) is proposed and
   compared with a typical design method (regular NDO). Both the NDOs are
   developed based on part of the three-state SCR model and cost-effective,
   since NOx sensors are only used. The stability and noise attenuation
   properties of both estimations were also analyzed in the paper. The
   simulation results based on the full-vehicle simulator of FTP-75 test
   demonstrate that the regular NDO and the robust NDO can effectively
   estimate the ammonia storage ratio even in cases where ammonia
   cross-sensitivity affects the response. Among the two observers, the
   robust NDO has better noise attenuation properties.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Flat Bar Supports on Streamwise Fluidelastic Instability
   in Heat Exchanger Tube Arrays}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Flow-induced vibration is an important criterion for the design of heat
   exchangers in nuclear, fossil, and chemical plants. Of the several known
   vibration excitation mechanisms, fluidelastic instability (FEI) is the
   most serious because it can cause tube failures in a relatively short
   period of time. Traditionally, FEI has been observed to occur in the
   direction transverse to the flow and antivibration bars have been used
   to stiffen the tubes against this motion. More recently, interest has
   increased in the possibility of FEI occurring in the streamwise
   direction, parallel to the flow. This is the subject of the present
   paper. Numerical simulations have been carried out to study the effects
   of tube-to-support clearance, tube sliding friction, tube-to-support
   preload, and ambient turbulence levels on the FEI threshold in the
   streamwise direction. As one would expect, increasing friction and tube
   preload against the support both tend to stabilize the tube against
   streamwise FEI. Importantly, the results also show that decreasing
   tube-support clearances destabilizes streamwise FEI while having little
   effect on transverse FEI. Increasing ambient turbulence levels also has
   the effect of destabilizing streamwise FEI.}},

Title = {{Blast Design-Basis Threat Uncertainty and Its Effects on Probabilistic
   Risk Assessment}},
Journal = {{ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART
   A-CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{At present, the deterministic approach to blast-resistant design appears
   to be the prevalent philosophy in practice, as suggested by the notion
   of design-basis threat (DBT) outlined by the ASCE/SEI 59-11. In this
   study, it is argued that even in the case of a clearly defined blast
   scenario, the resulting loading parameters can show a remarkably high
   degree of uncertainty, as corroborated by data from arena tests.
   Therefore, future standards should integrate a DBT definition guided by
   probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), in order to extend the general
   principles of limit state design philosophy to blast-resistant design.
   This paper investigates the sources of the variability observed in key
   blast wavefront metrics, including the peak pressure, specific impulse,
   positive phase duration, and decay coefficient. This objective is
   accomplished by quantifying and propagating the uncertainty associated
   with several input parameters, such as the mass of explosive, equivalent
   TNT-mass factor, pressure transducer and specimen positions relative to
   the explosive charge, and atmospheric conditions. All input parameters
   are modeled as random variables and the wavefront metrics are
   subsequently calculated via the Kingery and Bulmash model and corrected
   for nonstandard ambient conditions. The input uncertainties are
   propagated through the computations using the Monte Carlo method and the
   resulting confidence intervals, estimated for each selected DBT, are
   compared with corresponding arena test measurements. Within the context
   of the test program presented herein, it is found that the considered
   input parameters partially account for the discrepancies between test
   data and predicted wavefront metrics, whose uncertainty is largely
   controlled by the equivalent TNT-mass factor. In addition, it is found
   that the input uncertainty is significantly amplified by the structural
   response model, which reveals a significant variability in the response
   predicted for the specimens considered in this study. (C) 2015 American

   onset and propagation of damage. The formulation of the problem involves
   the specification of an anisotropic failure criterion as well as
   description of inelastic deformation, which includes the time-dependent
   effects. The discrete propagation of macrocracks is simulated using an
   enhanced constitutive law with embedded discontinuity. The framework is
   applied to the assessment of long-term damage around a deep-excavation
   in an anisotropic shale formation. In the second part, the steady state
   flow in the presence of embedded discontinuities/cracks is addressed by
   applying a modified form of Darcy's law. The approach is illustrated by
   examining the flow pattern in a sedimentary rock sample that contains
   randomly distributed sealed fractures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Silicon-based integrated systems are actively pursued for sensing and
   imaging applications. A major challenge to realize highly sensitive
   systems is the integration of electronic, optical, mechanical and
   fluidic, all on a common platform. Further, the interface quality
   between the tiny optoelectronic structures and the substrate for
   alignment and coupling of the signals significantly impacts the system's
   performance. These systems also have to be low-cost, densely integrated
   and compatible with current and future mainstream technologies for
   electronic-photonic integration. To address these issues, proper
   selection of the fabrication, integration and assembly technologies is
   needed. In this paper, wafer level bonding with advanced features such
   as surface activation and passive alignment for vertical electrical
   interconnections are identified as candidate technologies to integrate
   different electronics, optical and photonic components. Surface
   activated bonding, superior to other assembly methods, enables
   low-temperature nanoscaled component integration with high alignment
   accuracy, low electrical loss and high transparency of the interface.
   These features are preferred for the hybrid integration of silicon-based
   micro-opto-electronic systems. In future, new materials and assembly
   technologies may emerge to enhance the performance of these micro
   systems and reduce their cost. The article is a detailed review of
   bonding techniques for electronic, optical and photonic components in
   silicon-based systems.}},

Abstract = {{A new carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) anchor is developed and
   tested to delay debonding in reinforced concrete (RC) beams externally
   strengthened with FRP laminate/sheet. The C-shape anchor is made from a
   commercially available CFRP grid. The anchors legs are 95 mm long while
   the spacing between the legs is adjustable, depending on FRP laminate
   and beam widths. Nine full scale RC beams, 3.0 m long, 250 mm wide and
   400 mm deep, were strengthened with CFRP laminate/sheet, with and
   without the C-anchor. The main test parameters were the type and amount
   of FRP laminate and the presence/absence of the anchor. Test results
   showed that beams with the anchor had generally 5\%-10\% higher
   debonding and failure load, and they reached higher deflection at
   failure than the companion beams without anchors. Although complete
   separation of the FRP laminate from the concrete was not observed in any
   of the beams with anchors, there was noticeable slip at failure at one
   end of the laminate. A significant outcome of the study is that anchors
   are effective in limiting the extent of debonding along the laminate,
   thus contributing to the flexural stiffness of the beam by reducing the
   extent of cracking and limiting the crack width along the beam. Finally,
   the anchor allowed the FRP to reach or exceed its theoretically
   allowable strain computed based on the American Concrete Institute (ACI)
   Committee 440 recommendation while in none of the beams without anchors,
   the FRP reached its theoretically allowable strain.}},

Pages = {{1249-1266}},

Abstract = {{Fiber reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREI) possess unique
   characteristics relative to traditional steel reinforced elastomeric
   isolators (SREI). FREI can be classified as either bonded or unbonded
   according to the connection type employed. An understanding of the
   behavior of FREI under these loading configurations is needed in order
   to extend the application of FREI to bridges. The objective of this
   study is to investigate the response of FREI when vertical and
   rotational deformations are applied separately as well as in
   combination. Finite element modeling is carried out on five FREI having
   the same material properties but possessing different geometrical
   properties. The mean vertical pressure values employed in this studied
   are 1, 4.5, 7 and 10 MPa, which represent the specified upper and lower
   limits presented in CAN/CSA-S6 and AASHTO-LRFD. The behavior of the
   isolators under different angles of rotation is investigated up to a
   maximum value of 0.05 radians. Results obtained from the finite element
   model study and values obtained from available closed-form analytical
   solutions are found to be in excellent agreement. In addition, results
   show that U-FREI experience lower normal stresses and shear strains in
   the elastomer and lower strains in the reinforcement relative to B-FREI.

Abstract = {{In the present study, an evaluation of the scale of production on

   microscopic, lab- and pilot-scale foam systems were used to investigate
   the impact of the rheology on the process. A systematic comparison
   looking at the influence of rheological properties of the polymer matrix
   on the expansion behavior of polyethylene foams indicated that the size
   of the foam system does not affect the fundamental mechanisms of the
   foaming process and that the effects of system size on foam techniques
   could be suppressed by tailoring the processing conditions. It was
   demonstrated that the impact of rheology on bubble development observed
   in microscopic studies can be practically extended to higher scales of
   foaming, and the results can provide guidelines for the selection of the
   polymer materials for customized foam applications.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Liquid jet impingement is known for its high capability of extracting
   heat from the surface it impinges on. Steady state subcooled boiling
   experiments were carried out in the stagnation region of a water planar
   jet of 0.6 and 0.75 m/s jet velocity and 15 degrees C of subcooling. The
   transition boiling regime is found to have a region of constant heat
   flux. After the critical heat flux (CHF) is reached, the heat flux
   decreases till a local minimum value is reached; called the first
   minimum. The heat flux then increases till it reaches a relatively
   constant value, even with the increase of the surface degree of
   superheat. The constant heat flux region is called the shoulder heat
   flux. With the aid of high speed imaging, Rayleigh Taylor instability
   has been observed at the liquid vapor interface which is accelerated by
   gravity and jet dynamic pressure. A modified expression for the
   interface acceleration is proposed. The vapor layer formed in the
   transition boiling is not stable; it follows periodic cycles of break up
   and formation. Two surface wetting mechanisms are proposed based on
   observations: (i) direct liquid touching the surface at moderate degrees
   of superheat and (ii) liquid columns intruding the vapor layer and
   touching the surface at discrete locations at high degrees of superheat.
   A new wall heat flux partitioning model is proposed. The proposed model
   divides the wall heat flux, based on the two observed wetting
   mechanisms, into two components: (i) quenching heat flux and (ii)
   intrusion heat flux. The current model estimates the wall heat flux
   during transition boiling covering the surface superheat range from the
   CHF till the Leidenfrost point with a normalized root mean square error
   (NRMSE) of 33\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   usually unknown beforehand. We propose stopping rules along with
   sufficient conditions for the gOMP algorithm to recover the whole or a
   part of the sparse signal support from noisy observations. It is proved
   that under conditions on restricted isometry constant (RIC) and
   magnitude of nonzero elements of the sparse signal, the gOMP algorithm
   will recover the support with given stopping rules under various noisy
   settings. We also give conditions under which partial support
   corresponding to components with significant magnitude of the sparse
   signal can be recovered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal processing of two potato protein isolates (PPIs) with glycerol
   as a plasticizer was explored in this study. The PPIs were pretreated by
   alkali or alkali under reducing conditions. The PPIs before and after
   pretreatment were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy. The effects of plasticizer content and
   pretreatment on mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of the
   compression-molded biopolymers were studied. The highest tensile
   strengths obtained were 20-25 MPa and the biopolymer can be brittle or
   ductile depending on the plasticizer contents. The molecular weight and
   protein structure of the PPIs markedly affected the resultant
   biopolymers' static and dynamic mechanical properties. The pretreatment
   of PPIs caused distinctly different changes in the mechanical properties
   of the two PPIs. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci.

Abstract = {{The utility of hydrophobic wax barriers in paper-based lateral flow and
   multiwell devices for containment of aqueous solvents was extended to
   organic solvents and challenging aqueous surfactant solutions by
   preparation of a three layer barrier, consisting of internal pullulan
   impregnated paper barriers surrounded by external wax barriers. When
   paper impregnated with pullulan solution dries, the polymer forms
   solvent blocking lenses in the paper structure. Lens formation was
   illustrated by forming pullulan lenses in glass capillaries. The lens
   shapes were less curved compared to the predictions of a model based
   upon minimizing surface area. For barriers on Whatman \# 1 filter paper,
   the pullulan molecular weight must be greater than similar to 70 kDa,
   the mass fraction of pullulan in the barrier zone must be at least 32\%,
   and there are restrictions on the minimum width of the pullulan
   impregnated zone.}},

Abstract = {{Production planning and scheduling optimize feedstocks usage in
   refineries by using crude simplified distillation models which relate
   feed true boiling point (TBP) curves to product TBP curves and from
   these calculate product yields and properties. We compare product yield
   and properties calculated by the swing-cut methods (fixed-cut,
   weight/volume transfer, and light/heavy) with results from the
   pseudocuts TBP-based method. The latter uses product yields and TBP
   curves computed via the hybrid distillation model. Swing-cut methods use
   assumptions which lead to lower accuracy of predicting yields vs hybrid
   model yields, resulting in errors in computed bulk product properties.
   If swing-cut methods yields are replaced by the correct yields from
   hybrid model, all four methods have approximately the same accuracy.
   Therefore, for a mixture of crudes, by using accurate yields from the
   hybrid model, product bulk properties can be computed by blending rules
   as simple as those used by the fixed-cut swing method.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling electron microscopy techniques with insitu heating ability
   allows us to study phase transformations on the single-nanoparticle
   level. We exploit this setup to study disorder-to-order transformation
   of Pt-Fe alloy nanoparticles, a material that is of great interest to
   fuel-cell electrocatalysis and ultrahigh density information storage. In
   contrast to earlier reports, we show that Fe (instead of Pt) segregates
   towards the particle surface during annealing and forms a Fe-rich FeOx
   outer shell over the alloy core. By combining both exsitu and insitu
   approaches to probe the interplay between ordering and
   surface-segregation phenomena, we illustrate that the surface
   segregation of Fe precedes the ordering process and affects the ordered
   phase evolution dramatically. We show that the ordering initiates
   preferably at the pre-existent Fe-rich shell than the particle core.
   While the material-specific findings from this study open interesting
   perspectives towards a controlled phase evolution of Pt-Fe nanoalloys,
   the characterization methodologies described are general and should
   prove useful to probing a wide-range of nanomaterials.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{5976-5989}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop linear precoding schemes for MIMO downlink
   networks with quasi-static channels that are scalable, in the sense that
   they can be implemented with moderate complexity in networks with
   increasing numbers of cells and users. The principle that underlies the
   proposed precoding scheme is to exploit the decomposable structure of
   the equivalent channel matrix by designing the precoders at the base
   stations to be decomposable as well. Thus, the channel matrices and the
   designed precoders can be expressed as the Kronecker product of
   constituent matrices. For networks with a finite number of cells, the
   proposed structured precoding schemes enable inter-cell interference
   cancellation without the need for inter-cell feedback and provide more
   degrees of freedom than conventional interference avoidance schemes,
   while incurring a latency that grows only linearly in the number of
   cells. The proposed structured precoding schemes also enable a scaling
   approach for unbounded networks that we have called ``spatial reuse
   precoding{''} (SRP). SRP is based on the observation that at each
   receiver, the signals from interfering sources that employ the same
   precoder arrive in the same subspace, regardless of the particular
   channel matrices between the interfering sources and the receiver. In
   some typical cellular architectures we show how an SRP scheme based on
   the proposed structured precoders can be designed to eliminate the
   dominant sources of interference without requiring cooperation between
   cells. In addition, we show that SRP can provide substantial performance
   gains in certain heterogeneous networks.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{265-289}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper the results of a comprehensive numerical investigation
   regarding the axial-flexural-tor sional response of pultruded slender
   beams is presented. The goal is to propose GFRP standard cross-sections
   of such proportions and shapes that would possess improved strength,
   stability and deformational characteristics compared to the
   corresponding existing sections whose proportions are generally based on
   standard steel sections. As GFRP sections are thin-walled but are
   significantly less stiff than similar steel sections, the study focuses
   on enhancing their appropriate stiffness and buckling strength. The
   novel and efficient numerical model used in this investigation was
   developed by the writers and can be used to trace the complete
   pre-buckling geometrically nonlinear response of any GFRP or steel
   thin-walled member with open or closed cross-section. The bucking load
   is computed by the asymptotic value of the load-displacement curve.
   Members with I-, L-, T- and box sections are analyzed, considering
   different loading and boundary conditions. It is demonstrated that due
   to their unsuitable proportions, available standard GFRP sections do not
   have adequate stiffness and budding strength. Consequently,
   recommendations are made for new sectional proportions and modified
   shapes, and some graphical results are presented to demonstrate how the
   results of the proposed method could be utilized in practical design
   situations. The superiority of the proposed sections is quantified by an
   efficiency factor, defined in terms of ratio of strength gain to
   material volume increase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some commercially available amines used as curing agents for epoxy
   resins can capture CO2 to form ammonium carbamates, which represent a
   novel type of latent blowing and curing agent for epoxy foaming: The
   principles in the selection of suitable amines are critical for final
   applications. This;work aimed to reveal these principles by screening
   and comparing the preparation, chemical structure and composition, and
   curing and foaming performance of several types of ammonium Carbamates
   from typical amine curing agents. It is found that amines with pK(a) >9
   are eligible to react with CO2 to form ammonium carbamates with a high
   yield. Furthermore, the amines should have rigid cyclic groups in their
   structures to form a solid ammonium carbonate powder, which can be
   easily mixed with epoxy resins. The curing rate of the amine should not
   be much faster than the decomposition of the carbamate to obtain epoxy
   foams with good pore morphology and mechanical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that the static softening kinetics of
   7150 aluminum alloy showed typical sigmoidal behavior at 400 degrees C
   and softening plateaus at 300 degrees C (F.L. Jiang, et al., Mater. Sci.
   Eng. A, vol. 552, 2012, pp. 269-275). In present work, the static
   softening mechanisms, the microstructural evolution during
   post-deformation holding was studied by optical microscopy, scanning
   electron microscope, electron back-scattered diffraction and
   transmission electron microscopy. It was demonstrated that
   recrystallization is essentially absent during post-deformation holding,
   and that static recovery was the main contribution to static softening.
   Strain induced precipitation and coarsening caused softening plateaus at
   300 degrees C. In order to better understand the static softening
   mechanism, physically-based modeling, which integrated recovery and
   multicomponent particle coarsening modeling, was employed to rationalize
   the experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AZ31 magnesium sheet was processed by room temperature multi-step cyclic
   bending-unbending (CBU) and subsequent annealing (CBUA) process to
   modify the microstructure and improve its bendability. The CBU process
   resulted in a complex stress and strain distribution through the
   thickness and a multilayered microstructure after annealing. The grain
   structure, micro-texture, and micro-hardness of each of the layers were
   studied by optical microscopy, electron back-scattered diffraction
   (EBSD) and indentation measurements, respectively. The CBUA process
   resulted in static recrystallization of grains leading to average grain
   size of about 2.5 mu m to a depth of about 40 mu m from the surface. The
   grain size, however, significantly coarsened in two intermediate layers
   through the thickness. The recrystallization was studied by
   microstructural characterization and micro-hardness measurement after
   annealing. The through-thickness texture from EBSD experiments indicated
   texture spreading and weakening in the surface layers. The results are
   consistent with the mechanics of cyclic bending-unbending (CBU) process,
   mechanisms of strain induced static recrystallization, texture evolution
   and its stability with long term annealing. The grain refinement and
   texture spreading of multi-layered microstructure from CBUA process led
   to bendability (r(min)/t value) improvement in V-bending tests at room
   temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interactions of Apo lipoproteins Al, All, B and HDL, LDL, VLDL with
   Polyurethane and Polyurethane-PEO Surfaces}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{The lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, VLDL) are important components of blood
   present in high concentration. Surprisingly, their role in
   blood-biomaterial interactions has been largely ignored. In previous
   work apolipoprotein AI (the main protein component of HDL) was
   identified as a major constituent of protein layers adsorbed from plasma
   to biomaterials having a wide range of surface properties, and
   quantitative data on the adsorption of apo AI to a biomedical grade
   polyurethane were reported. In the present communication quantitative
   data on the adsorption of apo AI, apo All and apoB (the latter being a
   constituent of LDL and VLDL), as well as the lipoprotein particles
   themselves (HDL, LDL, VLDL), to a biomedical segmented polyurethane (PU)
   with and without an additive containing poly(ethylene oxide) (material
   referred to as PEO) are reported. Using radiolabeled apo AI, apo All,
   and apoB, adsorption levels on PU from buffer at a protein concentration
   of 50 mu g/mL were found to be 0.34, 0.40, and 0.14 mu g/cm(2) (12, 23,
   and 0.25 nmol/cm(2)) respectively. Adsorption to the PEO surface was
   <0.02 mu g/cm(2) for all three apolipoproteins demonstrating the strong
   protein resistance of this material. In contrast to the apolipoproteins,
   significant amounts of the lipoproteins were found to adsorb to the PEO
   as well as to the PU surface. X-ray photoelectron spectra, following
   exposure of the surfaces to the lipoproteins, showed a strong phosphorus
   signal, confirming that adsorption had occurred. It therefore appears
   that a PEO-containing surface that is resistant to apolipoproteins may
   be less resistant to the corresponding lipoproteins.}},

Abstract = {{O 1s inner-shell excitation spectra of a number of vapor phase molecules

   acid, di-t-butylperoxide and luperox-F recorded using a scanning
   transmission X-ray microscope, are also reported, and compared to the
   corresponding gaseous spectra. Spectral interpretation was aided by
   comparing the spectra of the peroxide and non-peroxide counterparts and
   with ab initio calculations. A characteristic O 1s -> sigma(O-O){*}
   transition at 533.0(3) eV is identified in each peroxide species, which
   is absent in the corresponding non-peroxide counterpart species. The
   energy and intensity of the 533 eV peroxide feature is stable and thus

Abstract = {{After reviewing the protocol-dependent properties of HDA, which
   thermally anneals to LDA, and the data gap over an unusually large
   T-range between HDA, LDA, and water, we investigate whether or not,
   despite HDA's ill-defined state and distinction from a glass, the
   HDL-LDL fluctuations view of the two-liquid model can explain water's
   anomalous behavior. An analysis of the density, rho, compressibility,
   beta, heat capacity, C-p, and thermal conductivity, kappa, of water over
   a monotonic (continuous) path bridging this data gap shows the
   following: (i) Such a path between rho(water) at 320 K and rho(HDA)
   yields an untenable thermal expansion coefficient of water. (ii) There
   is neither a continuous path between beta(water) at 353 K and beta(HDA),
   nor between C-p,C-water at 363 K and C-p,C-HDA. (iii) The same value of
   rho(water), of beta(water), or of C-p,C-water at two temperatures
   separated by a maxima or a minima is incompatible with the HDL-LDL
   fluctuations view. (iv) kappa(LDA) at similar to 140 K is about twice
   that of kappa(water) at 253 K. (v) kappa(HDA) at 120 K is incompatible
   with kappa(water) at T > 320 K. Thus, there is an internal inconsistency
   between the thermodynamics of HDA seen as a glass and that of water seen
   as an HDL-LDL mixture, which is incompatible with both the HDL-LDL
   fluctuations view and the liquid-liquid transition.}},

Abstract = {{Pencil lead was used to fabricate a graphite-based electrode for sensing
   applications. Its surface was electrochemically modified using ammonium
   carbamate to make it suitable for sensing free chlorine in water
   samples. Chlorine is widely used as a disinfectant in the water
   industry, and the residual free chlorine concentration in water
   distributed to the consumers must be lower than that stipulated by
   regulatory bodies. The graphite-based amperometric sensor gave a
   selective and linear response to free chlorine in the relevant
   concentration range and no response to commonly interfering ions. It was
   evaluated further for storage stability, response time, and hysteresis.
   This sensor is being proposed as a low-cost device for determining free
   chlorine in water samples. Its ease-of-use, limitations, and feasibility
   for mass-production and application is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Research advances in the rapidly growing field of polygeneration are
   highlighted. Although `polygeneration' has had many meanings, the
   chemical engineering community has overwhelmingly settled on a meaning
   which describes a process that co-produces at least two products:
   electricity, and at least one chemical or fuel via a thermochemical
   route that does not rely on petroleum. The production of syngas is
   almost always the primary intermediate for energy conversion, but the
   feeds, products, technologies, and pathways vary widely. However, the
   choice of the most optimal polygeneration system is highly dependent on
   circumstance, and often results in systems with only one fuel or
   chemical co-produced with electricity. Conversely, the synergistic use
   of multiple types of feedstocks can have important profitability
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of supplemental damping systems (e.g., the dynamic
   vibration absorbers (DVAs)) to mitigate excessive tall building
   vibrations induced by external dynamic loads (wind storms or
   earthquakes) has increased over the last several decades. A tuned liquid
   damper (TLD) is a specific type of the DVAs that consists of a rigid
   tank which is partially filled with a liquid, usually water. The
   sloshing liquid inside the tank provides inertia forces that counteract
   the forces acting on the structure, thus reducing the building motion. A
   single sway mode of vibration is usually targeted, however, for certain
   structures multiple modes may need to be suppressed. Moreover, the
   location of the TLD on the floor plate is important for certain modes,
   such as a torsionally dominate mode. In this paper, a three-dimensional
   (3D) finite element (FE) structure-TLD system model (3D-structure-TLD)
   is proposed where the TLDs can be positioned at any location on the
   structure allowing the most effective positions in reducing the
   structure's dynamic response to be determined. Therefore, the response
   of a 3D structure (tower, high-rise building, bridge, etc.) fitted with
   single or multiple TLD(s) and subjected to dynamic excitation can be
   predicted using the proposed FE model. For torsionally sensitive
   structure (eccentric/irregular structures), this type of 3D numerical
   analysis is highly recommended. Two nonlinear TLD models are employed to
   simulate the TLD and implemented in the FE model. The 3D-structure-TLD
   system model is validated for the cases of sinusoidal and random
   excitation forces using existing experimental test values. Results from
   the 3D-structure-TLD system model are found to be in excellent agreement
   with values obtained from experimental tests.}},

Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical upper limit for the anisotropic
   hydraulic conductivity ratio of homogeneous granular materials with
   internal structure. On the basis of a volume averaging approach, a
   theoretical analysis is proposed to relate the permeability of granular
   material to the spatial distribution of pore spaces. For flow in
   granular materials, both the linear porosity in the flow direction and
   the areal porosity in the plane perpendicular to the flow direction are
   required to describe the directional variation of pore space. The
   permeability tensor is derived by considering the macroscopic momentum
   balance equation of the fluid in a porous medium. While the permeability
   is affected by the porosity and the pore space distribution, the
   permeability anisotropy ratio is dominated by the directional variation
   of the linear porosity. By accounting for the theoretical maximum and
   minimum porosity, it is shown that the upper limit of permeability
   anisotropy for homogeneous granular materials is approximately 2.5, even
   for very flat (or elongated) particles and pronounced preferential
   orientations.}},

Abstract = {{Visible-light communication (VLC) systems leverage solid-state
   illumination devices to create high-speed communication links.
   Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered
   for these intensity-modulated/direct-detection (IM/DD) optical channels,
   however, it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).
   Moreover, the implementation of linear, power-efficient, high-current,
   wideband drivers is challenging. In this paper, the concept of spatial
   summing is developed where wideband, high PAPR OFDM signals are
   partitioned into many low-PAPR narrowband signals that are transmitted
   from multiple LEDs. The signals from different LEDs are allowed to sum
   in space before being detected by a conventional OFDM receiver. Spatial
   optical-OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed in which filtered subsets of carriers
   are emitted by each LED. In addition, low-PAPR optical single-carrier
   FDMA (OSC-FDMA) is developed where different collections of LEDs act as
   virtual users in a multiple-access scheme. The different variations of
   SO-OFDM and OSC-FDMA are compared to conventional DC-biased optical
   (DCO) OFDM and are shown to achieve lower PAPR and more robustness to
   LED nonlinearities leading to error rate performance gains at high
   signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{16-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews the surface modification strategies of a wide range
   of nanomaterials using aryldiazonium salts. After a brief history of
   diazonium salts since their discovery by Peter Griess in 1858, we will
   tackle the surface chemistry using these compounds since the first
   trials in the 1950s. We will then focus on the modern surface chemistry
   of aryldiazonium salts for the modification of materials, particularly
   metallic, semiconductors, metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon-based
   nanostructures, diamond and clays. The successful modification of sp(2)
   carbon materials and metals by aryldiazonium salts paved the way to
   innovative strategies for the attachment of aryl layers to metal oxide
   nanopartides and nanodiamonds, and intercalation of clays.
   Interestingly, diazotized surfaces can easily trap nanoparticles and
   nanotubes while diazotized nanoparticles can be (electro)chemically
   reduced on electrode/materials surfaces as molecular compounds. Both
   strategies provided organized 2D surface assembled nanopartides. In this
   review, atyldiazonium salts are highlighted as efficient coupling agents
   for many types of molecular, macromolecular and nanoparticulate species,
   therefore ensuring stability to colloids on the one hand, and the
   construction of composite materials and hybrid systems with robust and
   durable interfaces/interphases, on the other hand. The last section is
   dedicated to a selection of patents and industrial products based on
   aryldiazonium-modified nanomaterials. After nearly 160 years of organic
   chemistry, diazonium salts have entered a new, long and thriving era for
   the benefit of materials, colloids, and surface scientists. This tempts
   us to introduce the terminology of ``diazonics{''} we define as the
   science and technology of aryldiazonium salt-derived materials. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, joint direction-of-departure (DOD) and
   direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for bistatic
   multiple-input-multi-output (MIMO) radar in an unknown spatially
   correlated noise environment is investigated. The signal model is based
   on the assumption that the waveforms are transmitted by two separated
   subarrays having M-1 and M-2 sensors and received by two separated
   subarrays having N-1 and N-2 sensors, respectively. The received data
   are pulse-compressed using a matching matrix consisting of M = M-1 + M-2
   orthogonally transmitted waveforms. The joint covariance matrix of
   unknown correlated noise is analyzed. A novel algorithm is proposed by
   jointly estimating the DOD and DOA with transmitter and receiver
   subarrays in unknown noise. The joint estimation algorithm is based on
   the canonical correlation decomposition (CCD) and exploits the
   shift-invariance properties in the Kronecker product structure of each
   column of the various steering matrices. The estimated DOA and DOD can
   be automatically paired correspondingly. In addition, the formulas of
   stochastic Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) for DOD and DOA estimation are
   derived. Simulations show that our method can effectively improve the
   performance of estimation in unknown correlated noise environments and
   is insensitive to having different noise environments in the two
   subarrays.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a coupled ensemble filtering and probabilistic
   collocation (EFPC) approach is proposed for uncertainty quantification
   of hydrologic models. This approach combines the capabilities of the
   ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the probabilistic collocation method
   (PCM) to provide a better treatment of uncertainties in hydrologic
   models. The EnKF method would be employed to approximate the posterior
   probabilities of model parameters and improve the forecasting accuracy
   based on the observed measurements; the PCM approach is proposed to
   construct a model response surface in terms of the posterior
   probabilities of model parameters to reveal uncertainty propagation from
   model parameters to model outputs. The proposed method is applied to the
   Xiangxi River, located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of China. The
   results indicate that the proposed EFPC approach can effectively
   quantify the uncertainty of hydrologic models. Even for a simple
   conceptual hydrological model, the efficiency of EFPC approach is about
   10 times faster than traditional Monte Carlo method without obvious
   decrease in prediction accuracy. Finally, the results can explicitly
   reveal the contributions of model parameters to the total variance of
   model predictions during the simulation period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{530}},
Pages = {{716-733}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a polynomial chaos ensemble hydrologic prediction
   system (PCEHPS) for an efficient and robust uncertainty assessment of
   model parameters and predictions, in which possibilistic reasoning is
   infused into probabilistic parameter inference with simultaneous
   consideration of randomness and fuzziness. The PCEHPS is developed
   through a two-stage factorial polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)
   framework, which consists of an ensemble of PCEs to approximate the
   behavior of the hydrologic model, significantly speeding up the
   exhaustive sampling of the parameter space. Multiple hypothesis testing
   is then conducted to construct an ensemble of reduced-dimensionality
   PCEs with only the most influential terms, which is meaningful for
   achieving uncertainty reduction and further acceleration of parameter
   inference. The PCEHPS is applied to the Xiangxi River watershed in China
   to demonstrate its validity and applicability. A detailed comparison
   between the HYMOD hydrologic model, the ensemble of PCEs, and the
   ensemble of reduced PCEs is performed in terms of accuracy and
   efficiency. Results reveal temporal and spatial variations in parameter
   sensitivities due to the dynamic behavior of hydrologic systems, and the
   effects (magnitude and direction) of parametric interactions depending
   on different hydrological metrics. The case study demonstrates that the
   PCEHPS is capable not only of capturing both expert knowledge and
   probabilistic information in the calibration process, but also of
   implementing an acceleration of more than 10 times faster than the
   hydrologic model without compromising the predictive accuracy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel dye-based method for measuring cell death in image-based screens
   is presented. Unlike conventional high- and medium-throughput cell death
   assays that measure only one form of cell death accurately, using
   multivariate analysis of micrographs of cells stained with the
   inexpensive mix, red dye nonyl acridine orange, and a nuclear stain, it
   was possible to quantify cell death induced by a variety of different
   agonists even without a positive control. Surprisingly, using a single
   known cytotoxic agent as a positive control for training a multivariate
   classifier allowed accurate quantification of cytotoxicity for
   mechanistically unrelated compounds enabling generation of dose-response
   curves. Comparison with low throughput biochemical methods suggested
   that cell death was accurately distinguished from cell stress induced by
   low concentrations of the bioactive compounds Tunicamycin and Brefeldin
   A. High-throughput image-based format analyses of more than 300 kinase
   inhibitors correctly identified 11 as cytotoxic with only 1 false
   positive. The simplicity and robustness of this dye-based assay makes it
   particularly suited to live cell screening for toxic compounds.}},

Title = {{Preliminary testing of a novel bilateral plating technique for treating

Abstract = {{Background: Current stabilization methods for periprosthetic fractures
   of the distal femur are inadequate in achieving fracture fixation, with
   complication rates as high as 29\%. A major contributor to poor outcomes
   is that these methods rely only on screw purchase in the bone to
   maintain fracture reduction. We designed, manufactured and evaluated a
   novel plating method that utilizes the femoral prosthesis to enhance
   stability for treatment of distal femoral periprosthetic fractures.
   Methods: Medial and lateral plates were designed and manufactured based
   on geometry of a synthetic femur and femoral prosthesis. The two plates
   were linked via a compression screw and a small tab on each plate that
   inserted into pre-existing slots on the prosthesis. Mechanical tests
   (500 N compression or 250 N anterior directed cantilever bending), were
   performed on synthetic femurs with simple transverse fractures (3 mm
   gap) just superior to the distal femoral prosthesis that were stabilized
   using either the prototype plates or a single lateral plate.
   Translational movements of the fracture site during loading were
   measured using 3D motion tracking.
   Findings: With the single lateral plate, the distal fragment experienced
   a resultant displacement of 0.40 mm under cantilever bending and 0.61 mm
   under compression (13\% and 20\% respectively of fracture gap width).
   With the bilateral plates, fracture gap motion was significantly reduced
   to 0.13 mm under bending and compression (4.3\% of the fracture gap).
   Interpretation: Our results indicate that a bilateral plating method is
   capable of improving stabilization of periprosthetic fractures compared
   to the traditional lateral plating technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Response Evaluation of Reinforced Concrete Block Structural Walls
   Subjected to Blast Loading}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of the new American and Canadian standards for
   blast resistant design, there is a need to evaluate the response of
   different structural components under such extreme loads. This paper
   focuses on experimentally evaluating the damage levels and the
   out-of-plane response of fully grouted reinforced concrete block
   structural walls under blast loading-a load that they are typically not
   designed to resist. The scaled walls reported in this paper cover a
   range of design parameters and charge weights that reflect different
   vulnerabilities and threat levels. Three different reinforcement ratios
   and three different charge weights have been used, with scaled distances
   as low as 1.61 m/kg(1/3) and two different boundary conditions, to
   evaluate the walls' response. In general, the results show that the
   walls are capable of withstanding substantial blast load levels with
   different extents of damage depending on their vertical reinforcement
   ratio and scaled distance. However, brittle behavior was observed in the
   walls with a reinforcement ratio higher than 0.6\%. This is attributed
   to the fact that seismically detailed (concrete or masonry) structural
   walls designed to respond in a ductile manner under in-plane loads might
   develop brittle failure under out-of-plane loads. This is a consequence
   of the increased concrete block wall reinforcement ratio in the
   out-of-plane direction compared with the same in the in-plane direction.
   The maximum experimental support rotation values were compared with the
   corresponding values predicted using an available nonlinear
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model presented in the Unified
   Facilities Criteria document. In general, the comparison between the
   experimentally obtained and the analytically predicted support rotation
   values indicated reasonable agreement. The test results are expected to
   contribute to the growing masonry blast performance database of
   experimental results and to the future development of reinforced
   concrete block wall design provisions under blast loading in North
   America, in which a balance between the wall strength and ductility
   might be necessary to remain below the different damage classifications
   specified by the performance-based design oriented ASCE and Canadian
   Standards Association (CSA) standards. (C) 2015 American Society of

   Quantifications for an Asymmetrical Reinforced Concrete Masonry Building}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on analyzing the performance of structural walls
   comprising the seismic force resisting system (SFRS) in a scaled
   asymmetrical fully grouted reinforced masonry (RM) building tested under
   quasi-static loading. The in-plane tensile and compressive strains
   calculated at the wall toes and the curvature profile along the wall
   height as well as the contributions of the flexural and the shear
   deformations to the overall wall displacements were quantified. The
   component-level (when the walls were tested individually) responses were
   compared with those at the system level (in a building). In addition,
   key input parameters for displacement-based seismic design approaches,
   including stiffness degradation and the trend of the building's
   effective period increase as well as the variation of hysteretic
   damping, were quantified. Moreover, the building energy dissipation
   levels were compared with those generated during the individual wall
   tests to quantify the contribution of each component to the overall
   system-level performance. Finally, within the context of
   performance-based seismic design, the damage states of the building
   walls at different loading stages were identified and the damage levels,
   correlated to the maximum developed crack widths in the walls, were
   quantified utilizing a digital image correlation-based technique. Based
   on the analyses conducted, it was observed that wall curvatures and the
   extent of plasticity from the building test were not consistent with
   those based on the individual wall tests. In addition, the current test
   results showed that the total energy dissipation of the building does
   not only result from the walls aligned along the loading direction, but
   also from orthogonal walls engaged through the floor slabs as a result
   of the building twist. Finally, the study is expected to contribute to
   understanding the system-level performance of RM SFRS in order to
   facilitate their adoption in the next generation of performance-based
   seismic design codes in North America. (C) 2015 American Society of

Title = {{Strain Rate Effect on Development Length of Steel Reinforcement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Accidental or premeditated explosions have detrimental effects on the
   infrastructure near the center of explosion and pose major threats to
   human life. Thus, research is currently underway to study the effects of
   explosions on infrastructure systems with the ultimate goal of
   minimizing infrastructure damage and saving lives. Because reinforced
   concrete is the most common building material used in blast-resistant
   infrastructure design and construction, understanding the effect of
   blast loads on reinforced concrete components is essential to reaching
   this goal. The prevailing design philosophy for blast-resistant
   structures is energy dissipation through reinforcement yielding
   (ductility) and large bending deformations without the incidence of
   nonductile failure modes such as shear and bond. However, information
   regarding the bond behavior and strength of steel reinforcement-concrete
   bonds under blast loads is rather scant; therefore, this paper reports
   on an experimental program designed to investigate the strain rate
   effect on steel reinforcement-concrete bond. Reinforced concrete beams
   longitudinally reinforced with 15M, 20M, or 25M were tested in a shock
   tube under simulated blast loading. The test results show that high
   strain rate increases the steel reinforcement-concrete bond strength and
   thus, that the static load development lengths of these bars are
   adequate for developing their dynamic yield strengths at high strain
   rate. The dynamic increase factor for bond stress is determined to be
   1.11 for 15M, 2.24 for 20M, and 3.68 for 25M bar. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{The kinetics of ferrite growth in three Fe-C-Mn-Si quaternary alloys has
   been measured using controlled decarburization tests at four
   temperatures between 755 degrees C and 825 degrees C, and a critical,
   quantitative test of the existence of a coupled solute drag effect
   (CSDE) is performed. The Mn and Si binding energies and trans-interface
   diffusivities (critical inputs in solute drag modelling) are taken
   directly from analogous experiments recently reported for ternary
   Fe-C-Mn and Fe-C-Si systems. The net solute drag effect experimentally
   observed in the quaternary system is found to be significantly less than
   that predicted by modelling using binding energies and trans-interface
   diffusivities calibrated on the respective ternary systems, i.e. an
   anti-CSDE is observed. This surprising observation is discussed in the
   context of solute interactions within the migrating interface and a
   number of future directions requiring investigation are highlighted. (C)

   Both X-ray diffraction and TEM selected area electron diffraction
   patterns (SAEDPs) clearly confirm the presence of the Mn(BH4)(2) and
   LiCl phases in the synthesized nanocomposite. No other phases were
   detected. Bright field high-resolution TEM imaging of the synthesized
   composite powder particles reveals the presence of nanograins consistent
   with LiCl and Mn(BH4)(2) within the powder particles. Their respective
   grain sizes, estimated as the equivalent circle diameters (ECD) from the
   high-resolution TEM micrographs with the corrected sample standard
   deviations, are within the range of 14.1 +/- 3.7 nm and 10.0 +/- 2.9 nm
   for LiCl and Mn(BH4)(2), respectively.
   The XRD patterns of the thermally dehydrogenated (Mn(BH4)(2) + 2LiCl)
   nanocomposite do not exhibit any Bragg diffraction peaks belonging to
   either crystalline Mn or B. In contrast, the SAED patterns and EDS
   elemental maps provide strong evidence that both Mn and B exist in the
   dehydrogenated powder as crystalline phases alpha-Mn and beta-B,
   respectively. The results show that the lack of XRD Bragg diffraction
   peaks is insufficient evidence that the Mn and B elemental products of
   Mn(BH4)(2) thermolysis can be classified as being amorphous. (C) 2015

   abundance (NA), sigma= 60,900 barns) and Gd-157 (15.65\% NA, sigma=
   254,000 barns). Our previous work focused on muscle but this only
   informs about the short term kinetics of Gd. We studied the possibility
   of measuring bone, as it may be a long term storage site for Gd. A human
   simulating bone phantom set was developed. The phantoms were doped with
   seven concentrations of Gd of concentrations 0.0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 120
   and 150 ppm. Additional elements important for neutron activation
   analysis, Na, Cl and Ca, were also included to create an overall
   elemental composition consistent with Reference Man. The overall
   conclusion is that the potential application of this Pu-Be-based prompt
   in vivo NAA for the monitoring of the storage and retention of Gd in
   bone is not feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alternating current (AC) electroluminescence of thin film oxide
   phosphors is well known. However in this work electroluminescence of
   bulk oxide powder phosphors is achieved. A new type of AC
   Electroluminescent (ACEL) device has been created and developed by
   integrating SiC whiskers into a phosphor matrix composed of
   manganese-activated zinc germanate (Zn2GeO4:Mn2+). The conductive SiC
   whiskers enhance the average electric field in specific regions of the
   phosphor such that localized breakdown of the phosphor occurs, thus
   emitting green light. This field enhancement allows light emission to
   occur in thick film oxide powder phosphors and is notably the first time
   that bright and reasonably efficient electroluminescence of zinc
   germanate has been observed without using expensive thin film deposition
   techniques. Light emission has been achieved in thick pressed pellets
   using surface-deposited electrodes and the brightness-voltage
   characteristics of light emission are shown to be consistent with field
   emission of carriers from the embedded whiskers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Understanding the function of individual screw elements in twin screw
   wet granulation has become an area of intense study but has yet to
   contemplate the interactions of adjacent elements. The present work
   examines the influence of conveying elements around the critical

   prepared using nine different screw configurations with flight pitches
   of 20, 30 and 40 mm and tested at two different degrees of channel fill
   utilizing a placebo formulation of 20 wt\% microcrystalline cellulose in
   alpha-lactose monohydrate. Samples were taken directly from the upstream
   and downstream conveying elements as well as the machine exit and
   analyzed for particle size, shape, apparent porosity and fracture
   strength. The results showed that the particle size, shape, and fracture
   strength of granules produced were significantly influenced by the pitch
   of downstream conveying elements while upstream conveying elements had
   no effect on exiting particles. Both zones were found to be insensitive
   to the degree of fill, though the variance in measurements decreased at
   higher fill. Similar results were observed when the formulation was
   adjusted to included 15\% ibuprofen (though the ratio of lactose to
   microcrystalline cellulose remained constant). (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Changes in the composition of type I and type III collagen in tissue can
   shed light on various diseases. However, many of the current collagen
   detection techniques require invasive and destructive tissue sampling.
   In this study, a low cost, low complexity light emitting diode (LED)
   based system was developed to realize both non-invasive detection and
   specific discrimination of collagen and elastin variations in tissue
   based on fluorescence lifetimes. Modulated LED excitation was applied to
   frequency domain (FD) fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy to calculate
   tissue autofluorescence lifetimes. Using this method, fluorescence
   lifetimes from collagen type I versus type III were clearly separated at
   3.95 ns and 5.01 ns, respectively, distinct from the elastin lifetime at
   6.78 ns. The probe was tested on bovine ocular tissues, with cornea
   showing much shorter average lifetime of 4.27 ns than sclera at 7.48 ns.
   Furthermore, measurements of an 8 mm murine skin wound at 14 days
   post-wounding also showed distinct, longer average lifetimes at 9.74 ns
   versus normal skin at 6.72 ns. This FD tissue detection technique can
   potentially offer a way to examine tissue structures and discern the
   underlying pathology nondestructively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   a function of only the particle concentration. The viscosity of the
   nanofluid is found to decrease with temperature, similarly to the

Abstract = {{A fundamental challenge for PET block detector designs is to deploy
   finer crystal elements while limiting the number of readout channels.
   The standard Anger-logic scheme including light sharing (an 8 by 8
   crystal array coupled to a 2 x 2 photodetector array with an optical
   diffuser, multiplexing ratio: 16:1) has been widely used to address such
   a challenge. Our work proposes a generalized model to study the impacts
   of two critical parameters on spatial resolution performance of a PET
   block detector: multiple interaction events and signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR). The study consists of the following three parts: (1) studying
   light output profile and multiple interactions of 511 keV photons within
   crystal arrays of different crystal widths (horn 4 mm down to 1 mm,
   constant height: 20 mm); (2) applying the Anger-logic positioning
   algorithm to investigate positioning/decoding uncertainties (i.e.,
   ``block effect{''}) in terms of peak-to-valley ratio (PVR), with light
   sharing, multiple interactions and photodetector SNR Laken into account;
   and (3) studying the dependency of spatial resolution on SNR in the
   context of modulation transfer function (MTF). The proposed model can be
   used to guide the development and evaluation of a standard Anger-logic

Title = {{IgY antibodies in human nutrition for disease prevention}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Oral administration of preformed specific antibodies is an attractive
   approach against infections of the digestive system in humans and
   animals in times of increasing antibiotic resistances. Previous studies
   showed a positive effect of egg yolk IgY antibodies on bacterial
   intoxications in animals and humans. Immunization of chickens with
   specific antigens offers the possibility to create various forms of
   antibodies. Research shows that orally applied IgY's isolated from egg
   yolks can passively cure or prevent diseases of the digestive system.
   The use of these alternative therapeutic drugs provides further
   advantages: (1) The production of IgY's is a non-invasive alternative to
   current methods; (2) The keeping of chickens is inexpensive; (3) The
   animals are easy to handle; (4) It avoids repetitive bleeding of
   laboratory animals; (5) It is also very cost effective regarding the
   high IgY concentration within the egg yolk. Novel targets of these
   antigen specific antibodies are Helicobacter pylori and also molecules
   involved in signaling pathways in gastric cancer. Furthermore, also
   dental caries causing bacteria like Streptococcus mutans or
   opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients are
   possible targets. Therefore, IgY's included in food for human
   consumption may be able to prevent or cure human diseases.}},

Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Microwave absorbers have important applications in various areas
   including stealth, camouflage, and antenna. Here, we have designed an
   ultra-broadband light absorber by integrating two differentsized tapered
   hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) waveguides, each of which has wide but
   different absorption bands due to broadband slow-light response, into a
   unit cell. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that
   in such a design strategy, the low absorption bands between high
   absorption bands with a single-sized tapered HMM waveguide array can be
   effectively eliminated, resulting in a largely expanded absorption
   bandwidth ranging from 2.3 to 40 GHz. The presented ultra-broadband
   light absorber is also insensitive to polarization and robust against
   incident angle. Our results offer a further step in developing practical
   artificial electromagnetic absorbers, which will impact a broad range of
   applications at microwave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this Letter we demonstrate that a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM)
   waveguide array exhibits a giant modal bire-fringence between the TE and
   TM modes by utilization of a rectangular waveguide cross section. We
   further reveal that the designed polarization manipulation device using
   such a HMM waveguide array with a subwavelength thickness presents the
   ability to function as a polarizer or quarter- or half-wave plate that
   enables transmission only for electromagnetic wave (EW) that is
   polarized at a specific direction, or converting linearly polarized EW
   to circularly and elliptically polarized EW or rotating linearly
   polarized EW with 90 degrees at terahertz (THz) frequencies. A giant
   modal birefringence between the TE and TM modes from 0.8 to 2 between 2
   and 4.8 THz is achievable, which is dozens of times higher than
   conventional quartz birefringent crystals for THz waves. This
   polarization manipulation device has the performance merits including
   high transmission efficiency, ultra-compactness, and tunable
   birefringence, offering a promising approach to manipulating the

Title = {{Experimental evaluation of the seismic performance of reinforced
   concrete structural walls with different end configurations}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{246-263}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The Canterbury Earthquake Royal Commission report (2013) showed that
   cantilever reinforced concrete (RC) walls failed at a lower ductility
   capacity than expected due to a plasticity concentration region within a
   very limited height near the location of the primary cracks at the base
   of the walls. The New Zealand Standards (NZS 3101) (2006) {[}2] and the
   Canadian design standards (CSA A23.3-14) (2014), adopt the same capacity
   design approaches for RC walls design, with both standards specifying a
   minimum vertical reinforcement ratios (rho(v)\%) of 0.25\% for RC walls.
   Subsequently, the current study was conducted to study the seismic
   performance of RC walls with different vertical reinforcement ratios and
   cross sectional configurations. In this paper, six half-scaled RC
   structural walls were constructed and tested under quasi-static
   displacement controlled cyclic loading. The walls had three different
   cross sectional configurations; rectangular, flanged and boundary
   elements and were tested with specific design characteristics selected
   to evaluate and compare the wall ductility capabilities. In this
   respect, wall ductility can be defined as the ability of the walls to
   undergo inelastic deformations with no/low strength degradation, which
   is essential in Seismic Force Resisting Systems (SFRS) as it is not
   economically feasible to design SFRS to behave elastically under seismic
   loadings. So the ductility quantification of the structural walls used
   were ductility ratio between the intended displacements with the yield
   displacement. Based on the test results, the ultimate drift at 20\%
   ultimate strength degradation varied between 0.9\% and 1.6\% and the
   ultimate level displacement ductility (mu(Delta 0.8u)), ranged
   approximately between 4.0 and 6.0. Although the flanged walls and the
   walls with boundary elements were designed to develop almost the same
   capacity as that of the rectangular walls, the seismic performance of
   the former wall type was found to be superior to that of their
   rectangular counterparts with respect to both the ultimate displacement
   capacity and ductility level. Moreover, using the flanges and the
   boundary elements walls resulted in approximately 30\% reduction of the
   vertical reinforcement compared to that of the rectangular walls when
   designed to resist the same lateral loads while carrying identical
   gravity loads. In addition to gaining insights on the response of walls
   with boundary elements, the results indicated that structural walls with
   low vertical reinforcement ratio can experience reduced ductility as
   indicated in the Canterbury Commission Report. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   liquid under a high pressure shows a sub-T-g endotherm with a C-p peak,
   an exothermic minimum, and finally the true T-g-endotherm of the glass
   (A. Weitz, B. Wunderlich, J. Polym. Sci. Polym. Phys.12 (1974) 2473).
   Amann-Winkel et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.) 110 (2013) 17720)
   reported that the ambient pressure DSC scan of eHDA, the expanded high
   density amorphous ice, cooled under a pressure of 0.07 GPa shows onset
   of a C-p endotherm at 116 K. Unaware of the studies of
   pressure-densified glasses, they regarded this onset as a second glass
   transition of water at 116 K involving translational mobility. We show
   that: (i) their eHDA at 0.07 GPa and 140 K was ultraviscous water of
   high density, and the ex situ DSC scans were obtained for the recovered
   glassy solid that formed on cooling this water under 0.07 GPa pressure
   to 90K, (ii) decrease in the onset temperature of the 116 K endotherm
   they found on decreasing the cooling rate, and used as a typical
   signature of glass-transition, is not a signature of glass transition
   and this rules out the possibility of this endotherm being a glass
   transition endotherm nor are the methods claimed to be standard are
   standard or reliable methods, (iii) the DSC scans of the recovered
   glassy solid at ambient pressure are qualitatively similar to those
   found for pressure-densified glasses, and (iv) the experimental
   procedure and data analysis of the dielectric relaxation study is too
   inaccurate to reliably support the view that water has a second T-g. We
   conclude that the rise in C-p at 116 K is the sub-T(g)endotherm of
   pressure-densified glassy water, i.e., water has only one T-g in the DSC
   scan at ambient pressure. We also describe other findings on
   pressure-densified glasses, and the possibility of their sub-T-g
   mobility affecting certain irreversible processes, and suggest
   experiments for investigating why a glass formed by cooling under high
   pressure has different properties at ambient pressure than a glass
   formed by cooling at ambient pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid

   byproduct, pyrophosphate (PPO, a byproduct of the reaction; the yield is
   thereby limited. The conventional method for hydrolysis of PPi by
   pyrophosphatase (PPase) is not well adapted for operation at elevated
   temperatures over long times as required during the PCK In this work, we
   reported a strategy to improve the PCR yield using a conjugate of the
   enzyme with the thermally responsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAM). Pyrophosphatase (PPase) was conjugated to PNIPAM
   site-specifically near the active center. As compared to the free
   enzyme, the optimum temperature of the conjugate was shown to increase
   from 45 to 60 degrees C. For the conjugate, about 77\% enzyme activity
   was retained after incubation at 60 degrees C for 3 h, representing a
   6.8-fold increase as compared to the unconjugated enzyme. For the PCR
   using the conjugate, the yield was LS-fold greater than using the
   unconjugated enzyme. As well as improving the yield of the PCR (and
   possibly other biological reactions) at elevated temperature, polymer
   conjugation may also provide a strategy to improve the heat resistance

   respectively, closely match those expected for idealized diffusional
   Nabarro-Herring creep. These exponents are observed in the presence of
   significant stress-assisted diffusive grain boundary migration,
   indicating that Nabarro-Herring creep and stress-assisted boundary
   migration contribute in the same manner to the macroscopic constitutive
   relation. When plastic response is dislocation-mediated, power-law
   stress exponents inferred from dislocation climb rates are found to
   increase monotonically from m similar or equal to 3, as expected for
   generic climb-mediated natural creep, to m similar or equal to 5.8 as
   the dislocation density.d is increased beyond typical experimental
   values. Stress exponents m greater than or similar to 3 directly
   measured from simulations that include dislocation nucleation, climb,
   glide, and annihilation are attributed primarily to these large rho(d)
   effects. Extrapolation to lower rho(d) suggests that m similar or equal
   to 4-4.5 should be obtained from our PFC description at typical
   experimental rho(d) values, which is consistent with expectations for
   power-law creep via mixed climb and glide. The anomalously large stress
   exponents observed in our atomistic simulations at large rho(d) may
   nonetheless be relevant to systems in which comparable densities are
   obtained locally within heterogeneous defect domains such as dislocation
   cell walls or tangles.}},

Abstract = {{In this perspective, an overview of the key challenges and opportunities
   in the design of new energy systems is presented. Recent shifts in the

   concerns are creating a new set of challenges for process design
   engineers. Due to the massive scale and impact of energy conversion
   processes, some of the best solutions to the energy crisis lie in the

   particular, many of the most promising solutions take a big-picture
   approach by integrating many different processes together to take
   advantage of synergies between seemingly unrelated processes. This paper

Abstract = {{A processing map for extruded AZ31-1Ca-1.5NAl composite has been
   developed, which exhibited four important domains for hot working. The
   corresponding temperatures and strain rates associated with these
   domains are: (1) 250-350 degrees C and 0.0003-0.01s(-1); (1A) 350-410
   degrees C and 0.0003-0.01s(-1); (2): 410-490 degrees C and
   0.002-0.2s(-1); and (3) 325-410 degrees C and 0.6s(-1) to 10s(-1).
   Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurred in all the four domains
   although different slip mechanisms and recovery processes are involved.
   Basal slip and prismatic slip dominates deformation in Domains 1 and 1A,
   respectively, with recovery occurring by climb that is lattice
   self-diffusion controlled. However, because of the high strain rates in
   Domain 3, recovery occurs through a climb process, controlled by grain
   boundary self-diffusion. The recovery mechanism in Domain 2 is
   cross-slip assisted by pyramidal slip along with basal and prismatic
   slip. The grain size has a linear relation with Zener-Hollomon parameter
   in all the domains. At high strain rates, the composite undergoes shear
   fracture at lower temperatures and intercrystalline fracture at higher
   temperatures. All of the identified DRX domains are suitable for
   conducting bulk metal forming processes although the one with the
   highest strain rates (Domain 3) is preferred for achieving high
   productivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a fractional factorial probabilistic collocation method
   is proposed to reveal statistical significance of hydrologic model
   parameters and their multi-level interactions affecting model outputs,
   facilitating uncertainty propagation in a reduced dimensional space. The
   proposed methodology is applied to the Xiangxi River watershed in China
   to demonstrate its validity and applicability, as well as its capability
   of revealing complex and dynamic parameter interactions. A set of
   reduced polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) only with statistically
   significant terms can be obtained based on the results of factorial
   analysis of variance (ANOVA), achieving a reduction of uncertainty in
   hydrologic predictions. The predictive performance of reduced PCEs is
   verified by comparing against standard PCEs and the Monte Carlo with
   Latin hypercube sampling (MC-LHS) method in terms of reliability,
   sharpness, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Results reveal that the
   reduced PCEs are able to capture hydrologic behaviors of the Xiangxi
   River watershed, and they are efficient functional representations for
   propagating uncertainties in hydrologic predictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study highlights the impacts that the selected hydrologic
   characteristics of a basin have on the spatial variability of
   hydrometric networks. The study was conducted using streamflow
   monitoring networks in two Canadian basins, specifically in the
   Hamilton, Halton, Credit Valley basins of Ontario and the Columbia River
   basin of British Columbia. The Dual Entropy-Multiobjective Optimization
   (DEMO) model which has been demonstrated to be sufficiently robust for
   designing optimum networks in a large basin was used in these analyses.
   In addition to the entropy functions, the spatial variability of flow
   networks was examined by either excluding or including hydrologic
   signatures and indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) of a basin. The
   entropy functions are used to identify optimal trade-offs between the
   maximum possible information content and the minimum shared information
   among stations. The hydrologic signatures are used to quantify
   hydrological response characteristics among sub-basins, and the IHAs,
   which are normally used to determine how a hydrologic regime has been
   altered by an impact, are instead used to quantify differences between
   sub-basins. It was found that the optimal locations for the new stations
   were well captured by the objective functions. Also, new stations
   covered a wider area when hydrological signatures and IHAs were
   considered, enhancing the objective functions. The inclusion of
   streamflow signatures increased emphasis on the headwaters whereas the
   inclusion of IHAs increased emphasis on the downstream and disturbed
   regions. Accounting for such spatial variability in designing
   hydrometric networks is crucial in obtaining an optimal network. (C)

Abstract = {{The enhanced mechanics, unique chemistries, and potential for domain
   formation in interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels have attracted
   significant interest in the context of biomedical applications. However,
   conventional IPNs are not directly injectable in a biological context,
   limiting their potential utility in such applications. Herein, we report
   a fully injectable and thermoresponsive interpenetrating polymer network
   formed by simultaneous reactive mixing of hydrazone cross-linked
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), and thiosuccinimide cross-linked
   poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The resulting IPN gels rapidly (<1 min)
   after injection without the need for heat, UV irradiation, or
   small-molecule cross-linkers. The IPNs, cross-linked by kinetically
   orthogonal mechanisms, showed a significant synergistic enhancement in
   shear storage modulus compared to the individual component networks as
   well as distinctive pore morphology, degradation kinetics, and thermal
   swelling; in particular, significantly lower hysteresis was observed
   over the thermal phase transition relative to single-network PNIPAM
   hydrogels.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel process intensification design is proposed to
   integrate the Radiant Syngas Cooler (RSC) utilised to cool the
   coal-derived synthesis gas in entrained-bed gasifiers and a steam
   methane reformer (SMR). The feasibility of the proposed integrated
   system is analyzed by developing a rigorous, dynamic, multi-dimensional
   model and establishing design heuristics for the integrated system. Two
   different flow configurations are explored; co-current and
   counter-current. The simulation results show that the proposed concept
   is feasible that allows for methane conversions as high as 80\% in
   co-current mode and 88\% in counter-current mode. The results also
   demonstrate that the counter-current design, though with higher
   conversion and cooling duty provided when compared to co-current
   designs, is limited by the tube wall material limitations. Our analysis
   shows that the total avoided CO2 emissions is 133 tonnes/h by using the
   proposed integrated configuration in place of an external reformer for
   the natural gas feed rates considered in this study. In addition, a
   sensitivity analysis is performed on key model assumptions and the
   resulting effect on the performance is assessed. The sensitivity results
   have helped identify key factors to consider prior to pilot-scale
   implementation and further improvement for agile designs; a one third
   reduction in tube length reduced pressure drop by as much as 50\% but
   reduces methane conversion by 15\% points, neglecting slag deposition on
   tubes over-predicts performance only by 3\%, and a 10\% change in gas
   emissivity calculations affects model prediction of performance by less
   than 1\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate analytic models for the area, delay and power of the Hypermesh
   NoC topology, realized with the Altera family of FPGAs, are presented.
   Hypermeshes are based on the concept of hypergraphs, which consist of a
   set of nodes and a set of hyperedges, where the hyperedges represent
   low-latency switches which interconnect multiple nodes with
   deterministic latencies. Three different switch designs for the
   hyperedges are proposed and evaluated. Two parallel algorithms are
   considered; (a) the Bitonic sorting algorithm, and (b) the FFT parallel
   algorithm. The analytic models are shown to be very accurate, typically
   within 6 percent. The 2D Hypermesh is compared to the 2D layouts of the
   binary hypercubes (BHC) and generalized hypercubes (GHC) in terms of
   area, energy per algorithm, and the Energy-Area product. The Energy-Area
   product is proposed as an useful design metric to evaluate NoCs, which
   combines both the cost and the performance metrics of an NoC into one.
   Our analysis indicates that the 2D Hypermeshes generally have
   considerably lower area, energy, and Energy-Area product compared to the
   2D layouts of the Hypercubes.}},

Abstract = {{Ternary III-nitride based nanowires (NWs) are promising for
   optoelectronic applications by offering advantageous design and control
   over composition, structure, and strain. Atomic-level chemical ordering
   in wurtzite InGaN alloys along the c-plane direction with a 1:1
   periodicity within InGaN/GaN NW heterostructures was investigated by
   scanning transmission electron microscopy. Atomic-numbersensitive
   imaging contrast was used to simultaneously assign the In-rich and
   Ga-rich planes and determine the crystal polarity to differentiate
   unique sublattice sites. The nonrandom occupation of the c-planes in the
   InGaN alloys is confirmed by the occurrence of additional superlattice
   spots in the diffraction pattern within the ternary alloy. Compositional
   modulations in the ordered InGaN was further studied using
   atomic-resolution elemental mapping, outlining the substantial
   In-enrichment. Confirming the preferential site occupation of In-atoms
   provides experimental validation for the previous theoretical model of
   ordered InGaN alloys in bulk epilayers based on differences in surface
   site energy. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that atomic
   ordering in InGaN has a surface energetics-induced origin. Optimization
   of atomic ordering, in particular in III-nitride NW heterostructures,
   could be an alternative design tool toward desirable structural and
   compositional properties for various device applications operating at
   longer visible wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a generalized fuzzy two-stage stochastic programming
   (GFTSP) method is developed for planning water resources management
   systems under uncertainty. The developed GFTSP method can deal with
   uncertainties expressed as probability distributions, fuzzy sets, as
   well as fuzzy random variables. With the aid of a robust stepwise
   interactive algorithm, solutions for GFTSP can be generated by solving a
   set of deterministic submodels. Furthermore, the possibility information
   (expressed as fuzzy membership functions) can be reflected in the
   solutions for the objective function value and decision variables. The
   developed GFTSP approach is also applied to a water resources management
   and planning problem to demonstrate its applicability. Solutions of
   decision variables and objective function value are expressed as fuzzy
   membership functions, reflecting the fluctuating ranges of decision
   alternatives under different plausibilities. And thus, the water
   alternatives can be directly derived from the obtained fuzzy membership
   functions when the preferred a value is predefined by decision makers.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{205-215}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A common problem encountered in rock engineering involves the
   specification of strength anisotropy in transversely isotropic rocks
   such as slate and schist. The strength anisotropy under compression has
   been relatively well established, whereas the formulation of the tensile
   strength anisotropy has received less attention due to the difficulty of
   experimental validation. In this paper, a recently developed 3-D tensile
   failure function for transversely isotropic rocks is further examined.
   The failure condition incorporates three strength parameters and employs
   a 2nd order tensor, whose principal directions are those of material
   fabric, to describe the spatial variation of the tensile strength. It is
   shown that both the single plane of weakness theory of tensile failure
   and Nova and Zaninetti's failure condition are two special cases of the
   3-D criterion in the context of the spatial distribution of the tensile
   strength. A procedure for the identification of the strength parameters
   is outlined. The direct tensile tests on the transversely isotropic
   samples with various orientations are simulated by invoking the critical
   plane approach with the 3-D tensile failure function. The loading
   conditions considered in the simulation include uniaxial tension,
   triaxial tension, triaxial extension and true triaxial extension. The
   ultimate value of the axial tensile stress at failure and the associated
   orientation of the failure plane are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The presence of microfeatures/nanofeatures with sharp asperities on the
   emitter electrodes of ion drag electrohydrodynamic (EHD) micropumps is
   likely to enhance the local electric field and charge injection
   significantly, and thus the pressure generation and flow rates. The
   objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of EHD
   micropumps with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) on the emitter
   electrodes. The micropumps had 100 pairs of planar electrodes where the
   width of the emitter and collector electrodes was 20 and 40 mu m,
   respectively, with a cross-sectional domain of 100 mu m x 5 mm. Two
   micropumps with interelectrode spacing of 120 and 40 mu m were tested
   with a smooth emitter surface, and where SWCNT were electrophoretically
   deposited on the emitter electrodes using HFE7100 as the working fluid.
   The threshold voltage for charge injection lowered by a factor of 3 and
   1.4 for the two pumps with SWCNT on the emitter electrodes compared with
   the smooth electrode case. The corresponding static pressure head
   increased by a factor 5, while the flow rate at no external back
   pressure increased by a factor 3 for the pump with interelectrode
   spacing of 120 mu m. For the pump with interelectrode spacing of 40 mu
   m, a maximum static pressure of 4.7 kPa was achieved at 900 V with SWCNT
   on the emitter electrode. {[}2014-0308]}},

   sources and production together with transport are of great importance.
   SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed (SPARROW) is a nonlinear
   regression water quality model that simulates sources and transport of
   contaminants such as dissolved-solids. However, SPARROW simulations of
   dissolved-solids in the UCRB only represent conditions through 1998 due
   to limited data availability. More importantly, prior simulations
   focused on a single year calibration and its transferability to other
   years, and the validity of this approach is questionable, given the
   changing hydrologic and climatic conditions. This study presents
   different calibration approaches to assess the best approach for
   reducing model uncertainty. This study conducted simulations from 1999
   to 2011, and the results showed good model accuracy. However, the number
   of monitoring stations decreased significantly in recent years resulting
   in higher model uncertainty. The uncertainty analysis was conducted
   using SPARROW results and bootstrapping. The results suggest that the
   watershed rankings based on salinity yields changed due to the
   uncertainty analysis and therefore, uncertainty consideration should be
   an important part of the management strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Confocal microscopy has several advantages over wide-field microscopy,
   such as out-of-focus light suppression, 3D sectioning, and compatibility
   with specialized detectors. While wide-field microscopy is a faster
   approach, multiplexed confocal schemes can be used to make confocal
   microscopy more suitable for high-throughput applications, such as
   high-content screening (HCS) commonly used in drug discovery. An
   increasingly powerful modality in HCS is fluorescence lifetime imaging
   microscopy (FLIM), which can be used to measure protein-protein
   interactions through Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET). FLIM-FRET
   for HCS combines the requirements of high throughput, high resolution
   and specialized time-resolving detectors, making it difficult to
   implement using wide-field and spinning disk confocal approaches. We
   developed a novel foci array scan method that can achieve uniform
   multiplex confocal acquisition using stationary lenslet arrays for high
   resolution and high throughput FLIM. Unlike traditional mirror
   galvanometers, which work in Fourier space between scan lenses, this
   scan method uses optical flats to steer a 2-dimension foci array through
   refraction. After integrating this scanning scheme in a multiplexing
   confocal FLIM system, we demonstrate it offers clear benefits over
   traditional mirror galvanometer scanners in scan linearity, uniformity,
   cost and complexity. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{The nonlinear peak response distribution of structure-TLD systems during
   common wind events}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{226-237}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Linearized equivalent mechanical models are often used to conduct
   preliminary tuned liquid damper (TLD) design; however, they cannot
   capture nonlinear behavior resulting from the coupling among sloshing
   modes. Therefore, these models underestimate the expected peak wave
   height, a quantity that is necessary to evaluate the required tank
   freeboard. In this study, a method is presented to estimate the
   nonlinear peak wave height using an equivalent mechanical model.
   A linearized equivalent mechanical model of the structure-TLD system is
   employed to determine the RMS responses of the structural displacement
   and the TLD fundamental sloshing mode wave height. Davenport's
   derivation is used to estimate the probability density function of the
   peak structural displacement. Subsequently, the probability density
   function of the peak wave heights is derived using a Rayleigh-Stokes
   model, which employs an extended second order Stokes wave theory to
   estimate the nonlinear peak wave heights. Expressions are derived to
   calculate the mean-peak wave height as a function of the RMS response of
   the fundamental sloshing mode, and the fluid depth ratio.
   Structure-TLD system tests and nonlinear simulations are used to
   evaluate the model. Findings reveal that the Rayleigh model is in
   agreement with the experimental and simulated peak structural response
   distributions. In addition, the Rayleigh-Stokes model is in agreement
   with the experimental and particular simulated peak wave height
   distributions. Discrepancies are expected to arise when the fluid depth
   ratio is small, the excitation amplitude is large, and the damping
   screens are positioned to provide significant damping to the second
   sloshing mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)-confined concrete-steel composite columns
   have been recently introduced as a retrofit technique for structural
   steel columns. This technique involves placing a two-part FRP tube
   around an existing steel column and subsequently filling the void
   between the steel section and the FRP tube with concrete to create a
   composite column. The composite action occurs due to the concrete
   encasing the steel section and the FRP confining the concrete. Within
   this focus, an experimental investigation has been undertaken with the
   objectives of evaluating the effect of adding confined concrete to
   encase a steel W section, the effect of using a split-tube system as a
   practical encasement technique, and the effect of adding
   shrinkage-reducing admixtures (SRA) to the confined concrete. A total of
   18 stub columns comprising six different column types were tested to
   achieve these objectives. The test results showed that the
   load-displacement response of the composite columns was similar to that
   of confined concrete combined with the elastic-perfectly plastic steel
   contribution. The experimental findings also demonstrated the enhanced
   composite column performance, including a significant increase in the
   ultimate capacity using the proposed split-tube retrofit technique. The
   results also indicated that the use of a SRA in confined concrete has an
   indistinguishable effect on the confined concrete strength.}},

Abstract = {{Flow prediction is one of the most important issues in modern hydrology.
   In this study, a statistical tool, stepwise-clustered hydrological
   inference (SCHI) model, was developed for daily streamflow forecasting.
   The SCHI model uses cluster trees to represent the nonlinear and complex
   relationships between streamflow and multiple factors related to climate
   and watershed conditions. It allows a great deal of flexibility in
   watershed configuration. The proposed model was applied to the daily
   streamflow forecasting in the Xiangxi River watershed, China. The
   correlation coefficient for calibration (1991-1995) was 0.881, and that
   for validation (1996-1998) was 0.771. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for
   calibration and validation were 0.768 and 0.577, respectively. The
   results were compared to those of a conventional process-based model,
   and it was found that the SCHI model had a superior performance. The
   results indicate that the proposed model could provide not only reliable
   and efficient daily flow prediction but also decision alternatives
   through analyzing the end nodes of the cluster tree under uncertainties.
   This study is a first attempt to predict daily flow using
   stepwise-cluster analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to estimate the associations between
   muscular fat infiltration, tibia bone mineral quantity and distribution,
   and physical function in healthy older women. Thirty-five women (aged
   60-75 years, mean 70 years) were recruited from the community. Percent
   intramuscular fat (\%IntraMF) within the right leg tibialis anterior,
   soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles and total intermuscular fat (IMF) were
   segmented from magnetic resonance imaging scans at the mid-calf.
   Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content in the right tibialis anterior was
   measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Right tibia bone
   content, area, and strength were measured at the 4, 14, and 66 \% sites
   using peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Physical function was
   assessed by gait speed on the 20 m walking test. After adjusting for
   age, body size, and activity level, \%IntraMF had a negative association
   with bone content and area at all tibia sites (r = -0.31 to -0.03).
   Conversely, greater IMF was associated with increased bone content and
   area (r = 0.04-0.32). Correlation coefficients for the association
   between IMCL and bone were negative (r = -0.44 to -0.03). All measures
   of fat infiltration had a negative association with observed physical
   function (r = -0.42 to -0.04). Our findings suggest that muscular fat
   infiltration in the leg of healthy postmenopausal women has a
   compartment-specific relationship with bone status and physical
   function. Minimizing fat accumulation within and between muscle
   compartments may prevent bone fragility and functional decline in women.}},

Abstract = {{Our elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) model is improved by
   including thermal strain to allow study of the behavior of a Zircaloy-2
   slab under moderately large strains. The approach of introducing thermal
   strain effect is similar to the one developed by Turner et al. (1995)
   and used by Xu et al. (2008a). Various self-consistent schemes (SCSs) of
   the EVPSC model are then evaluated in terms of the deformation behavior
   of the material under different uniaxial strain paths. The material
   parameters for the various models are determined by fitting experimental
   data from uniaxial tension and compression tests along the normal
   direction (ND) and from uniaxial tension tests along the rolling
   direction (RD). The quality of the various SCS predictions is assessed
   based on comparisons of macroscopic deformation behavior (stress-strain
   curves and R-values) and microscopic mechanical response (the evolution
   of lattice strains and texture coefficients) between the predicted and
   experimental data. It is revealed that the Affine and Meff = 0.1
   self-consistent models give much better performance than the Secant and
   Tangent models. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-loop exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with variable geometry
   turbocharger (VGT) is an effective technique to simultaneously control
   intake manifold conditions (pressure, temperature, and burned gas mass

   highly coupled and complicatedly dynamic multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
   system, this paper proposed a control method with decoupled-feedforward
   loop. Through investigating the dynamics of airpath loop system, a
   linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) with a decoupled-eedforward control
   strategy was utilized for the control of the intake manifold conditions.
   The proposed method was validated and compared with the conventional LQR
   method via a high-fidelity GT-Power model.}},

   Technique}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Efficient driving of piezoelectric materials is desirable when operating
   transducers for biomedical applications such as high intensity focused
   ultrasound (HIFU) or ultrasound imaging. More efficient operation
   reduces the electric power required to produce the desired bioeffect or
   contrast. Our preliminary work {[}Cole et al. Journal of Physics:
   Condensed Matter. 2014; 26(13): 135901.] suggested that driving
   transducers by applying orthogonal electric fields can significantly
   reduce the coercivity that opposes ferroelectric switching. We present
   here the experimental validation of this biaxial driving technique using
   piezoelectric ceramics typically used in HIFU. A set of narrow-band
   transducers was fabricated with two sets of electrodes placed in an
   orthogonal configuration (following the propagation and the lateral
   mode). The geometry of the ceramic was chosen to have a resonance
   frequency similar for the propagation and the lateral mode. The average
   (+/- s.d.) resonance frequency of the samples was 465.1 (+/- 1.5) kHz.
   Experiments were conducted in which each pair of electrodes was driven
   independently and measurements of effective acoustic power were obtained
   using the radiation force method. The efficiency (acoustic/electric
   power) of the biaxial driving method was compared to the results
   obtained when driving the ceramic using electrodes placed only in the
   pole direction. Our results indicate that the biaxial method increases
   efficiency from 50\% to 125\% relative to the using a single electric
   field.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of germanium substitution for silicon in
   bismuth doped Mg2Si. This alloying reduces the thermal conductivity from
   above 7W m(-1) K-1 to 2.7W m(-1) K-1 at around 300 K in part due to the
   added mass contrast. High resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM) revealed the presence of Ge-rich domains within the
   Mg-2(Si,Ge,Bi) particles, contributing to decreasing thermal
   conductivity with increasing Ge content up to 0.3 Ge per formula unit.
   The electrical conductivity also decreases with Ge alloying because of
   the increasing amount of scattering centers, while the Seebeck
   coefficient increased only very slightly. In total, the positive effect
   of Ge substitution on the thermoelectric properties of Bi doped Mg2Si
   resulted in a figure of merit of 0.7 at 773 K for Mg2Si0.677Ge0.3Bi0.023
   sample. The optimum amount of Bi seems to be 0.023 per formula unit
   (0.77 at\%), since lower Bi content resulted in electrical conductivity
   that is too low, and higher Bi content generated the Mg3Bi2

Title = {{A Molecular Weight Distribution Polydispersity Equation for the ATRP

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Polydispersity quantifies the breadth of polymer molecular weight
   distribution, making it an important and frequently quoted chain
   microstructural property for characterization. An explicit expression of
   such an important variable is desirable for ease of calculation,
   correlation with experiment data, and/or parameter estimation. A review
   of published literatures shows that great efforts have been put forth by
   many researchers to derive these equations for various polymerization
   mechanisms. In atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP),
   polydispersity depends on three factors: monomer conversion, number of
   monomer addition per activation/deactivation cycle, and amount of dead
   chains. The existing expressions available in the literature only
   account for, at most, two of these three factors, with the contribution
   from dead chains commonly neglected. This assumption results in
   polydispersity monotonically decreasing with conversion, which is often
   not observed in experiments. In this work, a new equation for
   polydispersity, which accounts for contributions of all the three
   aforementioned factors, is proposed. The validity of assumptions
   involved in the derivation is evaluated by comparing the polydispersity
   profiles to those simulated by the method of moments. In addition, this
   new equation is used to correlate several experiment data sets for
   verification, namely from ATRP of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl
   methacrylate, and N-isopropylacrylamide, showing better agreement than
   the existing equation. Although the equation derived here is strictly
   applicable to homogeneous (bulk and solution) normal ATRP, with further
   effort it may be extended to other types of ATRP as well as NMP and RAFT
   systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{A method is presented to improve the quantitative determination of
   dopant concentration in semiconductor nanowire (NW) arrays using
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). SIMS measurements were used to
   determine Be dopant concentrations in a Be-doped GaAs thin film and NW
   arrays of various pitches that were dry-etched from the same film. A
   comparison of these measurements revealed a factor of 3 to 12
   difference, depending on the NW array pitch, between the secondary Be
   ion yields of the film and the NW arrays, despite being identically
   doped. This was due to matrix effects and ion beam mixing of Be from the
   NWs into the surrounding benzocyclobutene that was used to fill the
   space between the NWs. This indicates the need for etched NWs to be used
   as doping standards instead of 2D films when evaluating NWs of unknown
   doping by SIMS. Using the etched NWs as doping standards, NW arrays of
   various pitches grown by the vapour-liquid-solid mechanism were
   characterized by SIMS to yield valuable insights into doping mechanisms.

Abstract = {{We used NMR imaging (MRI) combined with data analysis based on inverse
   modeling of the mass transport problem to determine ionic diffusion
   coefficients and transference numbers in electrolyte solutions of
   interest for Li-ion batteries. Sensitivity analyses have shown that
   accurate estimates of these parameters (as a function of concentration)
   are critical to the reliability of the predictions provided by models of
   porous electrodes. The inverse modeling (IM) solution was generated with
   an extension of the Planck-Nernst model for the transport of ionic
   species in electrolyte solutions. Concentration-dependent diffusion
   coefficients and transference numbers were derived using concentration
   profiles obtained from in situ F-19 MRI measurements. Material
   properties were reconstructed under minimal assumptions using methods of
   variational optimization to minimize the least-squares deviation between
   experimental and simulated concentration values with uncertainty of the
   reconstructions quantified using a Monte Carlo analysis. The diffusion
   coefficients obtained by pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) fall within
   the 95\% confidence bounds for the diffusion coefficient values obtained
   by the MRI+IM method. The MRI +IM method also yields the concentration
   dependence of the Li+ transference number in agreement with trends
   obtained by electrochemical methods for similar systems and with
   predictions of theoretical models for concentrated electrolyte
   solutions, in marked contrast to the salt concentration dependence of
   transport numbers determined from PFG-NMR data.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a paper-based point-of-care (POC) colorimetric biosensor
   was developed for the detection of lactate dehydrogenase in serum using
   a nonporous, oxygen impermeable reversibly gelling polysaccharide
   material based on pullulan. The pullulan could be printed onto paper
   surfaces along with all required assay reagents, providing a means for
   high-stability immobilization of all reagents on paper. Serum containing
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was directly spotted on to the
   pullulan-coated bioactive paper and provided quantitative colorimetric
   data that was comparable to that obtained with a conventional
   plate-reader method. The paper strip was found to be highly stable and
   could be stored at 4 degrees C for at least 10 weeks with no loss in
   performance, as compared to a complete loss in performance within 1 day
   when the reagents were printed without the stabilizing polysaccharide.
   The ease of fabrication coupled with the high stability of the printed
   reagents provides a facile platform for easily manufactured POC sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The torsional design provisions of the Canadian standard S806 for fiber

   members are presented and their theoretical and empirical justifications

   strength are identified and their appropriate values for FRP-RC/PC
   members are specified. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by
   analyzing 27 FRP-RC/PC members tested under pure torsion by other
   investigators. The CSA method is able to reasonably predict the
   torsional strength of these beams. It is also shown that the cracking

Abstract = {{Nature inspired strategies have been developed for the colloidal
   processing of advanced composites for supercapacitor applications. New
   approach was based on the use of commercially available bile acid salts,
   such as sodium cholate (ChNa) and taurocholic acid sodium salt (TChNa).
   It was demonstrated that cholic acid (ChH) films can be obtained by
   electrophoretic deposition (EPD) from ChNa solutions. The analysis of
   deposition yield, quartz crystal microbalance and cyclic voltammetry
   data provided an insight into the anodic deposition mechanism. The
   outstanding suspension stability of multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNT), achieved using bile acids as anionic dispersants, allowed the
   fabrication of MWCNT films by EPD. The use of ChNa for EPD offered
   advantages of binding and film forming properties of this material.
   Composite MnO2-MWCNT films, prepared using ChNa as a dispersant and film
   forming agent for EPD, showed promising capacitive behavior. In another
   colloidal strategy, TChNa was used as a dispersant for MWCNT for the
   fabrication of polypyrrole (PPy) coated MWCNT. The use of PPy coated
   MWCNT allowed the fabrication of electrodes with high active mass
   loading, high capacitance and excellent capacitance retention at high
   charge-discharge rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss a simple technique for drying and storing biopharmaceutical
   proteins such as monoclonal antibodies as soluble composite thin films
   on the surface of ultrafiltration membranes. This technique, which could
   also be used for drying other biopharmaceutical products such as
   vaccines, is being proposed as a simpler, faster and a significantly
   more cost-effective alternative to lyophilization. Protein and water are
   separated primarily by capillary-action based water absorption into an
   asymmetric ultrafiltration membrane, and selective retention of protein
   on the membrane surface by sieving. There is no requirement for
   sophisticated and expensive equipment as this technique can be carried
   out on the laboratory bench-top at ambient conditions, i.e. without
   either freezing or application of vacuum. Monoclonal antibody dried
   using this technique remained stable for one month at room temperature.

   features of a bulk metal glass}},
Journal = {{THERMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{615}},
Pages = {{72-80}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{It is known that most multi-component glasses cold-crystallize
   incongruently on heating through the temperature range of their
   ultraviscous melt. If the incongruent melt's composition changes with
   time, its viscosity, eta, and the glass-liquid transition temperature,
   T-g, would change. Since the eta, relaxation time, and expansion
   coefficient of a liquid in its partially crystallized mixture cannot be
   determined, we used scanning calorimetry to study the
   liquid-glass-liquid transition during thermal cycling of the
   incongruently crystallizing Ce66Al10Cu20Co4 glass. Its T-g is 358 K for
   20 K/min and 354 K for 10 K/min heating rates, and its ultraviscous melt
   crystallized incongruently when heated beyond the hysteresis peak of its
   heat capacity scan. Its sample that had been aged for nine years at
   ambient conditions had a higher crystallization-onset temperature than
   an un-aged sample. Delayed enthalpy gain on heating of the aged glass is
   similar to 1/5th of the enthalpy lost on its crystallization.
   Crystallization of the melt occurred on both the heating and cooling
   paths of a thermal cycle and T-g of the un-aged glass increased as the
   volume fraction of the compositionally different glass, f(gl),
   decreased. The increase was by 8K after the 24th cycle of 20 K/min, and
   by 11 K after the 13th cycle of 10 K/min cooling-heating. The highest
   T-g values reached differed by similar to 1 K, which indicates that
   closely similar TgS may be reached if the total time period for thermal
   cycling (at different rates) is kept the same. As f(gl) approached its
   limiting low value, increase in Tg per cycle itself increased, and the
   T-g-endotherm became unusually broad, which we attribute to diverse
   energies of interactions between the incongruent liquid and the
   crystal-surface atoms that dominate at the lowest f(gl). (C) 2015

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A technique for optimizing large-scale differential-algebraic process
   models under uncertainty using a parallel embedded model approach is
   developed in this article. A combined multi-period multiple-shooting
   discretization scheme is proposed, which creates a significant number of
   independent numerical integration tasks for each shooting interval over
   all scenario/period realizations. Each independent integration task is
   able to be solved in parallel as part of the function evaluations within
   a gradient-based non-linear programming solver. The focus of this paper
   is on demonstrating potential computation performance improvement when
   the embedded differential-algebraic equation model solution of the
   multi-period discretization is implemented in parallel. We assess our
   parallel dynamic optimization approach on two case studies; the first is
   a benchmark literature problem, while the second is a large-scale air
   separation problem that considers a robust set-point transition under
   parametric uncertainty. Results indicate that focusing on the speed-up
   of the embedded model evaluation can significantly decrease the overall
   computation time; however, as the multi-period formulation grows with
   increased realizations, the computational burden quickly shifts to the
   internal computation performed within the non-linear programming
   algorithm. This highlights the need for further decomposition, structure
   exploitation and parallelization within the non-linear programming
   algorithm and is the subject for further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Through the recrystallization of an amorphous heterostructure, obtained
   by MeV Fe ion implantation, we are able to tailor a standard epitaxial
   semiconductor material, a small gap InGaAsP/InP alloy, for
   photoconductive terahertz optoelectronics. Here, we report on
   microstructural changes occurring in the material over a broad range of
   rapid thermal annealing temperatures, using X-ray diffraction line
   profile analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Results show a
   complete amorphous transition of the heterostructure after
   multiple-energy implantations done at 83 K. Upon thermal annealing,
   multiple structural layers develop via solid phase epitaxy and solid
   phase recrystallization. The photoconductive InGaAsP layer becomes
   polycrystalline and submicron grained, with high crystalline volume
   fraction and apparent h110i texture. Many grains are elongated and
   internally faulted, with high densities of planar faults occurring on
   closed-packed (111) planes. The X-ray diffraction line broadening is
   anisotropic and evolves with rapid thermal annealing temperatures. At
   500 degrees C, the X-ray coherent domain size estimate of 10 nm is
   aligned reasonably with electron microscopy made in faulted areas. Above
   500 degrees C, a significant decrease of the planar fault density is
   detected. We discuss the influence of these microstructural changes
   happening with recrystallization temperatures on the ultrafast
   photoconductive response of Fe-implanted InGaAsP/InP. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{The significant effect that the design of a plant can have on its
   dynamic performance has led to methodologies for systematic analysis of
   the interaction between design and control, and for inclusion of dynamic
   performance considerations in plant design. This article focuses on the
   assessment of design limitations to the agility of a nitrogen plant in
   response to demand and electricity price fluctuations. A two-tiered
   approach is proposed, where an economics-based optimization problem is
   first solved to determine the optimal steady-state operating point,
   after which a dynamic optimization problem is solved to minimize a
   measure of the transition time to the new operating point. Design
   limitations to the plant's responsiveness may be inferred by analysis of
   the active constraints. The approach is demonstrated on a comprehensive
   case study based on an existing industrial nitrogen plant. The design
   limitations of the existing plant configuration are identified, and the
   potential benefits of selected design modifications to demand response
   operation are assessed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to assess the impact of a releasable wetting
   agent, such as hyaluronic acid (HA), on the release profile of timolol
   maleate (TM) from model silicone hydrogel contact lens materials.
   Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as an alternative wetting agent for
   comparison. The model lenses consisted of a hydrophilic monomer, either
   2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or N,N-dimethylacrylamide and a hydrophobic
   silicone monomer of methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy) silane. The
   loading of the wetting and the therapeutic agent occurred during the
   synthesis of the silicone hydrogels through the method of direct
   entrapment. The developed materials were characterized by minimal
   changes in the water uptake, while lower molecular weight of HA improved
   their surface wettability. The transparency of the examined silicone
   hydrogels was found to be affected by the miscibility of the wetting
   agent in the prepolymer mixture as well as the composition of the
   developed silicone hydrogels. Sustained release of TM from 4 to 14 days
   was observed, with the drug transport occurring presumably through the
   hydrophilic domains of the silicone hydrogels. The release profile was
   strongly dependent on the hydrophilic monomer composition, the
   distribution of hydrophobic (silane) domains, and the affinity of the
   therapeutic agent for the silicone hydrogel matrix. Noncovalent
   entrapment of the wetting agent did not change the invitro release
   duration and kinetics of TM, however the drug release profile was found
   to be controlled by the simultaneous release of TM and HA or PVP. In the
   case of HA, depending on the HA:drug ratio, the release rate was
   decreased and controlled by the release of HA, likely due to
   electrostatic interactions between protonated TM and anionic HA.
   Overall, partitioning of the drug within the hydrophilic domains of the
   silicone hydrogels as well as interactions with the wetting agent
   determined the drug release profile.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, ternary and quaternary dividing wall column (DWC)
   configurations for the separation of a multicomponent feed stream from a
   novel thermochemical lignocellulosic biomass to butanol process are
   designed, modeled and assessed. The goal is to separate the feed into
   four major products, with a key product being a biobutanol rich stream.
   Due to the complexity of DWC models, a shortcut modeling approach based
   on the minimum energy mountain method (also called the ``V-min, diagram
   method{''}) is used to determine good initial values for the decision
   variables for the rigorous simulation of the DWC configurations.
   Furthermore, each DWC configuration is optimized to minimize the total
   annualized cost with the use of a derivative free algorithm coupled with
   a process simulator. The results show that the quaternary DWC
   configuration achieves up to 31\% energy savings, and 15\% capital
   savings in comparison to a conventional distillation sequence, and is
   thus a better option for implementation in the biofuel process. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We report an efficient, simple and fast method for graphene surface
   modification and its novel use for the fabrication of very soft,
   single-phase polyurethane (PU) nanocomposite elastomers. Content of the
   surface modified graphene (SMG) in PU was between 0.2 and 5 wt\%. FT-IR
   and thermogravimetric analysis indicated successful surface modification
   of graphene by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane while a large increase in
   the viscosity of the polyol blend with SMG content suggested its
   exfoliation down to six graphene layers, as observed by atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). The scanning electron microscopy and AFM of elastomers
   revealed strong SMG PU interactions and good dispersion of SMG within
   the matrix, respectively. Consequently, we measured more than a two-fold
   increase in the tensile strength and storage modulus of SMG/PU elastomer
   at addition of 5 wt\% of SMG, compared with unfilled PU. An initial
   degradation temperature and the maximum rate of weight loss of PU with 5
   wt\% SMG was upshifted by 10 degrees C and 8 degrees C, respectively,
   showing improved thermal stability of the matrix. Finally, an increased
   dielectric permittivity at 1 Hz from 3.6 for unfilled PU up to 34.2 for
   PU elastomer with 5 wt\% SMG, in the glassy state, was observed by
   dielectric spectroscopy indicating energy storage capabilities of these
   nanocomposites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evidence for differential modulation of primary and nonprimary auditory
   cortex by forward masking in tinnitus}},
Journal = {{HEARING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{327}},
Pages = {{9-27}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed that tinnitus is generated by aberrant neural
   activity that develops among neurons in tonotopic of regions of primary
   auditory cortex (A1) affected by hearing loss, which is also the
   frequency region where tinnitus percepts localize (Eggermont and Roberts
   2004; Roberts et al., 2010, 2013). These models suggest (1) that
   differences between tinnitus and control groups of similar age and
   audiometric function should depend on whether A1 is probed in tinnitus
   frequency region (TFR) or below it, and (2) that brain responses evoked
   from A1 should track changes in the tinnitus percept when residual
   inhibition (RI) is induced by forward masking. We tested these
   predictions by measuring (128-channel EEG) the sound-evoked 40-Hz
   auditory steady-state response (ASSR) known to localize tonotopically to
   neural sources in A1. For comparison the N1 transient response
   localizing to distributed neural sources in nonprimary cortex (A2) was
   also studied. When tested under baseline conditions where tinnitus
   subjects would have heard their tinnitus, ASSR responses were larger in
   a tinnitus group than in controls when evoked by 500 Hz probes while the
   reverse was true for tinnitus and control groups tested with 5 kHz
   probes, confirming frequency-dependent group differences in this
   measure. On subsequent trials where RI was induced by masking (narrow
   band noise centered at 5 kHz), ASSR amplitude increased in the tinnitus
   group probed at 5 kHz but not in the tinnitus group probed at 500 Hz.
   When collapsed into a single sample tinnitus subjects reporting
   comparatively greater RI depth and duration showed comparatively larger
   ASSR increases after masking regardless of probe frequency. Effects of
   masking on ASSR amplitude in the control groups were completely reversed
   from those in the tinnitus groups, with no change seen to 5 kHz probes
   but ASSR increases to 500 Hz probes even though the masking sound
   contained no energy at 500 Hz (an ``off-frequency{''} masking effect).
   In contrast to these findings for the ASSR, N1 amplitude was larger in
   tinnitus than control groups at both probe frequencies under baseline
   conditions, decreased after masking in all conditions, and did not
   relate to RI. These results suggest that aberrant neural activity
   occurring in the TFR of A1 underlies tinnitus and its modulation during
   RI. They indicate further that while neural changes occur in A2 in
   tinnitus, these changes do not reflect the tinnitus percept. Models for
   tinnitus and forward masking are described that integrate these findings
   within a common framework. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Visible light communication (VLC) reuses illumination devices,
   particularly light-emitting diodes (LEDs), for communication purposes.
   It has great potential to alleviate the strain on radio-frequency
   spectrumin indoor environments. VLC-enabled LED luminaries form VLC
   attocells that carry downlink data traffic to indoor mobile or
   stationary terminals. While one of the advantages of indoor VLC is low
   interference due to natural cell boundaries such as walls, multiple VLC
   attocells within a room would interfere. This is because illumination
   requirements often mandate a rich overlap of emissions of luminaries in
   a room. In this paper, we suggest the coordination of multiple VLC
   attocells (i.e., VLC-enabled LED luminaries) to turn the problem of
   overlap and thus interference into an advantage. We stipulate that this
   coordination can be accomplished through power line communication, which
   has been considered before as a means to transport data to VLC
   transmitters. Borrowing from concepts developed for radio-frequency
   wireless communications, we develop several precoding schemes for the
   new coordinated VLC broadcasting architecture. These include designs for
   the case of imperfect channel knowledge at the VLC transmitter, since
   channel information is usually provided through a low-rate feedback
   channel. The performance advantages for VLC transmission due to the
   proposed coordination and precoding designs are demonstrated based on a
   set of numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater from fractured rock aquifers serves as a source of drinking
   water around the world; however, wells in fractured rock can be
   susceptible to contamination. Aquifer vulnerability assessments are
   tools used for identifying the risk potential in groundwater sources, as
   well as efficiently allocating resources for source water protection.
   Existing methods include DRASTIC, GOD, EPIK, AVI, COP, and ISI. Some
   approaches do not consider risks posed by fractures, while others were
   developed for karstified regions; all are ill suited to fractured
   formations. This work proposes a new vulnerability assessment method
   incorporating quantitative portions of existing methods together with
   fractured rock characteristics. The proposed method is applied to a
   study area in Acton-Georgetown, Ontario; the DRASTIC and AVI methods are
   also applied for comparison. DRASTIC and AVI methods yield significantly
   different results from each other and from the proposed method. The
   proposed method demonstrates the heavy influence the fractured rock has
   on vulnerability, highlighting the need for its inclusion in

Abstract = {{We propose an ultra-broadband super light absorber by integrating
   different-sized tapered hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) waveguides, each

   slow-light response, into a unit cell. We numerically demonstrate that
   such an absorber is superior to a single-sized HMM absorber in terms of
   absorption bandwidth, while maintaining a comparable absorption
   efficiency. A three different-sized HMM absorber presents the capability
   of working with an ultra-wide frequency band ranging from 1 to 30 THz,
   which is much larger than previously proposed absorbers working in the
   same spectral region. Such a design shows great promise for a broad
   range of applications such as thermal emitters, photovoltaics,
   optical-chemical energy harvesting, and stealth technology, where
   ultra-wideband absorption is in very high demand.}},

Abstract = {{Single-phase fluid flow in porous media is always direction dependent

   approach to determining the tortuosity and permeability of porous

   through which the macroscopic tortuosity tensor is related to both the
   average porosity and the directional distribution of pore spaces.
   Depending on the estimate for the drag on the fluid-solid interfaces,
   the upper and lower bounds of tortuosity are determined. The
   permeability tensor, which is derived from the macroscopic momentum
   balance equation of fluid, is expressed as a function of the tortuosity
   tensor and the internal structure of the material. The analytical

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) are being developed as a
   seismic force resisting system that can be constructed economically to
   avoid structural damage and residual deformations following an
   earthquake. In a CRSBF, selected columns are permitted to uplift from
   the foundation in response to severe seismic loading, and posttensioning
   and energy dissipation are selected to control the magnitude of the
   rocking response. Despite extensive experimental testing to demonstrate
   that this behavior is stable and repeatable, there has been a lack of
   comprehensive guidance for potential designers of CRSBFs. This paper
   proposes a performance-based design methodology for CRSBFs, which
   consists of defining the performance objectives, designing the base
   rocking joint based on a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model, and
   capacity protecting the rest of the structure for the maximum forces
   expected during the rocking response. This paper focuses on the design
   of the base rocking joint, while Part II proposes a method for capacity
   designing the rest of the structure with due consideration of
   higher-mode effects. This paper shows how to design the base rocking
   joint to achieve a targeted response based on the results of 30,492
   analyses of SDOF systems with flag-shaped hystereses. The SDOF results
   suggest that the rotation demands on the rocking joint depend on the
   initial stiffness of the system. For structures with initial periods
   less than about 0.4 s, the base rocking joint requires smaller force
   reduction factors than are codified for ductile seismic force-resisting
   systems, but much larger force reduction factors could be used for
   structures with longer initial periods, provided that the frame members
   are capacity designed and that there is sufficient deformation capacity
   in the posttensioning and energy dissipation elements. These conclusions
   are validated by considering the peak and residual displacement response
   of three example structures at two seismic hazard levels. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) are intended to have a
   self-centering response that avoids damage to main structural elements.
   To ensure that all nonlinearity is confined to the intended elements at
   the rocking joint, the frame must be adequately capacity designed. This
   requires accurate predictions of the peak forces that are likely to
   develop in all members of the frame while the rocking mechanism reaches
   its peak rotation. Previous studies have shown that the peak forces in
   CRSBF members are likely to be strongly influenced by higher mode
   effects, but these effects can be mitigated by designing multiple
   nonlinear mechanisms. This paper proposes methods for estimating the
   peak forces in frame elements, designing an additional mechanism if it
   is desired to mitigate higher mode effects, and predicting the reduction
   in response that will be achieved by adding this mechanism. The methods
   are validated by designing buildings with two, six, and 12 stories,
   including three alternative designs that use multiple mechanisms to
   mitigate the higher mode effects. The six frames are modeled using
   OpenSees and are subjected to 44 ground motions at the maximum
   considered earthquake level. The peak forces in the taller frames
   without additional mechanisms are dominated by higher mode effects, but
   these effects can be estimated using the proposed method. These forces
   can also be reduced by designing multiple mechanisms, and the proposed
   method provides a reasonable design-level prediction of this force
   reduction. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The housing options in North American suburbs will fail to meet many
   future housing needs. An aging population, a younger generation who
   prefer walkable places, economic shifts, and the environmental impacts
   of suburban development are all contributing factors. Suburban
   retrofitting is occurring or imminent in many suburbs to stave off
   obsolescence. Although several models exist for the sustainable
   development of greenfields or large swaths of land, limited models exist
   for the retrofitting of existing suburban housing stock. To avoid
   poorly-designed retrofit schemes, this research proposes retrofit design
   principles aimed at dividing large suburban homes into multiple housing
   units. A set of design guidelines and practical examples of how large
   suburban homes can be divided are presented for use by homeowners (or
   their contractors) to begin the division of a single-family home. The
   main goal is to equip homeowners and their contractors with the
   knowledge to divide homes into independent, well-designed, and livable
   units. Two example divisions are shown with before and after division
   floor plans along with an explanation of how the guidelines were
   applied. This research contributes to a burgeoning paradigm shift in
   terms of the decision-making process at all levels of regional planning,
   with the expectation to lead to more innovative designs for housing
   division projects. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines higher mode effects in systems where the ductile
   mechanism for seismic design is the base moment-rotation response. The
   modal properties of flexural and shear beams with uniform mass and
   elasticity and with a variable amount of base rotational restraint are
   derived. As the base fixity is released, the first mode becomes the
   rigid body rotation of the beam about the base, but the higher modes
   change much less, particularly for the shear beam model. Most response
   quantities that are of interest in the seismic design of typical
   mid-rise buildings are controlled by the first two lateral modes, except
   at locations along the height where the second mode contributes little.
   However, the third and higher lateral modes are more significant for
   high-rise buildings. Based on the theory of uniform cantilever shear
   beams, expressions are developed to avoid the need for a modal analysis
   to estimate the overturning moment, storey shear, and floor acceleration
   envelopes. Considering the measured response from the shake table
   testing of a large-scale eight-storey controlled rocking steel braced
   frame, the proposed expressions are shown to be of similar or better

   stainless steel exposed in supercritical water}},

Abstract = {{There are still unknown aspects about the growth mechanism of oxide
   scales formed on candidate stainless steel fuel cladding materials
   during exposure in supercritical water (SCW) under the conditions
   relevant to the Canadian supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR). The
   tendency for intermetallic precipitates to form within the grains and on
   grain boundaries during prolonged exposure at high temperatures
   represents an unknown factor to corrosion resistance, since they tend to
   bind alloyed Cr. The objective of this study was to better understand
   the extent to which intermetallic precipitates affects the mode and
   extent of corrosion in SCW. Type 316L stainless steel, used as a model
   Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo alloy, was exposed to 25 MPa SCW at 550 degrees C for 500 h
   in a static autoclave for this purpose. Mechanically-abraded samples
   were tested in the mill-annealed (MA) and a thermally-treated (TT)
   condition. The thermal treatment was conducted at 815 degrees C for 1000
   h to precipitate the carbide (M23C6), chi (chi), laves (eta) and sigma
   (sigma) phases. It was found that although relatively large
   intermetallic precipitates formed at the scale/alloy interface locally
   affected the oxide scale formation, their discontinuous formation did
   not affect the short-term overall apparent corrosion resistance. (C)

Abstract = {{This study reports the results of blue phosphorescent organic light
   emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) employing an electron confinement layer (ECL),
   tris-(phenylpyrazole)iridium (Ir(ppz)(3)) and a hole confinement layer

   electrical and optical characteristics of PHOLEDs with different
   emissive layers, including current density, luminance, and luminous
   efficiency, were analyzed. The thickness of the individual emissive
   layer was optimized, however, and the total thickness of the emitting
   region was kept constant at 300 A. This work reveals that the effective
   electron confinement, due to a large energy level offset between the
   electron confinement and emitting layers, helps to improve hole-electron
   current balance in the emitting region. The maximum external quantum
   efficiency of 23.40\% at 1500 cd/m(2) was achieved for PHOLEDs with an
   ECL, which-is 60\% higher than the structural identical control device

Abstract = {{To make full use of water captured by reservoirs in flood seasons,
   methods such as forecast-based reservoir flood control (i.e., reservoir
   operation during flood periods based on precipitation or inflow
   forecasts) have been developed in China in the past few decades. The
   success of forecast-based reservoir flood control depends heavily on the
   precision of the precipitation or inflow forecasts. This study analyzes
   the sources of uncertainty and quantifies it in the process of reservoir
   flood control based on forecasts. First, flood inflow series is regarded
   as a random process with the forecasted flood inflows as its expectation
   process; the flood inflow error series, which is the difference between
   the observed inflow process and the forecasted inflow process, is
   obtained according to the statistical characteristics of the flood
   forecasts. Second, reservoir flood routing simulations are carried out
   using the Monte Carlo method with the flood inflow error series as an
   input to obtain output water level and discharge series. Finally, the
   frequency distributions of the maximum water level (MWL) reached during
   the passage of floods are used to evaluate the uncertainties and the
   corresponding risks associated with forecast-based flood control. These
   uncertainties and risks are what the operators of the reservoirs care
   about the most.}},

Title = {{Enhancing sedimentation by improving flow conditions using parallel
   retrofit baffles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, placing parallel-connected baffles in the vicinity of the
   inlet was proposed to improve hydraulic conditions for enhancing TSS
   (total suspended solids) removal. The purpose of the retrofit baffle
   design is to divide the large and fast inflow into smaller and slower
   flows to increase flow uniformity. This avoids short-circuiting and
   increases residence time in the sedimentation basin. The newly proposed
   parallel-connected baffle configuration was assessed in the laboratory
   by comparing its TSS removal performance and the optimal flow residence
   time with those from the widely used series-connected baffles. The
   experimental results showed that the parallel-connected baffles
   outperformed the series-connected baffles because it could disperse flow
   faster and in less space by splitting the large inflow into many small
   branches instead of solely depending on flow internal friction over a
   longer flow path, as was the case under the series-connected baffles.
   Being able to dampen faster flow before entering the sedimentation basin
   is critical to reducing the possibility of disturbing any settled
   particles, especially under high inflow conditions. Also, for a large
   sedimentation basin, it may be more economically feasible to deploy the
   proposed parallel retrofit baffle in the vicinity of the inlet than
   series-connected baffles throughout the entire settling basin. Crown

Abstract = {{Conductive polypyrrole (PPy) polymer - multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNT) composites were synthesized using sulfanilic acid azochromotrop
   (SPADNS) and sulfonazo III sodium salt (CHR-BS) as anionic dopants for
   chemical polymerization of PPy. The composites were tested for
   application in electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors (ES).
   Sedimentation tests, electrophoretic deposition experiments and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations showed that strong
   adsorption of anionic CHR-BS on MWCNT provided MWCNT dispersion. The
   analysis of scanning and transmission electron microscopy data
   demonstrated that the use of CHR-BS allowed the formation of PPy
   coatings on MWCNT. As a result, the composites, prepared using CHR-BS,
   showed higher capacitance, compared to the composites, prepared using
   SPADNS. The electrodes, containing MWCNT, coated with PPy showed a
   capacitance of 179 F g(-1) for active mass loading of 10 mg cm(-2), good
   capacitance retention at scan rates in the range of 2-100 mV s(-1) and
   excellent cyclic stability. Asymmetric ES devices, containing positive
   PPy-MWCNT electrodes and negative vanadium nitride (VN)-MWCNT electrodes
   showed significant improvement in energy storage performance, compared
   to the symmetric ES due to the larger voltage window. The low impedance
   and high capacitance of the individual cells paved the way to the
   development of modules with higher voltage, which showed good
   electrochemical performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Multi-focus image fusion using dictionary-based sparse representation}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION FUSION}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{72-84}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Multi-focus image fusion has emerged as a major topic in image
   processing to generate all-focus images with increased depth-of-field
   from multi-focus photographs. Different approaches have been used in
   spatial or transform domain for this purpose. But most of them are
   subject to one or more of image fusion quality degradations such as
   blocking artifacts, ringing effects, artificial edges, halo artifacts,
   contrast decrease, sharpness reduction, and misalignment of decision map
   with object boundaries. In this paper we present a novel multi-focus
   image fusion method in spatial domain that utilizes a dictionary which
   is learned from local patches of source images. Sparse representation of
   relative sharpness measure over this trained dictionary are pooled
   together to get the corresponding pooled features. Correlation of the
   pooled features with sparse representations of input images produces a
   pixel level score for decision map of fusion. Final regularized decision
   map is obtained using Markov Random Field (MRF) optimization. We also
   gathered a new color multi-focus image dataset which has more variety
   than traditional multi-focus image sets. Experimental results
   demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing
   state-of-the-art methods, in terms of visual and quantitative
   evaluations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{This work proposed and demonstrated a single-mode Fabry-Perot (FP) laser
   structure with a pair of deeply etched slanted trenches inside the
   cavity. We implemented the proposed mode selection scheme in
   conventional 1310 nm InAlGaAs/InP strained-layer multiple-quantum-well
   ridge wave-guide FP laser diodes and obtained single-mode operation with
   a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) as high as 35 dB. The single-mode
   yield was approximately 55\%, and other device performance measures such
   as the threshold and the slope efficiency were not greatly affected.
   Additionally, temperature cycling and aging tests show no exceptional
   disadvantages when compared with the performance of conventional FP
   lasers. Fiber-optic transmission tests show that the proposed device can
   send directly modulated 2.5 Gbps and 6.25 Gbps optical signals for
   distances of over 50 km in standard single-mode fiber. Thus, as a
   cost-effective solution, this device is promising as a replacement for
   conventional distributed feedback laser diodes in specific applications
   where single-mode operation is indispensable but precise control of the
   lasing wavelength and/or very high SMSR (e.g., >40 dB) are not required.

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between strain and composition is at the basis of
   heterostructure design to engineer new properties. The influence of the
   strain distribution on the incorporation of indium during the formation
   of multiple InGaN/GaN quantum dots (QDs) in nanowire (NW)
   heterostructures has been investigated, using the combined techniques of
   geometric phase analysis of atomic-resolution images and quantitative
   elemental mapping from core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy
   within scanning transmission electron microscopy. The variation in
   In-content between successive QDs within individual NWs shows a
   dependence on the magnitude of compressive strain along the growth
   direction within the underlying GaN barrier layer, which affects the
   incorporation of In-atoms to minimize the local effective strain energy.
   Observations suggest that the interfacial misfit between InGaN/GaN
   within the embedded QDs is mitigated by strain partitioning into both
   materials, and results in normal stresses inflicted by the presence of
   the surrounding GaN shell. These experimental measurements are linked to
   the local piezoelectric polarization fields for individual QDs, and are
   discussed in terms of the photoluminescence from an ensemble of NWs.}},

Abstract = {{Developing surfaces with antithrombotic properties is of great interest
   for the applications of blood-contacting biomaterials and medical
   devices. It is promising to coimmobilize two or more biomolecules with
   different and complementary functions to improve blood compatibility.
   However, the general one-pot strategy usually adopted by previous
   studies suffers the problems of inevitable competition between diverse
   biomolecules and uncontrollability of the relative quantities of the
   immobilized biomolecules. To solve these problems, a new sequential
   coimmobilization strategy is proposed and applied to fabricate a blood
   compatible surface. Polyurethane surface is modified with a copolymer,
   poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-1-adamantan-1-ylmethyl
   methacrylate), which serves as a linker-spacer for sequential attachment
   of two functional molecules, a hexapeptide containing REDV
   (Arg-Glu-Asp-Val) sequence, and a modified cyclodextrin bearing 7 lysine
   ligands, through covalent bonding and host-guest interaction,
   respectively. The resulting surface combines the antithrombogenic
   properties of the vascular endothelium and the clot lysing properties of
   the fibrinolytic system. Importantly, neither of the two functions of
   REDV peptide and lysine is compromised by the presence of the other,
   suggesting the enhanced blood compatibility. These results suggest a new
   strategy to engineer multifunctional surfaces by coimmobilization of
   bioactive molecules having unique functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole nanofibers (PPy-NF) were prepared by an oxidative template
   assembly method and utilized for the fabrication of N-doped activated
   carbon nanofibers (N-AC-NF). Capacitor cells, containing N-AC-NF
   electrodes were used for capacitive dye removal (CDR) from aqueous
   solutions. It was found that CDR method can be used for the removal of
   triphenylmethane and chromotropic acid family dyes from aqueous
   solutions. The analysis of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic
   charge-discharge and impedance spectroscopy data, coupled with results
   of quartz crystal microbalance studies, provided an insight into the
   influence of chemical structure, size, charge-to mass ratio,
   concentration and redox-active ligands of the dyes on the capacitive
   behavior, dye removal efficiency, reversibility and cyclic stability of
   the cells. The CDR method offers advantages for the dyes of chromotropic
   acid family, due to larger voltage window, good capacitive behavior,
   improved cyclic stability and higher power-energy characteristics. It
   was found that charge storage mechanism is mainly attributed to double
   layer capacitance. CDR is a promising method for water purification,
   which offers advantages of energy saving and simple electrode
   regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the aromatic sulfonate compound Tiron with high charge to
   mass ratio is used as an anionic dopant for synthesis of polypyrrole
   (PPy). The fabricated PPy is investigated for electrochemical
   supercapacitor (ES) application. Testing results show that Tiron allows
   reduced PPy agglomeration, smaller particle size and improved charge
   storage properties of PPy. High capacitance and improved capacitive
   retention at high scan rates are achieved by the fabrication of
   PPy/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite electrode using
   safranin (SAF) as a co-dispersant. The Tiron-doped PPy electrode shows
   the highest capacitance of 7.8 F cm(-2) with a mass of 27 mg cm(-2). The
   Tiron-doped PPy/MWCNT composite electrode shows good capacitance
   retention with a capacitance of 1.0 F cm(-2) at the scan rate of 100 mV
   s(-1). Symmetric supercapacitor cells are fabricated using PPy based
   active materials. An energy density of 0.36 mWh cm(-2) is achieved. The
   energy/power density and capacitance retention of the Tiron-doped
   PPy/MWCNT ES is significantly improved in comparison with PPy-based ES,
   prepared without Tiron or MWCNT. The Tiron-doped PPy/MWCNT symmetric
   supercapacitor presents good cycling performance with 91.4\% capacitance
   retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. The PPy/MWCNT composites,
   prepared using Tiron and SAF co-dispersant, are promising electrodes for

Abstract = {{The elastomeric performance of a series of ethylene/1-octene random and

   studied in this work. All the polymer samples exhibited good toughness.
   The living random copolymers had better elasticity than commercial
   metallocene random copolymers. The strain recovery of the living random
   copolymers was about 90\% with an applied strain up to 800\%. It was
   demonstrated that the copolymer elasticity was mainly determined by
   their block structure, with little influence by their molecular weight.
   It was also found that either too high or too low content of hard-block
   content deteriorated the copolymer elastomeric behavior. The diblock
   copolymer having about 42 wt\% hard block content (LBC1) gave the best
   elasticity among the studied block copolymers and retained the strain
   recovery about 80\% under the applied stain of 600\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper deals with description of the deformation process in
   argillaceous rocks that display a strong inherent anisotropy. Both, the
   homogeneous and the localized deformation modes are considered. The
   effects of anisotropy are incorporated by invoking the microstructure
   tensor approach. The strain localization is assumed to be associated
   with formation of a macrocrack the orientation of which is defined using
   the critical plane approach. The propagation of damage is traced within
   the context of a boundary value problem by employing a constitutive law
   with embedded discontinuity. The crack path is monitored in a discrete
   manner by using the level-set method. The closest-point projection
   algorithm is developed for the integration of the constitutive relations
   at both stages of the anisotropic deformation process, i.e. the
   homogenous mode as well as that involving an embedded discontinuity. The
   problem of macrocrack formation in a biaxial plane strain compression
   test is studied. It is demonstrated that friction between loading
   platens can play an important role in the process of evolution of damage
   and may significantly affect the compressive strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Effects of stacking disorder on thermal conductivity of cubic ice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Cubic ice is said to have stacking disorder when the H2O sequences in
   its structure (space group Fd (3) over barm) are interlaced with
   hexagonal ice (space group P6(3)/mmc) sequences, known as stacking
   faults. Diffraction methods have shown that the extent of this disorder
   varies in samples made by different methods, thermal history, and the
   temperature T, but other physical properties of cubic and hexagonal ices
   barely differ. We had found that at 160 K, the thermal conductivity,
   kappa, of cubic ice is similar to 20\% less than that of hexagonal ice,
   and this difference varies for cubic ice samples prepared by different
   methods and/or subjected to different thermal history. After reviewing
   the methods of forming cubic ice, we report an investigation of the
   effects of stacking disorder and other features by using new data, and
   by analyzing our previous data on the dependence of kappa on T and on
   the pressure. We conclude that the lower kappa of cubic ice and its
   weaker T-dependence is due mainly to stacking disorder and small crystal
   sizes. On in situ heating at 20-50 MPa pressure, kappa increases and
   cubic ice irreversibly transforms more sharply to ice Ih, and at a
   higher T of similar to 220 K, than it does in ex situ studies. Cooling
   and heating between 115 and 130 K at 0.1 K min(-1) rate yield the same
   kappa value, indicating that the state of cubic ice in these conditions
   does not change with time and T. The increase in kappa of cubic ice
   observed on heat-annealing before its conversion to hexagonal ice is
   attributed to the loss of stacking faults and other types of disorders,
   and to grain growth. After discussing the consequences of our findings
   on other properties, we suggest that detailed studies of variation of a
   given property of cubic ice with the fraction of stacking faults in its
   structure may reveal more about the effect of this disorder. A similar
   disorder may occur in the mono-layers of H2O adsorbed on a substrate, in
   bulk materials comprised of two dimensional layers, in diamond and in
   Zirconium and in numerous other crystals. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present the fabrication of polypyrrole (PPy) surfaces with a
   controlled overhang structure. Regularly structured PPy films were
   produced using interfacial polymerization around a sacrificial
   crystalline colloidal monolayer at the air/water interface. The
   morphology of the final inverse colloidal PPy film is controlled by the
   amount of monomer, the monomer: oxidant ratio and polymerization time.
   The PPy films exhibit an overhang structure due to depth of particle
   immersion in the water phase. As a result of the overhang structure, the
   PPy films are made hydrophobic, although the material itself is
   hydrophilic. The apparent contact angle of water on the structured
   surfaces is 109.5 degrees, which is in agreement with the predicted
   contact angle using the Cassie-Baxter equation for air-filled cavities.
   This fabrication technique is scalable and can be readily extended to
   other systems where controlled wettability is required.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the production loads and production times is an essential
   ingredient for making successful production plans and schedules. In
   steel production, the production loads and the production times are
   impacted by many uncertainties, which necessitates their prediction via
   stochastic models. In order to avoid having separate prediction models
   for planning and for scheduling, it is helpful to develop a single
   prediction model that allows us to predict both production loads and
   production times. In this work, Bayesian network models are employed to
   predict the probability distributions of these variables. First, network
   structure is identified by maximizing the Bayesian scores that include
   the likelihood and model complexity. In order to handle large domain of
   discrete variables, a novel decision-tree structured conditional
   probability table based Bayesian inference algorithm is developed. We
   present results for realworld steel production data and show that the
   proposed models can accurately predict the probability distributions.

Title = {{Junction potentials in thermolytic reverse electrodialysis}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{369}},
Pages = {{149-155}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Reverse electrodialysis (RED) can produce electric energy from waste
   heat using thermolytic solutions (e.g., NH4HCO3) where waste heat is
   used to regenerate the high concentration (HC) and low concentration
   (LC) solutions. The salinity difference between the two solutions in RED
   is converted into electric potential across an ion exchange membrane
   (IEM), exploiting the liquid junction potential. Theoretical calculation
   of the junction potential is cumbersome because the activity
   coefficients and equilibrium speciation of individual ions are
   complicated for highly concentrated NH4HCO3 solution. We used a
   simplification of the Planck-Henderson equation to approximate the
   junction potential in thermolytic RED systems based on conductivity
   measurements, and this approximation was consistent with experimentally
   measured junction potentials. The experimental results also found that
   NH4HCO3 created greater junction potentials across anion exchange
   membranes than (NH4)(2)CO3 solution for a given molar concentration
   ratio. The junction potential was hardly affected by the magnitude of HC
   as long as the concentration ratio between HC and LC was maintained.
   Based on the experimental findings, we recommend that thermolytic RED
   systems be operated under neutral pH and high concentration ratio
   conditions (above 1:100 ratio). These findings provide information
   essential for designing and operating thermolytic RED systems for future
   study and practical application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Base isolation of high-rise buildings has been growing in popularity in
   Japan, yet it is uncommon in most of the world. While tall buildings
   already have long periods and thus lower input accelerations, the
   addition of isolation can decrease inter-story drifts and greatly
   decrease floor acceleration, protecting building content. By protecting
   building content, high-rises can be kept fully operational and
   occupiable after earthquakes. The Japanese design code has clearly
   outlined procedures for designing isolated high-rises, facilitating the
   implementation of isolation; however, other design codes-and
   specifically the U.S. code-make the adoption of isolation difficult for
   these buildings. Using a design representative of typical isolated
   high-rises in Japan, it is shown that while isolation is feasible under
   U.S. design levels, requirements are much more stringent, and some
   changes from the Japanese design would be required to make the design
   acceptable under the U.S. code.}},

Abstract = {{On 2 August 2014 the city of Toledo, in Ohio USA issued a do not drink
   water advisory and declared a state of emergency. This was as a result
   of elevated levels of the toxin microcystin in the final treated water,
   a dangerous toxin produced by the algae cyanobacteria. The Toledo water
   crisis is a key focusing event that can advance dialogue on
   eutrophication governance in the context of public health. This paper
   examines the Toledo water ban with the aim of determining whether this
   crisis could have been averted. Further, we explore how this event can
   be used to stimulate action on eutrophication governance, to motivate
   action to protect water at its source. We use the World Health
   Organization's Water Safety Planning Methodology to show that the crisis
   could have been averted with some simple risk management actions. We
   also show that a water safety planning approach could lead to well
   developed operational and maintenance planning resulting in a higher

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel nanoantenna (nantenna) design for
   energy harvesting. The nantenna has an ``E{''} shape and is placed on a
   SiO2 substrate. Its operation is based on the excitation of surface
   plasmon polaritons through the gold arms of the E shape. By varying the
   lengths and widths of the arms, two overlapping working bandwidths can
   be achieved. This results in a wideband behavior characterized by a full
   width at half-maximum of about 2.2 mu m centered around 3.6 mu m. Two
   orthogonal E nantennas are placed perpendicular to each other to realize
   a dual-polarized nantenna. This nantenna can receive the two incident
   polarizations at two separate gap locations with very high isolation.
   The proposed structure can be used in several energy harvesting
   applications, such as scavenging the infrared heat from the Earth and
   other hot objects, in addition to optical communications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{It is reported on drain current modulation by UV light, in an organic
   thin-film phototransistor, based on a small molecule semiconductor
   2,7-dipentylbenzo{[}b] benzo{[}4,5]thieno{[} 2,3-d]thiophene(BTBT-C5)
   blended with a linear unsaturated polyester (L-upe) to form the active
   channel material. The electrical properties of the phototransistor
   (L-upe+BTBT-C5) and physical properties of thin-films are evaluated by
   means of two- and three-terminal current-voltage characteristics (in the
   dark and under UV light) and structure-morphology analysis,
   respectively. Upon illumination with UV light, a dramatic change in the
   electrical properties of the L-upe+BTBT-C5 transistors is observed,
   compared to low responsive control transistors based on a blend of
   poly(methyl methacrylate) and BTBT-C5. Drain current is increased by
   more than six orders of magnitude with maximum photosensitivity and
   responsivity of 4.0 x 10(6) and 11.1 A W-1, respectively, using a V-G =
   0 V. Modulated photoelectrical properties are explained by
   structure-morphology characteristics and efficient charge trapping at
   the polymer/ semiconductor interface due to the presence of
   electron-withdrawing groups in the polymer. Fast rise time of 1.80 s and
   slow relaxation time of 24.27 s, estimated using bi-exponential fitting
   models, confirm a charge trapping/releasing mechanism and reveal
   sensing-memory properties of the devices.}},

Abstract = {{This two-part series investigates the feasibility of the operation and
   control of a novel gasifier cooling system which integrates steam
   methane reformer tubes into a gasifier radiant syngas cooler. This
   approach capitalizes on available exergy by producing valuable H-2-rich
   synthesis gas (syngas) for liquid fuel production. In Part I (this
   work), an `agile' device design was developed for both counter-current
   and co-current flow configurations, wherein a PI control structure was
   designed to achieve performance objectives. Key trade-offs were found
   between the configurations: the counter-current design was more robust
   and effective in rejecting moderate and severe gasifier disturbances,
   while providing greater cooling duty and natural gas throughput, but at
   the expense of higher tube wall temperatures, which can greatly reduce
   tube lifetime. The co-current design operates in a safer temperature
   range and satisfactorily rejects moderate disturbances, but requires
   feedforward control to handle extreme gasifier upsets. Using the
   co-current design, the flexibility of the device to adjust natural gas
   throughput based on variations in downstream syngas demand was
   demonstrated. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

   after a relatively short exposure time (circa 500 h) to provide a more
   complete physical description of the metallurgical factors that
   influence the protectiveness of the scale formed. This was achieved
   using transmission electron microscopy and associated techniques on
   site-specific cross-section samples prepared by focused ion beam
   milling. No physical evidence in support of oxide scale exfoliation was
   found. Rather, the formation of the discontinuous magnetite (Fe3O4)
   outer nodular layer is believed to be controlled to a large extent by
   the underlying microstructure and the presence of epsilon-martensite
   plates in particular. The formation of a thin compact corundum-type ({[}
   Cr, Fe](2)O-3) base scale is considered to be sufficiently encouraging
   to justify an effort to reduce or eliminate the small volume fraction of
   epsilon-martensite from the starting microstructure of Alloy 800HT as a
   means to optimize the corrosion resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of hydrophobically-modified poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) as a
   shear-responsive, self-associative hydrogel for ophthalmic applications
   is demonstrated. Hydrophobic modification was achieved via random
   copolymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone with N-vinylformamide, the latter
   of which can be hydrolyzed to expose a desired degree of reactive amine
   groups permitting grafting of alkyl chlorides of varying alkyl chain
   lengths. The resulting materials formed highly shear-responsive physical
   hydrogels, exhibiting tunable shear thinning over 4-5 decades of
   viscosity from infinite shear to zero shear conditions that facilitates
   lubrication upon blinking and/or facile injection or drop-based delivery
   to the anterior or posterior segments of the eye. Viscosity changes due
   to self-association over time can also be tuned by changing the length
   of the hydrophobe, with C-18-grafted materials exhibiting prolonged
   thickening over several weeks to form extremely stiff hydrogels and
   shorter grafts equilibrating significantly faster but forming weaker
   gels. The hydrogels remained transparent even at very high polymer
   concentrations (20 wt\%) and are demonstrated to facilitate controlled
   release of a model drug (doxorubicin). The polymers exhibit minimal
   cytotoxicity in vitro to human corneal epithelial cells and retinal
   pigment epithelial cells, particularly when lower molecular weight
   backbone polymers were used. In vivo assessments in rabbits indicated no
   significant conjunctival edema or redness, secretion, corneal opacity,
   or iris involvement upon anterior application. Following intravitreal
   injection in rat eyes, no opacification of the lens, cornea or vitreous,
   nor any morphological or functional change to the posterior segment was
   observed. Examination of wholemount tissues and histology demonstrated
   no adverse effect from the injection or deposition of material. As such,
   these shear-thinning materials offer potential for drug delivery in both
   the anterior and posterior segments or as a vitreal replacement that can
   be easily administered or removed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Flooding is one of the leading causes of loss due to natural
   catastrophes, and at least one third of all losses due to natural forces
   can be attributed to flooding. Flood management systems involve a
   variety of complexities, such as multiple uncertainties, dynamic
   variations, and policy implications. This paper presents an inexact
   probabilistic-possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients
   (IPP-FRC) model for flood management in a hybrid uncertain environment.
   IPP-FRC is capable not only of tackling multiple uncertainties in the
   form of intervals with fuzzy random boundaries but of addressing the
   dynamic complexity through capacity expansion planning within a
   multi-region, multi-flood-level, and multi-option context. The
   possibility and necessity measures used in IPP-FRC are suitable for
   risk-seeking and risk-averse decision making, respectively. A case study
   is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology for
   facilitating flood management. The results indicate that the inexact
   degrees of possibility and necessity would decrease with increased
   probabilities of occurrence, implying a potential tradeoff between
   fulfillment of objectives and associated risks. A number of decision
   alternatives can be obtained under different policy scenarios. They are
   helpful for decision makers to formulate the appropriate flood
   management policy according to practical situations. The performance of
   IPP-FRC is analyzed and compared with a possibilitybased fractile model.}},

Abstract = {{AM60 high pressure die castings have been used in automobile
   applications to reduce the weight of vehicles. However, the pore defects
   that are inherent in die casting may negatively affect mechanical
   properties, especially the fatigue properties. Here we have studied
   damage (e.g., pore defects, fatigue cracks) during strained-controlled
   fatigue using 3-dimensional X-ray computed tomography (XCT). The fatigue
   test was interrupted every 2000 cycles and the specimen was removed to
   be scanned using a desktop micro-CT system. XCT reveals pore defects,
   cracks, and fracture surfaces. The results show that pores can be
   accurately measured and modeled in 3D. Defect bands are found to be made
   of pores under 50 mu m (based on volume-equivalent sphere diameter).
   Larger pores are randomly distributed in the region between the defect
   bands. Observation of fatigue cracks by XCT is performed in three ways
   such that the 3D model gives the best illustration of crack-porosity
   interaction while the other two methods, with the cracks being viewed on
   transverse or longitudinal cross sections, have better detectability on
   crack initiation and crack tip observation. XCT is also of value in
   failure analysis on fracture surfaces. By assessing XCT data during
   fatigue testing and observing fracture surfaces on a 3D model, a better
   understanding on the crack initiation, crack-porosity interaction, and
   the morphology of fracture surface is achieved. (C) The Minerals, Metals

Abstract = {{With the ubiquity and pervasiveness of computers in daily activities and
   with the ever-growing complexity of communication networks and
   protocols, covert channels are becoming an eminent threat to the

   technique to detect confidential information leakage via protocol-based
   covert channels. Although several works examine covert channel detection
   and analysis from the perspective of information theory by, for
   instance, analysing channel capacities, we propose a different technique
   that tackles the problem from a different perspective. The proposed
   technique takes an algebraic approach using relations. It provides tests
   to verify the existence of a leakage of information via a monitored
   covert channel. It also provides computations which show how the
   information was leaked if a leakage exists. We also discuss possible
   applications of the proposed technique in cryptanalysis and digital
   forensics based on a known-plaintext attack. We report on a prototype
   tool that allows for the automation of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a stepwise cluster forecasting (SCF) framework is
   proposed for monthly streamflow prediction in Xiangxi River, China. The
   developed SCF method can capture discrete and nonlinear relationships
   between explanatory and response variables. Cluster trees are generated
   through the SCF method to reflect complex relationships between
   independent (i.e. explanatory) and dependent (i.e. response) variables
   in the hydrologic system without determining specific linear/nonlinear
   functions. The developed SCF method is applied for monthly streamflow
   prediction in Xiangxi River based on the local meteorological records as
   well as some climate index. Comparison among SCF, multiple linear
   regression, generalized regression neural network, and least square
   support vector machine methods would be conducted. The results indicate
   that the SCF method would produce good predictions in both training and
   testing periods. Besides, the inherent probabilistic characteristics of
   the SCF predictions are further analyzed. The results obtained by SCF
   can presented as intervals, formulated by the minimum and maximum
   predictions as well as the 5 and 95 \% percentile values of the
   predictions, which can reflect the variations in streamflow forecasts.
   Therefore, the developed SCF method can be applied for monthly
   streamflow prediction in various watersheds with complicated hydrologic
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates capillary torque induced by capillary
   interaction between mono-sized elliptical disks within the pendular
   regime. When relative rotation between a pair of elliptical particles
   (2D disks) takes place, the liquid meniscus between the particles is
   distorted and generates unbalanced capillary forces around the contact,
   which further induces capillary torque that is a resistance to particle
   rotation. The variations of capillary-bridge force and capillary torque
   with relative particle rotation are determined as functions of relative
   particle rotation, the degree of saturation and particle shapes. For
   small rotation between particles, an approximate linear relation can be
   used to describe the dependency of capillary torque on particle
   rotation. The maximum capillary torque develops when the rotation angle
   reaches a critical value. The net capillary attraction between
   particles, however, monotonically decreases as particles rotate.
   Comparing with dry conditions, the characteristic length of grain
   columns of mono-sized elliptical particles within the pendular regime
   does not change significantly, particularly when the capillary stress is
   much lower than the net stress.}},

Title = {{Seismic Risk Assessment of Nonengineered Residential Buildings: State of
   the Practice}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The poor socioeconomic conditions in developing countries often lead to
   poorly constructed residential buildings that are particularly
   vulnerable to damage during an earthquake. A review of available
   literature carried out as part of a larger research program highlights
   the scarcity of existing fragility curves for the wide typology of
   nonengineered residential buildings around the world. Furthermore,
   fragility curves derived using empirical data are almost nonexistent due
   to the lack of postearthquake damage data and insufficient ground motion
   recordings in developing countries. The diversity in construction
   techniques and material quality in developing countries, particularly
   for nonengineered residential buildings, cannot be sufficiently
   represented through simplified or idealized analytical models.
   Therefore, the use of empirical based fragility curves is considered to
   be a well-suited approach for assessing the seismic risk levels for
   nonengineered residential buildings in developing countries. This paper
   presents a review and evaluation of existing seismic risk assessment
   studies and state-of-the-practice as it pertains to nonengineered
   buildings, and subsequently proposes the use of attenuation-based USGS
   ground motion and shaking intensity maps and geographic information
   system damage information to derive relevant fragility curves. The USGS
   ground motion and shaking intensity maps are proposed as they are
   developed using a consistent robust methodology. (C) 2014 American

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{216-224}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Silicone surfactants are used in a variety of applications, however,
   limited data is available on the relationship between surfactant
   structure and biological activity. A series of seven nonionic, silicone
   polyether surfactants with known structures was tested for in vitro
   antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli BL21. The compounds
   varied in their hydrophobic head, comprised of branched silicone
   structures with 3-10 siloxane linkages and, in two cases, phenyl
   substitution, and hydrophilic tail of 8-44 poly(ethylene glycol) units.
   The surfactants were tested at three concentrations: below, at, and
   above their Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMC) against 5
   concentrations of E. coli BL21 in a three-step assay comprised of a
   14-24h turbidometric screen, a live-dead stain and viable colony counts.
   The bacterial concentration had little effect on antibacterial activity.
   For most of the surfactants, antibacterial activity was higher at
   concentrations above the CMC. Surfactants with smaller silicone head
   groups had as much as 4 times the bioactivity of surfactants with larger
   groups, with the smallest hydrophobe exhibiting potency equivalent to
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SOS). Smaller PEG chains were similarly
   associated with higher potency. These data link lower micelle stability
   and enhanced permeability of smaller silicone head groups to
   antibacterial activity. The results demonstrate that simple manipulation
   of nonionic silicone polyether structure leads to significant changes in
   antibacterial activity. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, detailed cradle-to-grave life cycle analyses are performed
   for a current state-of-the art natural gas combined cycle and a
   bulk-scale solid fuel cell power plant fuelled by natural gas. Life
   cycle inventories are performed for multiple configurations of each
   plant, including designs with carbon capture capability. Consistent
   boundaries (including all supply chain and upstream processes) and unit
   bases for each process are defined for each process. The ReCiPe 2008
   life cycle assessment method is used to quantify the impacts of each
   plant at both mid- and end-point levels. Three impact assessment
   perspectives (individualist, hierarchist, and egalitarian) are
   considered. The results of these life cycle analyses are compared in
   order to determine the environmental trade-offs between potential power
   generation pathways. Results indicate that power generation using solid
   oxide fuel cells has a smaller life cycle impact than the natural gas
   combined cycle when the entire life cycle of each option is considered.}},

   symbols from two spaces collaborate so closely that the average optical
   power is minimized under the constraint that the minimum Euclidean
   distance is fixed. Therefore, this new constellation is called
   space-collaborative constellation (CC). Computer simulations show that
   the CC always has better error performance than SM and SMP, and also has
   better error performance than RC for most of good channels as well as
   for some really bad channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a joint multitarget (JoM) estimator for the joint
   target detection and tracking (JoTT) filter. An efficient choice to the
   unknown JoM estimation constant (i. e., hypervolume around target state
   estimate) is proposed as a Pareto-optimal solution to a multi-objective
   nonlinear convex optimization problem. The multi-objective function is
   formulated as two convex objective functions in conflict. The first
   objective function is the information theoretic part of the problem and
   aims for entropy maximization, while the second one arises from the
   constraint in the definition of the JoM estimator and aims to improve
   the accuracy of the JoM estimates. The Pareto-optimal solution is
   obtained using the weighted sum method, where objective weights are
   determined as linear predictions from autoregressive models. In contrast
   to the marginal multitarget (MaM) estimator, the ``target-present{''}
   decision from the JoM estimator depends on the spatial information as
   well as the cardinality information in the finite-set statistics (FISST)
   density. The simulation results demonstrate that the JoM estimator
   achieves better track management performance in terms of track
   confirmation latency and track maintenance than the MaM estimator for
   different values of detection probability. However, the proposed JoM
   estimator suffers from track termination latency more than the MaM
   estimator since the localization performance of the JoTT filter does
   deteriorate gradually after target termination.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{109-122}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Soil moisture is a principal component of the Earth's climate and
   hydrological systems that is difficult to monitor and model due to high
   variability, uncertainty in land surface characterization and
   uncertainty in soil moisture forcing. Satellite soil moisture retrievals
   and brightness temperature observations, such as those available from
   the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, can be a valuable
   source of information for data assimilation and merging with other
   satellite retrieval datasets. To correct for biases in these data sets,
   bias correction methods such as cumulative distribution function (CDF)
   matching, linear rescaling and copulas are used to map satellite soil
   moisture climatology to that of in situ or model values. This study
   compared SMOS retrievals to soil moisture observations from the SCAN
   network for a calibration period of 2010-2011 and validation period of
   2012-2013 before and after bias correction. The focus of the study was
   on the presence and removal of multiplicative bias when comparing SMOS
   retrievals to SCAN data. Additive bias between SMOS retrievals and SCAN
   observations was removed by standard bias correction techniques and a
   new resampling approach was found to reduce multiplicative biases. In
   addition, the new bias correction technique was found very competitive
   with the benchmark methods for both the calibration and validation
   periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural evolution during non-isothermal annealing of a
   precipitation hardenable Al alloy is investigated experimentally, and
   simulated by developing a new Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique. An
   annealing process that spans over a temperature range to promote the
   formation of a fine distribution of precipitates, is applied to a
   solution-treated Al-Mg-Si alloy. Experimental analysis of the deformed
   sample and samples non-isothermally annealed to intermediate
   temperatures reveals that early-stage precipitates inhibit dynamic
   recovery during deformation, as well as static recovery during the
   initial stages of annealing. Inhibition of recovery prior to the
   initiation of recrystallization leads to a high driving force for
   recrystallization and formation of randomly distributed recrystallized
   nuclei. Interactions of recovery, recrystallization and precipitations
   are integrated in the Monte Carlo algorithm and microstructural states
   during non-isothermal annealing are simulated. The MC technique is
   specifically designed for the systems in which precipitates inhibit
   dynamic recovery during the pre-annealing deformation stage. The good
   agreement achieved through comparison of MC simulation and experimental
   results supports the validity of the modeling technique developed. (C)

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Module design is of critical importance in membrane chromatography as
   the efficiency of separation is highly dependent on fluid flow
   distribution and collection within the membrane device. We discuss a
   novel, laterally-feel module, designed specifically for flat-sheet
   membrane chromatography. The performance of the novel module was
   compared with that of a conventional, centrally-fed, circular membrane
   module. Experiments were carried out with both devices using
   anion-exchange membrane sheets having the same surface area and
   thickness, and thereby the same bed volume. Tracer experiments using
   either a dye or a protein (lysozyme) under non-binding condition clearly
   indicated superior flow distribution and collection within the novel
   module. This could be attributed to greater uniformity in solute flow
   path length. The protein binding capacities of membrane sheets of
   identical surface area and bed volume housed in the novel and
   conventional modules were compared in the breakthrough and pulse modes,
   using bovine serum albumin (or BSA) as the model adsorbed protein. The
   breakthrough experiments showed that at the same experimental
   conditions, the 1\% breakthrough binding capacity of the membrane housed
   in the novel module was 5.12 times higher than that housed in the
   conventional module. Moreover, flow-through and elution peaks obtained
   with the novel membrane module were significantly sharper and more
   symmetrical, with lower peak width. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated optimal dynamics control of four-wheel
   driving and four-wheel steering (4WD4WS) electric ground vehicles via
   hierarchical control methodology. In the higher-level design, an LQR
   controller is proposed to obtain the integrated lateral force and yaw
   moment, according to their respective reference values. The lower-level
   controller is designed to ensure all the tires work in the stable region
   while realizing the tracking control of the vehicle dynamics. The
   tire-road friction coefficient is estimated through the integrated
   longitudinal force and lateral force, respectively, using a brush tire
   model. To reduce the estimation error, a novel data fusion function is
   employed to generate the final estimation value. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed control and estimation strategies is
   validated via CarSim-Simulink joint simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A practical parameter, the volume density of organic thin films, found
   to affect the electronic properties and in turn the performance of
   organic photovoltaics (OPVs), is investigated in order to benefit the
   polymer synthesis and thin film preparation in OPVs. To establish the

   organic thin films with various treatments was obtained, by
   two-dimensional X-ray diffraction measurement using the density mapping
   with respect to the crystallinity of thin films. Our results suggest
   that the OPV of higher performance has a denser photoactive layer, which
   may hopefully provide a solution to the question of whether the film
   density matters in organic electronics, and help to benefit the OPV

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{The absorptance in vertical nanowire (nw) arrays is a result of three
   optical phenomena: radial mode resonances, near-field evanescent wave
   coupling, and Fabry-Perot (F-P) modes. The contribution of these optical
   phenomena to GaAs, InP and InAs nw absorptance was simulated using the
   finite element method. The study compared the absorptance between finite
   and semi-infinite nw lengths with varying geometrical parameters,
   including the nw diameter, length and array period. Simulation results
   showed that the resonance peak wavelength of the HE11 and HE12 radial
   modes linearly red-shifted with increasing nw diameter. The absorptance
   and spectral width of the resonance peaks increased as the nw length
   increased, with an absorptance plateau for very long nws that depended
   on diameter and period. Near-field coupling between neighboring nws was
   observed to increase with decreasing period. The effect of F-P modes was
   more pronounced for shorter nws, with a significant enhancement of HE12
   over HE11 absorptance. Engineering of nw arrays to take advantage of
   these optical phenomena for multi-spectral photodetector applications is

   damping}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{348}},
Pages = {{329-343}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) with nonlinear damping are often
   modelled using a power-law equivalent viscous damping relationship.
   There is currently not a method available to predict the peak response
   of this type of nonlinear DVA without resorting to computationally
   expensive nonlinear simulations. Since the peak response of the DVA is
   required during the design process, it is advantageous to have a
   simplified method to estimate the peak response.
   In this study, statistical linearization is employed to represent the
   nonlinear damping as amplitude-dependent viscous damping and predict the
   rms response of the structure-DVA system. Subsequently, statistical
   nonlinearization is used to describe the probability density function of
   the DVA response amplitude. A probability density function is developed,
   which enables the peak response expected during an interval of time
   (e.g. 1-h) to be estimated from the rms response of the structure-DVA
   system. Higher power-law damping exponents are shown to result in
   smaller peak factors.
   Results of nonlinear simulations reveal that the model can estimate the
   peak structural and DVA responses with acceptable accuracy. A plot is
   developed to show the peak factors for nonlinear DVAs as a function of
   the number of system cycles for several power-law damping exponents.
   This plot can be used to estimate the peak response of a nonlinear DVA
   as a function of its rms response. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Passive microwave satellites such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity or
   Soil Moisture Active Passive observe brightness temperature (TB) and
   retrieve soil moisture at a spatial resolution greater than most
   hydrological processes. Bias correction is proposed as a simple method
   to disaggregate soil moisture to a scale more appropriate for
   hydrological applications. Temporal stability of soil moisture and TB
   was demonstrated at the Little Washita and Little River Experimental
   Watersheds using in situ observations and the Community Microwave
   Emissions Model. Decomposition of the mean square difference (MSD)
   between the watershed average soil moisture and TB showed that bias was
   a major contributor to differences between watershed average and
   local-scale soil moisture and TB, particularly at sites with high MSD.
   The mean RMSD between watershed average and local soil moisture was
   0.04m(3)m(-3) and 0.06m(3)m(-3) at Little River and Little Washita,
   respectively. Following a simple bias correction the RMSD was reduced to
   0.03m(3)m(-3) at both sites. Considering multiple incidence angles at
   both horizontal and vertical polarization, bias correction of watershed
   average TBV reduced the RMSD by approximately 75\% and 45\% and TBH RMSD
   by 68\% and 36\% for Little River and Little Washita, respectively, at
   all incidence angles. Therefore, at subsatellite grid scale, bias
   correction can be considered a viable technique for downscaling passive
   microwave observations and soil moisture retrievals.}},

Abstract = {{Combinatorial auctions allow allocation of bundles of items to the
   bidders who value them the most. The NP-hardness of the winner
   determination problem (WDP) has imposed serious computational challenges
   when designing efficient solution algorithms. This paper analytically
   studies the Lagrangian relaxation of WDP and expounds a novel technique
   for efficiently solving the relaxation problem. Moreover, we introduce a
   heuristic algorithm that adjusts any infeasibilities from the Lagrangian
   optimal solution to reach an optimal or a near optimal solution.
   Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the class of problems on
   which application of this technique provides near optimal solutions in
   much less time, as little as a fraction of a thousand, as compared to
   the CPLEX solver. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed cradle-to-grave life cycle analyses are performed for
   bulk-scale solid oxide fuel cell power plants fueled by gasified coal.
   These results are compared to cradle-to-grave life cycle analyses of the
   supercritical pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle
   power generation plants, which are also performed as a part of this
   study. Life cycle inventories for each plant including the inputs
   (resources and fuels) and outputs (emissions and waste) of the
   gate-to-gate plants and their associated up- and down-stream
   sub-processes are computed. The impact of carbon capture and
   sequestration on each plant is quantified and assessed using the ReCiPe
   2008 life cycle inventory method for three socioeconomic perspectives.
   The results of each coal plant are compared to one another and to plants
   generating power from natural gas at the end-point level. Results
   indicate that not only do coal-fed SOFCs generate power with a
   significantly lower life cycle impact than the current state-of-the-art
   coal plants, but when carbon capture is enabled they can do so with a
   lower impact than the most modern plants utilizing natural gas, as well.

Title = {{Diffusion-controlled growth rate of stepped interfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{For many materials, the structure of crystalline surfaces or solid-solid
   interphase boundaries is characterized by an array of mobile steps
   separated by immobile terraces. Despite the prevalence of step-terraced
   interfaces a theoretical description of the growth rate has not been
   completely solved. In this work the boundary element method (BEM) has
   been utilized to numerically compute the concentration profile in a
   fluid phase in contact with an infinite array of equally spaced surface
   steps and, under the assumption that step motion is controlled by
   diffusion through the fluid phase, the growth rate is computed. It is
   also assumed that a boundary layer exists between the growing surface
   and a point in the liquid where complete convective mixing occurs. The
   BEM results are presented for varying step spacing, supersaturation, and
   boundary layer width. BEM calculations were also used to study the
   phenomenon of step bunching during crystal growth, and it is found that,
   in the absence of elastic strain energy, a sufficiently large
   perturbation in the position of a step from its regular spacing will
   lead to a step bunching instability. Finally, an approximate analytic
   solution using a matched asymptotic expansion technique is presented for
   the case of a stagnant liquid or equivalently a solid-solid stepped
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions of three Oil-in-water emulsion types with
   polystyrene-coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor surfaces
   were probed with the QCM cell in both the conventional orientation
   (i.e., polystyrene surface on the bottom, ``looking up{''}) and the
   inverted orientation (polystyrene on top interior surface of sensor
   chamber, ``looking down{''}). With the conventionally oriented QCM
   sensors, the adsorption of Soluble and/or dispersed species quickly gave
   steady-state frequency and dissipation outputs. By contrast, the
   inverted sensors gave changing responses at long times because of the
   gravity driven buildup of a viscous consolidation layer next to but not
   necessarily bound to the sensor surface. Three emulsion types (a simple
   hexadecane/phosphatidylcholine emulsion, 2\% homogenized Milk, and a
   diluted commercial ophthalmic emulsion) displayed a wide range of
   behaviors. We propose that quiescent QCM measurement made with an
   inverted sample chamber is a new approach to probing emulsion behaviors
   near solid surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of ageing on the microstructure and dynamic rheological
   properties of three modified asphalt binders are investigated. The
   asphalt modifiers used comprise crumb rubber (CR),
   styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer and a blend or
   combination of CR and SBS (CCR). To investigate the modified asphalts
   microstructure, scanning electron microscopy is applied, while for
   assessing rheological properties at a wide range of temperature, Bending
   Beam Rheometry and Dynamic Shear Rheometry are employed. Ageing of
   asphalt during construction and under service conditions is simulated
   using the rolling thin film oven test and the Pressurised Ageing Vessel
   procedures. It is observed that ageing makes all three modified asphalts
   harder, increases their resistance to deformation under high
   temperatures, and decreases their fatigue and cracking resistance at low
   temperatures. Comparatively, the CR maintains its bond with the asphalt
   better than the SBS and the CR-modified asphalt exhibits lower stiffness
   and lower degree of ageing under cold temperature, while it shows the
   highest resistance to high-temperature deformation and fatigue. On the
   contrary, the SBS-modified asphalt exhibits the worst performance in
   practically every respect compared to the CR- and CCR-modified asphalts.}},

Abstract = {{The peel resistance of adhesively bonded polymer films to a stainless

   characteristics was examined in two different loading directions and for

   The SSSS surface was altered by grinding and knurling techniques before
   lamination and the effects of surface alterations on peel resistance
   were compared with peel resistance of the adherend from as-received SSSS
   with a bright annealed surface condition. For ground surface, an
   increase in adherend peel resistance was observed and the increase was
   attributed to increase in contact area between the adhesive and SSSS
   surface. For knurled surfaces which involved deeper and less frequent
   grooves, however, a decrease in peel resistance was observed. This was
   attributed to a more complex stress state at the peel front in the SSSS
   groove region during peeling. An increase in peel speed enhanced the
   peel resistance from both ground and knurled surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The disposal of enormous amount of stormwater sediments becomes an
   emerging worldwide problem. Stormwater sediments are contaminated by
   heavy metals, phosphorus, trace organic and hydrocarbons, and cannot be
   disposed without treatment. Thermal plasma decontamination technology
   offers a high decomposition rate in a wide range of toxic organic
   compound and immobilization of heavy metal. In this study, we compared
   the treatment results between two different modes of thermal plasma: (1)
   a non-transferred direct current (DC) mode and (2) a partial
   DC-transferred mode. The reductions of total organic carbon (TOC) were,
   respectively, 25\% and 80\% for non-transferred and partially
   transferred plasma, respectively. Most of the toxic organic compounds
   were converted majorly to CxHy. In the gaseous emission, the accumulated
   CxHy, CO, NO and H2S were significantly higher in partially transferred
   mode than in non-transferred mode. The solid analysis demonstrated that
   the concentrations of Ca and Fe were enriched by 500\% and 40\%,
   respectively. New chemical compositions such as KAlSi3O8, Fe3O4, NaCl
   and CaSO4 were formed after treatment in partially DC-transferred mode.
   The power inputs were 1 and 10 kW, respectively, for non-transferred DC
   mode and a partially DC-transferred mode. With a lower energy input,
   non-transferred plasma treatment can be used for decontamination of
   sediments with low TOC and metal concentration. Meanwhile, partially
   transferred thermal plasma with higher energy input is suitable for
   treating sediments with high TOC percentage and volatile metal
   concentration. The organic compounds are converted into valuable gaseous
   products which can be recycled as an energy source.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanically steered scanning radars receive measurements continuously
   while sweeping the surveillance region. However, most target tracking
   algorithms, like the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) and the joint
   probabilistic data association (JPDA) techniques, wait for the end of a
   scan in order to process the measurements and to estimate targets
   states. This is due to the fundamental assumption of one-to-one
   association between tracks and measurements and the 360 degrees physical
   limit of a scan. Associating measurements to initialized tracks and
   filtering at the end of a complete scan may cause significant delays in
   target state update. In addition, association may become imperfect due
   to longer intervals between updates. This issue becomes significant when
   tracking high-speed targets with low scan rate sensors as in the
   airborne early warning (AEW) system.
   In this paper, we present a new dynamic sector processing algorithm
   using two-dimensional (2-D) assignment for scanning radars that report
   measurements within the duration of a scan. The full scan is dynamically
   and adaptively divided into sectors, which could be as small as a single
   detection, depending on the scanning rate, sparsity of targets, and
   required target state update speed. Measurement-to-track association,
   filtering, and target state update are done dynamically while sweeping
   from one region to another, i.e., continuous track update, limited only
   by the intermeasurement interval, becomes possible. The proposed
   algorithm offers low latency while maintaining estimation accuracy in
   track updates as well as efficient utilization of computational
   resources compared with standard frame-based tracking algorithms.
   Experimental results based on rotating radars demonstrate the advantages
   of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have successfully developed a novel approach to epoxy
   foaming using CO2 as the latent blowing agent. The active amine groups
   of a commercially available curing agent for epoxy resin are blocked by
   CO2 to obtain ammonium carbamate. The prepared ammonium carbamate can be
   decomposed by heating. Above 100 degrees C, CO2 is released from the
   amine groups and acts as the blowing agent, while the amine compound is
   used as the curing agent and cures the epoxy resin. The ammonium
   carbamate combines the functionalities of latent blowing agent and
   curing agent. The one-pack epoxy foaming formulation has good storage
   stability under ambient conditions. The thermoset epoxy foams prepared
   from the one-pack formulation have low density, good mechanical
   properties, and thermal stability, competitive with the epoxy foams
   prepared by other methods. This novel approach is simple,
   environmentally benign, and cost-effective, which represents a promising
   direction in the development of epoxy foaming technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical modeling and numerical simulation have been performed at
   lambda = 2100 nm on silicon-on-insulator channel-waveguide directional
   couplers in which the outer two Si waveguides are passive and the
   central waveguide(s) are electro-optical (EO) ``islands.{''} The EO
   channel(s) utilize a 10 nm layer of Ge2Sb2Te5 phase-change-material
   sited at midlevel of a doped Si channel. A voltage-driven phase change
   produces a large change in the effective index of the TEo and TMo modes,
   thereby inducing crossbar 2 x 2 switching. A mode-matching method is
   employed to estimate EO switching performance in the limit of strong
   interguide coupling. Low-loss switching is predicted for cross-to-bar
   and bar-to-cross coupling lengths. These ``self-holding{''} switches had
   active lengths of 500-1000 mu m, which are shorter than those in
   couplers relying upon free-carrier injection. The four-waveguide devices
   had lower cross talk but higher loss than the three-waveguide devices.

   smaller than that for the amorphous phase. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

   monitoring network}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The number of water quality monitoring stations in the USA has decreased
   over the past few decades. Scarcity of observations can easily produce
   prediction uncertainty due to unreliable model calibration. An effective
   water quality monitoring network is important not only for model
   calibration and water quality prediction but also for resources
   management. Redundant or improperly located monitoring stations may
   cause increased monitoring costs without improvement to the
   understanding of water quality in watersheds. In this work, a
   decision-making methodology is proposed to design a water quality
   monitoring network by providing an adequate number of monitoring
   stations and their approximate locations at the eight-digit hydrologic
   unit codes (HUC8) scale. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for an
   example at the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), where salinity is a
   serious concern. The level of monitoring redundancy or scarcity is
   defined by an index, station ratio (SR), which represents a monitoring
   density based on water quality load originated within a subbasin. By
   comparing the number of stations from a selected target SR with the
   available number of stations including the actual and the potential
   stations, the suggested number of stations in each subbasin was decided.
   If monitoring stations are primarily located in the low salinity loading
   subbasins, the average actual SR tends to increase, and vice versa.
   Results indicate that the spatial distribution of monitoring locations
   in 2011 is concentrated on low salinity loading subbasins, and
   therefore, additional monitoring is required for the high salinity
   loading subbasins. The proposed methodology shows that the SR is a
   simple and a practical indicator for monitoring density.}},

Abstract = {{Space mapping is a recognized method for speeding up electromagnetic
   (EM) optimization. Existing space-mapping approaches belong to the class
   of surrogate-based optimization methods. This paper proposes a
   cognition-driven formulation of space mapping that does not require
   explicit surrogates. The proposed method is applied to EM-based filter
   optimization. The new technique utilizes two sets of intermediate
   feature space parameters, including feature frequency parameters and
   ripple height parameters. The design variables are mapped to the feature
   frequency parameters, which are further mapped to the ripple height
   parameters. By formulating the cognition-driven optimization directly in
   the feature space, our method increases optimization efficiency and the
   ability to avoid being trapped in local minima. The technique is
   suitable for design of filters with equal-ripple responses. It is
   illustrated by two microwave filter examples.}},

Abstract = {{The present study proposes a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) with
   64 selectable items based on the fusion of P300 and steady-state
   visually evoked potential (SSVEP) brain signals. With this approach,
   row/column (RC) P300 and two-step SSVEP paradigms were integrated to
   create two hybrid paradigms, which we denote as the double RC (DRC) and
   4-D spellers. In each hybrid paradigm, the target is simultaneously
   detected based on both P300 and SSVEP potentials as measured by the
   electroencephalogram. We further proposed a maximum-probability
   estimation (MPE) fusion approach to combine the P300 and SSVEP on a
   score level and compared this approach to other approaches based on
   linear discriminant analysis, a naive Bayes classifier, and support
   vector machines. The experimental results obtained from thirteen
   participants indicated that the 4-D hybrid paradigm outperformed the DRC
   paradigm and that the MPE fusion achieved higher accuracy compared with
   the other approaches. Importantly, 12 of the 13 participants, using the
   4-D paradigm achieved an accuracy of over 90\% and the average accuracy
   was 95.18\%. These promising results suggest that the proposed hybrid
   BCI system could be used in the design of a high-performance BCI-based
   keyboard.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past century, in most countries, there has been a continual
   increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public
   health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine. However, these
   improvements are now coupled with aging population demographics and
   falling birth rates, which, when combined, are expected to significantly
   burden the socioeconomic well-being of many of these countries. In fact,
   never before in human history have we been confronted with such a large
   aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions
   for the well-being, healthcare and social needs of the elderly. One
   efficient and cost-effective solution to the problem of elderly/patient
   care is remote healthcare monitoring so they can continue to live at
   home rather than in nursing homes or hospitals that are very expensive
   and with limited spaces. These remote monitoring systems will allow
   medical personnel to keep track of important physiological signs with
   reduced human resources, at less cost and in real time. This paper
   introduces several low-cost, noninvasive, user-friendly sensing and
   actuating systems using information and communication technologies. Such
   systems can be used to create engineering solutions to some of the
   pressing healthcare problems in our society, especially as it pertains
   to the elderly. One example is the integration of sensors, wireless
   communications, low-power electronics and intelligent computing to
   determine health-related information using signals from walking
   patterns. Such a sensing system will be suitable for prolonged use in a
   home environment. It will be wearable, noninvasive and non-intrusive,
   similar to smart socks, smart wrist-bands or smart belts. Other examples
   such as a smart joint monitor and a smart sleeping environment will be
   discussed, and future perspectives and research challenges in smart home
   technologies will be described.}},

Abstract = {{Method of moments is a simple deterministic method widely applicable in
   modeling various polymerization processes. This method is easy to use
   and computationally inexpensive. Although the mathematics involved is
   simple and elementary, the derivation step is often lengthy and thus it

   step-by-step guide on how to apply the method of moments to different
   polymerization and polymer modification systems. The basics behind
   method of moments, the limitation related to it, and common problems
   encountered in derivation with ways to counter them are described in

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)
   constructed with spiral wound electrode and to evaluate its
   effectiveness for wastewater treatment and methane (CH4) production. The
   spiral wound design can provide more than 60 m(2)/m(3) of specific
   surface area of the electrode and low internal resistance. With acetate
   as the substrate and increasing applied voltages from 0.7 to 1.3 V, the
   average current density and CH4 production rate increased from 46 to 132
   A/m(3) and from 0.08 to 0.17 m(3)/m(3) d, respectively. With the
   increasing applied voltages, the energy efficiencies decreased from
   157\% to 69\%, while the COD removal rates increased from 0.31 to 0.69
   kg COD/m(3)d. The optimal applied voltage of the spiral-wound-electrode
   MEC was about 0.95V. Fed with dairy wastewater, the MEC also showed good
   performance with the average current density of 24 A/m(3), CH4
   production rate of 0.03 m(3)/m(3) d, energy efficiency of 66\%, and COD

Abstract = {{This paper presents detailed analyses of experimental results pertaining
   to the cyclic behavior of a reduced-scale reinforced masonry (RM)
   asymmetric building with walls aligned in two orthogonal directions. The
   current study focuses on analyzing the influence of twist, as a
   system-level effect, on the displacement and strength demands of the
   building's individual seismic force resisting system (SFRS) wall
   components. The study evaluates the individual wall contributions to the
   overall building response characteristics within both the elastic and
   the inelastic response phases. Documentation of the compressive strains
   at the wall toes is also presented and correlated to the damage levels
   anticipated for each wall. In addition, the building center of rotation
   and center of strength are determined and the corresponding twist angles
   and moments and building torsional stiffness values are evaluated
   throughout the loading history. Moreover, the trends of stiffness
   degradation for the walls and for the building are presented, and the
   relationship between the individual walls' and building's stiffness is
   discussed. Finally, the trends of energy dissipation increase with
   increased building displacement ductility are established for different
   system-level ductility levels. The information presented in this paper
   is expected to provide useful benchmarking data that can contribute to
   the understanding of RM system-level response and how it compares to the
   behavior of individual RM SFRS components.}},

   Isolators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical model is developed and used to predict the
   horizontal behavior of unbonded fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators
   (FREIs). An advantageous feature of unbonded FREIs is the ability to
   undergo rollover due to the lack of flexural rigidity of the
   reinforcement and the unbonded support conditions of the isolator. The
   rollover causes a characteristic softening, followed by stiffening, as
   the initially vertical faces of the isolator come into contact with the
   upper and lower supportsdefined as full rollover. The force-displacement
   relationship is modeled by dividing the isolator into three sections: a
   central section, which experiences pure shear, and two rollover
   sections, which experiences combined shear and bending. The
   displacements of the rollover section are used to establish the curved
   deformed profile and predict full rollover. The model is evaluated with
   experimental data from four unbonded FREI designs. A parametric study is
   conducted to determine the influence of the aspect ratio and bending
   stiffness of the composite fiber reinforcement matrix on the horizontal
   force-displacement relationship.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical anisotropy of hot-rolled Mg alloy AZ31 is investigated
   both experimentally and numerically. First, five different specimen
   orientations with tilt angles of alpha = 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45
   degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees between the normal direction and
   longitudinal specimen axis are used to experimentally study the
   mechanical anisotropy under uniaxial compression. Then, the Elastic
   Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (EVPSC) model, with the recently developed
   Twinning and De-Twinning (TDT) description, is applied to simulate the
   uniaxial compression tests. It is demonstrated that accounting for the
   initial texture and calibrating the EVPSCTDT model using in-plane
   uniaxial tension and compression along the rolling direction permits
   prediction of the strength anisotropy and strain hardening behavior
   along all the five orientations, for cases in which the contribution of
   twinning is dominated, negligible and intermediate. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new analytic method based on the microstructural path method with
   nucleation rate and growth rate as descriptors is proposed, which
   provides a link between the nonhomogeneous distribution of stored energy
   in plastically deformed materials and the recrystallization rate. The
   proposed approach uses easily measured recrystallization rates to
   provide information about the deformation history and the inhomogeneity
   of stored energy. The theory was evaluated by comparing direct
   differential scanning calorimetry measurements of inhomogeneity factor,
   m, on deformed samples of pure Cu at 498 K (225 A degrees C), to those
   extracted from hardness measurements. Excellent agreement between the
   model and the experiment was found. In addition, it is shown how any
   given probability function describing the initial distribution of stored
   energy can be used to predict the evolution of the residual stored
   energy as recrystallization proceeds.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium alloy AZ31B plastically deforms via twinning and slip.
   Corresponding to the unidirectional nature of twinning, the activity of
   twinning/detwinning is directly related to loading history and materials
   texture. Using the elastic viscoplastic self-consistent model
   implementing with the twinning and detwinning model (EVPSC-TDT), we
   revisited experimental data of AZ31B sheets under four different strain
   paths: (1) tension-compression-tension along rolling direction, (2)
   tension-compression-tension along transverse direction, (3)
   compression-tension-compression along rolling direction, and (4)
   compression-tension-compression along transverse direction, and
   identified the dominant deformation mechanisms with respect to the
   strain path. We captured plastic deformation behaviors observed in
   experiments and quantitatively interpreted experimental observations in
   terms of the activities of different deformation mechanisms and the
   evolution of texture. It is found that the in-plane pre-tension has
   slight effect on the subsequent deformation, and the pre-compression and
   the reverse tension after compression have significant effect on the
   subsequent deformation. The inelastic behavior under compressive
   unloading is found to be insignificant at a small strain level but
   pronounced at a large strain level. Such significant effect is mainly
   ascribed to the activity of twinning and detwinning.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed, fabricated, and measured the performance of a linear
   and area-efficient implementation of the compressive sensing (CS) method
   in CMOS image sensors. The use of an active pixel sensor (APS) with an
   integrator and in-pixel current switches are exploited to develop a
   compact implementation of CS encoding in analog domain. The intrinsic
   linearity of APS with integrator circuit guarantees the linearity of the
   CS encoding structure. The CS measurement process is performed for
   different blocks of the imager separately. This block-based
   implementation provides individual access to all the pixels from outside
   the array, resulting in a scalable design with relatively high
   fill-factor using only two transistors in each pixel. The CS-CMOS image
   sensor is designed and fabricated in 130-nm technology for 2 x 2, 4 x 4,
   and 16 x 16 arrays. The linearity of the extracted measurement is
   confirmed by the experimental results from 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 blocks. In
   addition, the block readout scheme and the scalability of the design is
   examined by fabricating a larger array of 4 x 4 blocks.}},

Abstract = {{Many methods have been proposed to select sites for grid-scale soil
   moisture monitoring networks; however, calibration/validation activities
   also require information about where to place grid representative
   monitoring sites. In order to design a soil moisture network for this
   task in the Great Lakes Basin (522 000 km(2)), the dual-entropy
   multiobjective optimization algorithm was used to maximize the
   information content and minimize the redundancy of information in a
   potential soil moisture monitoring network. Soil moisture retrieved from
   the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission during the
   frost-free periods of 2010-2013 were filtered for data quality and then
   used in a multiobjective search to find Pareto optimum network designs
   based on the joint entropy and total correlation measures of information
   content and information redundancy, respectively. Differences in the
   information content of SMOS ascending and descending overpasses resulted
   in distinctly different network designs. Entropy from the SMOS ascending
   overpass was found to be spatially consistent, whereas descending
   overpass entropy had many peaks that coincided with areas of high
   subgrid heterogeneity. A combination of both ascending and descending
   overpasses produced network designs that incorporated aspects of
   information from each overpass. Initial networks were designed to
   include 15 monitoring sites, but the addition of network cost as an
   objective demonstrated that a network with similar information content
   could be achieved with fewer monitoring stations.}},

Abstract = {{Surface roughening due to the plastic straining in the blow-formed
   bottle is an important issue because of the cosmetically related surface
   appearance on the final product. In this paper, a finite-element-based
   crystal plasticity model is used to simulate surface roughening in
   aluminum tubes under blow-forming. The measured electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD) data is directly incorporated into the finite element
   model and the constitutive response at an integration point is described
   by the single crystal plasticity theory. Besides the influence of the
   texture and its spatial distribution, rate sensitivity and work
   hardening on surface roughening, the study shows that the better surface
   finishing in the final product can be achieved either through cladding a
   layer with more randomized texture or through improving the initial
   surface roughness of the tube before expansion, while the latter is more
   feasible and practical from industrial application point of view. (C)

Abstract = {{The complex microstructure of ferrous martensite is reflected in its
   complex mechanical response. In an attempt to highlight how carbon
   redistribution during quenching and/or low temperature tempering can
   affect mechanical response, a set of controlled experiments were
   performed. By rapidly quenching samples it was possible to limit
   autotempering allowing the evolution of mechanical response and
   microstructure to be followed with low temperature tempering. This was
   compared to a situation where the material was more slowly quenched,
   leading to a highly autotempered state. The gradual transition from
   elastic to plastic deformation is interpreted based on possible sources
   of microstructural heterogeneity. Lath-to-lath variations of dislocation
   density are discussed as a contributor to the development of
   microstructural heterogeneity during tempering. These results shed light
   on the possible origins of the continuous-composite like mechanical
   response of lath martensite proposed in recent work. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work, silicon-rich silicon oxide films of different
   stoichiometry were annealed at high temperatures in order to obtain
   silicon nanocrystals embedded in silica. The low-frequency Raman
   scattering has been observed and related to acoustic phonons confined in
   these nanocrystals. It has been found that this scattering consists of
   two modes: one at a lower frequency and one at a higher frequency. The
   depolarization ratios for these modes were determined, showing that the
   lower frequency mode is depolarized and the higher frequency mode is
   polarized. It has been also found that under specific conditions of film
   preparation the product of mode frequency and nanocrystal diameter is
   scale invariant. Finally, it has been shown that the confined acoustic
   phonon frequencies do not simply depend on the nanocrystal size alone,
   but also on the Si concentration in the film itself. This effect has
   been ascribed to the accelerated nucleation and enhanced crystallization
   occurring in the films deposited with higher Si content.}},

Abstract = {{The first ever implementation of a thermal AND gate, which performs

   Employing molecular dynamics simulations, the characteristics of this

   gate. The thermal gate mechanism originates through thermal
   rectification due to asymmetric phonon boundary scattering in the two
   diodes, which is only effective at the nanoscale and at the temperatures
   much below the room temperature. Due to the high phonon velocity in
   graphene, the gate has a fast switching time of approximate to 100 ps.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristic energies, occupancies and polarizations of the

   the interminiband gap, predicted by the theory, and as a consequence,
   the redistribution of charge over the superlattice minibands and the
   depolarization of the quantum Hall electron states are observed at odd
   filling factors. The response of the electrons residing in the
   InGaAs/InP superlattice minibands to the magnetic field is found very
   similar to the corresponding response of the electrons confined in the
   symmetric and anti-symmetric two-dimensional minibands of GaAs/AlGaAs

Title = {{Direct Measurement of Surface Termination Groups and Their Connectivity

Abstract = {{The MXenes are a class of 2D materials composed of transition-metal
   sheets alternating with carbide/nitride sheets, stacked just a few atoms
   thick. MXenes discovered thus far also have a surface termination layer
   that is likely a mixture of hydroxides and fluorides. While reasonable
   structural models based on X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
   microscopy data exist, the exact nature and distribution of the surface
   termination species are not well understood. Here, H-1, F-19, and C-13
   solid-state NMR spectroscopies are used to investigate the model MXene
   V2CTx, where T signifies the surface termination groups. H-1 NMR
   experiments provide direct proof of hydroxide moieties in the surface
   layer by measuring interactions with the MXene surface. Furthermore, H-1
   NMR spectroscopy shows a significant amount of water hydrogen bonded to
   the surface hydroxide layer. F-19 NMR experiments show fluoride moieties
   bonded to the MXene surface, with extremely unusual F-19 spectra caused
   by strong interactions with the metallic/semiconducting MXene. C-13 NMR
   observes the sample from the center of the MXene layer and shows that
   the C-13 chemical shift is extremely sensitive to the MAX -> MXene
   transformation. Nuclear-spin magnetization transferred from H-1 nuclei
   in the hydroxide surface termination layer to C-13 nuclei in the center
   of the MXene sheet yields further evidence of this connectivity. The
   multinuclear NMR experiments provide direct experimental verification of
   the structural models and depict the MXene V2CTx as infinite sheets of
   small-bandgap V2C sheets terminated by a mixed hydroxide/fluoride layer
   embedded in a matrix of strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecules.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated process for improving selectivity and permeate flux in
   ultrafiltration based protein fractionation was developed by combining
   electrodialysis (ED) with electro-ultrafiltration (EUF). The performance
   of such a process was first investigated using individual proteins
   (bovine serum albumin and lysozyme) and then with a mixture of the two.
   The experimental results showed that as with EUF on its own, the
   build-up of lysozyme concentration polarization near the cation exchange
   membrane in the permeate compartment significantly affected ion
   migration and led to change in pH and conductivity of the feed solution
   during an EUF-ED process with lysozyme, or bovine serum albumin and
   lysozyme mixture. As compared with EUF, EUF-ED of protein mixture
   resulted in a 20\% increase in permeate flux with the lysozyme
   transmission remaining the same. The demineralization that occurred
   during EUF-ED made this process suitable for protein separation from the
   feed solutions with high conductivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Submicrometre particles of multiferroic BiMn2O5 are prepared by a
   hydrothermal method. We demonstrate for the first time that
   BiMn2O5-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite can be used as a
   new active material for positive electrodes of electrochemical
   supercapacitors (ES). The possibility of fabrication of BiMn2O5-MWCNT
   composites from colloidal suspensions using Celestine blue dye as a
   co-dispersant for BiMn2O5 and MWCNT is demonstrated. The composite
   BiMn2O5-MWCNT electrodes with high mass loading and high active material
   to current collector mass ratio show a capacitance of 6.0 F cm(-2) (540
   F cm(-3)) at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1) and capacitance retention of 75
   and 58\% at scan rates of 100 and 200 mV s(-1), respectively. The new
   findings pave the way to the fabrication of efficient asymmetric
   devices, containing BiMn2O5-MWCNT positive electrodes and activated
   carbon-carbon black (AC-CB) negative electrodes. The asymmetric device
   shows good capacitive behavior and good cyclic stability in a voltage
   window of 1.8 V. The analysis of power-energy characteristics indicates
   that maximum energy density of 13.0 W h L-1 (9.0 W h kg(-1)) and maximum
   power density of 3.6 kW L-1 (2.5 kW kg(-1)) can be achieved. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Isothermal and non-isothermal multistage hot compression tests were
   carried out on 7150 aluminum alloy at temperature range of 325-425
   degrees C and strain rate range of 0.01 - 1 s(-1). During isothermal
   multistage hot compression, the flow stress decreased with increasing
   temperature, accumulative strain as well as decreasing strain rate and
   pass strain. However, the interval time had a complex influence on flow
   stress, which ascended flow stress values with increasing interval time
   at 425 degrees C. The isothermal and non-isothermal constitutive
   characteristics were studied based on hyperbolic-sine law, indicating
   complex influences of various processing parameters on material
   constants. Non-isothermal multistage flow stresses were found to be
   easier than normal continuous single pass method to manipulate for
   constitutive equations calculation with better linear fitting reference
   and comparable activation energy. Precipitation at low temperature and
   its dissolution at high temperature were found to affect flow behavior
   and constitutive characteristics remarkably based on microstructural
   observation of deformed sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to formulate and validate an accurate MPM
   approach for the numerical simulation of the large displacement of
   membranes containing soil. In the proposed approach, the membrane is
   discretised by a surface mesh that allows accurate simulation of
   membrane stresses. The membrane is free to move through a
   three-dimensional grid for a continuum consisting of tetrahedral
   elements. The approach is applied to model a geocontainer being released
   from a split barge, taking into account the frictional contact between
   the geotextile and the barge. No-slip contact is assumed between the
   geotextile and the soil inside. The effect of geocontainer interaction
   is investigated by dropping a second container. Copyright (c) 2014 John

   using a normal-incidence plane wave at mid-infrared frequencies}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{We investigate optical field enhancement for a wide mid-infrared range,
   originating from the excitation of graphene plasmons, by introducing a
   graded dielectric grating of varying period underneath a graphene
   monolayer. Excitation of the plasmonic mode can be achieved by
   illuminating a normal-incidence plane wave on the gratings due to
   guided-mode resonance. The gratings of varying period enable the
   excitation of the plasmonic mode with a very high field enhancement
   factor (to the order of magnitude of 1000) within a wide spectral band,
   which leads to the frequency-dependent spatially separated localization
   of the infrared spectrum modes. We also demonstrate that the excitation
   position of the plasmonic mode can be freely tuned by varying the
   thickness of the interlayer as well as the chemical potential of the
   graphene monolayer. This structure enables the design of two-dimensional
   plasmonic photonic circuits and metamaterials targeted towards numerous
   potential applications including optoelectronic detectors, light-harvest
   devices, on-chip optical interconnects, biosensors, and light-matter
   interactions.}},

Title = {{Kinetic-freezing and unfreezing of local-region fluctuations in a glass
   structure observed by heat capacity hysteresis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Fluctuations confined to local regions in the structure of a glass are
   observed as the Johari-Goldstein (JG) relaxation. Properties of these
   regions and their atomic configuration are currently studied by
   relaxation techniques, by electron microscopy, and by high-energy X-ray
   scattering and extended x-ray absorption fine structure methods. One
   expects that these fluctuations (i) would kinetically freeze on cooling
   a glass, and the temperature coefficient of its enthalpy, dH/dT, would
   consequently show a gradual decrease with decrease in T, (ii) would
   kinetically unfreeze on heating the glass toward the glass-liquid
   transition temperature, T-g, and dH/dT would gradually increase, and
   (iii) there would be a thermal hysteresis indicating the time and
   temperature dependence of the enthalpy. Since no such features have been
   found, thermodynamic consequences of these fluctuations are debated.
   After searching for these features in glasses of different types, we
   found it in one of the most stable metal alloy glasses of composition
   Pd40Ni10Cu30P20. On cooling from its T-g, dH/dT decreased along a broad
   sigmoid-shape path as local-region fluctuations kinetically froze. On
   heating thereafter, dH/dT increased along a similar path as these
   fluctuations unfroze, and there is hysteresis in the cooling and heating
   paths, similar to that observed in the T-g-endotherm range. After
   eliminating other interpretations, we conclude that local-region
   fluctuations seen as the JG relaxation in the non-equilibrium state of a
   glass contribute to its entropy, and we suggest conditions under which
   such fluctuations may be observed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art image acquisition, image analysis, and modern
   homogenization theory are used to study the effects of cycling on
   commercial lithium-ion battery cathodes ability to conduct electronic
   current. This framework allows for a rigorous computation of an
   effective, or macroscale, electronic conductivity given an arbitrarily
   complicated three-dimensional microstructure comprised of three
   different material phases, i.e., active material, binder (polymer mixed
   with conductive carbon black), and electrolyte. The approach explicitly
   takes into account the geometry and is thus a vast improvement over the
   commonly used Bruggeman approximation. We apply our framework to two
   different types of lithium-ion battery cathodes before and after
   cycling. This leads us to predict an appreciable decrease in the
   effective electronic conductivity as a direct result of cycling. In
   addition, we present an ad-hoc ``neighbor counting{''} methodology which
   meaningfully quantifies the effect of binder detaching from the surface
   of the active material due to the internal mechanical stresses
   experienced under operating conditions, thereby supporting the results
   of the homogenization calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Rheological analysis of a complex fluid system like an aqueous polymer
   dispersion can be challenging but can reveal mechanistic information as
   the viscous melt is emulsified. A pressurized vessel was used as a
   rheometer, based on the MetznerOtto approach, to evaluate formulation
   variables where the developed morphology of a polyester/water mixture
   was shear-dependent. The parameters of the study were resin-to-water
   ratio (R/W), surfactant (type and concentration), and process variables
   of impeller speed and temperature. Transient in situ information on the
   system during the mixing of water into the molten polymer showed that a
   rapid, near-instantaneous decrease in the torque on the impeller
   occurred consistently around 2\% water addition, related to the onset of
   the developed morphological state. It was observed to only demonstrate a
   drop in the torque for high shear rates and only with the appropriate
   content of surface-active species, revealing the chemical and physical
   parameters necessary to emulsify the polyester melt.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, rapid, solvent-free, and scalable thermally driven
   self-assembly approach is described to produce monodisperse, covalently

   microgels based on mixing hydrazide (PNIPAM-Hzd) and aldehyde
   (PNIPAM-Ald) functionalized PNIPAM precursors. Preheating of a seed
   PNIPAM-Hzd solution above its phase transition temperature produces nano
   aggregates that are subsequently stabilized and cross-linked by the
   addition of PNIPAM-Ald. The ratio of PNIPAM-Hzd:PNIPAM-Ald used to
   prepare the microgels, the time between PNIPAM-Ald addition and,cooling,
   the temperature to which the PNIPAM-Hzd polymer solution is preheated,
   and the concentration of PNIPAM-Hzd in the initial seed solution can all
   be used to control the size of the resulting microgels. The microgels
   exhibit similar thermal phase transition behavior to conventional
   precipitation-based microgels but are fully degradable into oligomeric
   precursor polymers. The microgels can also be lyophilized and
   redispersed without any change in colloidal stability or particle size
   and exhibit no significant cytotoxicity in vitro. We anticipate that
   microgels fabricated using this approach May facilitate translation of
   the attractive properties of such microgels in vivo without the concerns
   regarding microgel clearance that,exist with other PNIPAM-based

Abstract = {{Optical wireless links in the solar-blind ultraviolet (SB-UV) band
   transmit data without the need of a line-of-sight through the use of
   atmospheric scattering. These links have a host of advantages including
   security, covertness and ease of deployment, however, they inherently
   suffer large path loss and delay spread due to the underlying
   atmospheric scattering process. This paper considers the use of spatial
   degrees of freedom at the receiver to improve the information rates of
   SB-UV channels. Classical scattering link models are extended to provide
   both temporal and spatial arrival information for scattered photons. A
   spatio-temporal channel model is developed for SB-UV channels using
   multi-element imaging receivers. Spatial diversity techniques for delay
   compensation and detector noise suppression are presented and
   information rates under equally likely signalling are computed to
   contrast their performance. In the particular cases considered, the
   information rate using a spatial diversity receiver is improved
   approximately 50\% over single element receiver channels.}},

Title = {{Skeletal muscle microvascular function in girls with Turner syndrome}},
Journal = {{BBA CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{25-30}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exercise intolerance is prevalent in individuals with Turner
   Syndrome (TS). We recently demonstrated that girls with TS have normal
   aerobic but altered skeletal muscle anaerobic metabolism compared to
   healthy controls (HC). The purpose of this study was to compare
   peripheral skeletal muscle microvascular function in girls with TS to HC
   after exercise. We hypothesized that girls with TS would have similar
   muscle blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) signal responses during recovery from exercise compared to HC.
   Methods: Thirteen TS participants and 8 HC completed testing. BOLD MRI
   was used to measure skeletal muscle microvascular response during 60
   second recovery, following 60 s of exercise at 65\% of maximal workload.
   Exercise and recovery were repeated four times, and the BOLD signal time
   course was fit to a four-parameter sigmoid function.
   Results: Participants were 13.7 +/- 3.1 years old and weighed 47.9 +/-
   14.6 kg. The mean change in BOLD signal intensity following exercise at
   the end of recovery, the mean response time of the function/the washout
   of deoxyhemoglobin, and the mean half-time of recovery were similar
   between the TS and HC groups.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that compared to HC, peripheral
   skeletal muscle microvascular function following exercise in girls with
   TS is not impaired.
   General significance: This study supports the idea that the aerobic
   energy pathway is not impaired in children with TS in response to
   submaximal exercise. Other mechanisms are likely responsible for
   exercise intolerance in TS; this needs to be further investigated. (C)

Abstract = {{A fixed-switching-frequency model-based sliding mode current controller
   with an integral switching surface for switched reluctance motor (SRM)
   drives is presented in this paper. Based on the equivalent circuit model
   of SRM, including the magnetic saturation and mutual coupling, an
   integral sliding mode current controller is designed. The stability of
   sliding mode controller is analyzed in two scenarios: 1) one with known
   motor parameters and 2) the other with bounded modeling error. In order
   to analyze the robustness of the sliding mode controller, the motor
   controller parameter constraints are derived and the stability analysis
   is demonstrated by considering motor parameter modeling errors. The
   sliding mode controller is validated by both simulation and experimental
   results with a 2.3-kW, 6000-r/min, three-phase 12/8 SRM over the wide
   speed range in both linear and magnetic saturation regions. Compared to
   the hysteresis current controller, the sliding mode controller
   demonstrates comparable transient response and steady-state response in
   terms of torque ripples, current ripples, root-mean-square error of
   current and torque. Moreover, the sliding mode controller has some
   advantages over the hysteresis controller, including constant switching
   frequency and much lower sampling rate.}},

Abstract = {{In order to get better understanding of the mechanism of cleavage
   fracture in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of X100 pipeline steel,
   secondary microcracks underneath the brittle fracture surface of a
   Charpy impacted sample with the notch located in the HAZ were
   characterized using electron backscattered diffraction. Since the coarse
   grained (CG) HAZ and inter-critically reheated coarse grained (ICCG) HAZ
   are well accepted as the weakest region in the HAZ, the cleavage
   secondary microcracks in these two regions were observed respectively.
   Initiation and propagation of cleavage microcracks were discussed. The
   results show that the fracture behavior is obviously influenced by local
   microstructure. There are more secondary microcracks in the ICCGHAZ than
   in the CGHAZ which shows different probability for microcrack
   nucleation. Fracture mechanism changes from nucleation control in the
   CGHAZ to propagation control in the ICCGHAZ. The main reason for the
   increased possibility of secondary microcracks formation and the change
   in fracture mechanism is due to the formation of coarse necklacing
   martensite-austenite constituent in the ICCGHAZ. The results also show
   that high angle boundary, with the misorientation larger than 45
   degrees, is effective in deflecting or arresting brittle cracks, while
   low angle boundary (15 degrees-45 degrees) seems not. Most preferred
   crack planes are \{100\}, with decreasing probability of \{110\},
   \{112\}, \{123\}.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Large strain behavior of FCC polycrystals during reversed torsion are
   investigated through the special purpose finite element based on the
   classical Taylor model and the elastic-viscoplastic self-consistent
   (EVPSC) model with various Self-Consistent Schemes (SCSs). It is found
   that the response of both the fixed-end and free-end torsion is very
   sensitive to the constitutive models. The models are assessed through
   comparing their predictions to the corresponding experiments in terms of
   the stress and strain curves, the Swift effect and texture evolution. It
   is demonstrated that none of the models examined can precisely predict
   all the experimental results. However, more careful observation reveals
   that, among the models considered, the tangent model gives the worst
   overall performance. It is also demonstrated that the intensity of
   residual texture during reverse twisting is dependent on the amounts of
   pre-shear strain during forward twisting and the model used.}},

Abstract = {{We studied a simplified digital back propagation (DBP) scheme by

   analytical expression for calculating the correlation coefficients is

   nonlinear distortion due to phase-dependent terms in the perturbative
   expansion are ignored which enhances the computational efficiency. The
   performance of the correlated DBP is evaluated by simulating a
   single-channel single-polarization fiber-optic system operating at 28
   Gbaud, 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (32-QAM), and 40 x 80 km
   transmission distance. As compared to standard DBP, correlated DBP
   reduces the total number of propagation steps by a factor of 10 without
   performance penalty. Correlated DBP with only 2 steps per link provides
   about one dB improvement in Q-factor over linear compensation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Introduction: Thorough understanding of fluid dynamics in root canal
   irrigation and corresponding antibiofilm capacity will support improved
   disinfection strategies. This study aimed to develop a standardized,
   simulated root canal model that allows real-time analysis of
   fluid/irrigation dynamics and its correlation with biofilm elimination.
   Methods: A maxillary incisor with an instrumented root canal was imaged
   with micro computed tomography. The canal volume was reconstructed in 3
   dimensions and replicated in soft lithography-based models
   microfabricated from polyethylene glycol modified polydimethylsiloxane.
   Canals were irrigated by using a syringe (SI) and 2 ultrasonic-assisted
   methods, intermittent (IUAI) and continuous (CUAI). Real-time fluid
   movement within the apical 3 mm of canals was imaged by using
   microparticle image velocimetry. In similar models, canals were
   inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis to grow 3-week-old biofilms.
   Biofilm reduction by irrigation with SI, CUAI, and IUAI was assessed by
   using a crystal violet assay and compared with an untreated control.
   Results: SI generated higher velocity and shear stress in the apical 1-2
   mm than 0-1 and 2-3 mm. IUAI generated consistently low shear stress in
   the apical 3 mm. CUAI generated consistently high levels of velocity and
   shear stress; it was the highest of the groups in the apical 0-1 and 2-3
   mm. Biofilm was significantly reduced compared with the control only by
   CUAI (two-sample permutation test, P = .005). Conclusions: CUAI
   exhibited the highest mechanical effects of fluid flow in the apical 3
   mm, which correlated with significant biofilm reduction. The soft
   lithography-based models provided a novel model/method for study of
   correlations between fluid dynamics and the antibiofilm capacity of root
   canal irrigation methods.}},

   systems is valuable for product design and process optimization. This
   information may be obtained through the combination of modeling and
   experimental studies. In this review, published studies on kinetic and
   stochastic based modeling for CRP systems are summarized. Their
   relevance in model discrimination of proposed mechanisms is discussed.
   This review also includes various parameter estimation studies, that is
   crucial to obtain accurate simulation predictions. Existing issues on
   the fundamental mechanism in CRP processes are also addressed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel tissue stabilization device for magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI)-guided breast biopsy. The device is comprised of
   two pneumatically actuated support plates that would stabilize the
   biopsy target movements during needle insertion. An optimized geometry
   for the support plates allows for a good degree of tissue stabilization
   without relying on large compression forces. The plate configuration can
   also be adjusted inside the magnet bore using pneumatic actuators driven
   by pressure-controlled valves that are placed in the MRI control room.
   This capability allows for the compensation of the target displacement
   based on MRI image feedback. When combined with a separate needle drive
   mechanism, this stabilization device would enable in-bore MRI-guided
   breast biopsy. Experiments performed on chicken breast tissue with a
   prototype of the device demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism
   in increasing needle targeting accuracy using two simple error
   correction strategies. Furthermore, MRI compatibility tests are carried
   out to assess the performance of the device inside MRI.}},

Abstract = {{There have been no studies to investigate the effects of cycling
   exercise protocols, as well as repeated bouts of exercise, on the blood
   oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in the quadriceps muscles. This
   study characterized BOLD signal recovery following non-ischemic bouts of
   exercise in the quadriceps muscles of healthy adults in order to provide
   a basis for application of a protocol for clinical populations.
   Healthy male subjects (23.7 +/- A 2.0 years of age, n = 10) completed
   three cycles of one-minute exercise (65 \% of maximum workload), with
   two minutes of rest between each bout, on an MRI-compatible ergometer.
   The BOLD responses during recovery were fitted to a sigmoid model, and
   response kinetics (post-exercise intensity {[}S-0]), response time
   (alpha), change in baseline BOLD signal (kappa), and inflection point
   (beta)] were measured.
   The sigmoid function fit well to the post-exercise BOLD data (r (2) =
   0.95 +/- A 0.04). The mean response time was 10.5 +/- A 3.8 seconds,
   change in baseline BOLD intensity was 0.15 +/- A 0.068, and time to
   half-peak was 20.2 +/- A 8.6 seconds.
   The proposed sigmoid model is a robust method for quantifying quadriceps
   BOLD response post-exercise without induced ischemia. Extension of this
   model to evaluate microvascular responses in patients with chronic
   disease could improve our understanding of exercise intolerance.}},

Abstract = {{The object was to assess whether cross-sectional area (CSA) and water
   diffusion properties of leg muscles in young and older women change with
   increased time spent in supine rest.
   Healthy young (n = 9, aged 20-30 years) and older (n = 9, aged 65-75
   years) women underwent MRI scanning of the right leg at baseline, 30 and
   60 min of supine rest. Muscle CSA was derived from proton density
   images. Water diffusion properties {[}apparent diffusion coefficient
   (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA)] of the tibialis anterior and
   posterior, soleus, and medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius
   were derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Repeated measures
   ANOVAs and Bonferroni post hoc tests determined the effects of time and
   group on each muscle outcome.
   In both groups, muscle CSA and FA did not significantly change over
   time, whereas ADC significantly decreased. A greater decline at 30 min
   for young women was only observed for ADC in the medial gastrocnemius.
   Regardless of age, ADC values decreased with fluid shift associated with
   time spent supine, whereas CSA and FA were not affected. For leg muscle
   assessment in young and older women, DTI scanning protocols should
   consider the amount of time spent in a recumbent position.}},

Title = {{Overview of the current issues in austenite to ferrite transformation
   and the role of migrating interfaces therein for low alloyed steels}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING R-REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{1-38}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Solid state phase transformations in metals, and more precisely the
   science of transformation interfaces, is a key point to understand the
   formation of nano/microstructure, and thus, as a result, many physical
   properties such as mechanical properties, conductivity, thermoelectric
   and magnetic properties of materials.
   Steels are by far the most widely used metallic alloys, and a deep
   understanding of their microstructure is essential to tailor their
   service properties. The transformation of high temperature parent
   austenite to ferrite is one of the main issues controlling the final
   microstructures, and for more than a century, this has driven
   metallurgists to investigate in detail this solid state transformation,
   and, particularly, the details of austenite to ferrite interface
   migration.
   In this paper, we review the evolution of the different concepts and
   experiments developed in the last century to investigate this
   transformation mechanism.
   After a brief introduction, most of the physical models developed, which
   reduce the alpha/gamma interface into a mathematical body with its own
   properties, are reviewed and discussed with regard to experimental data.
   The increased availability of highly sophisticated experimental and
   modelling tools in recent decades has considerably clarified the
   perceptions of transformation interfaces. These recent advances are
   presented, and their contribution to the field of migrating
   austenite-ferrite interfaces are highlighted in a third section. In the
   fourth section, the latest developments in experimental methods, which
   now allow the quasi atomistic direct characterization of the interface
   chemistry, are presented. The observed conditions at the interfaces can
   be compared with model predictions, which is believed to be a critical
   step for the refinement of the theoretical concepts guiding the
   understanding of the interface migration. Finally, in the concluding
   section, the present situation of the field is summarized, and some
   perspectives regarding the expected future developments are sketched.

Abstract = {{With continued steep growth in the volume of data transmitted over
   optical networks there is a widely recognized need for more
   sophisticated photonics technologies to forestall a `capacity

   wavelengths near 2 mu m and to exploit the long-wavelength transmission
   and amplification capabilities of hollow-core photonic-bandgap
   fibres(2,3) and the recently available thulium-doped fibre
   amplifiers(4). To date, photodetector devices for this window have
   largely relied on III-V materials(5) or, where the benefits of
   integration with silicon photonics are sought, GeSn alloys, which have
   been demonstrated thus far with only limited utility(6-9). Here, we
   describe a silicon photodiode operating at 20 Gbit s(-1) in this
   wavelength region. The detector is compatible with standard silicon
   processing and is integrated directly with silicon-on-insulator
   waveguides, which suggests future utility in silicon-based mid-infrared

Abstract = {{Background Safe and effective vaccines could help to end the ongoing
   Ebola virus disease epidemic in parts of west Africa, and mitigate
   future outbreaks of the virus. We assess the statistical validity and
   power of randomised controlled trial (RCT) and stepped-wedge cluster
   trial (SWCT) designs in Sierra Leone, where the incidence of Ebola virus
   disease is spatiotemporally heterogeneous, and is decreasing rapidly.
   Methods We projected district-level Ebola virus disease incidence for
   the next 6 months, using a stochastic model fitted to data from Sierra
   Leone. We then simulated RCT and SWCT designs in trial populations
   comprising geographically distinct clusters at high risk, taking into
   account realistic logistical constraints, and both individual-level and
   cluster-level variations in risk. We assessed false-positive rates and
   power for parametric and non-parametric analyses of simulated trial
   data, across a range of vaccine efficacies and trial start dates.
   Findings For an SWCT, regional variation in Ebola virus disease
   incidence trends produced increased false-positive rates (up to 0.15 at
   alpha=0.05) under standard statistical models, but not when analysed by
   a permutation test, whereas analyses of RCTs remained statistically
   valid under all models. With the assumption of a 6-month trial starting
   on Feb 18, 2015, we estimate the power to detect a 90\% effective
   vaccine to be between 49\% and 89\% for an RCT, and between 6\% and 26\%
   for an SWCT, depending on the Ebola virus disease incidence within the
   trial population. We estimate that a 1-month delay in trial initiation
   will reduce the power of the RCT by 20\% and that of the SWCT by 49\%.
   Interpretation Spatiotemporal variation in infection risk undermines the
   statistical power of the SWCT. This variation also undercuts the SWCT's
   expected ethical advantages over the RCT, because an RCT, but not an
   SWCT, can prioritise vaccination of high-risk clusters.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo demonstrate the mapping of structures with high susceptibility
   values, such as the sinuses, bones and teeth, using short echo times.
   MethodsFour in vivo datasets were collected with a gradient-echo
   sequence (TE1=2.5 ms, TE2=5 ms and TE3=7.5 ms). Complex division was
   performed to remove the phase offset term and generate the phase at
   TE=2.5 ms. Susceptibility maps were generated from unwrapped phase
   images, using a geometry-constrained iterative algorithm, by preserving
   phase information in the extracerebral tissues. The susceptibility
   results were improved by updating the missing phase information inside
   structures with no signal using the predicted phase at each iteration
   step. Simulated phase images of a three-dimensional brain model and
   tooth phantom were used to validate the proposed method.
   ResultsImproved susceptibility maps were obtained once the phase
   information in the extracerebral tissue region was incorporated, for
   both the model and in vivo data. For in vivo data, the average
   susceptibilities of air (sphenoid sinus), bone and calcium (teeth) were
   found to be (in ppm): ((sinus-tissue))=+9.21.3, ((bone-tissue))=-2.1 +/-
   0.6 and ((teeth-tissue))=-3.3 +/- 1.2, respectively.
   ConclusionHigh susceptibility structures with little or no signal can be
   imaged using quantitative susceptibility mapping and can be used to
   improve background field removal. Magn Reson Med 73:2185-2194, 2015. (c)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The compression and bending modulus of elastomeric bearings, commonly
   applied as vibration isolators, are important design considerations.
   Analytical solutions have demonstrated that the sensitivity to the
   compressibility of the elastomer can be significant and begins at
   relatively low shape factors. These analytical solutions, which include
   the effects of compressibility on the compression and bending modulus,
   are often complex and not suitable for design purposes. Alternatively,
   an ad hoc approximation has been recommended that expresses the
   compression and bending modulus, including the compressibility of the
   elastomer, by assuming incompressibility and correcting with the bulk
   modulus. It is demonstrated that the ad hoc approximation provides an
   unconservatively large value of the compression and bending modulus for
   infinite strip, square, circular, and annular pad geometries. A
   correction factor to the ad hoc approximation is determined by expanding
   and simplifying the analytical solutions. The proposed approximations
   typically reduce the magnitude of the error while also providing a
   conservatively lower estimate of the compression and bending modulus.

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Turbocharger and negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy are widely used
   among advanced combustion modes for internal combustion engines. In
   order to achieve well emission performance, the NVO can be as large as
   100 crank angle (CA) degrees, such that the residual gas fraction can be
   up to 40\%. With such amount of residual gas in the cylinder, the
   trapped unburned fuel is not trivial. It has a significant impact on the
   combustion process. However, the trapped unburned fuel mass is hard to
   be measured directly. In this paper, a novel method based on the signals
   of oxygen fraction is proposed to estimate it. By analyzing the
   combustion process, dynamic equations for the intake/exhaust manifolds
   and in-cylinder oxygen fractions, as well as actual fuel mass in the
   cylinder are constructed. A smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) was
   designed to estimate oxygen fractions and further the trapped unburned
   fuel. As a comparison, Kalman filter (KF) and linear matrix inequality
   (LMI) based linear parameter-varying (LPV) filter were also applied.
   Robustness properties of the three observers are analyzed based on the
   theory of input-to-state (ISS) stability. The proposed models and
   methods and theoretical analysis are validated and compared through a
   set of simulations in high-fidelity GT-Power environment. The simulation
   results match well with theoretical analysis that the SVSF has good
   properties of strong robustness (with a root mean square error (RMSE) of
   0.24, comparing with 0.4 of LPV filter and 0.49 of KF, for the unburned
   fuel estimation).}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on the identification of
   transitions in growth modes during the diffusional decomposition of
   austenite to ferrite in Fe-C-X alloys. Of particular interest are
   transitions between the extremes of non-partitioned growth represented
   by the ParaEquilibrium (PE) and local equilibrium negligible partition
   limits. Identification of such transitions requires high-quality
   measurements of ferrite growth kinetics, and recent uses of the
   decarburization approach have allowed access to very high-precision
   growth kinetic measurements. However, one of the limitations of the
   decarburization approach is that the lower limit of its applicability is
   the eutectoid temperature and this has so far compromised its usefulness
   to probe the temperature dependence of kinetic transitions. In this
   contribution, analogous denitriding studies have been performed that
   allow access to much lower temperatures than are possible using
   decarburization. It is shown that the kinetics of ferrite growth in the
   Fe-N-Mn system become closer to the PE limit as the temperature is
   lowered. The growth kinetic data are interpreted quantitatively in the
   framework of the Zurob et al. model that includes diffusional
   dissipation due to Mn diffusion across the migrating interface.
   Furthermore, comparisons are made between decarburization and
   denitriding in Fe-Mn alloys of the same Mn content at the same
   temperature. The interface velocities are much faster under denitriding
   conditions, and this allows inferences to be made about the effect of
   the interface velocity on dissipation and contact conditions. It is also
   suggested that the binding energy of Mn to the migrating interface may
   be slightly higher in the Fe-C-Mn system than in the Fe-N-Mn system, and
   it is speculated that this is due to the strong segregation of C to the
   interface and the associated co-segregation of Mn.}},

Abstract = {{Hypo-d(f)-oxides of transition elements (d = 5) usually feature decisive
   and highly pronounced effects of spontaneous adsorptive dissociation of
   water molecules, as the main and initial thermodynamic precondition
   state for the reversible latent storage and spillover properties of
   primary oxides (Pt-OH, Au-OH), otherwise indispensable ingredients in
   electrocatalysis for the oxygen electrode reactions. The higher the
   altervalent number (or capacity) of the former, and when mostly further
   advanced for the proper mixed valence hypo-d(f)-oxide supports, the
   higher the overall (electro)catalytic yields primarily for cathodic
   oxygen reduction (ORR) and its anodic evolution (OER). In fact, cyclic
   voltammetry revealed the interrelated redox properties of the primary
   (Pt-OH) and surface (Pt=O) oxides between the cathodic hydrogen and
   anodic oxygen evolving limits, though the former has already been for
   longer known as the intermediate state from hydrogen oxidation in
   heterogeneous Doeberriner reaction upon Pt catalyst, and as being water
   molecules self-catalyzed (Ertel). Such interfering interrelated and
   autocatalytic species substantially define electrocatalytic properties
   of plain (Pt) or noninteractive supported noble metals (Pt/C), along the
   potential axis, and within some range even make them highly polarizable.
   Meanwhile, the latter can be continuously and successfully
   electrocatalytically depolarized and maintained reactivated. Such
   spontaneously renewable activation and maintenance of the reversible
   electrocatalytic state for the oxygen electrode reactions all along such
   cyclic voltammograms is the main Sir William Grove target challenge of
   the present study. In such a respect, continuously and spontaneously
   renewable adsorptive water molecule dissociation effectively means and
   enables the latent storage and electrocatalytic spillover properties of
   the primary oxide(s) for the reversible oxygen electrode (ROE) behavior,
   and these have been identified and substantiated, back and forth, all
   along the potential axis between hydrogen and oxygen evolving limits.
   Such advanced electrocatalytic properties imply selective grafting of
   interactive (SMSI, strong metalsupport interaction) nanostructured
   hyper-d-Pt (Au, RuPt) clusters upon individual and/or preferably
   composite mixed valence hypo-d-(f)-oxide supports. The latter then
   feature the extra high stability, pronounced electronic conductivity,
   and many other d-electronic-based metal properties mostly arising and
   being established upon the hypo-hyper-d-d-(f)-interelectronic bonding
   effect, along with and based upon spontaneous dissociative water
   molecule adsorption upon exposed oxide support surfaces, thereby
   yielding renewable primary oxide latent storage by simple continuous
   water vapor supply and imposed characteristic membrane type hydroxide
   ion surface migration. Migrating hydroxide, as individual species, under
   imposed polarization transfers its prevailing part of electron to the
   metallic electrocatalyst, hence resulting as the Pt-OH (Au-OH) dipole,
   and by the surface repulsion obeys reversible spillover distribution and
   imposes the electrocatalytic ROE properties all over the catalyst
   surface and DL pseudocapacitance charging and discharging, as well.
   The strong adsorptive surface oxide (Pt-O -> 1) deposition out of the
   primary oxide (Pt-OH -> 0) irreversible disproportionation thereby
   imposes unusually high reaction polarization of Pt, Au, Pd, and all
   other noble and transition d-metals within a very broad (600 mV, and
   even broader) potential range and, thereby, in general, mostly
   pronounced polarizable noncatalytic properties for oxygen electrode
   (ORR, OER) reactions. Thus, the strong interactive and selective
   hypohyper-dd-interelectronic grafting bonding of nanostructured
   individual (Pt) or prevailing hyper-d-intermetallic phase (MoPt3; HfPd3)
   cluster catalysts on altervalent and mixed-valence hypo-d(f)-oxide
   supports, as substantially and typically based upon the metallic d-d- or
   d-f-interelectronic bonding strengths and SMSI features, provide and
   keep just inferred basically all (inter)metallic properties of composite
   electrocatalysts, the primary oxide latent storage, and enhanced
   spillover and thereby enable approaching their reversible
   (electro)catalytic properties and optimization for the ROE. The
   reversibly revertible alterpolar bronze behaves (Pt/HxNbO5 <->
   Pt/Nb(OH)(5), x approximate to 0.3) as the thermodynamic equilibrium
   alterpolar state, and thereby substantially advanced electrocatalytic
   properties of these composite interactive electrocatalysts for both
   oxygen (ORR, OER) and hydrogen (HOR, HER) electrode reactions,
   consequently, have been inferred as spontaneously altering and strong
   spillover features, in particular unique and superior for the revertible
   (PEMFC versus WE (water electrolysis)) cells.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the formation of crosslinked 10-200-nm-thick
   polymer hydrogel films by alternating the spin-coating of two mutually
   reactive polymers from organic solutions, followed by hydrolysis of the
   resulting multilayer film in aqueous buffer. Poly(methyl vinyl
   ether-alt-maleic anhydride) (PMM) was deposited from acetonitrile
   solution, and
   poly(N-3-aminopropylmethacrylamide-co-N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide)
   (PAPM(x), where x corresponds to the 3-aminopropylmethacrylamide content
   ranging from 10 to 100\%) was deposited from methanol. Multilayer films
   were formed in up to 20 deposition cycles. The films cross-linked during
   formation by reaction between the amine groups of PAPMx and the
   anhydride groups of PMM. The resulting multilayer films were covalently
   postfunctionalized by exposure to fluoresceinamine, decylamine,
   D-glucamine, or fluorescently labeled PAPM(x) solutions prior to the
   hydrolysis of residual anhydride in aqueous PBS buffer. This allowed
   tuning the hydrophobicity of the film to give static water contact
   angles ranging from about 5 to 90 degrees. Increasing the APM content in
   PAPM(x) from 10 to 100\% led to apparent Young's moduli from 300 to 700
   kPa while retaining sufficient anhydride groups to allow
   postfunctionalization of the films. This allowed the resulting
   (PMM/PAPM(x)) multilayer films to be turned into adhesion-promoting or
   antifouling surfaces for C2C12 mouse myoblasts and MCF 10A premalignant
   human mammary epithelial cells.}},

Abstract = {{A novel semicontinuous system for the separation of quaternary liquid
   mixtures is presented in this work. This semicontinuous system is a
   process intensification technique that uses one distillation column and
   two integrated middle vessels to achieve a separation which would
   traditionally be carried out using three continuous distillation
   columns. The system is a theoretical extension of the conventional
   ternary semicontinuous process, which has been repeatedly demonstrated
   to be profitable at intermediate flow rates when compared to continuous
   systems. Dynamic simulation results are used to demonstrate feasibility
   and performance of the system for three examples: a mixture of n-hexane,
   n-heptane, n-octane, and n-nonane, a mixture of benzene, toluene,
   ethyl-benzene, and o-xylene, and a mixture of six alcohols and water.
   The results show that this new technique can achieve separation
   objectives while staying within safe operating limits. The
   semicontinuous system for the first example is compared to a
   conventional continuous system and is shown to be more profitable for
   low to intermediate production rates.}},

   structure during annealing and deuterium absorption}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{Nanolayered composites based on Fe and Mg serve as insightful model
   systems for understanding a wide range of hydrogen storage materials. We
   examined the stability of the multilayered thin-film structure Si
   (substrate)/Ta/Mg/Fe/Ta/Pd after deuterium absorption and desorption and
   after annealing the specimen at 250 degrees C. We employed two
   complementary techniques for analysis: neutron reflectometry and
   analytical transmission electron microscopy. The neutron reflectometry
   provides evidence that interdiffusion is significant at 250 degrees C,
   but with the film general structure still in place. In contrast, after
   deuterium absorption and desorption at the same temperature, the changes
   of the film structure are more severe, such that the Mg/Fe/Ta/Pd layers
   appear to be fully intermixed, with only the bottom Ta layer remaining
   intact. Electron microscopy observations indicate that annealing at 250
   degrees C has caused a phase transformation to form Mg5Pd2 at the upper
   sections of the Mg layer, with the general periodicity of the sample
   still maintained, in accordance with the reflectometry measurements. In
   the desorbed state, the layers show substantial variations in local
   thicknesses, with thicker regions containing a range of Mg-Pd compounds
   and the thinner portions remaining primarily Mg. This degradation
   sequence occurs despite the Fe layer remaining chemically unchanged. We
   provide a mechanistic description regarding the observed evolution of
   the multilayered structure during annealing and deuterium cycling. (C)

Abstract = {{We report here the microstructural changes occurring in the zirconium
   alloy Excel (Zr-3.5 wt\% Sn-0.8Nb-0.8Mo-0.2Fe) during heavy ion
   irradiation. In situ irradiation experiments were conducted at reactor
   operating temperatures on two Zr Excel alloy microstructures with
   different states of alloying elements, with the states achieved by
   different solution heat treatments. In the first case, the alloying
   elements were mostly concentrated in the beta (beta) phase, whereas, in
   the second case, large Zr-3(Mo,Nb,Fe)(4) secondary phase precipitates
   (SPPs) were grown in the alpha (alpha) phase by long term aging. The
   heavy ion induced damage and resultant compositional changes were
   examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination
   with scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)-energy dispersive
   x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. Significant differences were seen in
   microstructural evolution between the two different microstructures that
   were irradiated under similar conditions. Nucleation and growth of < c
   >-component loops and their dependence on the alloying elements are a
   major focus of the current investigation. It was observed that the < c
   >-component loops nucleate readily at 100, 300, and 400 degrees C after
   a threshold incubation dose (TID), which varies with irradiation
   temperature and the state of alloying elements. It was found that the
   TID for the formation of < c >-component loops increases with decrease
   in irradiation temperature. Alloying elements that are present in the
   form of SPPs increase the TID compared to when they are in the beta
   phase solid solution. Dose and temperature dependence of loop size and
   density are presented. Radiation induced redistribution and clustering
   of alloying elements (Sn, Mo, and Fe) have been observed and related to
   the formation of < c >-component loops. It has been shown that at the
   higher temperature tests, irradiation induced dissolution of
   precipitates occurs whereas irradiation induced amorphization occurs at
   100 degrees C. Furthermore, dose and temperature seem to be the main
   factors governing the dissolution of SPPs and redistribution of alloying
   elements, which in turn controls the nucleation and growth of < c
   >-component loops. The correlation between the microstructural evolution
   and microchemistry has been found by EDS and is discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Certain compositions of polymer blends remain mixed in the glassy state,
   and demix on heating and may demix or otherwise change on physical
   aging. To investigate these effects, we studied the loss of enthalpy and
   entropy of a 20\% polystyrene-80\% poly(alpha-methylstyrene) blend: (i)
   after aging it for varying periods at a fixed temperature,,(ii) after
   aging it for a fixed period at various temperatures and (iii) after
   vitrifying it at two different cooling rates prior to the physical
   aging. The results have been analysed by: (a) fitting the TNM model for
   a non-exponential, non-linear relaxation, and (b) by determining the
   enthalpy and entropy loss on aging. A single set of TNM model-fit
   parameters did not fit the data obtained for different cooling rates,
   and for the physically aged blend, and for some conditions a sub-T-g
   feature known from previous studies of pure polymers appeared. The
   enthalpy and entropy on physical aging are found to decrease
   non-exponentially, but the exponent, beta(age), and the characteristic
   time, tau(a) (i.e., reciprocal of the rate constant of aging-kinetics),
   differ from the beta(cal) and tau(o) determined by fitting the TNM model
   to the data. This indicates that either tau(a) itself is time-dependent
   during the relaxation, and/or beta(age) varies with the temperature.
   Since the characteristic time of the alpha-relaxation process and its
   non-exponential parameter refer to density and structure fluctuations in
   a state of fixed volume and energy, these two are neither expected to be
   the same as the characteristic time and the parameter observed for
   aging, nor are they found to be the same. We also discuss the change in
   the fictive temperature for different aging conditions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate an ultrabroad terahertz (THz) bandpass filter

   (HMM) waveguides, each of which has wide but different absorption and
   transmission bands, into a unit cell. With proper structural design of
   each HMM waveguide to control the absorption and transmission bands, we
   numerically demonstrate the designed BPF is capable of operating with a
   broad passband in the THz domain. A typical TM-polarized HMM BPF has a
   peak transmission of 37\% at 3.3 THz with the passband bandwidth of 2.2
   THz ranging from 2.97 to 5.17 THz. The co-designed three-dimensional HMM
   BPF also shows the capability of operating with independence to the
   polarization of incident light because of the structural symmetry and
   has sharp bandedge transitions of 22.6 and 17.6 dB/THz to the stop
   bands, respectively. The presented results here hold great promise for
   developing practical THz BPF with various applications in THz field.

   carefully validate a spectrally-accurate computational approach which
   ensures the correct behavior of the solution at infinity. In the
   proposed method the numerical solution is defined on the entire
   unbounded domain without the need to truncate this domain to a finite
   box with some artificial boundary conditions prescribed at its
   boundaries. Since our approach relies on the streamfunction vorticity
   formulation, the main complication is the presence of a discontinuity in
   the streamfunction field at infinity which is related to the slow decay
   of this field. We demonstrate how this difficulty can be overcome by
   reformulating the problem using a suitable background ``skeleton{''}
   field expressed in terms of the corresponding Oseen flow combined with
   spectral filtering. The method is thoroughly validated for Reynolds
   numbers spanning two orders of magnitude with the results comparing
   favorably against known theoretical predictions and the data available
   in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Osseointegration is controlled by a number of cellular mechanisms.
   Although factors governing bone formation are well understood, the
   maintenance of bone at the bone-implant interface is less clear. Of some
   interest is the role of osteocytes, which via mechanotransduction are
   believed to be responsible for mechanical loading-based remodelling
   events in bone. Using a resin cast etching technique, we investigated
   the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network adjacent to nanostructured
   titanium human dental implants after four years in clinical function.
   Correlative electron microscopy showed nanoscale osteocyte processes
   extending directly onto the implant surface. Calcium signal mapping via
   electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) showed apatite ingrowth into
   the nanotextured surface, while the apatite platelet c-axis was oriented
   approximately parallel to the collagen fibril direction. Furthermore,
   Z-contrast electron tomography demonstrated that natural bone-osteocyte
   and engineered bone-implant interfaces are similar in ultrastructural
   morphology. The present ultrastructural observation of multiple
   connections between osteocyte canaliculi and the nanotextured surface
   oxide suggests that osteocytes contribute toward the maintenance of
   osseointegration in long-term clinical function.}},

Abstract = {{The classic dynamic clamp technique uses a real-time electrical
   interface between living cells and neural simulations in order to
   investigate hypotheses about neural function and structure. One of the
   acknowledged drawbacks of that technique is the limited control of the
   cells' chemical microenvironment. In this manuscript, we use a novel
   combination of nanosensor and microfluidic technology and microfluidic
   and neural simulations to add sensing and control of chemical
   concentrations to the dynamic clamp technique. Specifically, we use a
   microfluidic lab-on-a-chip to generate distinct chemical concentration
   gradients (ions or neuromodulators), to register the concentrations with
   embedded nanosensors and use the processed signals as an input to
   simulations of a neural cell. The ultimate goal of this project is to
   close the loop and provide sensor signals to the microfluidic
   lab-on-a-chip to mimic the interaction of the simulated cell with other
   cells in its chemical environment.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for radio frequency (RF) transceivers operating at 2.4 GHz
   band has attracted considerable research interest due to the advancement
   in short range wireless technologies. The performance of RF transceivers
   depends heavily on the transmitter and receiver front-ends. The receiver
   front-end is comprised of a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a
   downconversion mixer. There are very few designs that focus on
   connecting the single-ended output LNA to a double-balanced mixer
   without the use of on-chip transformer, also known as a balun. The
   objective of designing such a receiver front-end is to achieve high
   integration and low power consumption. To meet these requirements, we
   present the design of fully-integrated 2.4 GHz receiver front-end,
   consisting of a narrow-band LNA and a double balanced mixer without
   using a balun. Here, the single-ended RF output signal of the LNA is
   translated into differential signal using an NMOS-PMOS (n-channel
   metal-oxide-semiconductor, p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor)
   transistor differential pair instead of the conventional NMOS-NMOS
   transistor configuration, for the RF amplification stage of the
   double-balanced mixer. The proposed receiver circuit fabricated using
   TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology operates at 2.4 GHz and produces an
   output signal at 300 MHz. The fabricated receiver achieves a gain of
   16.3 dB and consumes only 6.74 mW operating at 1.5 V, while utilizing
   2.08 mm(2) of chip area. Measurement results demonstrate the
   effectiveness and suitability of the proposed receiver for short-range
   wireless applications, such as in wireless sensor network (WSN).}},

Abstract = {{In high-conversion atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), all the
   reactions, such as radical termination, radical deactivation, dormant
   chain activation, monomer propagation, etc. could become diffusion
   controlled sooner or later, depending on relative diffusivities of the
   involved reacting species. These diffusion-controlled reactions directly
   affect the rate of polymerization and the control of polymer molecular
   weight. A model is developed to investigate the influence of
   diffusion-controlled reactions on the high conversion ATRP kinetics.
   Model simulation reveals that diffusion-controlled termination slightly
   increases the rate, but it is the diffusion-controlled deactivation that
   causes auto-acceleration in the rate (gel effect) and loss of control.
   At high conversions, radical chains are trapped because of high
   molecular weight. However, radical centers can still migrate through (1)
   radical deactivation-activation cycles and (2) monomer propagation,
   which introduce residual termination reactions. It is found that the
   residual termination does not have much influence on the polymerization
   kinetics. The migration of radical centers through propagation can
   however facilitate catalytic deactivation of radicals, which improves
   the control of polymer molecular weight to some extent. Dormant chain
   activation and monomer propagation also become diffusion controlled and
   finally stop the polymerization when the system approaches its glass
   state.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for an active protection system with two or more passive
   infrared sensors based on the principle of triangulation and an extended
   measurement vector consisting of time-to-go (TTG) estimation is proposed
   to address high-speed short-range threats. The proposed algorithm
   exploits the full potential of passive sensors enabling the use of
   target irradiance in a manner to estimate the TTG along with angle
   information. The approach here uses target irradiance measured at
   successive scans to initialize a fixed interval iteration scheme for
   estimating the TTG. The Newton's method is used for estimating the TTG,
   the estimate is then added to the measurement vector and position
   estimation is performed using an extended Kalman filter. Computer
   simulations demonstrate the resulting improvement in estimation and
   feasibility for real-time application of the proposed algorithm. (C) The

Abstract = {{A supported immobilized lipase was investigated as a suitable
   biocatalyst for the transesterification of triolein to methyl oleate in
   a packed bed reactor (PBR). The packing material for the bioreactor was
   comprised of lipase immobilized in sol gel and supported on Celite
   (CSG). A kinetic- and mass transfer-based model was developed,
   incorporating a novel efficiency correlation to account for the effect
   of glycerol on the immobilized enzyme. Comparing the CSG PBR performance
   to that using a commercial lipase preparation (Novozym 435 (N435)),
   higher product conversion was achievable using CSG over a shorter time
   period, indicating the superior performance of CSG for enzymatic
   transesterification. A rate equation accounting for alcohol inhibition
   was used to compare the kinetics of the CSG and N435 PBRs. It was found
   that CSG exhibited a higher maximum reaction rate and was less prone to
   inhibition by methanol relative to N435. The resulting model showed good
   agreement with the experimental data, and CSG exhibited good stability
   without loss of activity over a five day period. This biocatalyst shows
   significant potential for the efficient production of biodiesel, and the
   mechanistic model developed has broader applications for similar enzyme
   and reaction systems.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of water-soluble polymers on the properties of Pickering
   emulsions stabilized by cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) was investigated.
   Pretreatment of CNCs with excess adsorbing polymer, hydroxyethyl
   cellulose (HEC) or methyl cellulose (MC), gave smaller and more stable
   dodecane-in-water emulsion droplets compared to either polymer or CNCs
   alone, i.e., synergistic stabilization. By contrast, dextran, which does
   not adsorb on CNCs, gave unstable emulsions, with or without CNCs. CNCs
   with HEC or MC produced emulsions that showed no significant creaming or
   phase separation over several months. Interfacial tension, quartz
   crystal microbalance and confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements
   indicate that both HEC and MC are surface active and adsorb onto CNCs.
   75\% of the oil-water interface is covered by CNC particles coated with
   HEC or MC and the remaining interface is stabilized by HEC or MC chains
   not bound to cellulose. Viscoelastic emulsion gels were also produced by
   adding excess MC to the CNC-HEC emulsions and heating above 70 degrees
   C. The thermogelation was reversible, and multiple cycles of
   heating/cooling did not lead to coalescence of the emulsion. This work
   points to broad application of CNCs with water-soluble polymers as
   promising green emulsion stabilizers for food, pharmaceutical, and
   cosmetic products.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose low-complexity algorithms for downlink traffic
   scheduling in green vehicular roadside infrastructure. In multiple
   roadside unit (RSU) deployments, the energy provisioning of the RSUs may
   differ, and it is therefore desirable to balance RSU usage from a
   normalized min-max energy viewpoint. This paper considers both
   splittable RSU assignment (SRA) and unsplittable RSU asssignment (URA)
   scheduling. An offline integer linear programming bound is first derived
   for normalized min-max RSU energy usage. We then show that in the SRA
   case, there is a polynomial complexity 2-approximation bound for the
   normalized min-max energy schedule. This paper then proposes several
   online scheduling algorithms. The first is a greedy online algorithm
   that makes simple RSU selections, followed by minimum-energy time slot
   assignments. A normalized min-max algorithm is then proposed {[}
   2-approximation online algorithm (TOAA)], which is an online version of
   the 2-approximation bound. Two algorithms are then introduced based on a
   potential function scheduling approach. The 1-objective algorithm uses
   an objective based on normalized min-max energy, and we show that it has
   an upper bounded worst-case competitive ratio performance. The
   2-objective algorithm uses the same approach but incorporates a
   total-energy secondary objective as well. Results from a variety of
   experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithms perform well.
   In particular, we find that in the SRA case, the TOAA algorithm performs
   very close to the lower bound but at the expense of having to reassign
   time slots whenever a new vehicle arrives. In the URA case, our
   low-complexity 1-objective algorithm performs better than the others
   over a wide range of traffic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of increasing the robustness to bit
   errors for two description scalar quantizers. Our approach is to start
   with an m-diagonal index assignment and further apply a permutation to
   the indexes of each description to increase the minimum Hamming distance
   d(min) of the set of valid index pairs. In particular, we show how to
   construct linear permutation pairs achieving d(min) >= 3, and establish
   a lower bound in terms of the description rate R, for the highest value
   of m for which such permutations exist.
   For the case when one description is known to be correct, we propose a
   new performance measure, denoted by d(side, min). This represents the
   minimum Hamming distance of the set of indexes of one description, when
   the index of the other description is fixed. We prove the close
   connection between the problem of robust permutations design under the
   new criterion and the antibandwidth problem in a certain graph derived
   from a hypercube. Leveraging this connection, we settle the problem of
   existence of permutations achieving d(side, min) >= 2, respectively
   d(min) >= 2, and show their construction. Further, we develop a
   technique for constructing linear permutation pairs achieving d(side,
   min) >= h based on linear (R, inverted right perpendicularlog(2)
   minverted left perpendicular) channel codes of minimum Hamming distance
   h + 1. In addition, tight bounds in terms of R, on the maximum
   achievable value of d(side, min) are derived for m = 2, 3, 4.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares the performance of CVD coated tungsten-carbide tools
   having an intermediate Al2O3 layer to low content PCBN tools in hard
   turning of D2 tool steel (52 HRC). Results revealed that the coated
   carbide tool can outperform PCBN in machining the selected workpiece
   material within a certain range of cutting speeds (cutting temperature
   range). This is associated with tribo-film formation on the coated
   carbide tool surface. SEM and EDS were used to study the wear patterns
   of the used cutting tools. The tribo-films were investigated using the
   X-ray photoelectron method (XPS). The cutting temperature was measured
   using tool-workpiece thermocouple technique. The formation of the
   tribo-films was found to be highly-dependent on the cutting temperature
   and friction kinetics control at the tool-chip interface. Lubricious
   Cr-O tribo-films formed on the surface of the coated carbide tool,
   improving tool life at cutting speeds up to 100 m/min, which relates to
   an average tool-chip interface temperature up to 930 degrees C. Crown

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore changes in current source density locations after
   remifentanil infusion in healthy volunteers using source localization of
   the electroencephalography (EEG).
   Methods: EEG data was collected from 21 males using a 62-electrode
   system. Additionally, cognitive performance was evaluated by a
   continuous reaction time paradigm, and pain scores were obtained for
   experimental bone and heat stimuli. Data were recorded before and during
   treatment with remifentanil and placebo. Source localization was
   performed by sLORETA at delta (1-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.9 Hz), alpha (8-12
   Hz), beta1 (12.1-18 Hz), and beta2 (18.1-30 Hz) frequency bands.
   Results: Pre-treatment recordings demonstrated reproducible source
   characteristics. The alterations (i.e., pre-versus post-treatment) due
   to remifentanil were significantly and robustly different from placebo
   infusions. The results indicated that neurons in several brain areas
   including inferior frontal gyrus and insula at frontal lobe oscillated
   more strongly after remifentanil infusion compared to placebo.
   Furthermore, the source activity at delta band was correlated with
   continuous reaction time index.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that alterations in brain
   oscillations during remifentanil are mostly localized to frontal,
   fronto-temporal and fronto-central lobes and related to cognitive
   function. Significance: The approach offers the potential to be used for
   understanding the underlying mechanism of action of remifentanil on
   brain activity. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{Base isolation has been established as the seismic design approach of
   choice when it comes to protecting nonstructural contents. However,
   while this protection technology has been widely shown to reduce seismic
   demands on attached oscillatory equipment and contents (EC), its
   effectiveness in controlling the response of freestanding EC that are
   prone to sliding has not been investigated. This study examines the
   seismic behavior of sliding EC inside base-isolated buildings subjected
   to broadband ground motions. The effect of isolation system properties
   on the response of sliding EC with various friction coefficients is
   examined. Two widely used isolation models are considered: viscously
   damped linear elastic and bilinear. The study finds isolation to be
   generally effective in reducing seismic demands on sliding EC, but it
   also exposes certain situations where isolation in fact increases
   demands on EC, most notably for low friction coefficients and high
   earthquake intensities. Damping at the isolation level is effective in
   controlling the EC sliding displacements, although damping over about
   20\% is found to be superfluous. The study identifies a physically
   motivated dimensionless intensity measure and engineering demand
   parameter for sliding equipment in base-isolated buildings subjected to
   broadband ground motions. Finally, the paper presents easy-to-use design
   fragility curves and an example that illustrates how to use them.

Abstract = {{Urea-based selected catalytic reduction (SCR) systems are effective ways
   in diesel engine after-treatment systems to meet increasingly stringent
   emission regulations. To achieve high NOx reduction efficiency and low
   NH3 slip, the control of the SCR system becomes more challenging,
   especially in transient operating conditions with model uncertainties.
   To effectively address this issue, this paper proposed a compound
   control strategy with a switching mechanism between an active
   disturbance rejection (ADR) controller and a zero-input controller. The
   ADR controller estimates and rejects the total (internal and external)
   disturbances from the SCR system when the exhaust gas temperature is
   high and its variation is small. The zero-input controller is used to
   lower ammonia surface coverage ratio to avoid high ammonia slip when
   exhaust gas temperature suddenly rises. The proposed control strategy is
   validated through a high-fidelity GT-Power simulation for a light-duty
   diesel engine over steady states and federal test procedure (FTP-75)
   test cycle. Its effectiveness is demonstrated especially in rapidly
   transient conditions with model uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Cell adhesion to biomaterials can be mediated in part by mechanisms
   aside from the traditionally recognized opsinization and integrin
   binding mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the role of scavenger
   receptor A (SR-A) in leukocyte binding to a series of well-controlled
   polyanionic and uncharged hydrogels based on a
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) backbone. The hydrogels were injected in the
   peritoneal cavity of SR-A knockout (KO) and wild-type mice using a
   minimally invasive procedure and allowed to set in situ. After 24 h, the
   hydrogels were recovered and analyzed, the peritoneal cavity was
   lavaged, and cytokine concentrations were assessed by ELISA. The
   polyanionic hydrogels retrieved from the KO animals were found to be
   completely devoid of adherent leukocytes, which were present in other
   materials regardless of the mouse strain in which they were injected.
   Results from a subsequent in vitro cellular adhesion study with a
   RAW264.7 cell line failed to yield a similarly definitive role for SR-A
   in the cellular binding of a polyanionic hydrogel. Taken together, the
   results of this study show that SR-A mediates leukocyte adhesion to a
   polyanionic hydrogel in the peritoneal cavity, but other adhesion
   mechanisms contribute to cellular binding in vitro. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this study, we designed and demonstrated the effectiveness of an
   integrated waste treatment system for contaminated stormwater sludge.
   The system is comprised of two components: pulsed arc electrohydraulic
   discharge (PAED) for aqueous-phase treatment and thermal plasma
   decontamination for solid-phase treatment. PAED provided a reduction of
   80 \% in total organic carbon (TOC) within a treatment time of 5 min in
   the aqueous phase. With a prolonged treatment of 30 min, the
   decontamination of TOC reached over 90 \% in the aqueous phase,
   accompanied with 20 \% carbon and 70 \% sulfur decreases in weight in
   the solid phase. A huge weight reduction can be achieved prior to
   further solid treatment. The solid phase, named as the PAED-treated
   sludge, was separated by sedimentation and transferred to thermal plasma
   treatment. The thermal plasma-treated sludge was slightly melted, and
   the formation of slag was possible. X-ray energy dispersion solid
   analysis showed that carbon and sulfur were reduced to zero after
   treatment. Si, Mg, and Al decreased by 25, 30, and 60 \%, respectively,
   while Ca and Fe enriched by 400 and 25 \%, respectively. The emission
   gas analyses demonstrated a possible energy recovery from gaseous
   compounds with adequate gaseous treatment devices. This research
   demonstrates an innovative treatment approach of various sludge types,
   especially those types that contain high water contents and are severely
   contaminated by toxic organic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrophobicity of silicone elastomers can compromise their utility
   in some biomaterials applications. Few effective processes exist to
   introduce hydrophilic groups onto a polysiloxane backbone and
   subsequently crosslink the material into elastomers. This problem can be
   overcome through the utilization of metal-free click reactions between
   azidoalkylsilicones and alkynyl-modified silicones and/or PEGs to both
   functionalize and crosslink silicone elastomers. Alkynyl-functional PEG
   was clicked onto a fraction of the available azido groups of a
   functional polysiloxane, yielding azido reactive PDMS-g-PEG rake
   surfactants. The reactive polymers were then used to crosslink
   alkynyl-terminated PDMS of different molecular weights. Using simple

Abstract = {{White organic light emitting diodes (WOLEDs) were fabricated using blue,
   green and red emitting layers (EMLs). The device has a structure of
   ITO/NPB/EML/Alq(3)/Liq/Al. Here, to control the white color balance, the
   location of the blue EML in the WOLEDs was fixed and only the thickness
   of blue EML was changed while both thickness and position of the green
   and red EMLs were adjusted. When adjusting the thickness of blue EML,
   the occurrence area of recombination zone was changed to influence the
   green luminescence. When adjusting the location and thickness of red
   EML, it could be found that the current density is more sensitive to the
   location of red EML than its thickness. Furthermore, it was discovered
   that light was emitted due to the Forster energy transfer even if it was
   apart from the recombination zone. WOLEDs with a maximum luminance of
   17,740 cd/m,(2) an external quantum efficiency of 2.12\% at 100 cd/m,(2)
   CIE coordinates of (0.328, 0.301) and a color temperature of 6,185 K

Journal = {{CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{626}},
Pages = {{102-105}},

Abstract = {{Experiments have shown a dependence of the thermal conductivity of soft
   polymer materials on shear stress, which is common to several
   applications, such as film processing, fiber spinning, blow molding, and
   vacuum forming. Experiments reveal that the conductivity initially
   decreases with shear, but then increases as additional shear rate is
   applied. Based on molecular principles, we hypothesize that when
   molecules are initially placed under tension and extended, they
   disentangle, which reduces the number of points of interaction and
   diminishes the heat flux. Further molecular stretching increases this
   flux because the molecules are now better axially aligned. Molecular
   dynamics simulations confirm this competition and reproduce the
   inflection in the flux-strain relationship, which has not been
   previously explained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most conventional target tracking algorithms assume that one target can
   generate at most one detection per scan. However, in many practical
   target tracking applications, one target may generate multiple
   detections in one scan, because of multipath propagation, or high sensor
   resolution or some other reason. If the multiple detections from the
   same target can be effectively utilized, the performance of the
   multitarget tracking system can be improved. However, the challenge is
   that the uncertainty in the number of targets and the measurement
   set-to-target association will increase the complexity of tracking
   algorithms. To solve this problem, the random finite set (RFS) modeling
   and the random finite set statistics (FISST) are used in this paper.
   Without any extra approximation beyond those made in the standard
   probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, a general multi-detection
   PHD (MD-PHD) update formulation is derived. It is also established in
   this paper that, with certain reasonable assumptions, the proposed
   MD-PHD recursion can function as a generalized extended target PHD or
   multisensor PHD filter. Furthermore, a Gaussian Mixture (GM)
   implementation of the proposed MD-PHD formulation, called the MD-GM-PHD
   filter, is presented. The proposed MD-GM-PHD filter is demonstrated on a
   simulated over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The work studies the feasibility of developing a cardiac dedicated PET
   system using Monte Carlo simulation tools. The proposed system comprises
   a dual panel geometry and both panels utilize fine crystal elements
   (similar to 2-3 mm) to help improve high spatial resolution. The system
   performances were studied with respect to photon detection sensitivity,
   count-rate performances, spatial resolution, depthof-interaction (DOI)
   capability, and potential contrast recovery improvement due to
   time-of-flight (TOF). For a 2:3 dual panel configuration (front panel:
   24.0 x 18.0 cm(2) and back panel: 36.0 x 27.0 cm(2)), the system is able
   to achieve a peak photon sensitivity of similar to 13.0\% at the
   location of the heart. For count-rate performances, the system is able
   to yield a continuous increase of noise equivalent count rate (NECR) as
   a function of the total activity of radiotracers between 10 mCi and 50
   mCi. When crystal elements of 2 x 2 x 20 cm(3) are deployed in the front
   panel and crystal elements of 3 x 3 x 20 cm(3) are deployed in the back
   panel, the proposed system is not only able to revolve 2 mm diameter
   spheres in the image slices parallel to the panels but also demonstrates
   good resolution uniformity of less than 5\%. On the other hand,
   significant resolution degradation occurs in the direction perpendicular
   to the panels due to the following two factors: limited angular coverage
   and finite DOl resolution. Such degradation was quantitatively analyzed
   for five different DOl resolutions (0 mm, 2.5 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm and 20
   mm), as well as three different crystal configurations. Finally, the
   contrast study with a heart-like phantom (comprising lumen, aortic wall,
   myocardium and small lesions) indicates that TOP capability (time
   resolution: 250-500 ps) does not significantly improve image quality and
   lesion detectability, in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). (C)

Abstract = {{Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted
   more attentions because of the long-term stability, however, the
   high-cost fabrication method limits the application of CuPc OSCs. Here
   we report a surfactant-free CuPc nanoparticle organic solar cell with a
   much improved fill factor of 0.58, a power conversion efficiency (PCE)
   of 0.97\% by low-cost spin coating process. Annealing plays a key role
   on the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency and the fill
   factor. The improvement of fill factor is attributed to the formation of
   nanoscale connection among CuPc nanoparticles by annealing, which is
   suggested by the decrease of series resistance and increase of parallel
   resistance. The formation of nanoscale connection is also confirmed by
   the size growth of the CuPc nanoparticles. We also discover that the
   electrical contact between the CuPc nanoparticle layer and hole
   transportation layer, and the electrical contact among CuPc
   nanoparticles are both improved by annealing.}},

Title = {{Low molecular weight silicones particularly facilitate human serum
   albumin denaturation}},

Abstract = {{There is a market trend towards the administration of therapeutic
   proteins using sterilized, pre-filled glass syringes lubricated with
   silicone oil. It has been widely reported that initially clear solutions
   of proteins can become turbid during transport and storage, with unclear
   outcomes with respect to bioefficacy. While the basic processes of
   interactions of proteins with hydrophobic entities, leading to
   denaturation and aggregation, are increasingly well understood, the
   apparently random occurrence of such processes in syringes is not. To
   better understand the parameters that may be responsible for this
   change, we report the systematic examination of a series of factors that
   can affect the behavior of the protein human serum albumin (HSA) when in
   contact with silicone oil in water. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed
   that greater mixing times and greater concentrations of silicones
   (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)), especially lower molecular weight
   hydrophobic silicones like octamethyltetracyclosiloxane (D-4), were
   associated with increased protein denaturation. The turbidity of HSA
   solutions, due to the formation both of silicone oil-in-water (O/W)
   emulsions and protein aggregates, was also facilitated by the presence
   of D4. A series of mixtures of silicone oils, all of which exhibited a
   viscosity of 1000 cSt but which were comprised of different silicone
   constituents, clearly showed a correlation between the presence of lower
   molecular silicones and enhanced solution turbidity. While the addition
   of a non-ionic silicone-polyether surfactant led to greater turbidity by
   increasing the number of stabilized oil droplets, it was not accompanied
   by protein denaturation. These results are consistent with HSA
   denaturation and subsequent aggregation as a consequence of contact
   particularly with low molecular weight, hydrophobic silicones that are
   more mobile, leading to more efficient protein/silicone contact. (C)

Abstract = {{With the rapid expansion of urbanization, the technology of wastewater
   treatment has an increasingly crucial role in the field of environmental
   protection science and technology. The technology of pulsed arc
   electrohydraulic discharge (PAED) has been studied in depth by virtue of
   its signally treatment effect, low power consumption, and so on. The
   experiments were carried out with the wastewater from cyclic activated
   sludge system tank. The 10-L PAED reactor with eccentric electrodes is
   designed as industrialization mode. The PAED power supply is 3 kJ/pulse
   and the discharge rate is 2 Hz. The experiments on different distances,
   radii, and types of water gap electrodes were carried out. Three
   different electrode materials (titanium, tungsten, and titanium alloy)
   were used in the PAED system in the experiments. The results show that
   the sterilization effect on Escherichia coli is the highest when the
   material of the water gap electrodes is tungsten and the cumulative
   input electrical power is 1000 Wh/m(3). Fundamental discharge
   characteristics linked with disinfection performance will be discussed

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider a distributed multiple-input multiple-output
   (D-MIMO) system, where the channel is flat fading and may be correlated,
   and experiences both small and large-scale fading. We assume that the
   full knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is available at the
   receiver and only the first-and second-order statistics of the channel
   are available at the transmitter. For such a system employing the linear
   zero-forcing (ZF) receiver, an efficient linear precoding technique is
   proposed to optimize the worst-case performance of average
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver and a simple closed-form
   optimal precoder is derived. In addition, under some realistic
   assumptions, some significant asymptotic properties are established for
   the massive D-MIMO system designed in this letter. Computer simulations
   verify our theoretic analysis and show that our presented optimal system
   attains significant performance gains over the currently available equal

Abstract = {{This paper develops a power allocation strategy for multiple networks of
   Poisson-distributed single-antenna nodes that share the available
   spectrum in a spectrum underlay scenario. This strategy aims to maximize
   the overall throughput obtained by sharing the spectrum while limiting
   the degradation of the successful transmission probability of each
   network. In its original form, this joint power allocation problem is
   difficult to solve. However, we demonstrate that the problem can be
   transformed into a convex optimization formulation, which can be
   efficiently solved. Furthermore, we obtain a quasi-closed-form solution
   that has a water-filling interpretation by analyzing the optimality
   conditions. Numerical results indicate that, when a spectrum-sharing
   scheme employs the proposed optimal strategy of power allocation, the
   throughput substantially improves over that obtained by exclusively
   allocating the spectrum to the primary network. Moreover, when the
   number of spectrum-sharing networks increases, the enhancement is
   significant, being up to the limit imposed by the maximum allowable
   degradation in the performance of each network.}},

Abstract = {{H-2 generation under sunlight offers great potential for a sustainable
   fuel production system. To achieve high efficiency solar-to-hydrogen
   conversion, multijunction photoelectrodes have been commonly employed to
   absorb a large portion of the solar spectrum and to provide energetic
   charge carriers for water splitting. However, the design and performance
   of such tandem devices has been fundamentally limited by the current
   matching between various absorbing layers. Here, by exploiting the
   lateral carrier extraction scheme of one-dimensional nanowire
   structures, we have demonstrated that a dual absorber photocathode,
   consisting of p-InGaN/tunnel junction/n-GaN nanowire arrays and a Si
   solar cell wafer, can operate efficiently without the strict current
   matching requirement. The monolithically integrated photocathode
   exhibits an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 8.7\% at a
   potential of 0.33 V versus normal hydrogen electrode and nearly unity
   Faradaic efficiency for H2 generation. Such an adaptive multijunction
   architecture can surpass the design and performance restrictions of
   conventional tandem photoelectrodes.}},

Title = {{Critical factors and their effects on product maturity in food waste
   composting}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Product maturity represents the efficiency of composting performance,
   and it calls for high attention in food waste composting. In this study,
   a 2(4-1) fractional factorial design method combined with
   well-controlled experiments was introduced to characterize the effects
   of system factors (i.e., C/N ratio, aeration rate, starting culture
   amount, and coal ash amendment) on product maturity of food waste
   composting. The compost maturity was synthetically evaluated by
   developing a Mamdani fuzzy rule-based inference system. Temperature
   index, O-2 uptake rate, ammonium, OM loss, C/N ratio, and ash content
   were chosen as indicators of the fuzzy multicriterion maturity
   evaluation. Evaluation results of compost maturity for the eight
   experiment runs demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of
   evaluating the compost maturity in food waste composting. The effect
   analyses indicated that the starting culture amount and aeration rate
   contributed the most to the compost maturity in this study. The results
   could provide decision support for the process control in food waste
   composting management.}},

   measurements}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A quantitative imaging method is proposed based on microwave
   measurements where a direct inversion in real space is employed. The
   electrical properties of penetrable objects are reconstructed using a
   resolvent kernel in the forward model, which is extracted from
   calibration measurements. These measurements are performed on two known
   objects: the reference object (RO) representing the scatterer-free
   measurement and the calibration object representing a small scatterer
   embedded in the RO. Since the method does not need analytical or
   numerical approximations of the forward model, it is particularly
   valuable in short-range imaging, where analytical models of the incident
   field do not exist while the fidelity of the simulation models is often
   inadequate. The experimentally determined resolvent kernel inherently
   includes the particulars of the measurement setup, including all
   transmitting and receiving antennas. The inversion is fast, allowing for
   quasi-real-time image reconstruction. The proposed technique is
   demonstrated and validated through examples using simulated and
   experimental data. Its performance with noisy data is also examined. The
   concept of experimentally determined resolvent kernel in the forward
   model may be valuable in other imaging modalities such as ultrasound,
   photonic imaging, electrical-impedance tomography, etc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the relationship between the coherence and the speckle
   contrast in a laser-based projection display system is studied with the
   consideration of human visual percept. By using a varifocal
   liquid-crystal lens and a monochromatic charge-coupled device (CCD), a
   system which is used for simulating a human eye is set up to record the
   speckle pattern. An efficient method for controlling the spatial
   coherence by using a dielectric elastomeric actuator (DEA) is
   demonstrated. We find that there is a limitation for eliminating the
   speckle contrast in the laser projection system when only the method of
   reducing the spatial coherence is used. When the distance between the
   observer and the screen is sufficiently large (>3 m), the speckle
   contrast can be eliminated well (<4\%) by reducing the spatial coherence
   and the observer do not observe the speckle phenomenon. When the viewing
   distance is smaller than 3 m, however, the observer will feel the
   speckle all of the time. To further reduce the speckle contract, a
   method of wavelength modulation is used to reduce the temporal coherence
   while the spatial coherence is well reduced. The speckle contrast is
   reduced to 4\% at the viewing distance of 1 m by reducing both the
   temporal and spatial coherence of the laser.}},

Title = {{A machine learning approach using auditory odd-ball responses to
   investigate the effect of Clozapine therapy}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{721-730}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a machine learning (ML) methodology based on
   features extracted from odd-ball auditory evoked potentials to identify
   neurophysiologic changes induced by Clozapine (CLZ) treatment in
   responding schizophrenic (SCZ) subjects. This objective is of particular
   interest because CLZ, though a potentially dangerous drug, can be
   uniquely effective for otherwise medication-resistant SCZ subjects. We
   wish to determine whether ML methods can be used to identify a set of
   EEG-based discriminating features that can simultaneously (1)
   distinguish all the SCZ subjects before treatment (BT) from healthy
   volunteer (HV) subjects, (2) distinguish EEGs collected before CLZ
   treatment (BT) vs. those collected after treatment (AT) for those
   subjects most responsive to CLZ, (3) discriminate least responsive
   subjects from HV AT, and (4) no longer discriminate most responsive
   subjects from HVs AT. If a set of EEG-derived features satisfy these
   four conditions, then it may be concluded that these features normalize
   in responsive subjects as a result of CLZ treatment, and therefore
   potentially provide insight into the functioning of the drug on the SCZ
   brain.
   Methods: Odd-ball auditory evoked potentials of 66 HVs and 47 SCZ adults
   both BT and AT with CLZ were derived from EEG recordings. Treatment
   outcome, after at least one year follow-up, was assessed through
   clinical rating scores assigned by an experienced clinician, blind to
   EEG results. Using a criterion of at least 35\% improvement after CLZ
   treatment, subjects were divided into ``most-responsive'' (MR) and
   ``least-responsive'' (LR) groups. As a first step, a brain source
   localization (BSL) procedure was employed on the EEG signals to extract
   source waveforms from specified brain regions. ML methods were then
   applied to these source waveform signals to determine whether a set of
   features satisfying the four conditions outlined above could be
   discovered.
   Results: A set of cross-power spectral density (CPSD) features meeting
   these criteria was identified. These CPSD features, consisting of a
   combination of brain regional source activity and connectivity measures,
   significantly overlap with the default mode network (DMN). All decrease
   with CLZ treatment in responding SCZs.
   Conclusions: A set of EEG-derived discriminating features which
   normalize as a result of CLZ treatment was identified. These
   discriminating features define a network that shares significant
   commonality with the DMN. Our findings are consistent with those of
   previous literature, which suggest that regions of the DMN are
   hyperactive and hyperconnected in SCZ subjects. Our study shows that
   these discriminating features decrease after treatment, consistent with
   portions of the DMN normalizing with CLZ therapy in responsive subjects.
   Significance: Machine learning is proposed as a potentially powerful
   tool for analysis of the effect of medication on psychiatric illness. If
   replicated, the proposed approach could be used to gain some improved
   understanding of the effect of neuroleptic medications in treating
   psychotic illness. These results may also be useful in the development
   of new pharmaceuticals, since a new drug which induces changes in brain
   electrophysiology similar to those seen after CLZ could also have
   powerful antipsychotic properties. (C) 2014 International Federation of

Title = {{Seismic Fragility Evaluation of Lightly Reinforced Concrete-Block Shear
   Walls for Probabilistic Risk Assessment}},

Abstract = {{With the North American seismic codes moving toward adopting
   performance-based seismic design (PBSD) approaches, there is a need to
   develop seismic probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) tools for different
   construction systems, including reinforced masonry (RM). The current
   study focuses on the development of analytical fragility curves based on
   the performance of RM walls tested under base excitation generated by a
   shake table. The study has two phases. In the first phase, the seismic
   response of the RM shear walls is modeled using a simplified analytical
   model that was calibrated using previously reported shake table
   experimental results. The second phase of the study focuses on the
   development of fragility curves, as an essential component of a PRA
   framework, for two-story lightly reinforced masonry walls. In this
   phase, relevant limit states are defined and the corresponding
   capacities of the walls are quantified based on the shake table test
   results. The wall seismic demand levels are then determined through a
   probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) approach by performing 120
   nonlinear response history analyses using the analytical model developed
   in the first phase. Fragility curves are derived based on the
   experimental capacity data and the analytical PSDA results. The results
   indicate that the lightly reinforced masonry shear wall category
   considered in this study would experience acceptable seismic performance
   associated with moderate lateral wall top-roof drifts even when
   subjected to ground motion records representing some of the highest
   seismic regions in eastern and western Canada. The study is a part of a
   larger ongoing PRA research program to provide the needed seismic
   performance data to facilitate the inclusion of different RM
   construction categories within the next generation of PBSD codes in
   North America. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) employ sloshing fluid to reduce the resonant
   response of structures. Existing structure-TLD models are limited to
   rectangular or circular tanks, shapes that may not always be feasible in
   practice due to geometric restrictions of the building floor plan. This
   paper utilizes an equivalent linearized mechanical model and a nonlinear
   multimodal model to predict the response of the structure-TLD systems
   where the TLD tank geometry is irregular. Experimental structure-TLD
   system tests are conducted that consider two irregular tank shapes.
   Response history plots and frequency response plots of the structural
   displacement and TLD wave heights are created to evaluate the models
   using the experimental results. The parent distributions and 10-minute
   peak distributions of the structural displacements and TLD wave heights
   are created for the simulated and experimental results. These
   distributions indicate that both the linearized and nonlinear models can
   accurately predict the structural response; however, the linearized
   model substantially underestimates the peak wave heights. Since wave
   heights are required to establish the required tank free board, or roof
   impact pressures, it is concluded that nonlinear analysis of the
   structure-TLD system model is required before a TLD design is finalized.}},

Title = {{Elastic registration of prostate MR images based on estimation of
   deformation states}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{87-103}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being used increasingly for
   image-guided targeted biopsy and focal therapy of prostate cancer. In
   this paper, a combined rigid and deformable registration technique is
   proposed to register pre-treatment diagnostic 3 T magnetic resonance
   (MR) images of the prostate, with the identified target tumor(s), to
   intra-treatment 1.5 T MR images. The pre-treatment T2-weighted MR images
   were acquired with patients in a supine position using an endorectal
   coil in a 3 T scanner, while the intra-treatment T2-weighted MR images
   were acquired in a 1.5 T scanner before insertion of the needle with
   patients in the semi-lithotomy position. Both the rigid and deformable
   registration algorithms employ an intensity-based distance metric
   defined based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptors
   (MIND) between images. The optimization routine for estimating the rigid
   transformation parameters is initialized using four pairs of manually
   selected approximate corresponding points on the boundaries of the
   prostate. In this paper, the problem of deformable image registration is
   approached from the perspective of state estimation for dynamical
   systems. The registration algorithm employs a rather generic dynamic
   linear elastic model of the tissue deformation discretized by the finite
   element method (FEM). We use the model in a classical state estimation
   framework to estimate the deformation of the prostate based on the
   distance metric between pre- and intra-treatment images. Our deformable
   registration results using 17 sets of prostate MR images showed that the
   proposed method yielded a target registration error (TRE) of 1.87 +/-
   0.94 mm, 2.03 +/- 0.94 mm, and 1.70 +/- 0.93 mm for the whole gland
   (WG), central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively, using
   76 manually-identified fiducial points. This was an improvement over the
   2.67 +/- 1.31 mm, 2.95 +/- 1.43 mm, and 2.34 +/- 1.11 mm, respectively
   for the WG, CG, and PZ after rigid registration alone. Dice similarity
   coefficients (DSC) in the WG, CG and PZ were 88.2 +/- 5.3, 85.6 +/- 7.6
   and 68.7 +/- 6.9 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the mean absolute
   distances (MAD) between surfaces was 1.26 +/- 0.56 mm and 1.27 +/- 0.55
   mm in the WG and CG, after deformable registration. These results
   indicate that the proposed registration technique has sufficient
   accuracy for localizing prostate tumors in MRI-guided targeted biopsy or
   focal therapy of clinically localized prostate cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{21-26}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Measurements of the mean heat transfer coefficient film the wall below
   turbulent offset wall attaching planar jets were performed for jets with
   Reynolds numbers (Re-j) of 21,800-54,500. The jets were initially offset
   0.2-1 times the initial jet height (H-j) above the wall. The Reynolds
   number dependence of the maximum Nusselt number varied with offset
   distance from Re-j(0.64) for the flows with an offset distance of
   0.2H(j) to Re-j(0.77) for flows with initial offset distances of H-j.
   The distance from the jet exit to the location of the maximum heat
   transfer coefficient also increased with Reynolds number for the jets
   with smaller offset distances. The maximum heat transfer coefficient for
   the different offset jets could be correlated by hX(m)/k(a) =
   c(UjXm/v)(0.74) where X-m is the distance to the maximum heat transfer
   location and the parameter c varies with the initial offset distance
   from 0.08 to 0.1. The profiles of the Nusselt number approach the
   results for a wall jet downstream of x/H-j approximate to 8 and
   collapsed when scaled by Re-j(0.77) in all cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Microgels used for biomedical applications have to be purified to remove

   membrane-based purification processes. In this study, a model poly
   (N-isopropylacrylamide) or pNIPAM microgel was covalently tagged with
   Rhodamine B to enhance its detectability. The effects of salt
   concentration in the feed, membrane pore-size, and permeate flux on

   Both, the properties of the microgel particles, and operating conditions
   were found to significantly affect membrane filtration of pNIPAM

Abstract = {{A novel self-adaptive variable-size multi-objective differential
   evolution algorithm is presented to find the best reconfiguration of
   existing on-orbit satellites for some particular targets on the ground
   when an emergent requirement arises in a short period. The main
   contribution of this study is that three coverage metrics are designed
   to assess the performance of the reconfiguration. Proposed algorithm
   utilizes the idea of fixed-length chromosome encoding scheme combined
   with expression vector and the modified initialization, mutation,
   crossover and selection operators to search for optimal reconfiguration
   structure. Multi-subpopulation diversity initialization is adopted
   first, then the mutation based on estimation of distribution algorithm
   and adaptive crossover operators are defined to manipulate
   variable-length chromosomes, and finally a new selection mechanism is
   employed to generate well-distributed individuals for the next
   generation. The proposed algorithm is applied to three
   characteristically different case studies, with the objective to improve
   the performance with respect to specified targets by minimizing fuel
   consumption and maneuver time. The results show that the algorithm can
   effectively find the approximate Pareto solutions under different
   topological structures. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the
   proposed algorithm outperforms two other related multi-objective
   evolutionary optimization algorithms in terms of quality, convergence
   and diversity metrics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growth mechanisms of high quality GaN thin films on 6H-SiC by
   sputtering were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The XRD theta-2 theta scans
   show that high quality (0002) oriented GaN was deposited on 6H-SiC by
   reactive magnetron sputtering. Pole figures obtained by 2D-XRD clarify
   that GaN thin films are dominated by (0002) oriented wurtzite GaN and
   \{111\} oriented zinc-blende GaN. A thin amorphous silicon oxide layer
   on SiC surfaces observed by STEM plays a critical role in terms of the
   orientation information transfer from the substrate to the GaN epilayer.
   The addition of H-2 into Ar and/or N-2 during sputtering can reduce the
   thickness of the amorphous layer. Moreover, adding 5\% H-2 into Ar can
   facilitate a phase transformation from amorphous to crystalline in the
   silicon oxide layer and eliminate the unwanted \{3 (3) over bar 02\}
   orientation in the GaN thin film. Fiber texture GaN thin films can be
   grown by adding 10\% H-2 into N-2 due to the complex reaction between
   H-2 and N-2. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A new type of ultraviolet ( UV) light sensor based on film bulk acoustic
   wave resonator (FBAR) is proposed. The new sensor uses gold and a thin
   n-type ZnO layer deposited on the top of piezoelectric layer of FBAR to
   form a Schottky barrier. The Schottky barrier's capacitance can be
   changed with UV light, resulting in an enhanced shift in the entire
   FBAR's resonant frequency. The fabricated UV sensor has a 50 nm thick
   n-ZnO semiconductor layer with a carrier concentration of similar to
   10(17) cm(-3). A large frequency downshift is observed when UV light
   irradiates the FBAR. With 365 nm UV light of intensity 1.7 mW/cm(2), the
   FBAR with n-ZnO/Au Schottky diode has 250 kHz frequency downshift, much
   larger than the 60 kHz frequency downshift in a conventional FBAR
   without the n-ZnO layer. The shift in the new FBAR's resonant frequency
   is due to the junction formed between Au and n-ZnO semiconductor and its
   properties changes with UV light. The experimental results are in
   agreement with the theoretical analysis using an equivalent circuit
   model of the new FBAR structure.}},

Title = {{Structural fluctuations and orientational glass of levoglucosan-High
   stability against ordering and absence of structural glass}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{To investigate whether a non-exponential relaxation always indicates 2-4
   nm-size regions of dynamic heterogeneity, we studied the kinetic
   freezing and unfreezing of structural fluctuations involving the
   rotational modes in orientationally disordered crystal (ODIC) of
   levoglucosan by calorimetry. The heat capacity, C-p, of levoglucosan
   measured over the 203 K-463 K range shows that its low-temperature,
   orientationally ordered crystal (ORC) transforms to ODIC phase on
   heating, which then melts to a low viscosity liquid. On cooling, the
   melt transforms to the ODIC which then does not transform to the ORC.
   Instead, the ODIC supercools. Fluctuations resulting from hindered
   (random) rotations of levoglucosan molecules confined to the lattice
   sites and from their conformational changes become progressively slower
   on cooling and an orientational glass (O-G) forms showing the sigmoid
   shape decrease in C-p characteristic of structural arrest like that of a
   glass. On heating the O-G state, rotational fluctuations begin to
   contribute to C-p at To-g of 247.8 K and there is an overshoot in C-p
   and thermal hysteresis (characteristic of physical ageing) in the
   temperature range of 230-260 K. The non-exponential relaxation
   parameter, beta(cal), determined by fitting the C-p data to a
   non-exponential, nonlinear model for relaxation of a glass is 0.60,
   which is similar to beta(cal) found for polymers, molecular liquids, and
   metal-alloy melts in which Brownian diffusion occurs. Such beta(cal) < 1
   are seen to indicate 2-4 nm-size dynamically heterogeneous domains in an
   ultraviscous liquid near the glass formation, but its value of 0.60 for
   ODIC levoglucosan, in which Brownian diffusion does not occur, would not
   indicate such domains. Despite the lack of Brownian diffusion, we
   discuss these findings in the potential energy landscape paradigm.
   Levoglucosan melt, which is believed to vitrify and to stabilize a
   protein's disordered structure, did not supercool even at 200 K/min
   cooling rate. The findings have consequences for reports on the
   dielectric relaxation studies that indicated that levoglucosan melt
   supercools to form a structural glass of T-g of similar to 245 K, and
   for computer simulation of its dynamics. Levoglucosan is the ninth ODIC
   that forms O-G. It does so more easily than the other eight. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new method is developed for the fabrication of asymmetric
   supercapacitor devices containing fibrous electrode materials. The
   approach is based on the synthesis of uniform polypyrrole (PPy) coatings
   on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), which were used for the
   fabrication of MWCNTs coated with N-doped activated carbon (N-AC). The
   N-AC-MWCNT electrodes show good electrochemical performance in positive
   and negative potential windows. The electrochemical performance of
   positive electrodes is further enhanced by the development of
   MnO2-coated N-AC-MWCNT. In this approach, the problem of MWCNT
   degradation in the reaction with KMnO4 is avoided by the use of a
   sacrificial N-AC layer, which allows a relatively high mass content of
   MnO2 in the final material. The approach offers the advantages of small
   size of MnO2 nanoparticles, good electrical contact of MnO2 and MWCNT
   and fibrous microstructure of the material. Testing results show a
   remarkably high specific capacitance of 6.29 F cm(-2) (311.7 F g(-1)) at
   a mass loading of 20 mg cm(-2). The important finding is the possibility
   to fabricate asymmetric devices, which show a specific capacitance of
   2.19 F cm(-2) (62.7 Fg(-1)) in a voltage window of 1.9 V in aqueous
   Na2SO4 electrolyte, an energy density of 26.4 mW hg(-1) and a power
   density of 1.7 W g(-1). The electrodes and devices show good capacitance
   retention at high charge-discharge rates and good cycling stability. The
   asymmetric capacitors developed herein are promising for practical
   energy-storage applications.}},

   enhance the charge-carrier balance in the emitting region, resulting
   from the effective carrier confinement. The maximum external quantum
   efficiency of the blue PHOLEDs with the double-ECLs is 24.02\% at 1500
   cd/m(2) and its luminous efficiency is 43.76 cd/A, which is 70.47\%
   improved compared to the device without a carrier-confinement layer.}},

Abstract = {{A coagulatable and redispersible poly(styrene-block-n-butyl acrylate)
   (PS-b-PnBA) copolymer latex system was developed. A series of PS-b-PnBA
   diblock copolymers with the PnBA content up to 70 wt \% were prepared
   via a reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion
   polymerization. An amphipathic poly(acrylic acid-b-styrene)
   trithiocarbonate was synthesized and employed as macro-RAFT agent and
   surfactant. The resulted latex particles contained a soft poly(n-butyl
   acrylate) core and a hard polystyrene shell. The hard plastic shell
   could prevent the elastomer core from deformation and fusion at room
   temperature. It was found that the latex particles with the nBA content
   <= 60 wt \% could be easily coagulated by HCl and redispersed by NaOH
   with some ultrasound treatment. The coagulation and redispersion
   processes were repeatable. When the nBA content reached 70 wt \%, the
   plastic shell became too thin, resulting in collapsed sticky particles.
   The critical shell thickness for redispersible latexes was about 8 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic-scale, tribo-ceramic films associated with dissipative structures
   formation are discovered under extreme frictional conditions which
   trigger self-organization. For the first time, we present an actual
   image of meta-stable protective tribo-ceramics within thicknesses of a
   few atomic layers. A mullite and sapphire structure predominates in
   these phases. They act as thermal barriers with an amazing energy
   soaking/dissipating capacity. Less protective tribo-films cannot sustain
   in these severe conditions and rapidly wear out. Therefore, a functional
   hierarchy is established. The created tribo-films act in synergy,
   striving to better adapt themselves to external stimuli. Under a highly
   complex structure and non-equilibrium state, the upcoming generation of
   adaptive surface engineered nano-multilayer materials behaves like
   intelligent systems - capable of generating, with unprecedented
   efficiency, the necessary tribo-films to endure an increasingly severe
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the shear deformation and the superimposed hydrostatic

   terms of the forming limit diagram (FLD). The model employed is the
   elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) crystal plasticity model,
   which accounts for both slip and twinning systems as the deformation
   mechanisms. The conventiohal sheets have low formability at room
   temperature due to the strong basal texture developed by the rolling
   process. However differential speed rolling process develops relatively
   weak basal texture by introducing shear deformation. Therefore the
   formability of the sheets produced by differential speed rolling is
   enhanced. In terms of the superimposed hydrostatic pressure, it delays
   the onset of necking and therefore improves the formability of sheets.
   In addition, the effect of crystal elasticity on the formability of
   sheets is numerically studied. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, surface-activation-based nanobonding technology and its
   applications are described. This bonding technology allows for the
   integration of electronic, photonic, fluidic and mechanical components

   four different nanobonding techniques that have been used for the

   gold. We use these substrates to create electronic (silicon), photonic
   (silicon and gallium arsenide), microelectromechanical (glass and
   silicon), and fluidic (silicon and glass) components for biosensing and
   bioimaging systems being developed. Our nanobonding technologies provide
   void-free, strong, and nanometer scale bonding at room temperature or at
   low temperatures (<200 degrees C), and do not require chemicals,
   adhesives, or high external pressure. The interfaces of the nanobonded

Abstract = {{Here we investigate the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalytic
   activity and the corrosion stability of several ternary Pt-Au-Co and
   Pt-Ir-Co alloys, with Pt-Au-Co having never been previously studied for
   ORR. The addition of Au fine tunes the lattice parameter and the surface
   electronic structure to enable activity and cycling stability that is
   unachievable in Pt-25 atom \% Co (state-of-the-art binary baseline). The
   ternary alloys exhibit a volcano-type dependence of catalytic efficacy
   on the content of Au or Ir. Pt-2.5 atom \% Au-25 atom \% Co alloy shows
   a specific activity of 1.41 mA cm-2 at 0.95 V, which is 16\% and 404\%
   higher than those of identically synthesized Pt-Co and pure Pt,
   respectively. This enhancement is promising in comparison to a range of
   previously published Pt skeleton and Pt skin alloys and is in fact the
   most optimum reported for a skeleton-type system. The catalysts exhibit
   dramatically improved corrosion stability with increasing levels of Au
   or Ir substitution, with the specific activity of all the ternary alloys
   being superior to that of Pt-Co after 100,000 potential cycles of
   0.6-1.0 V. For instance, postcycled Pt-10 atom \% Au-25 atom \% Co shows
   a specific activity of 0.63 mA cm(-2), which is 140\% higher than that
   of Pt-Co and 439\% higher than that of Pt. HRTEM and XPS shows that Au
   alloying promotes the formation of an atomically thin Pt-Au-rich surface
   layer, which imparts kinetic stabilization against the dissolution of
   the less noble solute component.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposite in situ-gelling hydrogels containing both
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and thermoresponsive
   microgels are demonstrated to facilitate pulsatile, high-low release of
   a model drug (4 kDa fluorescein labeled dextran). The materials can be
   injected through a minimally invasive route, facilitate a similar to
   4-fold enhancement of release when pulsed on relative to the off state,
   and, in contrast to previous gel-based systems, can maintain pulsatile
   release properties over multiple cycles and multiple days instead of
   only hours. Optimal pulsatile release is achieved when the microgel
   transition temperature is engineered to lie just above the
   (physiological) incubation temperature. Coupled with the demonstrated
   degradability of the nanocomposites and the cytocompatibility of all
   nanocomposite components, we anticipate these nanocomposites have
   potential to facilitate physiologically relevant, controlled pulsatile

Abstract = {{The developed knowledge regarding use of twin screw granulators for
   continuous wet granulation has been primarily limited to immediate
   release formulations in the literature. The present study highlights an
   issue previously unreported for wet granulation with twin screw
   extruders when using formulations containing controlled-release (CR)
   excipients. Long (3-10 mm), twisted noodle-like granules can be produced
   in the presence of these excipients that are difficult to control and
   are anticipated to create complications in downstream unit operations to
   the granulator. Working with two different CR excipients, METHOCELTM K4M
   and Kollidon((R)) SR, each blended at different ratios with a mixture of
   80\% alpha-lactose monohydrate/20\% microcrystalline cellulose, these
   unique particles were found to be produced in the conveying elements of
   the extruder, arising from a rolling action at the top of the screw
   flights. The CR excipients adhesively strengthen the wetted mass,
   forming this undesired granule shape such that they persisted to the
   exit of the machine; the shape appeared most strongly affected by screw
   speed, producing particles of higher aspect ratio as speed was
   increased. Adjusting the concentration of these CR excipients in the
   formulation, the flow rate or the type of compression element used in
   the screws proved ineffective in controlling the problem. Rather, a
   re-design of the extruder screws was required to prevent generation of
   these extended-form granules.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{360-369}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a combination of paper-based sensors and a
   novel smart-phone application for on-site quantification of colorimetric
   readouts as an ultra-low cost solution to monitoring water quality. The
   system utilizes a paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) that produces a
   colorimetric signal that is dependent on the concentration of a specific
   target; a cell phone equipped with a camera for capturing images of two
   mu PADs one tested with a water sample and the other tested with clean
   water that is used as a control; and an on-site image processing app
   that uses a novel algorithm for quantifying color intensity and relating
   this to contaminant concentration. The cell phone app utilizes a pixel
   counting algorithm that performs with less bias and user subjectivity
   than the typically used lab-based software, ImageJ. The use of a test
   and control strip reduces bias from variations in ambient lighting,
   making it possible to acquire and process images on-site. The cell phone
   is also able to GPS tag the location of the test, and transmit results
   to a newly developed website, WaterMap.ca (TM), that displays the
   quantitative results from the water samples on a map. We demonstrate our
   approach using a previously developed mu PAD that detects the presence
   of organophosphate pesticides based on the inhibition of immobilized
   acetylcholinesterase by these contaminants. The objective of this paper
   is to highlight the importance and potential of developing and
   integrated monitoring system consisting of mu PADs, cell-phones and a
   centralized web portal for low-cost monitoring environmental
   contaminants at a large-scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We report the thermal conductivity, kappa, and the specific heat, C-p,
   of dispersion of 0.95-nm-thick, 25-nm-diameter disks of Laponite in
   water and in ice, as well as the thermal effects during gelation of
   several compositions, and the temperature dependence of the gelation
   time. The kappa values of its 5.0 wt\% sol and gel states at T>273 K are
   similar to 3 \% larger than those of pure water. In the frozen state of
   water, kappa is lower than that of hexagonal ice and the difference
   increases on cooling. kappa of the sol and gel calculated from Maxwell's
   mixture model agrees with the measured kappa. During the course of
   homogenization and formation of the gel state, kappa and C-p do not
   change significantly. The time for gel formation, t(gel), decreases
   rapidly when the sol is aged at high temperatures. The change occurs
   almost according to the relation, log(10)(t(gel)) proportional to 1/T.
   The accelerated formation of the Laponite gel at high T is distinguished
   from that of organic, mostly protein gels which form more rapidly at low
   T. The gels are not thermo-reversible. We consider the consequences of
   our findings for the current understanding of the phonon propagation and
   electrostatic interactions between H2O molecules and Laponite disks.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This brief considers the problem of quality control for the production
   of polymethyl methacrylate to achieve the prescribed number and weight
   average molecular weights. To this end, with a detailed first principles
   model used to simulate the process, a dynamic multiple-model-based
   approach is implemented to capture the process dynamics from past batch
   data. Subsequently, the multiple model is integrated with a quality
   model to enable the prediction of the end quality based on initial
   conditions and candidate control input (jacket temperature) moves. A
   data-driven model predictive controller is then designed to achieve the
   desired product quality while satisfying input constraint, a lower bound
   on the conversion, as well as additional constraints that enforce the
   validity of data-driven models for the range of chosen input moves.
   Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance (10.3\% and
   7.4\% relative error in number average and weight average molecular
   weights compared with 20.4\% and 19.0\%) of the controller over
   traditional trajectory-tracking approaches.}},

   Local false track discrimination uses a track quality measure to confirm
   most of the true tracks, and to terminate most of the false tracks.
   Confirmed tracks are transmitted for track-to-track fusion. The sets of
   tracks being considered for fusion may contain both true and false
   tracks. The authors assume that each track information also includes the
   track quality measure in the form of the probability of target existence
   information. This information is used for additional false track
   discrimination at the fusion centre. They also use this information to
   enhance the track-to-track association. They propose three different

   `single target', the `joint multitarget' and the `linear multitarget'.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, acrylic latexes are prepared through surfactant-free
   emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl acrylate
   (BA). CO2-responsive 2-(diethyl)aminoethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA) is used
   as a co-monomer. The resulting latexes can be easily coagulated by
   adding a small amount of caustic soda. Once washed, coagulated particles
   could be redispersed into water to prepare stable latexes with CO2 and
   ultrasonication. CO2-redispersibility of the latexes is examined as a
   function of glass transition temperature of the polymers having
   different MMA/BA ratios. It is found that, while high MMA content
   latexes are easily CO2-redispersed, it is challenging to re-disperse
   high BA content latexes. For latex particles with T-g below ambient
   conditions, coagulation with caustic soda leads to the fusion of
   individual particles, and the particles are no longer redispersible.
   This work provides a mechanistic insight and practical guidance for the
   applicability of CO2-responsive amine-containing molecules (employed as
   comonomer, initiator, surfactant, and so on) in developing
   CO2-redispersible latex products.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{286-294}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The limiting conditions for non-partitioned ferrite growth were
   investigated under controlled decarburization conditions. An abrupt
   change in the growth kinetics and morphology of ferrite was observed
   when the temperature increased above the limit defined by the local
   equilibrium no-partitioning (LENP) model. The ferrite layer formed below
   the LENP limit consisted of columnar grains and showed continuous,
   parabolic growth kinetics. In contrast, ferrite growth above the LENP
   limit showed two distinct stages. Initially, a thin layer of columnar
   ferrite grains formed and grew rapidly for a short period of time. In
   the second stage, the ferrite layer appeared to increase in thickness at
   a very low rate. The slow growth of the ferrite layer was associated
   with a strong depletion of carbon content in austenite as well as the
   formation of new ferrite grains as opposed to the growth of existing
   grains. The evolution of the carbon concentration in austenite was used
   to infer the operating interfacial contact conditions as a function of
   time. The evolution of the interfacial austenite conditions is suggested
   to penetrate deep into the two-phase region as predicted by ferrite
   growth theories that account for free-energy dissipation during the
   austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The two available wetting methods for twin screw granulation, namely
   foam delivery and liquid injection, were studied in detail by examining
   granule development along the screws as powder formulation and screw
   design were varied. Granulation profiles were determined by particle
   size analysis of samples along the screws collected using the screw
   pullout technique. Analysis of the particle size and porosity of
   produced granules revealed only minor differences between the two
   methods of wetting despite the larger dropsize of liquid injection
   compared to foam delivery. Excipients like microcrystalline cellulose or
   hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose with poor spreading properties,
   quantified by their specific penetration time and nucleation ratio, made
   the differences more apparent. The general similarities in granulation
   independent of wetting method implied that binder dispersion in an
   extruder was dominated by mechanical dispersion. Screw design (i.e.,
   location of kneading block) had the dominant effect on the granulation
   process in this study. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) resulting from the exposure to a
   blast shock wave is a challenging problem due to the broad long-term
   neurological deficits on the victims. The blast-related injury is not
   only due to the prevalence of military conflicts, but also due to
   increase terrorist attacks and domestic/industrial accidents. Mechanisms
   of blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (BImTBI) have been
   controversial for a long time and nowadays are one of the most attentive
   topics among the neurotrauma researches. A physical head and neck model
   (PHNM) equipped with a surrogate gel brain was developed, and its
   dynamic responses to a blast wave were evaluated using a predesigned
   compressed air-driven shock tube. The neck model was constructed and
   tuned to simulate the actual human neck stiffness. The history of
   intracranial pressure (ICP) at different locations within the brain was
   monitored with four miniature pressure transducers. The acceleration of
   the head as well as the brain model was recorded using two
   accelerometers mounted internally and outside the PHNM. The shockwave
   effects on the PHNM were examined at different distance orientations
   from shock tube exit. The PHNM was exposed to free-field blast tests
   with controlled reliable positive peak pressure (PPP). The ICP
   amplitudes/profiles and the acceleration results vary according to the
   PHNM locations and orientations with respect to shock tube exit. The
   most vital parameters of ICP wave profiles including PPP, positive phase
   duration, and positive impulse values were greatly affected by the PHNM
   locations/orientations from the shock tube exit.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers a satellite orbit design when a given set of target
   sites needs to be visited within an assigned period. Optimization of the
   orbit design takes into account target properties such as priority and
   minimum duration of observation time. Equations describing satellite
   orbit are used to compute the satellite's field of view and ground
   track. Scheduling of visits to the targets is carried out by maximizing
   the observation time over priority-weighted targets and minimizing the
   distance between the ground track and the target position while
   satisfying the constraints with respect to the minimum duration of
   observation time and revisit requirement. A self-adaptive differential
   evolution (SA-DE) algorithm with the ability to adjust its search
   parameters is used to find the best solution. The proposed design
   methodology computes the optimal values of design variables and also the
   start and end observation time points of each target. Regional and
   global case studies demonstrate that the SA-DE/best/1/bin variant is
   found to be the most suitable optimizer for orbit design. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A techno-economic analysis of a novel process to co-produce ethylene and

   the use of traditional gas turbines, chemical looping combustion, and
   100\% carbon dioxide capture. Mass and energy balance simulations were
   carried out using Aspen Plus simulations, and particle swarm
   optimization was used to determine the optimal process design under a
   variety of market scenarios. A custom model for the gas turbine section
   was used to ensure that the negative impacts of various cooling
   strategies were factored into the analysis. The results show that by
   synergistically co-producing power and ethylene using this catalyst,
   ethylene can be produced at costs close to traditional steam cracking
   methods with nearly zero carbon dioxide emissions, even when factoring
   in the relatively poor conversion and selectivity of the chosen
   catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although stable unbonded fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators
   (SU-FREIs) have desirable characteristics for seismic isolation, the
   unbonded application also introduces limitations in comparison with
   bonded elastomeric isolators. SU-FREIs are not capable of resisting
   tensile forces, making SU-FREIs unsuited for situations where
   overturning is of concern or where large vertical accelerations are
   anticipated. Furthermore, as SU-FREIs rely on friction to transfer
   horizontal forces, the isolator could potentially slip under certain
   loading conditions, resulting in permanent displacements. This paper
   proposes that concerns over the transfer of tensile forces and potential
   slip can be addressed by partially bonding the SU-FREI to the upper and
   lower supports. In this way, partially bonded FREIs (PB-FREIs) not only
   retain the beneficial characteristics of an unbonded FREI but also
   inherit characteristics of a bonded isolator; notably tensile and
   horizontal forces can be transferred through the partial bond.
   Experimental results from isolators tested unbonded and partially bonded
   under vertical compression are used to evaluate a finite element model.
   The experimental data and finite element analysis demonstrate that
   portions of a FREI can be bonded without substantially altering the
   rollover characteristics of the isolator within the range of average
   vertical compressive and tensile stresses considered. Despite an
   unconventional deformed shape under tensile vertical stress, the
   horizontal force-displacement relationship exhibits negligible deviation
   from a conventional unbonded SU-FREI under a compressive vertical
   stress. It is postulated that with further development, partially bonded
   FREIs can retain the beneficial characteristics of unbonded FREIs while
   addressing concerns over tensile forces and slip. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Microarray technology is a powerful tool in molecular biology which is

   Each microarray experiment produces hundreds of images. In this paper,

   microarray images. The most significant parts of the image pixels are
   compressed by classifying them into foreground and background regions.
   This increases the spatial redundancy of the image. The foreground
   regions are packed together using a novel compaction unit. Real-time
   compression of these images is achieved while the bit-per-pixel values

Abstract = {{PET image quality is directly associated with two important parameters
   among others: count-rate performance and image signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR). The framework of noise equivalent count rate (NECR) was developed
   back in the 1990s and has been widely used since then to evaluate
   count-rate performance for PET systems. The concept of NECR is not
   entirely straightforward, however, and among the issues requiring
   clarification are its original definition, its relationship to image
   quality, and its consistency among different derivation methods. In
   particular, we try to answer whether a higher NECR measurement using a
   standard NEMA phantom actually corresponds to better imaging
   performance. The paper includes the following topics: 1) revisiting the
   original analytical model for NECR derivation; 2) validating three
   methods for NECR calculation based on the NEMA phantom/standard; and 3)
   studying the spatial dependence of NECR and quantitative relationship
   between NECR and image SNR. (C) 2015 Associazione Italiana di Fisica

Abstract = {{In this study, an uncertainty quantification framework is proposed for
   hydrologic models based on probabilistic collocation method (PCM). The
   PCM method first uses polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to approximate
   the hydrological outputs in terms of a set of standard Gaussian random
   variables, and then estimates the unknown coefficients in the PCE
   through collocation method. The conceptual hydrologic model, Hymod, is
   used to demonstrate the applicability of PCM in quantifying
   uncertainties of the hydrologic predictions. Two parameters in Hymod are
   considered as uniformly distributed in certain intervals.
   Two-dimensional 2-order and two-dimensional 3-order PCEs are applied to
   quantify the uncertainty of Hymod's predictions. The results indicate
   that, both 2- and 3-order PCEs can well reflect the uncertainty of the
   streamflow predictions. The means and variances of 2-and 3-order PCEs
   are consistent with those obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
   method. However, for detailed distributions at selected periods, the
   histograms obtained by 3-order PCE are more accurate than those
   generated by 2-order PCE, when compared with the histograms obtained by
   MC simulation method.}},

Abstract = {{The communication of side information forms a key component of several
   effective strategies for transmitter adaptation to slowly fading
   channels. When the relevant side information is a subspace, the feedback
   scheme can be viewed as a lossy source compression scheme on the
   Grassmannian manifold. Memoryless vector quantization on each fading
   block is a viable compression scheme, but it neglects any temporal
   correlation between the blocks. In this paper, we propose an incremental
   approach to Grassmannian quantization that takes advantage of temporal
   correlation. The approach leverages existing codebooks for memoryless
   quantization schemes and employs a quantized form of geodesic
   interpolation. Two schemes that implement the principles of the proposed
   approach are presented. In the first scheme, the choice of the step size
   in the incremental update is adapted to a first-order GaussMarkov model
   for the channel, which enables the use of higher resolution codebooks.
   In the second scheme, a single bit is allocated to the step size, which
   enables adaptation of the step size to the channel realization rather
   than the channel statistics. This provides substantial robustness
   against mismatches in the model for the temporal correlation. A
   distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is that the direction of
   the geodesic interpolation is specified implicitly using a point in a
   conventional codebook. As a result, the approach has an inherent ability
   to recover autonomously from errors in the feedback path. Simulation
   results demonstrate that these features result in improved performance
   over some existing schemes in a variety of channel environments.}},

Abstract = {{Structural performance of a weld joint primarily depends on the
   microstructural characteristics of heat-affected zone (HAZ). In this
   regard, the HAZ in X100 ferrite-bainite pipeline steel was studied by
   separating the HAZ into intercritically reheated coarse-grained (ICCG)
   HAZ containing and non-containing regions. These two regions were
   individually evaluated for Charpy impact toughness and characterized by
   electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). Low toughness of similar to
   50 J was obtained when the notch of impact specimen encountered ICCGHAZ
   and high toughness of similar to 180 J when the notch did not contain
   ICCGHAZ. Fracture surface was similar to 60 pct brittle in the absence
   of ICCGHAZ, and 95 pct brittle (excluding shear lip) in the presence of
   ICCGHAZ in the impact tested samples. The underlying reason is the
   microstructure of ICCGHAZ consisted of granular bainite and upper
   bainite with necklace-type martensite-austenite (M-A) constituent along
   grain boundaries. The presence of necklace-type M-A constituent notably
   increases the susceptibility of cleavage microcrack nucleation. ICCGHAZ
   was found to be both the initiation site of the whole fracture and
   cleavage facet initiation site during brittle fracture propagation
   stage. Furthermore, the study of secondary microcracks beneath CGHAZ and
   ICCGHAZ through EBSD suggested that the fracture mechanism changes from
   nucleation-controlled in CGHAZ to propagation-controlled in ICCGHAZ
   because of the presence of necklace-type M-A constituent in ICCGHAZ.
   Both fracture mechanisms contribute to the poor toughness of the sample
   contained ICCGHAZ.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous sub-nanometre Tb-doped SiOxNy/SiO2 superlattices were
   fabricated by means of alternating deposition of 0.7 nm thick Tb-doped
   SiOxNy layers and of 0.9 nm thick SiO2 barrier layers in an
   electron-cyclotron-resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition
   system with in situ Tb-doping capability. High resolution transmission
   electron microscopy images showed a well-preserved superlattice
   morphology after annealing at a high temperature of 1000 degrees C. In
   addition, transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes were deposited
   by electron beam evaporation using a shadow mask approach to allow for
   the optoelectronic characterization of superlattices. Tb3+ luminescent
   spectral features were obtained using three different excitation
   sources: UV laser excitation (photoluminescence (PL)), under a bias
   voltage (electroluminescence (EL)) and under a highly energetic electron
   beam (cathodoluminescence (CL)). All techniques displayed Tb3+ inner
   transitions belonging to D-5(4) levels except for the CL spectrum, in
   which D-5(3) transition levels were also observed. Two competing
   mechanisms were proposed to explain the spectral differences observed
   between PL (or EL) and CL excitation: the population rate of the D-5(3)
   state and the non-radiative relaxation rate of the D-5(3)-D-5(4)
   transition due to a resonant OH-mode. Moreover, the large number of
   interfaces (trapping sites) that electrons have to get through was
   identified as the main reason for observing a bulk-limited charge
   transport mechanism governed by Poole-Frenkel conduction in the J-V
   characteristic. Finally, a linear EL-J dependence was measured, with
   independent spectral shape and an EL onset voltage as low as 6.7 V.
   These amorphous sub-nanometre superlattices are meant to provide
   low-cost solutions in different areas including sensing, photovoltaics
   or photonics.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of prior deformation conditions on the bainitic
   transformation are investigated using dilatometry and optical
   metallography. The influences of both deformation temperature and strain
   on bainite transformation kinetics and morphology are examined in
   superbainitic carbide-free steel. The transformation is retarded by
   deformation at high temperature due to the retardation of bainite growth
   by dislocation debris in deformed austenite. At low deformation
   temperatures, the initial transformation rate is accelerated due to the
   presence of prolific nucleation sites in deformed austenite. The growth
   rate is, again, retarded by deformation. The combined effect of
   accelerated nucleation and retarded growth results in a complex
   dependence of the phase transformation kinetics on applied strain. For
   small deformation strains at 300 degrees C, the overall transformation
   kinetics is faster than that in the non-deformed material. From a
   practical point of view, this provides an important opportunity to
   reduce the processing times for carbide-free bainitic steels.
   Interestingly, both the final transformed bainite and retained austenite
   fraction under these conditions are much higher than the non-deformed
   material. The retardation of growth dominates the overall transformation
   kinetics at large strains and low temperature leading to a high volume
   fraction of martensite in the final microstructure. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Network coding (NC) is a technique that allows intermediate nodes to
   combine the received packets from multiple links and forwarded to
   subsequent nodes. Compared with pure relaying, using NC in a wireless
   network, one can potentially improve the network throughput, but it
   increases the complexity of resource allocations as the quality of one
   transmission is often affected by the transmission conditions of
   multiple links. In this paper, we consider an ad hoc network, where all
   the links have bidirectional communications, and a relay node forwards
   traffic between the source and the destination nodes using NC. All
   transmissions share the same frequency channel, and simultaneous
   transmissions cause interference to each other. We consider both digital
   NC and analog NC strategies, referred to as DNC and ANC, respectively,
   and schedule transmission time and power of the nodes in order to
   maximize the overall network throughput. For DNC, an optimum scheduling
   is formulated and solved by assuming that a central controller is
   available to collect all the link gain information and make the
   scheduling decisions. Distributed scheduling schemes are proposed for
   networks using DNC and ANC. Our results indicate that the proposed
   scheduling scheme for DNC achieves higher throughput than pure relaying,
   and the scheduling scheme for ANC can achieve higher throughput than
   both DNC and pure relaying under certain conditions. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In a relay-assisted cellular network, the transmission mode (either
   direct transmission or relaying) and the transmit power of the source
   and relay nodes affect not only transmission rates of individual links
   but also the rates of other links sharing the same channel. In this
   paper, we propose a cross-layer design that jointly considers the
   transmission mode/relay node selection (MRS) with power allocation (PA)
   to optimize the system rate. We first formulate an optimization problem
   for a cellular system, where the same frequency channel can be reused in
   different cells. A low complexity heuristic MRS scheme is proposed on
   the basis of the link and interference conditions of the source and
   potential relay nodes. Given the transmission mode and relay node (if
   the relaying mode is chosen) of each link, the transmit power of the
   source and relay nodes can be solved by geometric programming. This
   method for MRS and PA can achieve a close-to-optimum performance, but
   implementing the PA requires heavy signalling exchanged among cells. To
   reduce the signalling overheads, we finally proposed a heuristic and
   distributed method for MRS and PA inspired by some asymptotic analysis.
   Numerical results are conducted to demonstrate the rate performance of
   the proposed methods.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   P(DEA-co-FS) microgels dispersed in aqueous solution could undergo
   volume phase transitions triggered by O-2 and/or CO2 aeration. The
   particles were very responsive to CO2, while their responsivity to O-2
   was moderate. Microgels having different levels of the responsivity
   could be designed and prepared by varying the FS content in the
   copolymer. The phase transitions were also highly reversible, and the
   initial states of microgels could be easily recovered by ``washing off

Abstract = {{We report the design and development of a series of novel ionic liquid
   polymers (PILs) which possess thermoresponsive properties in organic
   solvent. The PILs were synthesized via reversible additionfragmentation
   chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium
   bromide and N-isopropylacrylamide, followed by anion exchange of bromide
   to amino acid d-alanine. The PILs possessed 0.36-0.76 molar fraction of
   ionic liquid with number-average molecular weight of 2.70-8.17 kg/mol
   and polydispersity index ranging between 1.12 and 1.25. The
   copolymerizations followed first-order reaction kinetics, and they were
   well-controlled, as indicated by the linear increase of molecular weight
   with monomer conversion. The PILs were thermoresponsive in acetonitrile
   with upper critical solution temperatures (UCST) varying from 25.7 to
   34.8 degrees C, owing to the introduction of anion of amino acid. The
   PILs could be completely precipitated out by lowering the solution
   temperature. The PIL/acetonitrile solutions were used as extract phase
   for separation of tocopherol homologues in hexane. The distribution
   coefficient of delta-tocopherol between the extract and raffinate phases
   (D-delta) and the selectivity coefficient of delta-tocopherol to
   alpha-tocopherol (S-delta/alpha) reached as high as 7.86 and 13.0,
   respectively, while D-beta\&\&GAMMA; was 3.63 and S-beta\&\&GAMMA;/alpha
   was 6.0. The mole ratio of alpha-tocopherol in the raffinate phase
   increased from 0.08 to 0.27 after one stage extraction. The PILs could
   be reused for multiple extraction cycles with negligible change in the
   tocopherol distribution and selectivity coefficients. The
   thermoresponsivity of the PILs is of great benefit by eliminating the
   normally required back extraction steps. This work demonstrates the
   potential of thermoresponsive polymers for use in high performance
   separation of natural products.}},

Abstract = {{The key property of proteinnanoparticle conjugates is the bioactivity of
   the protein. The ability to accurately modulate the activity of protein
   on the nanoparticles at the interfaces is important in many
   applications. In the work reported here, modulation of the activity of
   proteingold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugates by specifically orienting the
   protein and by varying the surface density of the protein was
   investigated. Different orientations were achieved by introducing
   cysteine (Cys) residues at specific sites for binding to gold. We chose
   Escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) as a model protein
   and used site-directed mutagenesis to generate two mutant types (MTs)
   with a single Cys residue on the surface: MT1 with Cys near the active
   center and MT2 with Cys far from the active center. The relative
   activities of AuNP conjugates with wild type (WT), MT1, and MT2 were
   found to be 44.8\%, 68.8\%, and 91.2\% of native PPase in aqueous
   solution. Site-directed orientation with the binding site far from the
   active center thus allowed almost complete preservation of the protein
   activity. The relative activity of WT and MT2 conjugates did not change
   with the surface density of the protein, while that of MT1 increased
   significantly with increasing surface density. These results demonstrate
   that site-directed orientation and surface density can both modulate the
   activity of proteins conjugated to AuNP and that orientation has a
   greater effect than density. Furthermore, increasing the surface density
   of the specifically oriented protein MT2, while having no significant
   effect on the specific activity of the protein, still allowed increased
   protein loading on the AuNP and thus increased the total protein
   activity. This is of great importance in the study on the interface of
   protein and nanoparticle and the applications for enzyme immobilization,
   drug delivery, and biocatalysis.}},

   the sides, can enhance their lateral response characteristics. This
   study investigates the lateral response of modified rectangular FREls
   (MR-FREIs) through experimental tests and 3D finite element analysis.
   Experimental test results of five FREls with and without modifications
   are used to evaluate the 3D finite element models. These models are
   subsequently used to investigate the effect of modifications on the
   lateral behavior of the isolators, in addition to the stress and strain
   demands in the elastomer and fiber reinforcement layers. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Sell assembled quantum structures have been successfully grown for some
   time now but control over their uniformity has proven difficult due to
   the stochastic nature of surface diffusion. We have investigated the
   effect of vicinal InP(001) substrates on the uniformity of InAs quantum
   wires grown on InGaAlAs lattice-matched to InP using molecular beam
   epitaxy. Dense quantum wires were grown on both nominally flat and
   vicinal substrates off-cut by 0.9 degrees toward the {[}110] direction
   for comparison. The off-cut angle was chosen to provide terraces which
   match the orientation and spacing of wires grown on nominally flat
   substrates. A modest but statistically significant improvement in the
   size distribution of the wires was observed on vicinal substrates
   through the analysis of ultrahigh resolution scanning electron
   micrographs. The interface between the wires and the off-cut substrate
   was studied using cross-sectional high resolution scanning transmission
   electron microscopy. In addition, a kinetic Monte Carlo model of
   epitaxial growth including full strain calculations was developed to
   further investigate the nucleation process. Using an anisotropic bond
   model to account for the surface energy of different crystallographic
   facets, our simulations produced wires similar to those observed
   experimentally while demonstrating the importance of anisotropic
   bundling compared to anisotropic diffusion. Growth on vicinal substrates
   is also simulated here and indicates that off-cut substrates should
   indeed improve the size distribution of quantum wires under proper
   growth conditions. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{354-365}},

Abstract = {{A macro-micro multi-scale approach is applied to study the fuel-cap
   forming process to identify the effects of friction, material
   constitutive behavior and microstructural features on formability of
   aluminum sheets. In the sample level (macro-scale) model, lower friction
   at contacts between blank and dies/post are found to delay the onset of
   necking. This is due to the fact that the materials from the center and
   outer regions are less hindered by frictional force to flow to the
   regions of most severe deformation. High work hardening index and strain
   rate sensitivity are seen to effectively delay necking and enhance the
   fuel cap stamp formability. Particle distributions in the
   microstructurally-based sub-model are shown to play a weak role in
   pre-necking deformation, and have a large influence on post-necking
   deformation. The post-necking through-thickness thinning process,
   however, is very fast and makes a minor contribution to the total
   formability from initial deformation to final fracture, suggesting that
   continuous cast aluminum sheets with particle stringers may be used for
   stamping fuel cap component as efficiently as the direct chill cast
   aluminum sheets which a more homogeneous particle distribution. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study is to elucidate the impact of
   Martensite-Austenite (M-A) constituents formed at different
   intercritical temperatures on toughness. Gleeble thermal simulation
   technique has been used to produce different intercritically reheated
   coarse grained heat affected zone (ICCGHAZ) microstructures
   corresponding to different reheating temperatures between Ac-1 and Ac-3.
   The instrumental Charpy impact test results of dual pass thermal
   simulation showed that Charpy impact toughness improved with the
   increasing of second peak temperature. The fraction of M-A constituent
   was similar at each temperature. Near-connected coarse necklacing M-A
   constituents (2.4 mu m) formed at 760 degrees C (near to Ac-1) led to
   the worst toughness (42 J) while those formed at 800 degrees C and 840
   degrees C (near to Ac3) resulted in better toughness, respectively 80 J
   and 105 J. M-A constituents formed at 800 degrees C were still coarse
   (2.2 mu m) but had larger interspace compared to 760 degrees C. And
   those formed at 840 degrees C were refined (1.9 mu m) and well dispersed
   by matrix. Notable difference in toughness values is attributed to the
   size and distribution of M-A constituents formed at different
   intercritical temperatures. It is possible to achieve better toughness
   if M-A constituents are well controlled: smaller in size and larger in
   interspacing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Free chlorine from dissolved chlorine gas is widely used as a
   disinfectant for drinking water. The residual chlorine concentration has
   to be continuously monitored and accurately controlled in a certain
   range around 0.5-2 mg/l to ensure drinking water safety and quality.
   However, simple, reliable, and reagent free monitoring devices are
   currently not available. Here, we present a free chlorine sensor that
   uses oxidation of a phenyl-capped aniline tetramer (PCAT) to dope single
   wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and to change their resistance. The
   oxidation of PCAT by chlorine switches the PCAT-SWCNT system into a low
   resistance (p-doped) state which can be detected by probing it with a
   small voltage. The change in resistance is found to be proportional to
   the log-scale concentration of the free chlorine in the sample. The
   p-doping of the PCAT-SWCNT film then can be electrochemically reversed
   by polarizing it cathodically. This sensor not only shows good sensing
   response in the whole concentration range of free chlorine in drinking
   water but is also able to be electrochemically reset back many times
   without the use of any reagents. This simple sensor is ideally suited
   for measuring free chlorine in drinking water continuously. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Depth-of-interaction (DOI) poses a major challenge for a PET system to
   achieve uniform spatial resolution across the field-of-view,
   particularly for small animal and organ-dedicated PET systems. In this
   work, we implemented an analytical method to model system matrix for
   resolution recovery, which was then incorporated in PET image
   reconstruction on a graphical processing unit platform, due to its
   parallel processing capacity. The method utilizes the concepts of
   virtual DOI layers and multi-ray tracing to calculate the coincidence
   detection response function for a given line-of-response. The accuracy
   of the proposed method was validated for a small-bore PET insert to be
   used for simultaneous PET/MR breast imaging. In addition, the
   performance comparisons were studied among the following three cases: 1)
   no physical DOI and no resolution modeling; 2) two physical DOI layers
   and no resolution modeling; and 3) no physical DOI design but with a
   different number of virtual DOI layers. The image quality was
   quantitatively evaluated in terms of spatial resolution
   (full-width-half-maximum and position offset), contrast recovery
   coefficient and noise. The results indicate that the proposed method has
   the potential to be used as an alternative to other physical DOI designs
   and achieve comparable imaging performances, while reducing

Abstract = {{Surface defect inspection of TFT-LCD panels is a critical task in LCD
   manufacturing. In this paper, an automatic defect inspection method
   based on the low-rank matrix reconstruction is proposed. The textured
   background of the LCD image is a low-rank matrix and the foreground
   image with defects can be treated as a sparse matrix. By utilizing the
   Inexact Augmented Lagrange Multipliers (IALM) algorithm, the
   segmentation of a LCD image can be converted into the reconstruction of
   a low-rank matrix with a fraction of its entries arbitrarily corrupted.
   This low-rank matrix reconstruction problem can be exactly solved via
   convex optimization that minimizes a combination of the nuclear norm and
   the l(1)-norm. Also, adaptive parameter selection strategy is proposed
   by conducting deep analysis on the IALM algorithm, which improves the
   generality of the IALM algorithm for different defect types. Experiment
   results show that our inspection algorithm is robust for the defect
   shapes and types under different illumination conditions. The shapes and
   edges of defect areas in the LCD images can be well preserved and
   segmented from textured background by our detection algorithm. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{To research and analyze the differential settlements of foundations
   specifically, site investigations of existing railways and metro were
   firstly carried out. Then, the centrifugal test was used to observe
   differential settlements in different position between foundations on
   the basis of investigation. The theoretical model was established
   according to the stress diffusion method and Fourier method to establish
   an analytical solution of embankment differential settlement between
   different foundations. Finally, theoretical values and experimental
   values were analyzed comparatively. The research results show that both
   in horizontal and vertical directions, evident differential settlement
   exists in a limited area on both sides of the vertical interface between
   different foundations. The foundation with larger elastic modulus can
   transfer more additional stress and cause relatively less settlement.
   Differential settlement value decreases as the distance to vertical
   interface decreases. In the vertical direction of foundation, mass
   differential settlement also exists on both sides of the vertical
   interface and foundation with larger elastic modulus can transfer more
   additional stress. With the increase of relative modulus of different
   foundations, foundation with lower elastic modulus has larger
   settlement. Meanwhile, differential settlement is more obvious. The main
   error sources in theoretical and experimental values include: (a)
   different load form; (b) foundation characteristics differences; (c)
   modulus conversion; (d) effect of soil internal friction.}},

Title = {{Position control of hybrid pneumatic-electric actuators using
   discrete-valued model-predictive control}},
Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The design, modeling and position control of a novel hybrid
   pneumatic-electric actuator for applications in robotics and automation
   is presented. The design incorporates a pneumatic cylinder and DC motor
   connected in parallel. By avoiding the need for a high ratio
   transmission, the design greatly reduces the mechanical impedance that
   can make collisions with conventionally actuated robot arms dangerous. A
   novel discrete-valued model-predictive control (DVMPC) algorithm is
   proposed for controlling the position of the pneumatic cylinder with
   inexpensive on/off solenoid valves. A variant of inverse dynamics
   control is proposed for the DC motor. A prototype was built for
   validating the actuator design and control algorithms. It is used to
   rotate a single-link robot arm. The actuator inertia and static friction
   torque values for the prototype were only 0.6\% and 4\%, respectively,
   of the values found for a comparable actuator from an industrial robot.
   Simulation results for position control of pneumatic actuators with
   different valve speeds and friction coefficients show that the DVMPC
   algorithm outperforms a sliding mode control algorithm in terms of
   position error and expected valve life. Experimental results are
   presented for vertical rotary cycloidal trajectories. Even with the poor
   quantization caused by the on/off valves, the pneumatic cylinder
   controlled by the proposed DVMPC algorithm achieved a 0.7\% root mean
   square error (RMSE) and a 0.25\% steady-state error (SSE). With the
   addition of the DC motor to form the hybrid actuator, the RMSE and SSE
   were reduced to 0.12\% and 0.04\%, respectively. By incorporating a
   novel estimation algorithm, the system was made robust to an unknown
   payload. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Patterning the Stiffness of Elastomeric Nanocomposites by
   Magnetophoretic Control of Cross-linking Impeder Distribution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{474-485}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We report a novel method to pattern the stiffness of an elastomeric
   nanocomposite by selectively impeding the cross-linking reactions at
   desired locations while curing. This is accomplished by using a magnetic
   field to enforce a desired concentration distribution of colloidal
   magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) in the liquid precursor of
   polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. MNPs impede the cross-linking of
   PDMS; when they are dispersed in liquid PDMS, the cured elastomer
   exhibits lower stiffness in portions containing a higher nanoparticle
   concentration. Consequently, a desired stiffness pattern is produced by
   selecting the required magnetic field distribution a priori. Up to 200\%
   variation in the reduced modulus is observed over a 2 mm length, and
   gradients of up to 12.6 MPa center dot mm(-1) are obtained. This is a
   significant improvement over conventional nanocomposite systems where
   only small unidirectional variations can be achieved by varying
   nanoparticle concentration. The method has promising prospects in
   additive manufacturing; it can be integrated with existing systems
   thereby adding the capability to produce microscale heterogeneities in
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization, such as ATRP, has
   been proven to be a powerful method for preparation of well-controlled
   functional grafted polymers. There are thousands of experimental works
   published, by varying polymers, surfaces, and applications. In
   comparison, theoretical developments are very lacking. Many fundamental
   questions still remain to be answered. These questions include, but not
   limited to: What determine the surface initiator efficiency? How many
   chains per square nanometer can be fully grown? What is the maximum
   thickness can polymer grow to? If chains are simultaneously grown from
   surface and solution, which has higher molecular weight? Answers to
   these questions are most helpful for innovation and further development
   in this important area. In this work, we employed recently developed
   theories to explain experimentally observed kinetic profiles of polymer
   layer thickness growth. What limits the growth of surface chains? Is it
   the monomer starvation in grafting layer that slow down propagation? Or
   is it the termination of radicals that stop the chain growth? It was
   found that no existing models could fully explain the often
   contradictory experimental observations. It is our hope that this work
   will provoke further discussions and inspire more effort in resolving
   the fundamental issues of this area.}},
