Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{996-1012}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers a scenario in which signals from an emitter at an
   unknown location are received at a number of different collinear
   locations. The receiver can determine the received signal strength, but
   no other parameters of the signal. Postulating a log-normal transmission
   model with a constant but unknown path loss exponent and, also, an
   unknown transmit power and known noise variance, the paper shows how the
   localization problem can be solved, along with estimating the parameters
   appearing in the log-normal transmission model, given enough
   measurements at different points. The log-normal transmission model
   parameters can be determined first. An algorithm based on construction
   of a Gram matrix is proposed to estimate the path loss exponent and
   transmit power parameters from the received noisy power measurements.
   Since the estimated parameters are biased due to the nonlinearity of the
   model and constraints, a pattern-matching algorithm is also proposed to
   remove the bias in the estimates. The distances corresponding to the
   different received signal strength measurements can then be bounded, and
   finally the location estimation is formulated as a convex optimization
   problem where the estimated distances are used as the new measurements.
   Simulation results are finally provided to assess the efficacy of the
   proposed methods in the parameter and location estimation. (C) 2012

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{93}},

Pages = {{1095-1105}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an algorithm for sparse channel estimation, called
   l(1)-regularized least-absolutes (l(1)-LA), and an algorithm for
   equalization, called linear least-absolutes (LLA), in non-Gaussian
   impulsive noise are proposed. The proposed approaches are based on the
   minimization of the absolute error function, rather than the squared
   error function. By replacing the standard modulus with the l(1)-modulus
   of complex numbers, the resulting optimization problem can be
   efficiently solved through linear programming. The selection of an
   appropriate regularization parameter is also addressed. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms, compared with the
   classical methods, are more robust to impulsive noise and have a
   superior accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influences of work hardening behavior of materials on ductile
   fracture, and especially on void growth and coalescence, have been
   investigated in model materials by in-situ X-ray computed tomography
   (XCT) coupled with tensile deformation. The model materials contain an
   artificial void array embedded in a metal matrix. By producing such
   materials with different metal matrices (pure copper, brass, Glidcop =
   copper strengthened by nanoparticles), the influences of the work
   hardening behaviors on void growth and coalescence/linkage process are
   analyzed. This set of experiments were performed at Japanese synchrotron
   radiation facility SPring-8 BL20XU beamline, whereby the X-ray
   tomography setup with one of the highest spatial resolution in the world
   is available. This beamline however provides less brilliant X-rays
   compared to the ESRF ID15 beamline where the our previous experiments
   were performed Hosokava et al. (Acta Mater, 60:2829-2839, 2012), (Acta
   Mater, 61:1021-1036, 2013). To compensate for the X-ray absorption
   problems, the specimens to be tested have to be much smaller, making the
   experiments more difficult. Nevertheless, the growth and linkage
   behaviors of the artificial voids were successfully visualized, and the
   plastic strain whereby the linkage takes place (referred to as the
   linkage strain, hereafter) were quantitatively captured. The models for
   void coalescence developed by Thomason and by Pardoen and Hutchinson
   both predict coalescence rather well for both brass and Glidcop, even
   though the linkage events were found to be dominated by the meso/macro
   shear localization process.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the magnetoconductance that can be generated at tunnel
   junction contacts with disordered normal (DN) materials. We use
   self-assembled 1,4-butanedithiol-linked gold nanoparticle films as a
   prototype DN material and different types of tunnel junction contacts,
   namely one native to a gold electrode/1,4-butanedithiol interface and
   another naturally occurring at aluminum/aluminum oxide layer. For
   control measurements, we also study normal metal and superconducting
   contacts above and below critical temperature Tc in place of tunnel
   junction contacts. We focus on a nanoparticle film regime where contact
   resistance is significant, i.e. when films are metallic and have low
   resistance. In this regime, superconducting contacts yield a zero-field
   magnetoconductance enhancement due to ``reflectionless tunneling{''}
   below Tc. Normal metal contacts do not yield significant
   magnetoconductance. This is also true for superconducting contacts above
   Tc when the superconductor becomes a normal metal. When a tunnel
   junction is present between the normal metal and the DN material, a
   similar to 10\% zero-field magnetoconductance suppression appears at
   temperatures below similar to 10 K. We propose a mechanism for the
   tunnel junction mediated magnetoconductance based on coherent back
   scattering in disordered granular materials, percolation and a local
   nature of current flow across planar tunnel junctions. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a versatile technique for constructing fast microwave
   component models at a low computational cost. Our modeling procedure
   consists of two stages: (i) kriging interpolation of coarsely
   discretized electromagnetic simulation data of the device under
   consideration and (ii) enhancing the kriging model by using space
   mapping and a limited amount of high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation
   data. The use of coarse discretization data allows for low-cost model
   generation, whereas space mapping is a convenient way of ensuring its
   accuracy. Our approach can be applied to almost any type of microwave
   device; it can also work with other types of nonsmooth or costly
   low-fidelity models. The operation and performance of our methodology is
   demonstrated using a variety of microwave components, including a
   microstrip filter, a planar ultrawideband antenna, and a
   microstrip-to-coplanar waveguide transition. Copyright (c) 2012 John

   emitter/source terminals and between gate and base/body terminals, allow
   for tuning the photoresponse from sublinear to slightly above linear,
   satisfying the application requirements for wide dynamic range,
   high-contrast, or linear imaging. MOSFETs from a standard 0.18-mu m

Abstract = {{A predictive compressive strength model accounting for the type of
   cement, cement degree of hydration, aggregates type and gradation,
   mixtures proportion and air content was developed. This paper presents
   the formulation, implementation, calibration and validation of the
   proposed strength model for normal concrete. The theoretical formulation
   postulates that particles' interaction is governed by excess paste
   theory from which an average paste thickness model is developed to
   account for concrete mixture proportions and aggregate gradation. In
   addition, the model accounts for the cement compressive strength and
   aggregate to cement paste bond strength. An experimental programme,
   developed to evaluate the model, accounts for the following variables:

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{34-48}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) model is used to determine the effect
   of axial load on column strength and stability during a blast event. The
   model, which accounts for the axial load-bending interaction (P-delta
   effect) and strain rate effect on the column dynamic response, is
   validated by comparing its results with experimental data from blast
   tests on full scale steel columns and with the results of the finite
   element software LS-DYNA. Maximum displacements and moments obtained
   from SDOF analysis are also compared with the results of the interaction
   formulas recommended by the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 3-340-02)
   design manual for steel structures. It is shown that the UFC method
   overestimates the column capacity for ductility ratios mu greater than
   one, irrespective of the axial load to Euler elastic buckling load ratio
   (P/P-e). Also for P/P-e > 0.5, even if mu < 1.0, the UFC method still
   overestimates the actual column capacity. For dealing with this problem
   in practical applications, non-dimensional beam column curves are
   developed to include the effects of the blast load and column properties
   on both its strength and stability. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Microfluidic-based Electrotaxis for On-demand Quantitative Analysis of
   Caenorhabditis elegans' Locomotion}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{75}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a versatile model organism for
   biomedical research because of its conservation of disease-related genes
   and pathways as well as its ease of cultivation. Several C. elegans
   disease models have been reported, including neurodegenerative disorders
   such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which involves the degeneration of
   dopaminergic (DA) neurons(1). Both transgenes and neurotoxic chemicals
   have been used to induce DA neurodegeneration and consequent movement
   defects in worms, allowing for investigations into the basis of
   neurodegeneration and screens for neuroprotective genes and
   compounds(2,3).
   Screens in lower eukaryotes like C. elegans provide an efficient and
   economical means to identify compounds and genes affecting neuronal
   signaling. Conventional screens are typically performed manually and
   scored by visual inspection; consequently, they are time-consuming and
   prone to human errors. Additionally, most focus on cellular level
   analysis while ignoring locomotion, which is an especially important
   parameter for movement disorders.
   We have developed a novel microfluidic screening system (Figure 1) that
   controls and quantifies C. elegans' locomotion using electric field
   stimuli inside microchannels. We have shown that a Direct Current (DC)
   field can robustly induce on-demand locomotion towards the cathode
   ({''}electrotaxis{''})(4). Reversing the field's polarity causes the
   worm to quickly reverse its direction as well. We have also shown that
   defects in dopaminergic and other sensory neurons alter the swimming
   response(5). Therefore, abnormalities in neuronal signaling can be
   determined using locomotion as a read-out. The movement response can be
   accurately quantified using a range of parameters such as swimming
   speed, body bending frequency and reversal time.
   Our work has revealed that the electrotactic response varies with age.
   Specifically, young adults respond to a lower range of electric fields
   and move faster compared to larvae(4). These findings led us to design a
   new microfluidic device to passively sort worms by age and phenotype(6).
   We have also tested the response of worms to pulsed DC and Alternating
   Current (AC) electric fields. Pulsed DC fields of various duty cycles
   effectively generated electrotaxis in both C. elegans and its cousin C.
   briggsae(7). In another experiment, symmetrical AC fields with
   frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 3 KHz immobilized worms inside the
   channel(8).
   Implementation of the electric field in a microfluidic environment
   enables rapid and automated execution of the electrotaxis assay. This
   approach promises to facilitate high-throughput genetic and chemical
   screens for factors affecting neuronal function and viability.}},

Abstract = {{An improved bias correction method for daily general circulation model
   (GCM) precipitation is presented. The method belongs to the widely used
   family of quantile mapping correction methods. The method uses different
   instances of gamma function that are fitted on multiple discrete
   segments on the precipitation cumulative density function (CDF), instead
   of the common quantile-quantile approach that uses one theoretical
   distribution to fit the entire CDF. This imposes to the method the
   ability to better transfer the observed precipitation statistics to the
   raw GCM data. The selection of the segment number is performed by an
   information criterion to poise between complexity and efficiency of the
   transfer function. The global precipitation output of Institut Pierre
   Simon Laplace Coupled Model for the period 1960-2000 is bias corrected
   using the precipitation observations of WATCH Forcing Data. The
   1960-1980 period of observations was used to calibrate the bias
   correction method, while 1981-2000 was used for validation. The proposed

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{By using the known formalism for the effect of an externally applied
   electric field, E, on thermodynamics of a dielectric material, we
   calculated the field-induced configurational entropy factor, Delta
   S-conf(E)/E-2, of 50 dipolar liquids, including those whose static
   permittivity, epsilon(s), decreases on cooling. The field induced
   change, Delta S-conf(E), is found to be experimentally detectable only
   when E is on the order of 10(5) V/cm, a value less than the dielectric
   breakdown field strength of some liquids but in the range of nonlinear
   dielectric response. We argue that the dielectric response is formally
   nonlinear already for E > 0, and then show that the difference between
   the Langevin-function and the extrapolated linear response is < 0.15\%
   for E in the 10(5) V/cm range. Therefore, such high E values may be used
   to estimate Delta S-conf(E). We conclude that (i) for E in the 10(5)
   V/cm range, Delta S-conf(E) is high enough to produce a measurable
   change in the viscosity and relaxation time of some ultraviscous liquids
   with prominent dipolar interactions, thereby changing their glass
   formation temperature, and (ii) application of E would reversibly
   transform, isothermally, some liquids to glass, and transform some
   glasses to liquid. Finally, we suggest that the effect of E can be used
   to determine the merits of the models for non-Arrhenius kinetics. (C)

Title = {{A Bayesian model averaging based multi-kernel Gaussian process
   regression framework for nonlinear state estimation and quality

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Batch processes are characterized by inherent nonlinearity, multiplicity
   of operating phases, between-phase transient dynamics and batch-to-batch
   uncertainty that pose significant challenges for accurate state
   estimation and quality prediction. Conventional multi-model strategies,
   however, may be ill-suited for multiphase batch processes because the
   localized models do not specially take into account the complex
   transient dynamics between two consecutive operating phases. In this
   study, a novel Bayesian model averaging based multi-kernel Gaussian
   process regression (BMA-MKGPR) approach is proposed for state estimation
   and quality prediction of nonlinear batch processes with multiple
   operating phases and between-phase transient dynamics. A kernel mixture
   model strategy is first used to identify the different operating phases
   of batch processes and then the multi-kernel GPR models are built for
   all the identified phases. Further, the between-phase transitional stage
   is determined by the posterior probabilities of measurement samples with
   respect to the two consecutive phases so that the Bayesian model
   averaging strategy can be designed to incorporate the two localized GPR
   models for handling the between-phase transient dynamics. For an
   arbitrary test sample within the transitional stage, its posterior
   probabilities with respect to the local models corresponding to the two
   consecutive phases are set as the adaptive weightings to integrate the
   corresponding local GPR models for state estimation and quality
   prediction. The proposed BMA-MKGPR approach is applied to a multiphase
   batch polymerization process and the result comparison demonstrates that
   the presented method can effectively handle multiple nonlinear operating
   phases, between-phase transient dynamics and process uncertainty with
   fairly high prediction accuracies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this Letter we present the detailed, quantitative comparison between
   experimentally and theoretically derived structures of the extended
   \{311\} defect in silicon. Agreement between experimental and
   theoretical column positions of better than +/- 0.05 nm has been
   achieved for all 100 atomic columns in the defect structure. This
   represents a calculated density of 5.5 x 10(14) silicon interstitials
   per cm(2) on \{311\} planes, in agreement with previous work {[}S.
   Takeda, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Part 2, 30, L639 ( 1991)]. We show that
   although the \{311\} defect is made up of five-, six-, seven-, and
   eight-member rings, the shape of these rings varies as a function of
   position along the defect, and these variations can be determined
   experimentally with high precision and accuracy. The excellent agreement
   between the calculated and experimentally derived structure, including
   the position of atomic columns and the shape of the distinct structural
   units of the defect, provides strong evidence for the quality and
   robustness of the molecular dynamics simulation approach for structural
   studies of defects. The experimental approach is straightforward,
   without the need for complicated image processing methods, and is
   therefore widely applicable. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.166102}},

   two-point correlation function for multicomponent alloys that uses the
   local species concentrations to interpolate between different crystal
   structures. A simplified version of the model is derived for the
   particular case of three-component (ternary) alloys, and its equilibrium
   properties are demonstrated. Dynamical equations of motion for the
   density and multiple species concentration fields are derived, and the
   robustness of the model is illustrated with examples of complex

   solid-state precipitation. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.87.134105}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces new heat exchanger network (HEN) model for networks
   containing single phase and two phase exchangers. Rigorous simulation of
   HEN performance requires sequential solutions of two sets of linear
   equations: mass balances and energy balances which are linear in
   temperatures. This enables data reconciliation via QR factorization as
   sequential solution of linear mass and energy balances. Hence,
   reconciliation of energy balances can be added as a follow-on step to
   material balance reconciliation, thereby greatly simplifying data
   reconciliation in process plants. If simultaneous reconciliation of
   flows, temperatures and heat transfer coefficients is required, the
   convergence is attained in a handful of successive substitution
   iteration via QR factorization. Similarly, optimization of the HENs
   based on the proposed model converges in two three to five successive
   linear programming iterations. Excellent convergence of the proposed HEN
   model makes it suitable for use in large scale site-wide energy models.

Volume = {{228}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the applicability and performance of an integrated solid
   oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and compressed air energy storage (CAES) plant
   with and without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in a
   load-following power production scenario is investigated. Ten different
   process configurations are simulated using a combination of Aspen Plus
   2006.5 and MATLAB tools. It was found that the addition of CAES to an
   SOFC plant provided significant load-following capabilities with
   relatively small penalties to efficiencies (1.1\%HHV) and levelized
   costs of electricity (LCOE) (0.08-0.3 cent kW(-1) h(-1)). The
   load-following capabilities of the CAES-enabled plants, as measured by
   proposed squared-error based metrics, were excellent and were not
   impacted by the addition of CCS. CCS-enabled configurations using SOFCs
   with and without CAES are able to reduce direct CO2 emissions to
   essentially zero. The introduction of a seasonal, partial power train
   shutdown schedule, while useful for maintenance and cleaning purposes,
   also reduces fuel consumption by 9.5\% with very small penalties to the
   overall load-following performance of the SOFC/CAES plant. Although
   SOFCs are perhaps decades away from being implemented on the scale
   discussed in this study, the forward-looking energy conversion strategy
   proposed in this work shows promise for providing future carbon-free
   peaking power. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus in this work is on modeling of mechanical response of
   granular materials that display inherent anisotropy. Both the
   experimental and numerical investigations are described. First, the
   results of direct shear as well as drained/undrained triaxial tests that
   involve crushed limestone with elongated angular-shaped particles are
   reviewed. Afterward, a mathematical framework is presented for modeling
   of elastic/ inelastic deformation that incorporates the multi-laminate
   approach. The deformation is monitored on a set of randomly oriented
   planes, and the formulation incorporates the thickness of the shear band
   that is associated with sliding/separation process. A systematic
   procedure for identification of material functions/ parameters is
   outlined that is based on the results of direct shear tests, and the
   framework is later applied to simulate the behavior under triaxial
   conditions. The results of numerical simulations are compared with the
   experimental data. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Scintillation crystal design is a critical component in positron
   emission tomography system development, which impacts a number of
   performance parameters including energy resolution, time resolution and
   spatial resolution. Our work aims to develop a generalized simulation
   tool to model the light transport inside scintillation crystals with
   good accuracy, taking into account surface treatments, reflectors,
   temporal dependence of scintillation decay, and comprehensive
   experimental validations. The simulation has been validated against both
   direct analytical calculation and experimental measurements. In this
   work, the studies were performed for a lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate
   crystal of 3x3x20 mm(3) dimension coupled to a Hamamatsu silicon
   photomultiplier, with respect to light output, rise-time slope, energy
   resolution and time resolution. Four crystal surface treatment and
   reflector configurations were investigated: GroundMetal, GroundPaint,
   PolishMetal and PolishPaint. The experiments were performed to validate
   the Monte Carlo simulation results. The results indicate that the best
   time resolution (0.96+/-0.05 ns) and good energy resolution
   (10.6+/-0.4\%) could be produced by using a polished surface with
   specular reflector, while the configuration of a polished surface with
   diffusive reflector produces the best energy resolution (10.2+/-0.9\%).
   The results indicate that a polished surface with diffusive reflector
   achieves the best energy resolution (10.2+/-0.9\%) for 511 keV high
   energy photons, and a polished surface with specular reflector achieves
   the best time resolution (0.96+/-0.05 ns) measured against a Hamamatsu
   fast photomultiplier tube. The ground surface treatment is not
   recommended for its inferior performance in terms of energy and time
   resolution. Possible explanations and future improvements to be made to
   the developed simulation tool are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Prevention of coagulation appears not to be possible when a foreign

   lysing surface has therefore been suggested. In this work, a mimic of
   the fibrinolytic system was constructed on L605 cobaltchromium coronary
   stents. Lysine which, immobilized on a surface, has been shown
   previously to adsorb plasminogen in contact with blood was attached to
   the stent using poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(HEMA)) as a
   spacer. The lysine-poly(HEMA) modified stent was shown to have low
   nonspecific protein adsorption and to bind plasminogen in high quantity
   from plasma. Following exposure to plasma and treatment with tissue
   plasminogen activator, the lysine-modified stents showed clot-lysing
   properties in vitro while the unmodified L605 stents did not. It was
   shown that the modified stents retained their clot lysing properties
   after 24h exposure to plasma.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the design of steel plate elements of rectangular
   industrial ducts. Because of the practical aspect ratios and the
   stiffener arrangements, such a plate element is often treated as a long
   plate (one way slab), fixed supported at the edges and subjected to
   transverse pressure. The design pressure and the deflection limit
   determine the plate thickness and the stiffener spacing. Current design
   practice considers the geometrical nonlinearity, however, uses the
   strength criterion of first yield. This investigation postulates that
   consideration of partial yielding of the plate may result in an
   economical design option, while meeting the serviceability criterion.
   The study is based on nonlinear finite element analyses of long plates
   subjected to increasing transverse pressure. Dimensionless parameters
   that characterize the behavior of such plates were identified and varied
   in a parametric study. Based on these analyses, design equations have
   been established for plate thickness and for stiffener spacing
   corresponding to three different scenarios namely; 0\%, 16.5\%, and 33\%
   of through thickness partial yielding of the plate. Results show that
   allowing for 16.5\% yielding results in 50\% increase in stiffener
   spacing, at the expense of about 40\% increase in deflections. Partially
   yielding plates can satisfy the serviceability limits states and can
   lead to economical stiffened plate systems for large rectangular
   industrial ducts.}},

Abstract = {{Stationary roadside units (RSUs) deployed along highways are generally
   considerably distant with each other, which leads to large areas that
   are not covered by any RSU. When mobile vehicles enter these areas,
   their communications are in outage. In order to reduce the outage time,
   an adaptive carry-store forward (ACSF) scheme is proposed in this
   letter, where a vehicle is selected to relay the communications for a
   target vehicle in the uncovered areas. To keep the target and the
   relaying vehicles to have continuous communications in the uncovered
   areas, the relaying vehicle should carry and store a sufficient amount
   of data that are destined to the target vehicle in advance, and the
   moving speed of the target vehicle can be adaptively changed according
   to the relaying vehicle. The optimum moving speeds of the target vehicle
   are solved and the best relaying vehicle is selected in order to
   minimize the communication outage time of the target vehicle. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed ACSF scheme can greatly reduce the
   communication outage time.}},

Abstract = {{Natural type selection was originally proposed by Zamir and Rose for
   universal single description coding. In this paper, we generalize this
   principle to universal multiple description coding (MDC). Two schemes
   based on random codebooks are proposed: one is of fixed distortion and
   the other is of fixed weight. Their operational sum-rate-distortion
   functions are derived, which coincide with the EGC (El Gamal-Cover)
   sum-rate bound if the parameters of the schemes are optimized. It is
   also shown that in both schemes the joint type of reconstruction
   codewords can be used to improve the rate-distortion (R-D) performance.
   Based on our theoretical results, a practical universal scheme is
   proposed by leveraging the MDC methods based on low-density generator
   matrix (LDGM) codes. The performance of this scheme is compared
   experimentally with the EGC bound, which shows its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic channel estimation is an important problem in various
   applications. Unlike many existing channel estimation techniques that
   need known probe or training signals, this paper develops a blind
   multipath channel identification algorithm. The proposed approach is
   based on the single-input multiple-output model and exploits the sparse
   multichannel structure. Three sparse representation algorithms, namely,
   matching pursuit, orthogonal matching pursuit, and basis pursuit, are
   applied to the blind sparse identification problem. Compared with the
   classical least squares approach to blind multichannel estimation, the
   proposed scheme does not require that the channel order be exactly
   determined and it is robust to channel order selection. Moreover, the
   ill-conditioning induced by the large delay spread is overcome by the
   sparse constraint. Simulation results for deconvolution of both
   underwater and room acoustic channels confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson photon-counting model is accurate for optical channels with
   low received intensity, such as long-range intersatellite optical

   capacity and the design of capacity-approaching, nonuniform signaling
   for discrete-time Poisson channels in the presence of dark current and
   underaverage and peak amplitude constraints. Although the capacity of
   this channel is unknown, numerical computation of the channel capacity
   is implemented using a particle method. A nonuniform mapper is coupled
   to a low-density parity check code and a joint demapper-decoder is
   designed based on the sum-product algorithm. Simulations indicate
   near-capacity performance of the proposed coding system and significant
   gains over information rates using traditional uniform signaling. A key
   observation of this work is that significant gains in rate can be
   achieved for the same average power consumption by using optical
   transceivers with nonuniform signaling and a modest increase in peak
   power.}},

   The BisAM to chain transfer agent (CTA) ratios from 1 to 40 at a
   constant {[}AM](0)/{[}CTA](0) of 600 were investigated at 60 degrees C.
   The s-PAMs with the number of arms of 1.4-12.8 and 1.8-8.4 were,
   respectively, produced by arm-first (AF) and core-first (CF) approaches,
   whereas the b-PAMs having the branching density of 1.34-13.1C/1000Cs
   were synthesized by constant BisAM feeding (semibatch polymerization,
   SB) and batch (batch polymerization, BA). Soluble b-PAMs were produced
   with the four feeding policies at {[}BisAM](0)/{[}CTA](0) of 5. However,
   when the {[}BisAM](0)/{[}CTA](0) was increased to 30, the gelation

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1557-1570}},

Abstract = {{A new method of de-interlacing is proposed. De-interlacing is revisited
   as the problem of assigning a sequence of interpolation methods
   (interpolators) to a sequence of missing pixels of an interlaced frame
   (field). With this assumption, our de-interlacing algorithm
   (de-interlacer), undergoes transitions from one interpolation method to
   another, as it moves from one missing pixel position to the horizontally
   adjacent missing pixel position in a missing row of a field. We assume a
   discrete countable-state Markov-chain model on the sequence of
   interpolators (Markov-chain states) which are selected from a
   user-defined set of candidate interpolators. An estimation of the
   optimum sequence of interpolators with the aforementioned Markov-chain
   model requires the definition of an efficient cost function as well as a
   global optimization technique. Our algorithm introduces for the first
   time using a nonlocal cost (NLC) scheme. The proposed algorithm uses the
   NLC to not only measure the fitness of an interpolator at a missing
   pixel position, but also to derive an approximation for transition
   matrix (TM) of the Markov-chain of interpolators. The TM in our
   algorithm is a frame-variate matrix, i.e., the algorithm updates the TM
   for each frame automatically. The algorithm finally uses a Viterbi
   algorithm to find the global optimum sequence of interpolators given the
   cost function defined and neighboring original pixels in hand. Next, we
   introduce a new MAP-based formulation for the estimation of the sequence
   of interpolators this time not by estimating the best sequence of
   interpolators but by successive estimations of the best interpolator at
   each missing pixel using Forward-Backward algorithm. Simulation results
   prove that, while competitive with each other on different test
   sequences, the proposed methods (one using Viterbi and the other
   Forward-Backward algorithm) are superior to state-of-the-art
   de-interlacing algorithms proposed recently. Finally, we propose motion
   compensated versions of our algorithm based on optical flow computation
   methods and discuss how it can improve the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Strain fields around grain boundary dislocations are measured by
   applying geometric phase analysis on atomic resolution images obtained
   from multiple fast acquisitions in scanning transmission electron
   microscopy. Maps of lattice distortions in silicon introduced by an
   array of pure edge dislocations located at a sigma 9(122) grain boundary
   are compared with the predictions from isotropic elastic theory, and the
   atomic structure of dislocation cores is deduced from images displaying
   all the atomic columns. For strain measurements, reducing the
   acquisition time is found to significantly decrease the effects of
   instabilities on the high-resolution images. Contributions from scanning
   artefacts are also diminished by summing multiple images following a
   cross-correlation alignment procedure. Combined with the sub-angstrom
   ngstrom resolution obtained with an aberration corrector, and the stable
   dedicated microscope's environment, therapid acquisition method provides
   the measurements of atomic displacements with accuracy below 10pm.
   Finally, the advantages of combining strain measurements with the
   collection of various analytical signals in a scanning transmission
   electron microscope are discussed.}},

   modulus values of 16 +/- 5, 12 +/- 1, and 3.5 +/- 0.3 GPa at 30\%, 42\%,
   and 64\% relative humidities, respectively. CNC/PEI films had larger
   elastic moduli than NFC/PEI films. Both types of nanocellulose
   multilayer films showed the same modulus dependence on relative humidity
   over the range studied. Results suggest that ambient water might have an
   even more pronounced role in nanocomposites than in traditional natural
   fiber-reinforced composites. This straightforward buckling-based method
   has quantified mechanical properties and provided a useful comparison
   between CNC and NFC films. Furthermore, it qualitatively assesses that
   the components in the composite film are highly compatible and that the
   hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity of cellulose and PEI combined do not
   allow for the full mechanical potential of crystalline cellulose
   nanoelements to be exploited. This work is one approach toward finding
   dependable methods to characterize nanocellulose, specifically
   cellulosic thin films, which is increasingly important as we extract
   nanocellulose from wood, plants, algae, bacteria, and animals and enter
   a new age of cellulose materials.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{707-718}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Bridge design and evaluation involve the determination of the internal
   forces and moments that each bridge element must resist. In
   slab-on-girder bridges, the moment and shear caused by traffic loads are
   normally determined using load distribution factors. These factors are
   derived based on results of analytical models, numerical analyses, as
   well as actual loading tests, but there appears to be scant experimental
   data to gauge their accuracy, particularly beyond the elastic limit
   state. To address the scarcity of the experimental data and to
   understand how the distribution characteristics of concrete slab on
   steel girder composite bridges change with the advent of yielding and
   inelasticity, a 1/3 scale model of a hypothetical composite bridge was
   tested to failure in this study.
   Extensive measurements were taken during the test to allow better
   understanding of the response of slab-on-girder bridges as well as their
   live load distribution characteristics at all stages of loading up to
   failure. The experimentally determined distribution factors for the
   tested bridge model are compared with the calculated values based on the
   Canadian Highway Bridge Design Standard, and the code values are found
   to overestimate the maximum moment in the interior loaded girder by
   about 22\% and 33\% at the elastic and the inelastic states,
   respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate the functional status measured by Berg Balance Scale
   (BBS) in elderly aged more than 65years after hip fractures, and to
   evaluate the influence of sex, age and comorbidity on balance function
   improvement. Methods: The study included 203 patients with hip
   fractures. Functional status was evaluated by BBS: at admission (Group
   1), at discharge (Group 2) and 3months after discharge (Group 3). We
   analyzed three age groups: Group6574, Group7584 and Group85-up; female
   and male sex separately; and for severity index value (SI; total
   cumulative illness rating scale for geriatrics score divided by number
   of endorsed categories): group between 01.99 (SI1) and group 2 (SI2).
   Results: BBS values significantly declined in all male groups and female
   Group 2 and Group 3 in SI2 (P<0.01). Group6574 and Group85-up had a
   significant BBS values decline in Group 2 and Group 3, whereas Group7584
   had a significant decline in all groups in the SI2 group (P<0.01).
   Females and males had a significant BBS values increase in the SI1
   groups (P<0.01), and non-significant BBS values increase between Group
   2/Group 3 for SI2. Group85-up had a significant BBS values increase in
   SI1 (Group 1/Group 2 and Group 1/Group 3; P<0.01); a non-significant
   increase between Group 1/Group 2 and Group 1/Group 3, and a
   non-significant decline between Group 2/Group 3 in SI2. Conclusions:
   Male sex, increased comorbidity and age more than 85years could be
   considered with lower functional recovery capacity potential after hip
   fracture, and thus should be individually assessed and continuously
   monitored. Functional status estimation by BBS could be taken as a
   sensitive predictive value for the evaluation of functional improvement
   in these patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2013; 13: 365371.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing demand within the automotive industry to utilize
   aluminium alloy sheets and their spot welds to facilitate vehicle weight
   reduction and increase fuel economy. While traditional uniaxial tensile
   testing only determines mechanical properties to small strains, direct
   measurement of the constitutive behaviour of aluminium alloy spot welds
   to large strains remains a challenge. For the first time, the present
   work employed digital image correlation coupled with shear testing to
   directly measure the constitutive behaviour of an AA6022-T4 spot weld to
   large strains. The results show that the spot welding process not only
   decreases the yield strength but also lowers the work hardening rate of
   the nugget versus the base material. The paint bake cycle partially
   recovers the yield and shear strength of the nugget. (C) 2012 Crown

Abstract = {{Inhomogeneous plastic deformation in AZ31 magnesium sheet has been
   studied during uniaxial tensile testing using digital image correlation
   and electron backscatter diffraction techniques. Large strain gradients
   develop on the sheet surface parallel and perpendicular to the loading
   direction while very little deformation occurs in the thickness
   direction. This lack of thinning leads to an abrupt fracture following
   the development of a premature but extensive diffuse neck but without
   any localized neck. The strain distribution on the sheet surface evolves
   nonlinearly with strain, impacting the measured plastic strain ratio,
   r-value. The results show that r-value should be measured at
   ``points{''} rather than over the ``gage length{''} in Mg alloys.
   Friction stir processing modifies the basal texture and thus
   significantly improves the forming limit for in-plane plane strain path.

Abstract = {{The silicon-based three-dimensional hybrid long-range plasmonic
   waveguide not only supports long-range propagation distance (similar to
   mm) but also has an ultra-small modal area (similar to 10(-2) mu m(2))
   at 1.55 mu m. Here, we propose a directional coupler for effective
   coupling from a dielectric slab-waveguide to the hybrid plasmonic
   waveguide on a silicon platform. Our simulation results show that the
   coupler is able to excite hybrid long-range plasmonic mode with short
   coupling length, low insertion loss, and high extinction ratio. With the
   arm separation of 0.3 mu m, the coupling length can be made 5.2 \% of
   the propagation length of the hybrid plasmonic waveguide, while the
   insertion loss and extinction ratio are -0.12 and 22.4 dB, respectively.
   This coupler offers the potential applications in signal routing between
   the hybrid long-range plasmonic waveguide and dielectric waveguide in
   the photonic integrated circuits.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated a new technique known as foam granulation for
   the continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals by a twin screw
   extruder. Six grades of hypromellose were compared as binders in the
   trials, using two addition methods: foam injection by auxiliary side
   stuffer feeder and liquid injection directly into the extruder. The
   produced granules were tested for particle size, Carr compressibility
   index and characteristic fracture strength. It was found that
   granulation using foam injection improved powder lubrication inside the
   extruder and wetting uniformity of the lactose, as well as produced
   granules having lower Carr indices. (c) 2012 Canadian Society for

Title = {{Non-exponential nature of calorimetric and other relaxations: Effects of
   2 nm-size solutes, loss of translational diffusion, isomer specificity,
   and sample size}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Certain distributions of relaxation times can be described in terms of a
   non-exponential response parameter, beta, of value between 0 and 1. Both
   beta and the relaxation time, tau(0), of a material depend upon the
   probe used for studying its dynamics and the value of beta is
   qualitatively related to the non-Arrhenius variation of viscosity and
   tau(0). A solute adds to the diversity of an intermolecular environment
   and is therefore expected to reduce beta, i.e., to increase the
   distribution and to change tau(0). We argue that the calorimetric value
   beta(cal) determined from the specific heat {[}C-p = T(dS/dT)(p)] data
   is a more appropriate measure of the distribution of relaxation times
   arising from configurational fluctuations than beta determined from
   other properties, and report a study of beta(cal) of two sets of binary
   mixtures, each containing a different molecule of similar to 2 nm size.
   We find that beta(cal) changes monotonically with the composition, i.e.,
   solute molecules modify the nano-scale composition and may increase or
   decrease tau(0), but do not always decrease beta(cal). (Plots of
   beta(cal) against the composition do not show a minimum.) We also
   analyze the data from the literature, and find that (i) beta(cal) of an
   orientationally disordered crystal is less than that of its liquid, (ii)
   beta(cal) varies with the isomer's nature, and chiral centers in a
   molecule decrease beta(cal), and (iii) beta(cal) decreases when a
   sample's thickness is decreased to the nm-scale. After examining the
   difference between beta(cal) and beta determined from other properties
   we discuss the consequences of our findings for theories of
   non-exponential response, and suggest that studies of beta(cal) may be
   more revealing of structure-freezing than studies of the non-Arrhenius
   behavior. On the basis of previous reports that beta -> 1 for dielectric
   relaxation of liquids of centiPoise viscosity observed at GHz
   frequencies, we argue that its molecular mechanism is the same as that
   of the Johari-Goldstein (JG) relaxation. Its spectrum becomes broader on
   cooling and its unimodal distribution reversibly changes to a bimodal
   distribution, each of beta < 1. Kinetic freezing of the slower modes of
   the bimodal distribution produces a glass. After this bifurcation, the
   faster, original relaxation persists as a weak JG relaxation at T ->
   T-g, and in the glassy state. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Title = {{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation of pressure-driven water
   transport through modified CNT membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are presented to
   investigate the effect of water-membrane interactions on the transport
   properties of pressure-driven water flow passing through carbon nanotube
   (CNT) membranes. The CNT membrane is modified with different physical
   properties to alter the van der Waals interactions or the electrostatic
   interactions between water molecules and the CNT membranes. The
   unmodified and modified CNT membranes are models of simplified
   nanofiltration (NF) membranes at operating conditions consistent with
   real NF systems. All NEMD simulations are run with constant pressure
   difference (8.0 MPa) temperature (300 K), constant pore size (0.643 nm
   radius for CNT (12, 12)), and membrane thickness (6.0 nm). The water
   flow rate, density, and velocity (in flow direction) distributions are
   obtained by analyzing the NEMD simulation results to compare transport
   through the modified and unmodified CNT membranes. The pressure-driven
   water flow through CNT membranes is from 11 to 21 times faster than
   predicted by the Navier-Stokes equations. For water passing through the
   modified membrane with stronger van der Waals or electrostatic
   interactions, the fast flow is reduced giving lower flow rates and
   velocities. These investigations show the effect of water-CNT membrane
   interactions on water transport under NF operating conditions. This work
   can help provide and improve the understanding of how these membrane
   characteristics affect membrane performance for real NF processes. (C)

Abstract = {{Metamorphic buffer layers offer a wide variety of lattice constants for
   substrate on which devices can be grown. However, almost in all cases,
   the surface of the pseudo-substrate contains striations which are known
   as ``cross-hatch.{''} Although, it is accepted that this surface
   undulation is related with the underlying gridlike misfit dislocations
   (MDs), the exact correlation is still to be determined. In this article,
   degree of polarization of photoluminescence maps and atomic force
   microscopy were used to analyze the correlation between surface
   undulation and the underlying strain field of the pseudo-substrate. From
   the correlation, it can be said that the surface undulation is not
   formed after MD nucleation, but MDs form in some of the troughs of the
   undulation. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Changes in trabecular bone microarchitecture in postmenopausal women
   with and without type 2 diabetes: a two year longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: The risk of experiencing an osteoporotic fracture is greater
   for adults with type 2 diabetes despite higher than normal bone mineral
   density (BMD). In addition to BMD, trabecular bone microarchitecture
   contributes to bone strength, but is not assessed using conventional BMD
   measurement by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The aim of this study
   was to compare two year changes in trabecular bone microarchitecture in
   women with and without type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: We used a 1 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to
   acquire axial images (resolution 195 mu m x 195 mu m x 1000 mu m) of the
   distal radius. We report the change in the number and size of trabecular
   bone holes, bone volume fraction (BVTV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th),
   number (Tb.N) and separation (Tb.Sp), endosteal area, nodal and branch
   density for each group. Lumbar spine and proximal femur BMD were
   measured with DXA (Hologic, Discovery QDR4500A) at baseline and
   follow-up. Using a multivariable linear regression model, we evaluated
   whether the percent change in the trabecular bone microarchitecture
   variables differed between women with and without type 2 diabetes.
   Results: Of the 54 participants at baseline with valid MRI image sets,
   37 participants (baseline mean {[}SD] age, 70.8 {[}4.4] years) returned
   for follow-up assessment after 25.4 {[}1.9] months. Lumbar spine BMD was
   greater for women with diabetes compared to without diabetes at both
   baseline and follow-up. After adjustment for ethnicity, women with
   diabetes had a higher percent increase in number of trabecular bone
   holes compared to controls (10{[}1] \% versus -7 {[}2]\%, p=0.010),
   however results were no longer significant after adjustment for multiple
   comparisons (p=0.090). There were no differences in the change in other
   trabecular bone microarchitecture variables between groups.
   Conclusion: There were no differences in percent change in trabecular
   bone microarchitecture variables over two years in women with type 2
   diabetes compared to women without diabetes. This study provides
   feasibility data, which will inform future trials assessing change in
   trabecular bone microarchitecture in women with type 2 diabetes. Larger
   studies using higher resolution imaging modalities that can assess
   change in trabecular and cortical bone compartments in women with type 2
   diabetes are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Electron capture during forward bias and reemission at zero bias by
   divacancies in the depletion region of a silicon diode structure at room
   temperature have been studied for the first time using monoenergetic
   positrons. The positron response increases essentially linearly with
   electron current, as a result of increased positron trapping by
   negatively charged divacancies. The measurements indicate that <= 1\% of
   the divacancies become negatively charged in the steady state at a
   forward bias of 1 V. Changes in the mean positron response when applying
   a square wave bias to the sample (1 V forward bias and 0 V, duty cycle
   1:4, times at 0 V in the range 0.1-100 mu s), were consistent with a
   rapid conversion of doubly to singly charged divacancies (in similar to
   10(1) ns), followed by slower defilling of the singly charged
   divacancies with a time constant of similar to 10(1) mu s. These ac
   measurements allow determination of the relative populations of singly
   and doubly charged divacancies. The results provide confirmation of
   consistency between the positron's response to the silicon divacancy and
   previously extracted capture and emission kinetics determined through
   charge transient measurements and assigned to the same defect. The
   possibility of combining these two, orthogonal techniques suggest a
   promising new and powerful approach to defect spectroscopy in which the
   structure and electrical properties of a defect may be determined in a
   single measurement. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.136401}},

Title = {{An adaptive data-based modeling approach for predictive control of batch
   systems}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we generalize a previously developed data-based modeling
   methodology for batch processes to account for time-varying dynamics by
   incorporating online learning ability into the model, making it
   adaptive. First, the standard recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm
   with a forgetting factor is applied to update the model parameters.
   However, applying the standard RLS algorithm leads to a global update of
   all the models, which may be unnecessary depending on the operating
   conditions of the process. We address this issue by developing a
   probabilistic RLS (PRLS) estimator (also with a forgetting factor) for
   each model that takes the probability of the model being representative
   of the current plant dynamics into account in the update. The main
   advantage of adopting this localized update approach is adaptation
   tuning flexibility. Specifically, the model adaptations can be made more
   aggressive while maintaining better parameter precision compared to the
   standard RLS algorithm. The benefits from incorporating both RLS
   algorithms are demonstrated via simulations of a nylon-6,6 batch
   polymerization reactor. Closed-loop simulation results illustrate the
   improvement in tracking performance (over the non-adaptive model based
   design). The model adaptation is also shown to be crucial for achieving
   acceptable control performance when encountering large disturbances in
   the initial conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{33-41}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Purification of recombinant monoclonal antibody from transgenic plant
   extract is technically challenging as it involves the processing of
   large volume of material, containing low titre of antibody, present
   along with large quantities of native proteins and other impurities. The
   conventional approach of capturing antibody from a clarified extract
   using packed-bed chromatography is therefore not particularly suitable.
   This study evaluates the suitability of using a combination of
   ultrafiltration and chromatography for purifying transgenic
   tobacco-derived human monoclonal antibody. A two-stage cascade
   ultrafiltration process removed about 97\% impurities while ensuring
   almost complete recovery of antibody, providing 32-fold antibody
   enrichment in the process. The primary objective of the ultrafiltration
   step was to reduce the burden on the subsequent chromatographic steps. A
   two-step chromatographic process was then used to eliminate remaining
   impurities. Using this approach, recombinant human antibody expressed in
   tobacco could be purified to greater than 95\% purity with 50\% overall
   recovery (ca. 12.5 mg antibody/kg tobacco tissues). (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Disentanglement, dispersion of CNTs without attrition and efficient
   interfacial interaction with polymer chains are a major challenge in
   developing CNT/polymer composites. In the present device the mixture of
   highly viscous polyphosphoric acid (PPA) and entangled MWCNTs fills a
   hollow cylinder where a perforated piston, encasing micro-grids, is
   axially translating, oscillating and simultaneously rotating. This
   generates an extensional-shear-spiralling flow, magnified in the
   entrance/exit zone of the grid micro-openings, the smallest having
   diameter of 40 mu m. The reciprocating action forces the agglomerates to
   cross the grid many times, while the oscillation reduces effectively the
   clogging of the grid. Flow micro-splitting and recombination, across
   millions of micro-openings in a time dependent regime, facilitated
   erosion and collision mechanisms to prevail, leading to a gradual CNT
   deagglomeration-dispersion without CNT attrition. The resulting high
   multi-directional-rotational flow generated the conditions for efficient

   nanotubes induced by photon excitation are observed for the first time

   to measure carbon nanotube expansions coupled to electronic transitions

   excitation/irradiation. Laser-induced effects are recorded in electron
   energy-loss spectra, which show reversible changes in the carbon

   increased interatomic spacing, resulting from photon-induced thermal
   expansion and exciton screening enhancement due to photocarriers. These
   are the first measurements of photon-induced correlated structural and

   hybrid dynamic model framework. The dynamics of the individual modes are
   represented by a set of linear and nonlinear differential equations. An

Abstract = {{Measurements of platelet adhesion and fibrinogen adsorption from flowing
   whole blood to a series of polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based materials were
   carried out. A unique experimental design was used in which both
   quantities were measured in the same experiment. The materials consisted
   of a polyurethane (PU) as a matrix into which various triblock
   copolymers of general structure PEO-PU-PEO were blended; the PU block
   was the same in all materials but the PEO blocks ranged in molecular
   weight from 550 to 5000. Platelets were isolated from fresh human blood
   and labeled with Cr-51; purified fibrinogen was labeled with I-125. A
   whole blood preparation containing these labeled species was used for
   the adhesion/adsorption studies. The surfaces were exposed to the
   flowing blood in a cone and plate device at a wall shear rate of
   300s(1). It was found that both platelet adhesion and fibrinogen
   adsorption decreased with increasing copolymer content in the blends and
   with decreasing PEO block size for a given copolymer content. The block
   size effect was due probably to higher PEO surface coverage for the
   lower molecular weight blocks. Fibrinogen adsorption and platelet
   adhesion were linearly and strongly correlated. The best performing
   materials showed very low fibrinogen adsorption of the order of
   25ng/cm(2), and correspondingly low platelet densities around 10,000 per
   cm(2), i.e. fractional platelet coverage in the vicinity of 0.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the foam development process under atmospheric
   pressure as applicable to rotational molding, investigating the
   influence of the processing parameters, and characterizing the
   morphology of the foamed structure. Detailed understanding of the bubble
   transformation during foaming of nonpressurized polymer melts provided
   an accurate basis for predicting the morphological structure and
   macroscopic properties of foams produced by rotational molding. The
   experimental results are based on visualization studies using a hot
   stage microscopy setup. The cellular structure developed during the
   foaming was analyzed for its bubble density, bubble size, and
   statistical parameters considering the combined effect of these two
   factors. It was found during this investigation that the foaming
   mechanism comprises four distinct stages. It included two major stages
   of bubble nucleation, primary nucleation in interstitial regions, and
   secondary nucleation in the polymer melt. Statistical analysis of the
   developing foamed structure revealed that primary nucleation in the
   interstitial regions was the controlling stage in determining the final
   cellular structure. Subsequently, the nucleation stages were followed by
   bubble growth and bubble coalescence/shrinkage. The microscopic
   observations were complemented by actual rotational foam molding
   experiments. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Adv Polym Techn 32:

Abstract = {{The selective control of pathogenic bacteria is an ongoing challenge. A
   strategy is proposed that combines targeted binding of the bacterium,
   using antibodies, with their photoactivated oxidative destruction.
   Photoactive colloidal TiO2 was first derivatized with E. coli antibodies
   (EA-TiO2). When mixtures of the organisms E. coli and Pseudomonas putida
   (P. putida) were exposed to modified EA-TiO2., the particles
   preferentially selected E. coli for surface binding. Two consequences
   arose from surface bioconjugation: bacteria were found to flocculate
   upon mixing at appropriate ratios of EA-TiO2/E. coli, and EA-TiO2-bound
   E. coli underwent cell death after exposure to UV light. In the former
   case, flocculation of the bacteria was optimal at similar to 50 EA-TiO2
   particles per E. coli. Selective flocculation provides an alternative
   strategy for pathogen removal. With respect to UV disinfection, as few
   as 26 EA-TiO2 particles per E. coli gave a 10 000-fold decrease in
   viable bacteria. Thus, it is possible to selectively target and kill one
   type of bacteria in a mixture of pathogens. The results give support to
   the proposal that photocatalytic TiO2 most effectively delivers an
   oxidizing agent when the titania is bound to the bacterial surface.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the problem of scheduling for energy-efficient
   roadside infrastructure. In certain scenarios, vehicle locations can be
   predicted with a high degree of accuracy, and this information can be
   used to reduce downlink infrastructure-to-vehicle energy communication
   costs. Offline scheduling results are first presented that provide lower
   bounds on the energy needed to satisfy arriving vehicular communication
   requirements. We show that the packet-based scheduling case can be
   formulated as a generalization of the classical single-machine job
   scheduling problem with a tardiness penalty, which is referred to as
   alpha-Earliness-Tardiness. A proof is given that shows that even under a
   simple distance-dependent exponential radio path loss assumption, the
   problem is NP-complete. The remainder of the paper then focuses on
   timeslot-based scheduling. We formulate this problem as a Mixed-Integer
   Linear Program (MILP) that is shown to be solvable in polynomial time
   using a proposed minimum cost flow graph construction. Three
   energy-efficient online traffic scheduling algorithms are then
   introduced for common vehicular scenarios where vehicle position is
   strongly deterministic. The first, i.e., Greedy Minimum Cost Flow
   (GMCF), is motivated by our minimum cost flow graph formulation. The
   other two algorithms have reduced complexity compared with GMCF. The
   Nearest Fastest Set (NFS) scheduler uses vehicle location and velocity
   inputs to dynamically schedule communication activity. The Static
   Scheduler (SS) performs the same task using a simple position-based
   weighting function. Results from a variety of experiments show that the
   proposed scheduling algorithms perform well when compared with the
   energy lower bounds in vehicular situations where path loss has a
   dominant deterministic component so that energy costs can be estimated.
   Our results also show that near-optimal results are possible but come
   with increased computation times compared with our heuristic algorithms.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary assimilation of streamflow in distributed hydrologic

Abstract = {{This study has applied evolutionary algorithm to address the data
   assimilation problem in a distributed hydrological model. The
   evolutionary data assimilation (EDA) method uses multi-objective
   evolutionary strategy to continuously evolve ensemble of model states
   and parameter sets where it adaptively determines the model error and
   the penalty function for different assimilation time steps. The
   assimilation was determined by applying the penalty function to merge
   background information (i.e., model forecast) with perturbed observation
   data. The assimilation was based on updated estimates of the model state
   and its parameterizations, and was complemented by a continuous
   evolution of competitive solutions.
   The EDA was illustrated in an integrated assimilation approach to
   estimate model state using soil moisture, which in turn was incorporated
   into the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) to assimilate streamflow.
   Soil moisture was independently assimilated to allow estimation of its
   model error, where the estimated model state was integrated into SWAT to
   determine background streamflow information before they are merged with
   perturbed observation data. Application of the EDA in Spencer Creek
   watershed in southern Ontario, Canada generates a time series of soil
   moisture and streamflow. Evaluation of soil moisture and streamflow
   assimilation results demonstrates the capability of the EDA to
   simultaneously estimate model state and parameterizations for real-time
   forecasting operations. The results show improvement in both streamflow
   and soil moisture estimates when compared to open-loop simulation, and a
   close matching between the background and the assimilation illustrates
   the forecasting performance of the EDA approach. (C) 2012 Published by

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A method based on a liquid-liquid interfacial coordination mechanism has
   been developed for the synthesis of free-standing metal-organic
   framework (MOF) membranes. MOF precursors, zinc nitrate {[}Zn(NO3)(2)]
   and terephthalic acid (TPA or H2BDC), as well as catalyst triethylamine
   (TEA), were dissolved in two immiscible solvents, dimethylformamide
   (DMF) and hexane. The reaction of Zn(NO3)(2) and TPA (at a 2:1 molar
   ratio) in DMF was catalyzed by TEA in hexane at the solvent interface
   thus forming a free-standing membrane. A region of reactant
   concentrations critical to membrane formation was identified; a
   free-standing membrane could only be formed in the region of high Zn/TPA
   and low TEA concentrations. The combination of low Zn/TPA and high TEA
   concentrations yielded MOF particles that precipitated from DMF. The
   membranes were characterized by SEM and XRD and found to be asymmetric.
   SEM results showed that the top layer was particulate, whereas the
   bottom layer had a sheet-like morphology, which was further revealed by
   XRD data as 3D Zn4O(BDC)(3) (also known as MOF-5) and 2D ZnBDC center
   dot DMF (MOF-2) for the top and bottom, respectively. Other transitional
   zinc-carboxylate structures between the two MOFs, namely
   Zn-3(OH)(2)(BDC)(2)(MOF-69c) and Zn-5(OH)(4)-(BDC)(3), were also
   observed with small signal intensities revealing a transition of
   coordination modes between zinc ions and BDC groups from 3D to 2D at the
   membrane cross-section. This was caused by a change of the TEA diffusion
   rate during the synthesis process, which might change the pH and alter
   the membrane growth. From both SEM and XRD characterizations, MOF-2 is
   the dominant material in the overall composition. Nitrogen adsorption
   tests showed an average Langmuir surface area of 709 m(2)/g for the
   membrane, demonstrating its potential for gas separation applications.}},

   acid (HA) release from model contact lens materials when HA was
   physically incorporated into the hydrogel during synthesis and to assess
   the effects of the HA release on lysozyme sorption.
   Methods: Model conventional and silicone hydrogel contact lens materials
   containing HA of various molecular weights as a releasable wetting agent
   were prepared. The HA was released into phosphate-buffered saline and
   MilliQ water, and the release was monitored using ultraviolet
   spectroscopy. Hyaluronic acid release was quantified by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay. The effect of the releasable HA on lysozyme
   sorption to the materials was also analyzed using 125-I-labeled protein.
   Results: Hyaluronic acid loaded into the materials using this method
   could be released from conventional hydrogel materials for 21 days; the
   model silicone hydrogels showed release of more than 7 weeks. With one
   exception, the releasable HA decreased lysozyme sorption.
   Conclusions: Hyaluronic acid physically incorporated into contact lens
   materials during synthesis may therefore be released for extended
   periods of time of up to 7 weeks. Hyaluronic acid release leads to
   decreased protein adsorption in general. This method has potential for
   modification of conventional and silicone hydrogel lenses with
   releasable HA as a wetting agent.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic statistics and information theory techniques have been
   developed to investigate the accuracy to which solute clusters
   characterised in atom probe tomography (APT) data can reflect the true
   nature of the physical clusters in the original specimen. Simulated
   atom-probe datasets representing a range of atomic solute clustering
   within a pseudo-binary alloy upon an fcc aluminium lattice were
   generated for the study. The effectiveness of partitioning the APT-like
   simulated data based upon a binary classification defined by a distance
   threshold d max upon the kth nearest neighbour distance distribution was
   investigated. Information theory was also used to optimise the selection
   of the threshold d max. Analysis of variation was performed upon a
   factorial design of data simulations with low and high levels of: solute
   concentration; short-range order; and background to the
   mass-to-charge-state-ratio spectrum. This meta-analysis showed that the
   background levels have a significant compromising effect upon the binary
   classification in low solute systems with relatively low or random
   levels of clustering. Although the random clustering of higher solute
   concentrations is better analysed, significantly non-random clustering
   in both low and high solute concentrations is analysed well despite the
   presence of high levels of background. A meta-analysis of the binary
   classification upon a simulated dispersion of coherent precipitates
   within a similar matrix was also undertaken. Optimal k and d max
   parameters are likely a dependent upon the physical dimensions of
   precipitate size as well as the precipitate/matrix solute
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond their biocompatibility, implanted electrodes for neuromuscular
   stimulation require careful consideration of conductivity, stability,
   and charge delivery capacity (CDC) to avoid irreversible faradaic
   reactions. To study these requirements, metal electrodes of platinum
   (Pt), gold (Au), and titanium (Ti) on flexible liquid crystal polymer
   are fabricated using electron-beam evaporation, and investigated by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and atomic
   force microscopy. A theoretical model is used to explain the physical
   functionalities. Frequency dependent electrochemical interfacial
   impedance is observed. The impedance as well as long-term
   electrochemical stability is influenced by the surface roughness,
   reactivity and capacitance of the electrodes. Pt electrode offers lower
   impedance in the neuromuscular stimulation frequencies and higher CDC
   than that of Ti and Au, but is not as stable as Au electrode. (c) 2012

   calculated by minimizing the mismatch between the area under the

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel concept called a uniquely factorable
   constellation pair (UFCP) is proposed for the systematic design of a
   noncoherent full diversity collaborative unitary space-time block code
   by normalizing two Alamouti codes for a wireless communication system
   having two transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna. It is
   proved that such a unitary UFCP code assures the unique identification
   of both channel coefficients and transmitted signals in a noise-free
   case as well as full diversity for the noncoherent maximum likelihood
   receiver in a noise case. To further improve error performance, an
   optimal unitary UFCP code is designed by appropriately and uniquely
   factorizing a pair of energy-efficient cross quadrature amplitude
   modulation (QAM) constellations to maximize the coding gain subject to a
   transmission bit rate constraint. After a deep investigation of the
   fractional coding gain function, a technical approach developed in this
   paper to maximizing the coding gain is to carefully design an energy
   scale to compress the first three largest energy points in the corner of
   the QAM constellations in the denominator of the objective as well as
   carefully design a constellation triple forming two UFCPs, with one
   collaborating with the other two so as to make the accumulated minimum
   Euclidean distance along the two transmitter antennas in the numerator
   of the objective as large as possible, and at the same time, to avoid as
   many corner points of the QAM constellations with the largest energy as
   possible to achieve the minimum of the numerator. In other words, the
   optimal coding gain is attained by intelligent constellations
   collaboration and efficient energy compression. Computer simulations
   demonstrate that error performance of the optimal unitary UFCP code
   presented in this paper outperforms those of the differential code and
   the signal-to-noise-ratio-efficient training code.}},

Abstract = {{Electro-erosion honing is a novel process that exploits the undesirable
   but inevitable phenomenon of localized electrode wear in sink electrical
   discharge machining that rapidly rounds off sharp edges, for the edge
   honing of cutting tools. The process essentially entails the sinking of
   a sharp edge of a cutting tool into a counterface of an appropriate
   material to generate the round edge geometry. This paper proposes the
   innovative application of a foil counterface, with a view to expanding
   the capability of this process in the honing of tools with such
   geometric features as nose radii and curved edges. Such a configuration
   involves no particular alignment requirements, and facilitates the
   simultaneous processing of a batch of inserts. In consideration of their
   industrial significance, the process is evaluated in the honing of
   cemented carbide inserts. The novel process is demonstrated to address
   the limitation of the conventional brush honing process in being capable
   of generating consistent edge geometry, while delivering comparable tool

Abstract = {{Microbleeds have been implicated to play a role in many neurovascular
   and neurodegenerative diseases. The diameter of each microbleed has been
   used previously as a possible quantitative measure for grading
   microbleeds. We propose that magnetic susceptibility provides a new
   quantitative measure of extravasated blood. Recently, a Fourier-based
   method has been used that allows susceptibility quantification from
   phase images for any arbitrarily shaped structures. However, when very
   small objects, such as microbleeds, are considered, the accuracy of this
   susceptibility mapping method still remains to be evaluated. In this
   article, air bubbles and glass beads are taken as microbleed surrogates
   to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of the susceptibility mapping
   method. We show that when an object occupies only a few voxels, an
   estimate of the true volume of the object is necessary for accurate
   susceptibility quantification. Remnant errors in the quantified
   susceptibilities and their sources are evaluated. We show that
   quantifying magnetic moment, rather than the susceptibility of these
   small structures, may be a better and more robust alternative. Magn

Abstract = {{A new method is developed for synthesizing Ti4O7 supported Ru@Pt
   core-shell catalyst (Ru@Pt/Ti4O7) through pyrolysis followed by
   microwave irradiation. The purpose is to improve the Ru durability of
   PtRu from core-shell structure and strong bonding to Ti4O2 oxide. In
   this method, the first step is to co-reduce the mixture of ruthenium
   precursor and TiO2 in a H-2 reducing atmosphere under heat-treatment to
   obtain a Ru core on Ti4O7 support, and the second step is to create a
   shell of platinum via microwave irradiation. Energy dispersive X-ray
   spectrometry, X-ray Diffraction, High-resolution Scanning Transmission
   Electron Microscopy with the high-angle annular dark-field method and
   Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy are used to demonstrate that this
   catalyst with larger particles has a core-shell structure with a Ru core
   and a Pt shell. Electrochemical measurements show Ru@Pt/Ti4O7 catalyst
   has a higher CO-tolerance capability than that of PtRu/C alloy catalyst.

Abstract = {{By taking into account the continuity of stresses and pore pressure
   across the boundaries of a shear band, it is theoretically shown that
   incipient localization may take place in saturated loose contractive
   sand in the regime of decreasing deviator stress under undrained
   conditions. The undrained shear band orientation primarily depends on
   the Poisson's ratio and the dilatancy characteristics of the material.
   However, under strict isochoric constraint, localization is precluded in
   dense dilative sand with deviator stress increasing only. If any local
   volume change takes place with a certain mechanism, undrained shear band
   would be possible in dense sand, most likely in the regime of decreasing
   friction angle after the peak friction angle is mobilized. Numerical
   examples are given to demonstrate the variation of shear band
   inclinations with void ratios and initial consolidation pressures.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{366}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel crystal growth method named lateral diffusion epitaxy (LDE) as
   well as the necessary growth apparatus are described in detail. Single
   crystalline Si strips are grown on (1 1 1) Si substrates by LDE. The
   thickness of the LDE Si strips is around 100 mu m, and the aspect ratio
   of width to thickness is around 2 which is an improvement compared with
   Si strips grown by conventional liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The LDE Si
   strip can be peeled off from the substrate for further device processing
   since the 100 mu m thickness provides reasonable mechanical strength.
   Due to the low cost of LDE technology it is potentially a good candidate
   for PV application if the LDE can achieve continuous growth and
   therefore grow Si strips in sizes for practical application. Crown

Title = {{Implications of test methodology on post-cracking and fracture behaviour
   of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{31-38}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is now universally recognized that the mechanical, cracking and
   fracture, properties of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) are far
   superior to those of plain concrete. The use of SFRC contributes
   effectively to preserve the structural stability and structural
   integrity of concrete elements and improve their ductile behaviour.
   To optimize the performance of SFRC in structural members it is
   necessary to establish the mechanical properties very precisely. The
   best test methodology to evaluate the post-cracking and toughness
   properties of SFRC is the beam bending test. Design codes recommend one
   of two bending test configurations: the three-point or the four-point
   bending test. The results obtained from these two test configurations
   are not identical.
   The overall focus of this paper is to evaluate the contributions of
   fibres to the post-cracking and fracture behaviour of concrete as
   determined by the two different standard test procedures. To achieve
   these aims plain and fibre concrete specimens were tested. All the test
   specimens were extensively instrumented to establish the strength
   properties, crack tip and crack mouth opening displacement,
   post-cracking and fracture behaviour. The results of the two types of
   bending tests were then critically analysed and evaluated to identify
   the differing effects of the bending load configurations on material and
   structural behaviour.
   SFRC specimens subjected to four-point bending test showed higher stress
   values compared to those obtained from the three-point bending tests.
   The first crack strength values evaluated following the two standards
   are close with an improvement of 10\% for the European standard. (C)

Abstract = {{As the number of transistors that are integrated onto a silicon die
   continues to increase, the compute power is becoming a commodity. This
   has enabled a whole host of new applications that rely on
   high-throughput computations. Recently, the need for faster and
   cost-effective applications in form-factor constrained environments has
   driven an interest in on-chip acceleration of algorithms based on Monte
   Carlo simulations. Though Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), with
   hundreds of on-chip arithmetic units, show significant promise for
   accelerating these embarrassingly parallel simulations, a challenge
   exists in sharing access to simulation data among many concurrent
   experiments. This paper presents a compute architecture for accelerating
   Monte Carlo simulations based on the Network-on-Chip (NOC) paradigm for
   on-chip communication. We demonstrate through the complete
   implementation of a Monte Carlo-based image reconstruction algorithm for
   Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging that this
   complex problem can be accelerated by two orders of magnitude on even a
   modestly sized FPGA over a 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor. The
   architecture and the methodology that we present in this paper is
   modular and hence it is scalable to problem instances of different
   sizes, with application to other domains that rely on Monte Carlo
   simulations.}},

   Streptomyces virginiae IBL14}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: As well known, both natural and synthetic steroidal
   compounds are powerful endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) which can
   cause reproductive toxicity and affect cellular development in mammals
   and thus are generally regarded as serious contributors to water
   pollution. Streptomyces virginiae IBL14 is an effective degradative
   strain for many steroidal compounds and can also catalyze the C25
   hydroxylation of diosgenin, the first-ever biotransformation found on
   the F-ring of diosgenin.
   Results: To completely elucidate the hydroxylation function of
   cytochrome P450 genes (CYPs) found during biotransformation of steroids
   by S. virginiae IBL14, the whole genome sequencing of this strain was
   carried out via 454 Sequencing Systems. The analytical results of BLASTP
   showed that the strain IBL14 contains 33 CYPs, 7 ferredoxins and 3
   ferredoxin reductases in its 8.0 Mb linear chromosome. CYPs from S.
   virginiae IBL14 are phylogenetically closed to those of Streptomyces sp.
   Mg1 and Streptomyces sp. C. One new subfamily was found as per the fact
   that the CYP Svu001 in S. virginiae IBL14 shares 66\% identity only to
   that (ZP\_05001937, protein identifer) from Streptomyces sp. Mg1.
   Further analysis showed that among all of the 33 CYPs in S. virginiae
   IBL14, three CYPs are clustered with ferredoxins, one with ferredoxin
   and ferredoxin reductase and three CYPs with ATP/GTP binding proteins,
   four CYPs arranged with transcriptional regulatory genes and one CYP
   located on the upstream of an ATP-binding protein and transcriptional
   regulators as well as four CYPs associated with other functional genes
   involved in secondary metabolism and degradation.
   Conclusions: These characteristics found in CYPs from S. virginiae IBL14
   show that the EXXR motif in the K-helix is not absolutely conserved in
   CYP157 family and I-helix not absolutely essential for the CYP
   structure, too. Experimental results showed that both CYP Svh01 and CYP
   Svu022 are two hydroxylases, capable of bioconverting diosgenone into
   isonuatigenone and beta-estradiol into estriol, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PDMAEMA-b-PMMA) has been used as a surfactant in the
   preparation of PMMA latexes that can be coagulated and redispersed
   reversibly. In this work, we investigated in detail the effects of the
   block copolymer composition on the coagulation/redispersion performance
   of the latexes. A series of well-defined PDMAEMA-b-PMMA samples that
   have 10-30 DMAEMA units and 5-45 MMA units were synthesized through a
   two-step solution RAFT polymerization process and were used as the
   surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of MMA. PMMA latexes obtained
   with surfactants having MMA weight fraction (F-MMA) < 58.5\% were
   stable. The particle size of the resulting PMMA latexes decreased
   gradually with the increase of F-MMA. The latex particles initially
   coagulated with a small amount of caustic soda could be repeatedly
   redispersed into fresh water through CO2 bubbling with ultrasonication
   and coagulated through N-2 bubbling with some heating. The
   coagulation/redispersion process was repeatable through the CO2/N-2
   bubbling. The latexes showed excellent redispersibility with the
   surfactants of F-MMA < 46\%. With F-MMA > 46\%, the latex particle sizes
   could increase over 20\% after the coagulation/redispersion process.}},

   consistent with the model of Kaplan and Aziz where K approaches unity in
   the limit of infinite velocity. However, with the introduction of
   wavelike dynamics in both the density and concentration fields, the
   trapping follows the kinetics proposed by Sobolev {[}Phys. Lett. A 199,

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the
   fabrication of 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBH) films from aqueous solutions.
   The films can be deposited at constant voltage or potentiodynamic
   conditions. The method allowed the formation of 0.1-2 mu m thick films,
   containing needle-shape PBH particles. The deposition mechanism involved
   the electrophoresis, pH decrease at the anode surface, charge
   neutralization and formation of insoluble PBH films. The film morphology
   and shape of the PBH particles are controlled by the pi-pi stacking
   mechanism of the polyaromatic PBH molecules. The important finding was
   the possibility of controlled EPD of multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) using PBH as a charging, dispersing and film forming agent. It
   was found that at low voltages or low PBH concentrations the deposits
   contained mainly MWCNT. The increase in the deposition voltage or/and
   PBH concentration resulted in co-deposition of MWCNT and needle-shape
   PBH particles. The new approach to the deposition of MWCNT was used for
   the fabrication of composite MnO2-MWCNT films for electrodes of
   electrochemical supercapacitors, which showed a specific capacitance of
   250 F g(-1). The EPD method developed in this investigation paves the
   way for the deposition of other small organic molecules and composites
   and their applications in new materials and devices, utilizing
   functional properties of the organic molecules, CNT, and other advanced
   materials. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soft nanocomposite hydrogels consisting of thermoresponsive microgels
   physically entrapped or covalently cross-linked to a

   Copolymer microgels based on N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylic acid were
   synthesized that exhibited ionic affinity for binding to bupivacaine, a
   cationic local anesthetic. These microgels were subsequently physically
   entrapped within an in situ-gelling carbohydrate-based hydrogel network
   cross-linked via hydrazide-aldehyde chemistry; alternately,
   hydrazide-functionalized microgels were prepared that covalently
   cross-linked to the bulk hydrogel phase. Both the overall rate of drug
   release and the magnitude of the burst release were significantly
   decreased when microgels were restricted from undergoing a phase
   transition between the preparation temperature of the nanocomposite (25
   degrees C) and the test temperature (37 degrees C), whether deswelling
   was inhibited by increasing the cross-link density within the microgel
   itself or by cross-linking the microgel to the bulk hydrogel network.
   This result facilitates facile tuning of soft nanocomposite drug

Abstract = {{The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the
   fabrication of MnO2-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) films for
   application in electrochemical supercapacitors (ESs). For MWCNT
   applications, which depend on electrical conductivity, it is challenging
   to achieve dispersion and EPD of pristine MWCNT and avoid defects due to
   chemical treatment or functionalization. An important finding was the
   possibility of efficient dispersion and controlled EPD of MWCNT using
   calconcarboxylic acid (CCA). Moreover, the use of CCA allowed efficient
   dispersion of MnO2 in concentrated suspensions and EPD of MnO2 films.
   The comparison of the experimental data for chromotrope FB (CFB) and CCA
   and chemical structures of the molecules provided insight into the
   mechanism of CCA adsorption on MnO2. The fabrication of stable
   suspensions of MnO2 nanoparticles containing MWCNT, and controlled
   codeposition of both materials is a crucial aspect in the EPD
   composites. The new approach was based on the use of CCA as a charging
   and dispersing agent for EPD of MnO2 nanoparticles and MWCNT. The
   deposition yield measurements at various experimental conditions and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data, coupled with results of
   electron microscopy, thermogravimetric, and differential thermal
   analysis provided evidence of the formation of MnO2-MWCNT composites.
   The electrochemical testing results and impedance spectroscopy data
   showed good capacitive behavior of the composite films and the
   beneficial effect of MWCNTs.}},

Abstract = {{Various issues on the closed-loop identification of empirical latent
   variable dynamic models for model predictive control (MPC) of the
   trajectories of process variables in batch systems are investigated. The
   concept of identifiability is explored in the context of batch processes
   and desirable conditions for the identification experiments to be
   informative for building latent variable dynamic models are proposed. It
   is shown that in many situations it is possible to identify the batch
   process models only from historical batch data without the need for
   external excitation of the closed-loop system. However, adding one or
   two batch runs with only slight set-point trajectory changes is an
   efficient approach to enhance the data for the identification of the
   batch dynamic models. The issue of model bias in closed-loop
   identification using nonparametric or highly parametrized modeling

Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of a spin system is usually calculated using the density
   matrix. However, the usual formulation in terms of the density matrix
   predicts that the signal will decay to zero, and does not address the
   issue of individual spin dynamics. Using stochastic calculus, we develop
   a dynamical theory of spin relaxation, the origins of which lie in the
   component spin fluctuations. This entails consideration of random pure
   states for individual protons, and how these pure states are correctly
   combined when the density matrix is formulated. Both the lattice and the
   spins are treated quantum mechanically. Such treatment incorporates both
   the processes of spin-spin and (finite temperature) spin-lattice
   relaxation. Our results reveal the intimate connections between spin
   noise and conventional spin relaxation. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.022110}},

Abstract = {{We have imaged, with electron energy loss spectroscopy, the plasmonic

Abstract = {{Organic anionic molecules such as 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DBA23),
   2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DBA26), 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) and
   pyrocatecholsulfonphthalein (PCS) were investigated for electrophoretic
   deposition (EPD) of TiO2 and TiO2-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   films from suspensions in ethanol. The adsorption of the molecules on
   TiO2 surfaces was based on catecholate or salicylate binding, involving
   adjacent OH groups or adjacent OH and COOH groups, respectively. The
   adsorption of the anionic molecules allowed efficient dispersion,
   charging and EPD of TiO2. The deposition yield was studied as a function
   of DBA23, DBA26, SSA and PCS concentration in TiO2 suspensions and
   deposition time. An important finding was the possibility of efficient
   dispersion, charging and EPD of MWCNT using PCS. It was shown that PCS
   can be used as a universal dispersing agent for co-deposition of TiO2
   and MWCNT and fabrication of composite TiO2-MWCNT films. The advantages
   of the new strategies, compared to other methods described in
   literature, were discussed. The deposits were studied by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
   differential thermal analysis and electron microscopy. The proposed
   approach paves the way for EPD of other oxide materials and composites.

Abstract = {{An assessment of the impact of global climate change on the water
   resources status of the island of Crete, for a range of 24 different
   scenarios of projected hydro-climatological regime is presented. Three
   ``state of the art{''} Global Climate Models (GCMs) and an ensemble of
   Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under emission scenarios B1, A2 and A1B
   provide future precipitation (P) and temperature (T) estimates that are
   bias adjusted against observations. The ensemble of RCMs for the A1B
   scenario project a higher P reduction compared to GCMs projections under
   A2 and B1 scenarios. Among GCMs model results, the ECHAM model projects
   a higher P reduction compared to IPSL and CNCM. Water availability for
   the whole island at basin scale until 2100 is estimated using the
   SAC-SMA rainfall-runoff model And a set of demand and infrastructure
   scenarios are adopted to simulate potential water use. While predicted
   reduction of water availability under the B1 emission scenario can be
   handled with water demand stabilized at present values and full
   implementation of planned infrastructure, other scenarios require
   additional measures and a robust signal of water insufficiency is
   projected. Despite inherent uncertainties, the quantitative impact of
   the projected changes on water availability indicates that climate
   change plays an important role to water use and management in
   controlling future water status in a Mediterranean island like Crete.
   The results of the study reinforce the necessity to improve and update
   local water management planning and adaptation strategies in order to
   attain future water security. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A new support vector clustering (SVC)-based probabilistic approach is
   developed for unsupervised chemical process monitoring and fault
   classification in this article. The spherical centers and radii of
   different clusters corresponding to normal and various kinds of faulty
   operations are estimated in the kernel feature space. Then the geometric
   distance of the monitored samples to different cluster centers and
   boundary support vectors are computed so that the distance-ratio-based
   probabilistic-like index can be further defined. Thus, the most probable
   clusters can be assigned to the monitored samples for fault detection
   and classification. The proposed SVC monitoring approach is applied to
   two test scenarios in the Tennessee Eastman Chemical process and its
   results are compared to those of the conventional K-nearest neighbor
   Fisher discriminant analysis (KNN-FDA) and K-nearest neighbor support
   vector machine (KNN-SVM) methods. The result comparison demonstrates the
   superiority of the SVC-based probabilistic approach over the traditional
   KNN-FDA and KNN-SVM methods in terms of fault detection and

Abstract = {{Population of old generation is growing inmost countries. Many of these
   seniors are living alone at home. Falling is among the most dangerous
   events that often happen and may need immediate medical care. Automatic
   fall detection systems could help old people and patients to live

   devices. These visual systems extract some features from video sequences
   and classify fall and normal activities. These features usually depend
   on camera's view direction. Using several cameras to solve this problem
   increases the complexity of the final system. In this paper, we propose
   to use variations in silhouette area that are obtained from only one
   camera. We use a simple background separation method to find the
   silhouette. We show that the proposed feature is view invariant.
   Extracted feature is fed into a support vector machine for

Abstract = {{Void growth and coalescence in model materials containing a pre-existing
   three-dimensional void array were studied by X-ray computed tomography
   coupled with in situ uniaxial tensile deformation. A newly developed
   continuous tomography technique was employed to capture the onset of
   coalescence. Using a picosecond laser machining system and a diffusion
   bonding technique, model materials with different void geometries were
   prepared. By implementing continuous tomography, the plastic strain at
   the onset of void coalescence was measured (instead of simple linkage)
   for the first time. The plastic strains at the onset of void coalescence
   were compared with the existing void coalescence models. Finite-element
   (FE) simulations were performed to study the influences of void shape
   (sphere, cylinder, tapered-cylinder) on the void growth behavior. This
   study shows that the coalescence models developed by Thomason and later
   extended by Pardoen and Hutchinson provide accurate predictions of
   coalescence strain when the voids are aligned normal to the tensile
   axis. However, offsets can induce shear effects that lower the
   coalescence strain in a manner not predicted by the models.
   Two-dimensional plane-strain FE simulations were also used to explore
   the influence of shear localization between two misaligned coalescing
   voids on ductility. These demonstrate the nature of the effect. Crown

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1179-1188}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Due to relatively long associated count times, in situ strain
   measurements using neutron diffraction requires periodic interruption of
   the test to collect the diffraction data by holding either the stress or
   the strain constant. As a consequence, stress relaxation or strain creep
   induced by the interrupts is inevitable, especially at loads which are
   close to the flow stress of the material. An in situ neutron diffraction
   technique, which consists in performing the diffraction measurements
   using continuous event-mode data collection while conducting the
   mechanical loading monotonically with a very slow loading rate, is
   proposed here to avoid the effects associated with interrupts. The
   lattice strains in stainless steel under uniaxial tension are measured
   using the three techniques, and the experimental results are compared to
   study the effect of stress relaxation and strain creep on the lattice
   strain measurements. The experimental results are simulated using both
   the elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) model and the elastic
   plastic self-consistent (EPSC) model. Both the EVPSC and EPSC models
   give reasonable predictions for all the three tests, with EVPSC having
   the added advantage over EPSC that it allows us to address the
   relaxation and creep effects in the interrupted tests. Published by

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an embedded atom method
   potential for pure Fe were performed to determine the atomic mechanisms
   taking place during the migration of a face-centered-cubic
   body-centered-cubic (fcc-bcc) interface. A centro-symmetry parameter
   (CSP) has been utilized to discriminate between atoms of the fcc and bcc
   phases. It is shown from both simulation and disconnection theory that
   the primary structural disconnections formed when creating the fcc bcc
   bicrystal do not move laterally across the boundary as the
   transformation proceeds. However, it is observed that a second set of
   glissile disconnections forms on the terraces and the interface migrates
   by the rapid advance of these mobile defects. The rate-limiting step of
   the interface propagation process is the nucleation of new bcc islands
   on the terraces and it is shown that the nucleation event is
   heterogeneous, with the primary disconnections acting as the preferred
   nucleation sites. The nucleation and growth mechanisms identified here
   may provide important insights into the mobility of more general
   incoherent interphase boundaries. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) utilize sloshing fluid to absorb and
   dissipate structural vibrational energy, thereby reducing wind induced
   dynamic motion. By selecting the appropriate tank length, width, and
   fluid depth, a rectangular TLD can control two structural sway modes
   simultaneously if the TLD tank is aligned with the principal axes of the
   structure. This study considers the influence of the TLD tank
   orientation on the behavior of a 2D structure-TLD system. The sloshing
   fluid is represented using a linearized equivalent mechanical model. The
   mechanical model is coupled to a 2D structure at an angle with respect
   to the principal axes of the structure. Equations of motion for the
   system are developed using Lagrange's equation. If the TLD and structure
   are not aligned, the system responds as a coupled four degree of freedom
   system. The proposed model is validated by conducting structure-TLD
   system tests. The predicted and experimental structural displacements
   and fluid response are in agreement. An approximate method is developed
   to provide an initial estimate of the structural response based on an
   effective mass ratio. The results of this study show that for small TLD
   orientation angles, the performance of the TLD is insensitive to TLD
   orientation. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007416]}},

Abstract = {{It is the first time for us to investigate the estimation and adjustment
   of the natural frequencies for a composite beam with small periodicity.
   An approach is presented in which the two-scale asymptotic expansion
   method is used to establish a homogenized model of the original
   heterogeneous beam. The accuracy of the homogenized model to predict the
   natural frequencies is checked by comparing with a fine finite element
   simulation of the original beam. In the case that each repetitive unit
   is composed of two different materials and the volume ratio of each
   material is given, the maximum and minimum frequencies of the composite
   beam are determined. Then it is shown that the beam can be designed to
   have particular frequencies within these frequency limits through a
   proper selection of the material distribution law in the unit. A
   concrete example is given when the material distribution function is
   assumed to be piecewise linear. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{93}},

Pages = {{420-431}},

Abstract = {{The Kalman filter (KF) remains the most popular method for linear state
   and parameter estimation. Various forms of the KF have been created to
   handle nonlinear estimation problems, including the extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The robustness and
   stability of the EKF and UKF can be improved by combining it with the
   recently proposed smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) concept. The
   SVSF is a predictor-corrector method based on sliding mode concepts,
   where the gain is calculated based on a switching surface. A phenomenon
   known as chattering is present in the SVSF, which may be used to
   determine changes in the system. In this paper, the concept of SVSF
   chattering is introduced and explained, and is used to determine the
   presence of modeling uncertainties. This knowledge is used to create
   combined filtering strategies in an effort to improve the overall
   accuracy and stability of the estimates. Simulations are performed to
   compare and demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and stability of the
   Kalman-based filters and their combinations with the SVSF. (C) 2012

   safety}},
Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{1-27}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Unintentional physical human-robot contact is becoming more common as
   robotic manipulators operate in closer proximity to people. In this
   paper, we investigate the use of compliant foam covering to reduce
   impact severity and enhance human safety. An improved analytical impact
   dynamic model is introduced. The impact model conservatively
   approximates the impact force and resulting head acceleration; and
   incorporates the configuration-dependent manipulator dynamics and the
   coupling between the human head and moving torso. It is applicable to
   head impacts with impact velocities that do not exceed 1.25 m/s. Based
   on this model, the most important manipulator parameter for reducing the
   impact severity is the effective mass. Furthermore, the foam stiffness
   has a greater reduction effect than any of the manipulator parameters. A
   procedure to properly design the foam in accordance with a force-based
   or acceleration-based safety criterion and a foam thickness constraint
   is proposed. The impact model and model-based design procedure are
   tested experimentally. Impact experiments are performed with an
   apparatus simulating the human head-neck-torso. The maximum error
   between the predicted and experimental maximum head acceleration results
   is less than 7\%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of La-doped bismuth titanate (BLT), Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12, is
   investigated with atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field
   (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy. The images reveal
   evidence of the tilting of TiO6 octahedra within the perovskite-like
   layers of the BLT unit cell. The tendency of La ions to substitute Bi
   ions and occupy the top part of the (Bi2O2)(2+) layer, previously
   observed from electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping
   experiments, is explained based on the tolerance factors and stress
   relief mechanism. The atomic resolution HAADF images also reveal the
   presence of the out-of-phase boundaries (OPBs). The role of OPBs in BLT
   is discussed in terms of its fatigue resistance as the OPBs provide
   extra nucleation sites for ferroelectric domains during polarization
   reversals. Further, we show evidence that the first deposited atomic
   layer at the interface also governs the subsequent film growth,
   resulting in the modulation of the ``defect-free{''} and the
   ``defected{''} regions throughout the BLT film in the lateral direction,
   parallel to the film-substrate interface. As demonstrated from
   atomic-resolved elemental mapping with EELS, the generation of the
   defect-free and regions with defect in the BLT film are likely to be
   induced by the presence of surface steps and dislocations at the
   film-substrate interface. These effects are discussed in terms of the
   large remanent polarization and enhanced fatigue resistance in BLT. (C)

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Evidence is given for the effectiveness of InAs surface passivation by
   the growth of an epitaxial In0.8Al0.2As shell. The electron mobility is
   measured as a function of temperature for both core-shell and
   unpassivated nanowires, with the core-shell nanowires showing a
   monotonic increase in mobility as temperature is lowered, in contrast to
   a turnover in mobility seen for the unpassivated nanowires. We argue
   that this signifies a reduction in low temperature ionized impurity
   scattering for the passivated nanowires, implying a reduction in surface
   states. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Mobile Robot Collision Avoidance in Human Environments}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Collision avoidance is a fundamental requirement for mobile robots.
   Avoiding moving obstacles (also termed dynamic obstacles) with
   unpredictable direction changes, such as humans, is more challenging
   than avoiding moving obstacles whose motion can be predicted. Precise
   information on the future moving directions of humans is unobtainable
   for use in navigation algorithms. Furthermore, humans should be able to
   pursue their activities unhindered and without worrying about the robots
   around them. In this paper, both active and critical regions are used to
   deal with the uncertainty of human motion. A procedure is introduced to
   calculate the region sizes based on worstcase avoidance conditions.
   Next, a novel virtual force field-based mobile robot navigation
   algorithm (termed QVFF) is presented. This algorithm may be used with
   both holonomic and nonholonomic robots. It incorporates improved virtual
   force functions for avoiding moving obstacles and its stability is
   proven using a piecewise continuous Lyapunov function. Simulation and
   experimental results are provided for a human walking towards the robot
   and blocking the path to a goal location. Next, the proposed algorithm
   is compared with five state-of-the-art navigation algorithms for an
   environment with one human walking with an unpredictable change in
   direction. Finally, avoidance results are presented for an environment
   containing three walking humans. The QVFF algorithm consistently
   generated collision-free paths to the goal.}},

Abstract = {{Large increases in viscosity are not normally observed when insoluble
   liquid polymers are mixed in the absence of a compatibilizing agent: the
   liquids separate into bulk phases. Mixing propyl- or allyl-modified
   oligo(ethylene glycol)(PEG), but not the parent hydroxy-terminated
   oligo(ethylene glycol), with silicone pre-elastomers led a sharp
   increase in viscosity that preceded the onset of cure. Only in the case
   of allyl-modified PEG, however, did a low density, closed cell silicone
   foam form that, in addition to trapped bubbles, contained dispersed PEG
   droplets. Rheological studies demonstrate that the origins of the
   viscosity build lie in the formation, shortly after mixing, of
   organo-PEG stabilized droplets that act as fillers within the silicone
   pre-elastomers. Similar viscosity builds were not observed with
   hydroxy-terminated oligo(ethylene glycol). Although the propyl-modified
   PEG led initially to large viscosity increases, its ability to stabilize
   bubbles was comparably limited. The surface activity of the propyl- and
   allyl-PEG compounds themselves facilitates the formation of a colloidal
   dispersion within the silicone. However, the key to the observed foamed
   product is the in situ platinum-catalyzed hydrosilylation of the ally!
   group, prior to or concomitant with silicone cure, leading to
   PEG-silicone copolymers that are able to stabilize both dispersed PEG
   droplets and bubbles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{We studied the photoluminescence spectra of silicon and phosphorus
   co-implanted silica thin films on (100) silicon substrates as a function
   of isothermal annealing time. The rapid phase segregation, formation,
   and growth dynamics of intrinsic silicon nanocrystals are observed, in
   the first 600 s of rapid thermal processing, using dark field mode
   X-TEM. For short annealing times, when the nanocrystal size distribution
   exhibits a relatively small mean diameter, formation in the presence of
   phosphorus yields an increase in the luminescence intensity and a blue
   shift in the emission peak compared with intrinsic nanocrystals. As the
   mean size increases with annealing time, this enhancement rapidly
   diminishes and the peak energy shifts further to the red than the
   intrinsic nanocrystals. These results indicate the existence of
   competing pathways for the donor electron, which depends strongly on the
   nanocrystal size. In samples containing a large density of relatively
   small nanocrystals, the tendency of phosphorus to accumulate at the
   nanocrystal-oxide interface means that ionization results in a
   passivation of dangling bond (P-b-centre) type defects, through a charge
   compensation mechanism. As the size distribution evolves with isothermal
   annealing, the density of large nanocrystals increases at the expense of
   smaller nanocrystals, through an Ostwald ripening mechanism, and the
   majority of phosphorus atoms occupy substitutional lattice sites within
   the nanocrystals. As a consequence of the smaller band-gap, ionization
   of phosphorus donors at these sites increases the free carrier
   concentration and opens up an efficient, non-radiative de-excitation
   route for photo-generated electrons via Auger recombination. This effect
   is exacerbated by an enhanced diffusion in phosphorus doped glasses,
   which accelerates silicon nanocrystal growth. (C) 2013 American

   electron capture and emission times are measured as functions of
   temperature and gate voltage for individual traps, and are consistent
   with traps residing in the few-nanometer-thick native oxide, with a
   Coulomb barrier to trapping. These results suggest that oxide removal
   from the nanowire surface, with proper passivation to prevent regrowth,
   should lead to the reduction or elimination of random telegraph noise,
   an important obstacle for sensitive experiments at the single electron
   level. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The performance of a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) based thermal
   management system for an electronic packaging design that operates under
   a range of ambient conditions and system loads is examined using a
   standard model for the TEC and a thermal resistance network for the
   other components. Experiments were performed and it was found that the
   model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results.
   An operating envelope is developed to characterize the TEC based thermal
   management system for peak and off peak operating conditions. Parametric
   studies were performed to analyze the effect of the number of TEC
   module(s) in the system, geometric factor of the thermo-elements and the
   cold to hot side thermal resistances on the system performance. The
   results showed that there is a tradeoff between the extent of off peak
   heat fluxes and ambient temperatures when the system can be operated at
   a low power penalty region and the maximum capacity of the system. (C)

Abstract = {{Three Global Climate Models (GCMs) output (precipitation and
   temperature), bias corrected with the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD), for the
   A2 and B1 scenarios, are used for drought assessment at a basin scale.
   At a first step, the hydrological model IHMS-HBV was calibrated using
   both local and large scale forcing data (precipitation and temperature)
   aiming to assess the suitability of large scale forcing data in a small
   basin, Platis, located in Crete, for the period 1974-1999. The second
   step includes the forcing of the WFD calibrated HBV model with the bias
   corrected GCM output from 2001 to 2100 (WATCH Driving Data). The
   produced hydrological variables, flow, soil moisture and lower
   groundwater reservoir volume were used for the hydrological regime
   assessment and drought identification with the aid of the threshold
   level method. A quantitative comparison with four future sub-periods was
   carried out addressing the drought events number, duration and deficit
   volume. Simulations of both emission scenarios indicate a significant
   decrease in all hydrological parameters. The relative change of drought
   characteristics for the future periods in terms of the three-model
   ensemble implied severe drought conditions. For A2 scenario, it was
   found that the number of drought events could increase up to 98\%, 109\%
   and 81\% in flow, soil moisture and groundwater respectively. B1
   scenario provided more conservative estimates, with an increase of
   drought events number up to 56\%, 92\% and 34\% in flow, soil moisture
   and groundwater, respectively. The drought duration difference between
   scenarios reaches up to 33\%, 89\% and 34\% for simulated flow, soil
   moisture and groundwater respectively till 2100. Moderate changes can be
   noticed in drought deficit volume with an estimated maximum increase of
   19\%, 33\% and 22\% in flow, soil moisture and groundwater involving A2
   scenario, whereas B1 scenario projected 10\%, 2\% and 26\% maximum
   increase for the former parameters. The evolution of the hydrological
   parameters is in line with the projected decreasing precipitation and
   increasing temperature trends. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Advances in soil moisture retrieval from synthetic aperture radar and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{476}},

Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to soil moisture is
   well established, however, the retrieval of soil moisture from SAR is
   confounded by the effects of surface roughness and vegetation. This
   difficulty has resulted in limited applications of SAR as an operational
   source of soil moisture in hydrology despite the demonstrated benefits
   of high-resolution distributed soil moisture. Technical and
   methodological advances such as multi-configuration radar and
   forthcoming SAR constellations are increasingly mitigating the
   shortcomings of SAR with respect to soil moisture estimation at the
   field and catchment scale. At the same time, progress in data
   assimilation and a better understanding of the impact of phenomena, such
   as climate change, are revealing the hydrological importance of soil
   moisture spatial distribution. Thus, despite the currently modest
   retrieval accuracy, SAR is an important source of soil moisture state
   information for the hydrological community. Towards the end of
   increasing the hydrological utilization of SAR soil moisture, a
   comprehensive literature review was conducted to provide the
   state-of-the-art of SAR soil moisture retrieval methodology, its
   limitations and potential. Following the methodology review, a
   discussion of the benefits and limitations of soil moisture data
   retrieved from SAR is used to outline the scope of SAR derived soil
   moisture for hydrological applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel local feature selection and classification
   method, which finds the most discriminative features for different
   regions of the feature space. To this end, we consider each sample of
   the training set to be a ``representative point{''} of its associated
   class. A feature set (possibly different in size and members) is
   assigned to each representative point. The process of finding a feature
   set for each representative point is independent of the others and can
   be performed in parallel. The proposed method makes no assumptions about
   the underlying structure of the training set; hence the method is
   insensitive to the distribution of the data over the feature space. The
   method is formulated as a linear programming optimization problem, which
   has a very efficient realization. Experimental results demonstrate the
   viability of the formulation and the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

   all-electric (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) utilizing onboard

   requires a battery charger composed of a uni- or bi-directional power

   The expectation for future automotive power electronic converter
   products is lifetimes of 10 years and over, and operation in arduous
   temperature environments, factors that compromise existing power
   converter topologies, in particular those employing electrolytic

Abstract = {{The Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter is an efficient
   algorithm for multitarget tracking in the presence of nonlinearities
   and/or non-Gaussian noise. The Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Gaussian
   Mixture (GM) techniques are commonly used to implement the PHD filter.
   Recently, a new implementation of the PHD filter using B-splines with
   the capability to model any arbitrary density functions using only a few
   knots was proposed. The Spline PHD (SPHD) filter was found to be more
   robust than the SMC-PHD filter since it does not suffer from degeneracy
   and it was better than the GM-PHD implementation in terms of estimation
   accuracy, albeit with a higher computational complexity. In this paper,
   we propose a Multiple Model (MM) extension to the SPHD filter to track
   multiple maneuvering targets. Simulation results are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the new filter.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, based on the measure-theoretic probability theory and the
   theory of stochastic differential equation (SDE), a stochastic fusion
   framework is proposed for the heterogeneous sensor network for the
   purpose of robust decision making. In this framework, for each sensor,
   its sample space and the corresponding sigma-algebra are defined. Then,
   random variables, which are designed to meet the requirements of the
   operation in the battle field, are defined over the pairs of sample
   space and its sigma-algebra. After that, the conditional expectation is
   taken for those random variables conditional on the union of
   sigma-algebras to finish the information fusion process. Furthermore, to
   make the decision making process more robust, the undesired uncertainty
   in the fused information is hedged out based on the theory of SDEs,
   before the fused information is used for the decision making.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with increasing the error resilience of two
   description scalar quantizers by applying a permutation to the index of
   each description, for an m-diagonal initial index assignment. First we
   address the existence of permutations achieving a minimum Hamming
   distance of at least 2. Such permutations allow the central decoder to
   detect any 1 bit error pattern. We establish the connection with the
   hypercube antibandwidth problem, connection which allows us to determine
   the highest value of m for which such a permutation exists and to show
   its construction.
   Further, we highlight the relation between the error robustness at the
   side decoders and the bandwidth of the hypercube labeling associated to
   the permutation. To ensure error resilience at both the central and side
   decoders we are interested in labelings with the lowest bandwidth given
   that the antibandwidth is larger or equal to m. We make some progress
   toward the solution of this problem by constructing a class of hypercube
   labelings trading the increase in antibandwidth for the decrease in
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the three-cell MIMO interfering broadcast channel (IBC) with
   K users assigned to each base station. Each base station has M = 2 K + 1
   antennas and each user has N antennas. We propose two different linear
   precoding schemes to achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) for
   the case in which each user receives only one data stream. The first
   scheme finds the transmit precoders and receive beamformers using a
   sequence of closed-form steps that is initiated by the solution of an
   optimization problem on the Grassmannian manifold. One advantage of this
   scheme is the ability to achieve the optimal DoF with the minimum
   possible number of transmit and receive antennas. In the second scheme,
   the users in one cell will have additional K = 1 antennas, but we have
   been able a closed-form solution for each step of the generation of the
   transmit precoders and receive beamformers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a rate-adaptive free-space optical (FSO) communication
   system using systematic Raptor codes is investigated based on
   experimental data measured over a 1.87 km terrestrial FSO link in
   different weather conditions. Using Raptor codes, the FSO communication
   system can adapt to the channel gain fluctuations caused by atmospheric
   turbulence and/or adverse weather conditions. To alleviate the burden of
   synchronizing between transmitter and receiver, messages are packetized
   and sent in sequence. For each packet, a cyclicredundancy code (CRC) is
   added resulting in an effective packet erasure channel (PEC). Using
   experimental data and on-off-keying (OOK) modulation, the performance of
   the rate-adaptive FSO system is evaluated at different signaling rates.
   While an uncoded FSO system fails to efficiently operate during adverse
   weather conditions, the rate-adaptive technique provides reliable FSO
   communication under clear and rainy weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method for dimensionality reduction of
   high-dimensional input data in a binary classification problem. The
   method is based on selecting a few latent variables that maximize the
   Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between the two class distributions,
   under the assumption that these distributions are multivariate Gaussian.
   Numerical performance is demonstrated by solving the challenging problem
   of classifying patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) into
   responders vs. non-responders to an anti-depressant treatment using
   pre-treatment resting electroencephalography (EEG) data. The extracted
   feature set measures consistent connectivity and includes the magnitude
   coherence features among all electrode pairs in a 3Hz to 30Hz bandwidth
   with 1Hz resolution. An overall 86\% prediction performance indicates
   the effectiveness of the KLDR method in this application. This
   performance level was found to exceed that of other dimensionality
   reduction methods; namely the unsupervised principal component PCA) and
   the supervised Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) methods.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of antennas used in
   tissue microwave imaging. In this method, two identical antennas are
   employed, one transmitting and the other one receiving, in a setup where
   the scattering parameters are measured. Each antenna is considered as a
   two-port network and the antenna efficiency is expressed in terms of its
   equivalent network parameters. A signal flow graph (SFG) is developed
   for the two-port network formed by the two antennas and the medium
   between them. A system of equations is derived from the SFG and it is
   solved for the acquired data. This solution provides the efficiency of
   the antenna. The accuracy of the efficiency estimated from measured and
   simulated data is verified through comparison with full-wave
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes to monitor industrial process faults using
   Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence. The main idea is to measure the
   difference between the distributions of normal and faulty data.
   Sensitivity analysis on the KL divergence under Gaussian distribution
   assumption is performed, which shows that the sensitivity of KL
   divergence increases with the number of samples. For non-Gaussian data,
   a recently proposed kernel method for density ratio estimation is used
   to estimate the KL divergence. The density ratio estimation method does
   not involve direct estimation of probability density functions, hence is
   fast and efficient. For monitoring of non-Gaussian data, the confidence
   limits are obtained through a window based strategy. Application studies
   involving a simulation example and an industrial melter process show
   that the performance of the proposed monitoring strategy is better than
   the principal component analysis (PCA) based statistical local approach.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the two-cell MIMO interfering broadcast channel (IBC) with K
   users assigned to each base station, and we develop two closely-related
   Interference Alignment schemes that are well suited to a limited
   feedback implementation. The schemes are developed for BSs with K + 1
   antennas and receivers with K or K + 1 antennas, respectively. The
   schemes achieve the maximum degrees of freedom (DoF), 2 K, and are shown
   to have a smaller power offset than some competing schemes. We provide
   SNR scaling laws for the number of feedback bits that our scheme require
   to maintain the optimal DoF. Our analysis suggests that there are
   tradeoffs between the feedback requirements, spatial dimensions and user
   cooperation. In particular, having one more antenna at each user can
   greatly reduce the number of feedback bits. Interestingly, the same
   reduction can be realized without additional receive antennas if direct
   user cooperation is allowed.}},

Abstract = {{Time-delay estimation (TDE) is an important problem in radar target
   localization and range profile imaging. A common approach to TDE is
   matched filtering or equivalently cross-correlation, which is
   statistically optimal in white Gaussian noise. However, its performance
   greatly degrades in the presence of impulsive noise or non-Gaussian
   clutter. In this paper, a new concept called l(p)-correlation (0 < p <=
   2), which generalizes the conventional correlation from Hilbert space to
   the l(p)-space, is proposed. In addition, several important mathematical
   properties of the l(p)-correlation are given and proved. Based on the
   l(p)-correlation, a family of TDE algorithms robust against heavy-tailed
   noise or clutter are developed. Simulation results under a-stable noise
   are provided to demonstrate its robustness and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communication has revealed great potential to
   satisfy the soaring wireless data demands. As a key point, interference
   management should be carefully investigated. Different from the view
   that D2D transmissions cause harmful interference to cellular
   communication when reusing the same channels, we deem such interference
   as a kind of spontaneous interference against eavesdropping and use this
   interference to guarantee the secrecy capacity of cellular
   communication. Hence D2D pairs could have their own D2D transmission
   without violating secrecy-based cellular communication. Also, we utilize
   secrecy outage probability to overcome the difficulty in accurately
   obtaining channel gains at the eavesdropper. On the other hand, we take
   the advantage of auction algorithm to derive the channel assignment
   policy, such that multiple D2D pairs are assigned different channels
   with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm
   works well and converges quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon-based devices, circuits and systems are expected to continue to
   dominate the semiconductor and electronics industries in the near to
   medium-term. However, to maintain this dominance, several innovations
   have been made in fabrication technologies, material systems, device
   architecture, and circuit and system designs. While these innovations
   have helped to improve their large-signal properties and maintain
   reliability, often, the result in worse low-frequency noise properties.
   In this paper, we examine the impact of scaling, material systems used
   in device manufacture, new device architectures, sensors and sensor
   systems on the noise characteristics. Finally, from the applications
   perspective, the push to lower voltages for portable/mobile applications
   leads to the signal-to-noise dilemma which becomes more challenging with

Abstract = {{Junctionless field-effect transistors (FETs) are now actively pursued as
   a future silicon transistor technology because of its good scalability,
   excellent electrical performance and relatively simple structure. There
   has been much research and technology development in JL FETs, their
   modeling, including some compact modeling, but relatively little work in
   modeling both noise and static characteristics. In this paper, we
   present an improved dc model that includes the field-dependent mobility
   and doping dependent diffusivity using a modified Einstein's relation
   for heavily doped semiconductors. We verify the new dc model using the
   data from the TCAD simulation. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first
   time, a new noise model and their calculated results for channel thermal
   noise, induced gate noise, and their correlation noise as a function of
   biasing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An energy management system is proposed for a grid-connected microgrid
   with on-site battery storage and renewable energy sources. The system
   controls power flow between the microgrid and grid in order to
   effectively utilize renewable energy and maximize economic benefits for
   the customer and the utility operator. The power flow is optimized by
   formulating and solving a mixed-integer-linear-program optimization over
   a rolling horizon window. Multiple objectives concerning economic
   benefits, cost of battery operation and grid power profile shaping are
   built into the optimization. So called battery incremental red-zone
   power rates are among unique battery management features of this
   formulation. Careful consideration is also given to reducing the
   computations so the controller can run on an embedded computer in real
   time. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of various novel
   aspects of the proposed controller.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a self-adjoint analytical method was proposed to compute the
   S-parameter sensitivities of microwave structures from the field
   solution at the object of interest. However, due to field singularities,
   the method is inapplicable to infinitesimally thin metallic shapes-a
   case of interest in the analysis and design of printed circuits and
   antennas. Here, we propose a formulation, which allows for the
   analytical calculation of the sensitivities with respect to the shape
   parameters of infinitesimally thin metallic objects. The computation is
   simulator-independent and is very fast as it involves a numerical
   integration of the surface current and charge densities along a suitably
   chosen contour on the metal. The method is validated through comparisons
   with reference S-parameters sensitivities obtained with a commercial
   finite-element-method (FEM) simulator. The proposed method enables the
   much needed analytical response sensitivities for simulators that are
   not based on the FEM, e. g., the method of moments (MoM) and the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a three-hop multi-relay network with one
   transmitter, one receiver and two clusters of relay nodes. With the aid
   of perfect channel state information (CSI), two different design
   approaches are devised. In the first approach, we aim to maximize the
   received signal to noise ratio (SNR) under different transmit power
   constraint at the relay nodes by performing optimization on the
   beamforming vectors of the two clusters jointly, whilst in the second
   design, the total transmit power of the relay nodes is minimized under
   the QoS constraint at the receiver. It is shown that, in both
   approaches, upon the coefficients of either one cluster being
   determined, the other one could be optimized, and therefore the overall
   optimization problem can be resorted to an efficient iteration process.
   Simulation results show that our proposed approaches outperform the
   existing solutions for improved energy efficiency and increased
   receiving SNR.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a hardware architecture to accelerate boolean constraint
   propagation (BCP). Although satisfiability (SAT) solvers in software use
   varying search and learning strategies, BCP is a fundamental component
   and by far consumes the most CPU time. Our field-programmable gate array
   (FPGA) design uses on-chip SRAM to facilitate the acceleration of BCP.
   We discuss many insights to our innovative hardware memory layout, which
   is very compact and enables extremely fast BCP. It also supports
   multithreading to minimize the idle time in hardware and to fully
   utilize the multicore processor host. Additionally, many industrial SAT
   instances encode logic gates as constraints. We compact these to
   simultaneously reduce the hardware memory usage as well as speed up the
   computation (enhanced BCP). We implemented our enhanced BCP core and
   integrated it with a simple software SAT solver which communicates over
   PCI Express. Hardware performance counters show that a single processing
   engine is up to 4x faster than a state-of-the-art software SAT solver.}},

Abstract = {{In many scientific, medical and defense applications of image/video
   compression, an l(infinity) error bound is required. However, pure
   l(infinity)-optimized image coding, colloquially known as near-lossless
   image coding, is prone to structured errors such as contours and
   speckles if the bit rate is not sufficiently high; moreover, previous
   l(infinity)-based image coding methods suffer from poor rate control. In
   contrast, the l(2) error metric aims for average fidelity and hence
   preserves the subtlety of smooth waveforms better than the l(infinity)
   error metric and it offers fine granularity in rate control; but pure
   l(2)-based image coding methods (e.g., JPEG 2000) cannot bound
   individual errors as the l(infinity)-based methods can. This paper
   presents a new compression approach to retain the benefits and
   circumvent the pitfalls of the two error metrics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a power control strategy for multiple
   spectrum-sharing networks of single antenna nodes in a spectrum underlay
   scenario. A distinguishing feature of the proposed strategy is that it
   requires only knowledge of the spatial distribution of the nodes, rather
   than instantaneous channel state information. The strategy seeks to
   maximize a weighted sum of the throughput of each network while
   guaranteeing specified successful transmission probabilities. In its
   native form, this joint power allocation problem is difficult to solve.
   However, we show that the problem can be transformed into a convex
   optimization formulation that can be efficiently solved using general
   purpose tools. Furthermore, we analyze the optimality conditions and
   obtain a quasi-closed form solution reminiscent of waterfilling.
   Numerical results demonstrate that spectrum sharing employing the
   proposed optimal power yields a substantial throughput gain over
   allocating the spectrum to a single network.}},

   In addition to achieving the optimal (sum) degrees of freedom (DoF) of
   4/3, the precoders are balanced in the sense that for pairs of symbols
   the signal-to-noise ratio at the input to the decoder is the same.
   Furthermore, the sum rate is shown to have a small power offset-in one
   simple scenario that offset is at least 6 dB smaller than the offset of
   an existing scheme. The principles that underlie this scheme are
   extended to a time-varying channel with delayed feedback in which either

   With this unique factorization, a new distributed concatenated Alamouti
   code is proposed for a one-way relaying network consisting of two
   single-antenna terminals and one relay having two antennas. This design
   allows the relay to transmit its own information while forwarding the
   source information which it has received to the destination. By making
   use of the Alamouti coding scheme twice and jointly processing the
   signals from the two antennas at the relay node, such a code design also
   renders the equivalent channel between source and destination be a
   product of the two Alamouti channels and therefore, is called
   distributed concatenated Alamouti space-time block code (STBC). In
   addition, the asymptotic symbol error probability (SEP) formula is
   derived with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector, showing that the
   optimal diversity gain function is achieved and proportional to ln
   SNR/SNR2.}},

   paper proposes a new design that makes the channel matrix be

   (SBSD). Using ODSTBC, an asymptotic symbol error probability (SEP)
   formula with SBSD is derived, showing the optimal diversity gain
   function is achieved. In addition, two kinds of ODSTBC designs for the
   distributed relay networks are presented, which interestingly renders
   that SBSD is equivalent to the ML detector. Numerical results verify the
   diversity analysis and indicate competitive error performance to
   currently available orthogonal distributed STBC designs with much

Abstract = {{Surface and interface characteristics of substrates are critical for
   reliable wafer bonding. Understanding the elemental and compositional
   states of surfaces after various processing conditions is necessary when
   bonding dissimilar materials. Therefore, we investigated the elemental
   and compositional states of silicon (Si), silicon dioxide (SiO2) and
   glass surfaces exposed to oxygen reactive ion etching (O-2 RIE) plasma
   followed by storage in controlled humidity and/or ambient atmospheric
   conditions to understand the chemical mechanisms in the direct wafer
   bonding. High-resolution X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) spectra
   of O-2 RIE treated Si, SiO2 and glass showed the presence of Si(-O)(2)
   resulting in highly reactive surfaces. A considerable shift in the
   binding energies of Si(-O)(2), Si(-O)(4) and Si(-OH)(x) were observed
   only in Si due to plasma oxidation of the surface. The humidity and
   ambient storage of plasma activated Si and SiO2 increased Si(-OH)(x) due
   to enhanced sorption of hydroxyls. The amounts of Si(-O)(2) and
   Si(-OH)(x) of Si varied in different humidity storage conditions which
   are attributed to crystal-orientation dependent surface morphology and
   oxidation. The O-2 RIE plasma induced high surface reactivity and
   humidity induced Si(-OH)(x) can play an important role in the
   hydrophilic wafer bonding with low temperature heating. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose to extend the adjoint variable method (AVM) to
   the sensitivity analysis of dispersive materials. In the optical range,
   most common materials are frequency dependent. The complexity of the
   modeling approaches of these materials delayed the development of
   simulation-based AVM techniques. We circumvent the mathematical
   difficulties through utilizing the Z-domain representation of the
   dispersive models. We exploit the time domain modeling technique
   (transmission line modeling) for efficient calculation of the structure
   sensitivities. The theory is developed for general dispersive materials
   modeled by Drude or Lorentz models. Adjoint variable method is known to
   be the ultimate efficient sensitivity calculation modality. The
   sensitivity is calculated with respect to all the designable parameters
   utilizing at most one extra simulation. This is far more efficient than
   the regular finite difference approaches with a computational overhead
   that scales linearly with the number of design parameters. The theory
   has been successfully applied to a subwavelength structure of 180 bend
   utilizing metamaterial slab where the design variables are the shape
   parameters and material parameters of the metamaterial slab. The results
   are compared to the accurate yet expensive finite difference approach

Abstract = {{Since its establishment in the 1890s, the Canadian National Hydrometric
   Network (CNHN) has become the main source of water information for
   various users across the country. The CNHN provides the essential
   information and data on the status of one of the most precious natural
   resources of Canada: its surface water resources. However, the CNHN has
   never been evaluated based on international standards such as the World
   Meteorological Organization (WMO) guidelines for hydrometric network
   density. This preliminary analysis aims to fill that gap and provide
   background information on CNHN density. In this study, the CNHN is
   evaluated using WMO (2008) guidelines as a benchmark. Spatial analysis
   techniques are applied to determine the areas that meet the WMO (2008)
   minimum network density standards and those that do not meet the minimum
   standards. It was found that only about 12\% of the Canadian terrestrial
   area is covered by hydrometric networks that meet the WMO (2008) minimum
   standards, while 49\% of the terrestrial area is poorly gauged and about
   39\% is ungauged. The poorly gauged and ungauged areas are largely
   located in the mountainous and northern regions. Only a few spots in the
   southern parts of the country have a streamflow network density that
   meets the WMO (2008) minimum recommendation. An estimated total of about
   5041 new stations are needed to bring the CNHN up to WMO (2008) minimum
   standard level. The study results clearly confirm the necessity to
   continue operating all existing streamflow stations and the need to add
   new streamflow stations. However, further analysis is required to
   optimize the CNHN at the regional scale by accounting for other factors
   such as population density, specific needs and economic constraints.}},

Abstract = {{From the early days of slag metal reaction studies in the 1950's to the
   mid 1980s, a generation of metallurgists contributed much to the theory
   of slags and their reactions. These workers showed us the importance of
   charge transfer in slags. They demonstrated that the reaction interface
   could change dramatically under the influence of reaction and many
   questions were asked about the specific reaction mechanisms. This paper
   will review work in slag metal reactions since the mid 1980s and examine
   our progress in answering some of the questions raised by the early
   pioneers. The author will focus on recent work from his own laboratory
   as well as labs from around the World. Finally the author will make some
   suggestions regarding future directions in this field.}},

   matching methods have been applied to dynamic process monitoring.
   However, they do not take into account the non-Gaussian features in
   industrial processes and are also more focused on fault detection
   instead of fault diagnosis. In this paper, an independent component
   analysis and mutual information based non-Gaussian pattern matching
   approach is developed for fault detection and diagnosis of complex
   chemical processes. The presented approach is applied to a simulated
   cryogenic air separation process and the application study demonstrates
   that the developed non-Gaussian pattern matching method can effectively
   monitor the complex air separation process with strong capability of
   fault detection and diagnosis.}},

   redundancy in the system through state observer design. To this end, out
   of possible actuator and sensor faults, we consider subsets of faults,
   and design state observers and an associated residual that is only
   sensitive to faults in each subset. With the ability of detecting faults
   in a subset, they can be isolated by checking whether the corresponding
   residuals breach their thresholds. The proposed method enables
   differentiating between actuator and sensor faults while explicitly
   accounting for system nonlinearity. The effectiveness of the fault
   isolation design is illustrated using a chemical reactor example.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the production of Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to
   achieve target quality variables such as number and weight average
   molecular weights. A dynamic multiple-model based approach is first used
   to capture the process dynamics using data generated from a detailed
   first principles model. Subsequently, the multiple-model is integrated
   with a quality model to enable predicting the end quality based on
   initial conditions and candidate control input (jacket temperature)
   moves. A data-driven model predictive controller is then designed to
   achieve the desired product quality while satisfying input and a lower
   bound on the conversion, as well as additional constraints that enforce
   the validity of data-driven models for the range of chosen input moves.
   Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance (10.4\% and
   6.5\% relative error in number average and weight average molecular
   weight compared to 19.8\% and 18.5\%) of the controller over traditional
   trajectory tracking approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Batch processes are characterized by inherent nonlinearity, multiplicity
   of operating phases, between-phase transient dynamics and batch-to-batch
   uncertainty that pose significant challenges for accurate state
   estimation and quality prediction. Conventional multi-model strategies,
   however, may be ill-suited for multiphase batch processes because the
   localized models do not specifically characterize the complex transient
   dynamics between two consecutive operating phases. In this study, a
   novel Bayesian model averaging based multi-kernel Gaussian process
   regression (BMA-MKGPR) approach is proposed for state estimation and
   quality prediction of nonlinear batch processes with multiple operating
   phases and between-phase transient dynamics. The new approach is applied
   to a simulated batch polymerization process and the result comparison
   shows that it can effective handle multiple nonlinear operating phases,
   between-phase transient dynamics and process uncertainty with high
   prediction accuracies.}},

   including: physics, air traffic control, ground vehicle monitoring, and
   processing medical images. The probabilistic data association algorithm,
   in conjunction with the Kalman filter (KF), is one of the most popular
   and well-studied strategies. The relatively new smooth variable
   structure filter (SVSF) offers a robust and stable estimation strategy
   under the presence of modeling errors, unlike the KF method. The purpose
   of this paper is to introduce and formulate the SVSF-PDA, which can be
   used for target tracking. A simple example is used to compare the
   estimation results of the popular KF-PDA with the new SVSF-PDA.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of a building obtaining Net-Zero Energy (NZE) consumption over
   the course of a year is often difficult due to the size of the roof area
   relative to the occupied space. Typically only signal story buildings or
   homes are able to achieve NZE from renewable solar energy generation
   situated just on the roof of the building. An optimization analysis was
   done on the various parameters that effect system electrical production
   to find the parameter combination that maximizes annual electrical
   production. The optimization seeks to find the highest annual energy
   generated per roof space and it does not focus on the standard lowest
   cost per installed watt target.
   The optimization analysis is shown as a design procedure that could be
   applied to any location. To demonstrate a practical application of the
   procedure, a case study was performed. The optimization demonstrated
   that standard solar array designs do not provide the most annual energy
   generation. However, the optimal design introduces other challenges such
   as snow runoff and higher solar cell temperature that had to be
   addressed. The results of the optimization will be applicable to most
   locations in North America, and should be considered by designers
   looking to build multistory NZE buildings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new novel form of the Smooth Variable Structure Filter
   (SVSF) is proposed. The SVSF is a recently proposed predictor-corrector
   filter for state and parameter estimation, and it is based on the
   sliding mode control concepts. It defines a hyperplane and then applies
   a discontinuous corrective action that forces the estimate to go back
   and forth across that plane. Thereby, the SVSF is robust and stable
   technique. The proposed SVSF uses a saturated function with an
   associated fixed-width smoothing boundary layer to eliminate chattering.
   However, it has been noticed that the filter performance could be
   improved by using a time-varying smoothing boundary layer that is
   directly linked to the output's a priori estimation error. In this
   paper, a solution for a time-varying, stable and robust smoothing
   boundary layer width is obtained based on using two filters; the first
   is to maintain stability, and the second is to obtain the modified
   estimate vector that minimizes the diagonal elements of the error
   covariance matrix. The proposed method is tested on an
   electro-hydrostatic actuator proposed in {[}1] and its performance is
   compared with the Kalman Filter performance.}},

Abstract = {{Video transport in wireless mesh networks is a challenging problem
   because of frequent link failures, limited link capacity, and multihop
   communications. However, the mesh topology provides some degree of
   freedom in designing error resilient video broadcasting scheme, as
   multiple links can exist between a source and a destination. In this
   paper, we combine the mesh nature with Multiple Description Coding (MDC)
   technique to design a video broadcasting scheme. An Access Point (AP) is
   broadcasting video traffic to the Mobile Stations (MSs) via a number of
   Relay Stations (RSs). The AP utilizes MDC technique to encode video
   traffic into equal descriptions. Each description is multicasted to
   several RSs, which further broadcast the descriptions to MSs. Whether or
   not an MS can successfully receive a description from an RS depends on
   the transmission power of the RS and the channel conditions between the
   RS and the MS. For each MS, the quality of the received video depends on
   the total number of correctly received descriptions. We study how to
   allocate the transmission power of the RSs so that to satisfy the
   quality of the received video at each MS while minimizing the maximum
   transmission power at the RSs. An optimization problem is first
   formulated, and then a heuristic power adjustment scheme is proposed to
   find the transmission power of each RS. Our numerical results show a
   good match between optimal solution and proposed heuristic.}},

Abstract = {{Using network coding in a wireless network can potentially improve the
   network throughput. On the other hand, it increases the complexity of
   resource allocations as the quality of one transmission is often
   affected by the link conditions of the transmitter node to multiple
   destination nodes. In this paper we consider a multi-channel wireless
   network with a star topology. Network coding is used for data
   transmissions of each bidirectional link through a relay node, which has
   multiple radios, each for one bidirectional link. We study the channel
   and time allocations in this network, so that the overall network
   throughput is maximized. An optimum problem is first formulated and
   solved, and two heuristic schemes, Concurrent Node Selection and Channel
   Assignment (CNSCA) and Sequential Node Selection and Channel Assignment
   (SNSCA), with different complexity are proposed. Our results indicate
   that the CNSCA scheme has high complexity and achieves close-to-optimum
   performance, and the SNSCA scheme requires lower complexity and achieves
   relatively lower throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing the recently-developed unique factorization of signals and

   space-time block code design is presented for a two-way
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying network, where both two sources and
   the relay are equipped with a single antenna. For such system, two
   asymptotic pairwise error probability (PEP) formulae are first derived
   for both fixed-gain AF and variable-gain AF over Rayleigh channels with
   the maximum likelihood detector. Then, subject to the constraints on a
   fixed transmission bit rate and unity average transmission energy, the
   optimal constellation combinations with the optimal energy-scales as the
   coefficients are attained by minimizing the dominant term of PEP. It is
   shown that the PEP and the average block error rate of the
   newly-designed code are superior to those of the conventional
   distributed Alamouti code.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of many biological and chemical sensors is critically
   dependent on the stability of the potential imposed or sensed through a
   reference electrode. As these sensors are miniaturized, the reference
   electrode has to be miniaturized simultaneously without any loss to its
   stability. In this paper, we describe a new microfluidic miniaturized
   silver/silver chloride reference electrode that demonstrates
   significantly better stability and lifetime than conventional designs.
   In our new design, we have miniaturized the existing format of the
   macroscale reference electrode and added the capability to replenish the
   internal solution by integrating it with a microfluidic channel. The
   replenishment of the internal solution significantly improves the
   performance of these electrodes over other miniaturized designs. We
   demonstrate reference electrodes that are very stable (potential
   variation of <0.1 mV), with minimal drift (similar to 1 mV) and
   lifetimes longer than 100 hours. We have also characterized the behavior
   of these electrodes to changes in pH and chlorine concentration of the
   external solution. The results indicate insensitivity of the
   microfluidic reference electrode potential to the presence of any
   analyte in the test solution. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All

   increasingly studied for various medical applications. In addition,
   there has been continuous research and technology development of more
   improved light transport models in tissues, practical simplifying
   assumptions to aid in analysis, more efficient imaging algorithms, and
   more reliable instrumentation. In this paper, we review time-resolved
   near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging from an engineering perspective
   and describe some of the key results of progress in the field. We
   discuss various techniques and hardware components of near-infrared
   spectroscopy and imaging systems, highlighting their advantages and
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss a novel finite element method-based technique for estimating
   accurate sensitivities of the desired response. Our technique utilizes
   the central adjoint variable method (CAVM) for estimating the response
   sensitivities. This approach features accuracy comparable to that of the
   central finite difference (CFD) approximation at the response level. Our
   approach uses a simple perturbation method to calculate the sensitivity
   of modal parameters of various waveguide structures with respect to the
   geometric and material parameters. No additional simulation is required
   to calculate the response and its sensitivity with respect to all the
   design parameters. The accuracy of our approach is illustrated by
   comparing the results with the second order accurate CFD applied on the
   response level. Our results show a very good agreement between the
   CAVM-based sensitivities and those obtained using the expensive central.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an adjoint variable method (AVM) for efficient wideband
   sensitivity analysis of the dispersive plasmonic structures.
   Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) is exploited for calculation of the
   structure sensitivities. The theory is developed for general dispersive
   materials modeled by Drude or Lorentz model. Utilizing the dispersive
   AVM, sensitivities are calculated with respect to all the designable
   parameters regardless of their number using at most one extra
   simulation. This is significantly more efficient than the regular finite
   difference approaches whose computational overhead scales linearly with
   the number of design parameters. A Z-domain formulation is utilized to
   allow for the extension of the theory to a general material model. The
   theory has been successfully applied to a structure with teeth-shaped
   plasmonic resonator. The design variables are the shape parameters
   (widths and thicknesses) of these teeth. The results are compared to the
   accurate yet expensive finite difference approach and good agreement is
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient dispersion and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was achieved using organic dyes, such as
   pyrocatechol violet (PV) and m-cresol purple (CP). The problem of MnO2
   nanoparticle dispersion in concentrated suspensions was addressed by the
   use of PV as a dispersant. The analysis and comparison of experimental
   data for PV and CP provided insight into the influence of chemical
   structures of the dyes on their adsorption on MWCNTs and MnO2. The
   adsorption of PV on MWCNTs and MnO2 was attributed to pi-pi interactions
   and catecholate type bonding, respectively. The EPD yield can be varied
   by the variation of the PV concentration in the suspensions, deposition
   voltage and time. It was found that PV can be used as a co-dispersant
   for EPD of MWCNTs and MnO2 and the fabrication of MnO2-MWCNT composites.
   The proposed approach offers advantages of uniform distribution of
   individual components and low binder content in the composite.
   MnO2-MWCNT films were prepared by EPD for thin film electrodes of
   electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). Bulk MnO2-MWCNT electrodes with a
   material loading of 40 mg cm(-2) were obtained by the impregnation of Ni
   foam current collectors. The highest specific capacitance of 5.9 F
   cm(-2) (148 F g(-1)) was achieved. The composite materials are promising
   for ES applications.}},

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole (PPy) nanofibers and composites, containing PPy and

   their efficient electrosteric dispersion in water. Sedimentation tests,
   electrophoretic deposition (EPD) experiments, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy data showed strong adsorption of MG
   on PPy and MWCNTs. The important finding was the possibility of
   efficient dispersion of PPy and MWCNTs using MG dye as a co-dispersant.
   The new approach allowed colloidal processing of individual materials
   and composites. This method is suitable for the cathodic EPD of
   electrically neutral PPy and MWCNTs. The ES electrodes with high
   material loading in the range of 10-30 mg cm(-2) were prepared from
   colloidal suspensions of PPy nanofibers and MWCNTs using Ni foam current

   composite electrodes prepared without MG. The composite PPy-MWCNT
   electrodes with high mass loadings showed excellent capacitance

Abstract = {{For linear and well-defined estimation problems with Gaussian noise, the
   Kalman filter (KF) yields the best result in terms of estimation
   accuracy. However; the KF performance degrades and can fail in cases
   involving large uncertainties such as modeling errors in the estimation
   process. The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is a model-based
   estimation method built on sliding mode theory with excellent robustness
   to modeling uncertainties. Wavelet theory has attracted interest as a
   powerful tool for signal and image processing, and can be used to
   further improve estimation accuracy. In this paper, a new filtering
   strategy based on stationary wavelet theory and the smooth variable
   structure filter is proposed. This strategy, referred to as W-SVSF, is
   applied on an electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA) for the purposes of
   state estimation. The results of the W-SVSF are compared with the
   standard KE SVSF, and combined W-KF.}},

Title = {{Estimating the stormwater attenuation benefits derived from planting
   four monoculture species of deciduous trees on vacant and underutilized
   urban land parcels}},
Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{401-407}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents research that was undertaken to determine whether
   planting deciduous trees, using intensive tree planting schemes, on
   vacant and underutilized urban land provides significant hydrologic
   benefits. This work contributes to an ongoing discussion on how to use
   vacant and underutilized land productively, and may be important to land
   use decision-makers, whose policies support the use of green
   infrastructure for stormwater management. Tree growth parameters for
   four monoculture planting schemes were modeled (all trees had a 50.8 mm
   caliper at planting) and included (i) 450 Ginkgo biloba, (ii) 92
   Platanus x acerifolia, (iii) 120 Acer saccharinum, and (iv) 434
   Liquidambar styraciflua, on a 1.6-acre parcel. i-Tree Hydro (formerly
   UFORE-Hydro) was used to derive a simplified Microsoft Excel-based water
   balance model to quantify the canopy interception potential and
   evaporation, based on 7 years (2002-2008) of historical hourly rainfall
   and mean temperature data in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. This study
   revealed that three of the species responded similarly, while one
   species (L. styraciflua) performed significantly better with respect to
   total canopy storage potential and evaporation, capturing and
   evaporating 2.9 m(3)/tree over the 7 years analyzed, or 1280 m(3) for
   the total tree stand of 434 trees. The analyses presented herein
   demonstrate that the tree canopy layer was able to intercept and
   evaporate approximately 6.5\%-11\% of the total rainfall that falls onto
   the crown across the 7 years studied, for the G. biloba, P. X acerifolia
   and A. saccharinum tree stands and 17\%-27\% for the L styraciflua tree
   stand. This study revealed that the rate at which a species grows, the
   leaf area index of the species as it matures, and the total number of
   trees to be planted need to be determined to truly understand the
   behavior and potential benefits of different planting schemes; had the
   mature leaf area been used as the sole indicator of the stormwater
   attenuating potential for each species, the A. saccharinum would have
   been the selected species. Also, had attenuation and evaporation per
   unit of tree been the only measurement reported, the P. X acenfolia
   stand would have been deemed the best performing tree, attenuating and
   evaporating 8.1 m(3)/tree. While the actual values presented herein may
   be uncertain because of a lack of locally-derived tree growth models,
   the approach described warrants further investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Defect structure of pseudo phases of wustite}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-33}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There have been several reports in the literature of the existence of
   pseudo phases of wustite, whereas other workers have disputed their
   existence. In this work the kinetics of the oxygen exchange reaction
   between carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide were measured on wustite
   surfaces and discontinuities in the rate constants were observed at the
   proposed boundaries between the pseudo phases. This result supports the
   existence of pseudo phases and provides evidence for the location of
   pseudo phase boundaries. Rate constants were measured using an isotope
   exchange technique which allows for the measurement of the rate of the
   surface reaction, even when the overall rate is controlled by diffusion.
   The measured rate constants are dependent on the oxygen activity. This
   dependence is expressed by k(a) = k(o)a(O)(-m). m was found to change at
   oxygen partial pressures which have been proposed by other workers to
   define the phase boundaries of the pseudo phases. In the wustite region
   m was found to be equal to 0.51, 0.66 and 1.0 for the w(1), w(2) and
   w(3) pseudo phases respectively at 995 degrees C. At 850 degrees C, in
   wustite, m was found to be equal to 0.59 for the w(1)' and w(2)' pseudo
   phases and 1.0 for the w(3)' pseudo phase. Analysis of the oxygen
   potential dependence of the rate constants showed the following defects
   to be dominant: in the w(1) and w(1)' regions the 7 : 2 type II, in w(2)
   and w(2)' regions the 12 : 4 type II and in the w(3) and w(3)' regions
   the 16: 5 type I.}},

   The ability to achieve three-dimensional imaging without back-scattered
   waves enables the imaging of high-loss objects, for example, tissues,
   where the back-scattered waves may not be available due to low
   signal-to-noise ratio or nonreciprocal measurement setup. The simulation

Abstract = {{We propose a surface plasmon multilevel coupler based on the orthogonal
   junction coupling technique between silicon nanowires and plasmonic slot
   waveguides (PSWs). It couples light of different polarizations from a
   silicon nanowire into multilevel plasmonic networks. Two orthogonal PSWs
   are employed to guide each polarization to its respective port. The
   proposed structure splits the polarizations and allows for simultaneous
   processing at different horizontal layers. Our device overcomes inherent
   polarization limitation in plasmonic structures by providing multilevel
   optical signal processing. This ability of controlling polarization can
   be exploited to achieve 3-D multilevel plasmonic circuits and
   polarization controlled chip to chip channel. Our device is of a compact
   size and a wideband operation. The device utilizes both quasi-TE and
   quasi-TM polarizations to allow for increased optical processing
   capability. The crosstalk is minimal between the two polarizations
   propagating in two different levels. We achieve -4.5 dB transmission
   efficiency at a wavelength of 1.55 mu m for the different polarizations
   in the respective ports. A transmission efficiency of -21 dB is achieved
   in the subsidiary port. We analyze and simulate the structure using the
   FDTD method. The proposed device can be utilized in integrated chips for
   optical signal processing and optical computations.}},

   agents to track an active leader and/or distributed rejection with

Abstract = {{The effect of solute niobium in retarding coarsening rate of austenite

   examined in thermo-mechanical controlled rolling of high Nb microalloyed
   steel. The importance of austenite grain refinement prior to pancaking
   in compact strip rolling of high Nb microalloyed steel as a means to
   increase surface area to volume ratio of pancaked austenite grain is
   emphasized. This is to promote adequate nucleation sites for phase
   transformation even under conditions of reduced strain accumulation
   resulting from low total rolling reduction below temperature of no

Abstract = {{Three major hydrogenated castor oil crystal morphologies have been
   observed: fiber, rosette and irregular crystal. Due to the difficulty in
   obtaining samples with a single crystal morphology, rheological studies
   of suspensions containing mixtures of the three morphologies in an
   aqueous solution have been undertaken. The viscometry of dilute
   suspensions has shown that the magnitude of intrinsic viscosity is
   dominated by the fraction of a crystal morphology type, i.e. fiber >
   rosette > irregular crystal. A modified Farris model was fitted to the
   rheology data for mixtures of crystal morphology with interacting
   particles. A yield stress exists for concentrated suspensions followed
   by a shear thinning behavior with the increase of shear rate. A
   power-law relation has been found between yield stress and total
   particle volume fraction, and a constant exponent of 1.5 has been
   obtained regardless of crystal morphology.}},

   the gate-and drain-terminal voltages, but also from fundamental
   parameters such as the mobility and the threshold voltage. Other models

Abstract = {{The large strain Elastic Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (EVPSC) model,
   with the recently developed Twinning and De-Twinning (TDT) description,
   is applied to study the mechanical behavior of magnesium alloy AZ31
   extrusion. Five different specimen orientations with tilt angles of
   alpha of 0 degrees, 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, 67.5 degrees and 90
   degrees between extrusion direction and longitudinal specimen axis are
   used to study the mechanical anisotropy under both uniaxial tension and
   compression. It is found that the uniform strain under tension is
   sensitive to the tilt angle and the maximum uniform strain is found at
   alpha = 45 degrees. The effect of pre-strain in uniaxial compression
   along the extrusion direction on subsequent uniaxial tension and
   compression along different directions with respect to the extrusion
   direction is also investigated. It is demonstrated that the influence of
   the twinning during pre-strain in compression and the detwinning in the
   subsequent uniaxial tension on the uniaxial tension response depends
   significantly on the tilt angle. By comparing the differences in the
   flow stress vs. orientation curves between the as-received and
   pre-strained samples, the effect of pre-straining on material anisotropy
   is investigated. It is found that the pre-compression lowers the uniform
   strain regardless of the tilt angle alpha.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the development of microfluidic oxygenator (MFO)
   units designed for a lung assist device (LAD) for newborn infants. This
   device will be connected to the umbilical vessels like the natural
   placenta and provide gas exchange. The extracorporeal blood flow is only
   driven by the pressure difference between the umbilical artery and vein
   without the use of external pumps. The LAD is designed for use in
   ambient air (similar to 21\% of 760 mmHg). The main focus of this paper
   is the presentation of the development of the MFO units testing various
   membrane materials with human blood to enhance gas exchange and in the
   design of fluidic inlets to lower the pressure drop across the
   oxygenator. Four different membranes, including thin film PDMS, porous
   PDMS, and two different pore size porous polycarbonate membranes are
   compared in this study. Among them, the microfluidic oxygenator with
   porous PDMS membrane has the highest gas exchange rate of 1.46 mu L
   min(-1) cm(2) for oxygen and 5.27 mu L min(-1) cm(2) for carbon dioxide
   and performs better than a commercial hollow fiber-based oxygenator by
   367 and 233\%, respectively. A new tapered inlet configuration was
   designed to reduce the pressure drop across the oxygenator and showed a
   further 57\% improvement over the traditional perpendicular inlet
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces and describes the hourly, high-resolution soil
   moisture dataset continuously recorded by the McMaster Mesonet located
   in the Hamilton-Halton Watershed in Southern Ontario, Canada. The
   McMaster Mesonet consists of a network of time domain reflectometer
   (TDR) probes collecting hourly soil moisture data at six depths between
   10 cm and 100 cm at nine locations per site, spread across four sites in
   the 1250 km(2) watershed. The sites for the soil moisture arrays are
   designed to further improve understanding of soil moisture dynamics in a
   seasonal climate and to capture soil moisture transitions in areas that
   have different topography, soil and land cover. The McMaster Mesonet
   soil moisture constitutes a unique database in Canada because of its
   high spatio-temporal resolution. In order to provide some insight into
   the dominant processes at the McMaster Mesonet sites, a spatio-temporal
   and temporal stability analysis were conducted to identify
   spatio-temporal patterns in the data and to suggest some physical
   interpretation of soil moisture variability. It was found that the
   seasonal climate of the Great Lakes Basin causes a transition in soil
   moisture patterns at seasonal timescales. During winter and early spring
   months, and at the meadow sites, soil moisture distribution is governed
   by topographic redistribution, whereas following efflorescence in the
   spring and summer, soil moisture spatial distribution at the forested
   site was also controlled by vegetation canopy. Analysis of short-term
   temporal stability revealed that the relative difference between sites
   was maintained unless there was significant rainfall (> 20 mm) or wet
   conditions a priori. Following a disturbance in the spatial soil
   moisture distribution due to wetting, the relative soil moisture pattern
   re-emerged in 18 to 24 h. Access to the McMaster Mesonet data can be
   provided by visiting www.hydrology.mcmaster.ca/mesonet.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the problem of modeling the complex nonlinear
   behavior of the nylon-6, 6 batch polymerization process and then
   subsequently tracking trajectories of important process variables,
   namely the reaction medium temperature and reactor pressure, using model
   predictive control. To this end, a data-based multi-model approach is
   proposed in which multiple local linear models are identified from
   previous batch data using latent variable regression and then combined
   using an appropriate (continuous) weighting function that arises from
   fuzzy c-means clustering. The proposed approach unifies the concepts of
   auto-regressive exogenous (ARX) modeling, latent variable regression
   techniques, fuzzy c-means clustering, and multiple local linear models
   in an integrated framework capable of capturing the nonlinearities and
   multivariate nature of batch data. The resulting data-based model is
   then used to formulate a trajectory tracking predictive controller.
   Through simulation studies, the modeling approach is shown to capture
   the major nonlinearities in the nylon-6, 6 polymerization process and
   closed-loop simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   predictive controller and illustrate its advantages over existing
   trajectory tracking approaches such as conventional
   proportional-integral control and latent variable model predictive
   control.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{4302-4308}},
Abstract = {{The recent application of electron tomography to the study of
   biomaterial interfaces with bone has brought about an awareness of
   nano-osseointegration and, to a further extent, demanded increasingly
   advanced characterization methodologies. In this study, nanoscale
   osseointegration has been studied via laser-modified titanium implants.
   The micro- and nano-structured implants were placed in the proximal
   tibia of New Zealand white rabbits for six months. High-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), analytical microscopy,
   including energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and
   energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM), as well as electron tomography studies were
   used to investigate the degree of nano-osseointegration in two- and
   three-dimensions. HRTEM indicated the laser-modified surface encouraged
   the formation of crystalline hydroxyapatite in the immediate vicinity of
   the implant. Analytical studies suggested the presence of a functionally
   graded interface at the implant surface, characterized by the gradual
   intermixing of bone with oxide layer. Yet, the most compelling of
   techniques, which enabled straightforward visualization of
   nano-osseointegration, proved to be segmentation of electron tomographic
   reconstructions, where thresholding techniques identified bone
   penetrating into the nanoscale roughened surface features of
   laser-modified titanium. Combining high-resolution, analytical and
   three-dimensional electron microscopy techniques has proven to encourage
   identification and understanding of nano-osseointegration.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{6188-6225}},
Abstract = {{After efficiency, lifetime is the second most important parameter for
   organic devices. Interfaces play a major role in that lifetime. This
   article reviews the current state of the art with regards to interfacial
   stability and control of electrode/active layer interfaces to understand
   the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. From examples
   relating to interfacial chemical reactions, interfacial morphological
   changes, and interfacial electronic level modification, a comprehensive
   picture of the role of the organic-electrode interfaces in device
   stability can be formed. The review begins with a brief overview of
   degradation in organic devices, including definitions and measurement
   approaches. It is then broken into two sections. The first focuses on
   the bottom contact (substrate) interface, specifically chemical
   reactions and dewetting, as the two main mechanisms of device
   degradation. The second section examines the top contact interface,
   which is prone to oxidation, interdiffusion, blistering and
   delamination, and inhomogeneous loss of performance (dark spots). For
   both sections, various approaches to overcoming device instabilities are
   given, with special attention to the various interlayers that have been
   introduced into devices for improved stability. Each section also
   includes examples where the main degradation mechanism is used
   advantageously to produce novel device architectures and surprising
   solutions to device degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Enthalpy and entropy changes on structural relaxation of Mg65Cu25Tb10
   glass have been studied after keeping its samples for varying periods of
   time t(a) at several temperatures T(a)s, and after keeping for fixed
   t(a) at various T(a)s. At a fixed T-a, the decrease in the enthalpy and
   entropy occurred with time according to a non-exponential kinetics. When
   the sample was kept for the same t(a), but at different T(a)s, the
   decrease in the enthalpy and entropy showed a peak at a temperature when
   the sample reached an equilibrium state for that t(a). The rate of heat
   release from the DSC heating scan was analyzed in terms of the model for
   non-exponential, non-linear enthalpy relaxation. A single set of
   parameters that fitted the data for un-annealed glass did not fit the
   data for the highly annealed glass. This is expected in view of the
   approximations made in the model and the contribution from the
   Johari-Goldstein (JG) relaxation. It is shown that the distribution of
   relaxation times leads to memory effect for a glass sample of complex
   thermal history. This has been investigated by measurement of the
   enthalpy change on structural relaxation of two bulk metallic glasses,
   Mg65Cu25Tb10 and Zr46.75Ti8.25Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 by DSC using two-step
   annealing temperature procedure. The memory effect was observed as an
   increase in enthalpy with time and then a decrease.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the addition of a solute can change both
   work-hardening characteristics and yield stress; however, there are few
   available models which describe the role of a solute in relation to both
   the isotropic and kinematic aspects of work hardening. The current work
   extends the well-established approach of Kocks and Mecking to include
   the occurrence of cross slip and its dependence on solute content. The
   proposed model is compared with experimental data for the system FeAl by
   reference both to the observed work hardening in monotonic loading and
   the Bauschinger effect measured in reverse shear tests. The agreement
   between the model and the experimental data is satisfactory and suggests
   a new description of work hardening which includes a prediction of the
   ratio of isotropic and kinematic hardening for a given solute content.}},

Abstract = {{Latent hardening produced by different dislocation patterns in fatigued
   copper single crystals and the stability of these structures under the
   change of dominant slip mechanism have been studied under conditions of
   secondary fatigue at room temperature. Due to the larger anisotropy of
   the dislocation substructure, easy glide orientations of single crystals
   produce stronger latent hardening in non-coplanar slip systems than
   multiple slip orientations. There is no correlation between latent
   hardening ratios for different slip systems and the fatigue behavior of
   the secondary samples. The secondary samples may exhibit hardening or
   softening, depending on the relation between saturation stress of the
   secondary samples and the latent hardening produced by the primary
   substructure in the latent slip systems. The pre-saturation region in
   single crystals is strongly dependent on the pre-existing dislocation
   substructure and the slip systems operating during secondary fatigue.
   The saturation stress is independent of the fatigue history and the
   microstructure and is controlled by the crystallographic orientation of
   the samples and the scale of the dislocation pattern developed at

Abstract = {{To improve vehicle fuel economy and crash worthiness the automotive
   industry has been redesigning parts from advanced high strength steels
   such as dual-phase and martensitic steels. These steels have high
   strengths with the higher formability characteristics when compared to
   lower strength conventional steels of similar ductility. These steels
   derive their unique properties from their complex microstructures
   containing ferrite and martensite. During assembly welding, the
   martensite within the sub-critical region of the heat-affected zone
   tempers, which locally reduces mechanical properties. Although this
   phenomenon is well studied, it has yet to be quantified. The present
   work proposes a technique to measure the softening kinetics of
   dual-phase and martensite steels using rapid isothermal tempering. The
   resulting model was then validated by predicting the heat-affect zone
   softening that occurs in laser and resistance spot welds as well as by
   comparing the microstructures of the rapid tempered samples to the
   microstructures found in the sub-critical heat-affected zone of welded

   out to investigate the need for the force to be applied infinitesimally
   slowly for the first principle to be applicable, the requirement for
   constant force when using the second principle, and what happens when
   the force is applied in an arbitrary manner. It is shown when including
   viscous damping and considering equilibrium states that conservation of
   energy principle is consistent with the external work equalling the
   internal work under a very slow loading rate, whereas for the total
   potential energy theorem the total work done is split evenly between the

Abstract = {{A methacrylic monomer containing lysine side groups in which the

   deprotection of the epsilon-amino and carboxylic acid groups, the
   corresponding copolymers (P(HEMA/Lys)) were obtained and showed good
   film-forming properties. P(HEMA/Lys) films were shown to reduce
   fibrinogen (Fg) adsorption compared to controls and to bind a large
   quantity of plasminogen from plasma. The plasminogen binding capacity of
   the copolymer films could be regulated by varying the copolymer
   composition. Upon activation of adsorbed plasminogen to plasmin, the
   films were able to rapidly lyse fibrin formed on their surface. These

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel Bayesian inference based Gaussian mixture
   contribution (BIGMC) method to isolate and diagnose the faulty variables
   in chemical processes with multiple operating modes. The statistical
   confidence intervals of traditional principal component analysis (PCA)
   based T-2 and SPE diagnostics rely upon the assumption that the
   operating data follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution approximately
   and therefore may not be able to determine the faulty variables in
   multimode non-Gaussian processes accurately. As an alternative solution,
   the proposed BIGMC method first identifies the multiple Gaussian modes
   corresponding to different operating conditions and then integrates the
   Mahalanobis distance based variable contributions across all the
   Gaussian clusters through Bayesian inference strategy. The derived BIGMC
   index is of probabilistic feature and includes all operation scenarios
   with posterior probabilities as weighting factors. The Tennessee Eastman
   process (TEP) is used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed BIGMC
   method for fault diagnosis of multimode processes. The comparison of the
   single-PCA and multi-PCA based contribution approaches shows that the
   BIGMC method can effectively identify the leading faulty variables with
   superior diagnosis capability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A novel composite column composed of steel, concrete and a fiber
   reinforced polymer (FRP) tube is presented in this paper. The
   confinement and composite action between the constituent materials
   result in enhanced compressive strength, ductility and energy
   dissipation capacity of the proposed composite column compared to a
   traditional reinforced concrete (RC) column. Due to the presence of the
   FRP tube, current design methods for concrete-filled steel tubes (CFSTs)
   or concrete-encased steel (CES) columns are not directly applicable. An
   analytical model was developed to predict the behavior of the composite
   column for various slenderness ratio values. Predicted values are found
   to be in good agreement with the experimental results from tests of six
   columns ranging from 500 mm to 3000 mm in height. A parametric study is
   conducted to investigate the influence of column diameter, FRP tube
   thickness, axial compressive modulus of the FRP tube and
   steel-to-concrete area ratio on the capacity relationships and
   slenderness limits. Finally, a simplified design equation is proposed to
   predict the compressive load capacity of this type of composite column.

Title = {{A Track Quality Based Metric for Evaluating Performance of Multitarget

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{610-616}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The track qualities of multitarget state estimates are often available
   in many tracking algorithms, including the multiple hypothesis tracking
   and the joint integrated probabilistic data association estimators.
   However, the recently proposed Optimal Subpattern Assignment (OSPA)
   metric ignores the quality information and thus its capability to
   quantify the performance of multi-object estimation algorithms is
   limited. In this paper, a new metric, called the quality-based OSPA
   (Q-OSPA), is proposed based on the original OSPA metric. The proposed
   Q-OSPA metric is able to incorporate the quality information and thus
   provide more accurate quantification of the performance of multi-object
   estimation algorithms. Also, the mathematical consistency of the
   original OSPA metric is maintained by the proposed Q-OSPA metric. In
   addition, if the qualities of estimates are not available, the Q-OSPA
   metric reduces to the original OSPA metric by assigning equal qualities
   to the estimates. Besides theoretical derivations, simulations are
   presented to verify the advantages of the proposed metric.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For linear and well-defined estimation problems with Gaussian white
   noise, the Kalman filter (KF) yields the best result in terms of
   estimation accuracy. However, the KF performance degrades and can fail
   in cases involving large uncertainties such as modeling errors in the
   estimation process. The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is a
   relatively new estimation strategy based on sliding mode theory and has
   been shown to be robust to modeling uncertainties. The SVSF makes use of
   an existence subspace and of a smoothing boundary layer to keep the
   estimates bounded within a region of the true state trajectory.
   Currently, the width of the smoothing boundary layer is chosen based on
   designer knowledge of the upper bound of modeling uncertainties, such as
   maximum noise levels and parametric errors. This is a conservative
   choice, as a more well-defined smoothing boundary layer will yield more
   accurate results. In this paper, the state error covariance matrix of
   the SVSF is used for the derivation of an optimal time-varying smoothing
   boundary layer. The robustness and accuracy of the new form of the SVSF
   was validated and compared with the KF and the standard SVSF by testing
   it on a linear electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA). {[}DOI:

Title = {{A new t-PA releasing concept based on protein-protein displacement}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2321-2328}},
Abstract = {{A new tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) releasing concept based on a
   unique protein-displacement triggering mechanism is reported. This
   concept takes advantage of the fact that plasminogen has higher affinity
   than t-PA for surface bound lysine. t-PA bound to lysine-modified
   materials through specific interactions is thus displaced from the
   surface (released) by plasminogen when in contact with plasma. The
   concept was investigated using a lysine-modified polyurethane (PU)
   material in the form of fibrous mats fabricated by electrospinning. The
   mats are of high surface area to volume ratio and are effectively porous
   due to fiber entanglement. They were successively modified with
   poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and lysine, such that the
   3-amino and carboxyl groups were free (3-lysine). These materials were
   shown to be significantly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption
   and to take up large amounts of t-PA through specific interactions with
   lysine residues. The role of plasminogen-mediated displacement in t-PA
   release was fully confirmed, and efficient clot lysis by the t-PA loaded
   materials was demonstrated in an in vitro plasma assay. Release of t-PA
   by plasminogen displacement endows the t-PA-loaded materials with dual
   mechanisms for clot-lysis, i.e. by t-PA released from the material to
   generate plasmin in the fluid phase and by plasmin generated on the
   surface.}},

Title = {{Negative buoyant plume model for solar domestic hot water tank systems
   incorporating a vertical inlet}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{53-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thermal stratification in solar energy storage tanks plays an important
   role in enhancing the performance of solar domestic hot water systems.
   The mixing that occurs when hot fluid from the solar collector enters
   the top of the tank is detrimental to the stratification. Mathematical
   models that are used for system analysis must therefore be able to
   capture the effects of this inlet jet mixing in order to accurately
   predict system performance. This paper presents a computational study of
   the heat transfer and fluid flow in a thermal storage tank of a solar
   domestic hot water system with a vertical inlet under negative buoyant
   plume conditions. The effects of parameters such as the fluid inlet
   velocity and temperature as well as inlet pipe diameter on the thermal
   mixing were considered. The work culminated in the development of a
   one-dimensional empirical model capable of predicting the transient
   axial temperature distribution inside the thermal storage tank.
   Predictions from the new model were in good agreement with both
   experimental data and detailed computational fluid dynamics predictions.

Abstract = {{Objectives: To characterize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tensor
   eigenvalues (lambda(1), lambda(2), lambda(3)), fractional anisotropy,
   mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in healthy lumbar musculature.
   Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects (10 men, 7 women; mean age, 28 +/- 7
   years) were scanned using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging. Axial DTI
   was performed using 15 diffusion directions (b = 400 mm(2)/s) at the L4
   level. Oswestry Low Back Pain and Godin Physical Activity questionnaires
   were administered to rule out underlying lower back problems.
   Results: Skeletal muscle DTI metrics were similar to those previously
   published. All measurements showed low coefficients of variation, except
   for quadratus lumborum. Laterality was not significant. Significant sex
   differences were observed in the quadratus lumborum (P < 0.05).
   Significant correlations were found between subjects' weight and body
   mass index with fractional anisotropy and lambda(1) of the multifidus
   muscles.
   Conclusions: The DTI metrics in paraspinal muscles can be reliably
   measured and are influenced by body mass index and weight but not by age
   or physical activity.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of austenite from as-quenched martensite during intercritical
   annealing was studied in a quaternary Fe-0.1C-3Mn-1.5Si alloy. Fine
   austenite grains either grew from interlath-retained austenite films or
   were newly nucleated at lath and martensite packet boundaries. Both
   types grew to a size comparable to the width of the martensite lath. It
   was found both metallographically and by dilatometry that the austenite
   grew to an amount in excess of the volume fraction at final equilibrium.
   Simulation by DICTRA, which assumed local equilibrium at the alpha/gamma
   boundary, confirmed that the development of austenite is composed of
   three stages: initial negligible-partitioning growth controlled by rapid
   carbon diffusion in ferrite, which is gradually replaced by carbon
   diffusion in austenite; intermediate slow growth, controlled by
   diffusion of Mn and/or Si in ferrite; and a final stage controlled by
   diffusion of substitutional elements in austenite for final
   equilibration, which may result in the shrinkage of austenite. The
   formation of austenite in excess of the equilibrium amount is considered
   to occur due to very slow substitutional diffusion in the growing
   austenite compared to the boundary migration. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{An easy-to-use and physically based analytical probabilistic model is

   are introduced first, the hydrologic and hydraulic processes occurring

   the closed-form mathematical expressions depicting the storm-water

   the derived probability distribution theory. Simplifying assumptions are
   made to mathematically describe the hydrologic and hydraulic processes.
   The validity of these assumptions and the overall probabilistic approach
   is demonstrated by comparing its outcomes with results from a series of
   continuous simulations using long-term rainfall data from Detroit,

Abstract = {{Strontium ranelate is an approved pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis in
   Europe and Australia, but not in Canada or the United States. Strontium
   citrate, an alternative strontium salt, however, is available for
   purchase over-the-counter as a nutritional supplement. The effects of
   strontium citrate on bone are largely unknown. The study's objectives
   were 1) to quantify bone strontium accumulation in female Sprague Dawley
   rats administered strontium citrate (N=7) and compare these levels to
   rats administered strontium ranelate (N=6) and vehicle (N=6) over 8
   weeks, and 2) to verify an in vivo X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF)
   system for measurement of bone strontium in the rat. Daily doses of
   strontium citrate and strontium ranelate were determined with the
   intention to achieve equivalent amounts of elemental strontium. However,
   posthoc analyses of each strontium compound conducted using energy
   dispersive spectrometry microanalysis revealed a higher elemental
   strontium concentration in strontium citrate than strontium ranelate.
   Bone strontium levels were measured at baseline and 8 weeks follow-up
   using a unique in vivo XRF technique previously used in humans. XRF
   measurements were validated against ex vivo measurements of bone
   strontium using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Weight
   gain in rats in all three groups was equivalent over the study duration.
   A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare bone strontium levels amongst
   the three groups. Bone strontium levels in rats administered strontium
   citrate were significantly greater (p<0.05) than rats administered
   strontium ranelate and vehicle. ANCOVA analyses were performed with Sr
   dose as a covariate to account for differences in strontium dosing. The
   ANCOVA revealed differences in bone strontium levels between the
   strontium groups were not significant, but that bone strontium levels
   were still very significantly greater than vehicle. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   achieve the theoretical highest fidelity of intensity reproduction in
   either l(1) or l(2) metrics. Both the exact and fast approximate

Abstract = {{Visual surveillance of a designated air space can be achieved by a
   randomly distributed camera sensor network spread over a large area. The
   location and field of view of each battery operated sensor, after a
   calibration phase, will be known to a central processing node. To
   increase the lifetime of the network, the density of distributed sensors
   could be such that a subset of sensors can cover the required air space.
   As a sensor dies another sensor should be selected to compensate for the
   dead one and reestablish the complete coverage. This process should be
   continued until complete coverage is not achievable by the existing
   sensors. Thereafter, a graceful degradation of the coverage is
   desirable.
   The goal is to elongate the lifetime of the network while maintaining a
   maximum possible coverage of the designated air space. Since the
   selection of a subset of sensors for complete coverage of the target
   area is an NP-complete problem, we present a number of heuristics for
   this case. The proposed methods are categorized in two groups. In one
   category, the sensors are prioritized based on their visual and
   communicative properties and the selection is performed according to the
   prioritizing function. In the other group, we propose traditional
   evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. The performance of the
   proposed methods is evaluated through extensive simulations. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In machining, wear formation changes the effective geometry of the
   cutting edge which directly influences the mechanics of cutting.
   Analysis of the cutting mechanics and determination of the corresponding
   machining performance with a worn edge is of significant importance in
   terms of tool design, surface integrity, and process optimization. In
   the present study the effective geometry of the cutting edge was
   analyzed prior to cut by employing the circular regression method.
   Experimental cutting tests were performed and the effect of cutting time
   on the wear progression was investigated at several time intervals. The
   worn edge geometries were used to build the Arbitrary Lagrangian -
   Eulerian finite element cutting models in ABAQUS/Explicit. The models
   were validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental
   findings of machining forces and chip thicknesses. The validated models
   were then employed to investigate the effect of wear geometry on the
   contact stresses, plastic deformation, and temperature distributions in
   the cutting zone. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a sparsity-based soft decoding approach to restore compressed
   images directly in the transform domain of compression (DCT domain
   specifically examined in this paper). Restoring transform coefficients
   rather than pixel values prevents the propagation of quantization errors
   in the image domain. As natural images are statistically non-stationary
   with spatially varying sparse representations, we develop an adaptive
   block-wise sparsity-based restoration method that learns and exploits
   local statistics. Specially, for each DCT block, we collect sample
   blocks via non-local patch grouping to learn a compact dictionary based
   on principal component analysis. The resulting block-specific dictionary
   is used to estimate the corresponding DCT coefficients by a technique of
   collaborative sparse coding, in which the similarity between sample DCT
   patches used in dictionary construction is further considered.
   Experimental results are encouraging and demonstrate that the proposed
   soft decoding approach performs competitively on restoring compressed
   images against existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{In multivariate model predictive control (MPC) systems, the quality of
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) plant models has significant impact on
   the controller performance in different aspects. Though
   re-identification of plant models can improve model quality and
   prediction accuracy, it is very time consuming and economically
   expensive in industrial practice. Therefore, the automatic detection and
   isolation of the model-plant mismatch is highly desirable to monitor and
   improve MPC performance. In this paper, a new closed-loop MPC
   performance monitoring approach is proposed to detect model-plant
   mismatch within state-space formulations through subspace projections
   and statistical hypothesis testing. A monitoring framework consisting of
   three quadratic indices is developed to capture model-plant mismatches
   precisely. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated through a paper machine head box control example.}},

   of fixtures can be coordinated through a power line communication
   backbone network. Hence, we have a multiple-input VLC system, for which
   we derive the optimal linear precoding transmitter according to the
   minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion. Different from similar
   problems in RF wireless communication, we need to take constraints
   resulting from the LED linearity region and its use as an illumination
   device into account. Since the precoder design requires channel
   knowledge at the transmitter, usually provided through a low-rate RF or
   infrared feedback channel, we further extend our derivations to the
   practically relevant case of imperfect channel estimation. Numerical
   results for VLC with different system parameters are presented to
   illustrate the performance of the proposed transmitter designs.}},

Abstract = {{A system for indoor localization using partially collimated light from
   individual LEDs inside a luminary is proposed, simulated and tested
   experimentally. A simple biconvex lens provides angular diversity to the
   luminary and generates multiple spatially separated regions of
   overlapping light which can be resolved with a single detector receiver.
   This approach provides location information without relying on signal
   intensity measurements, time-of-flight data or complex imaging
   approaches. The multiple LEDs available in each luminary are exploited
   to create a large number of uniquely detectable regions, enabling both
   low positioning error and low complexity. Using a model based on
   experimental measurements, in a prototypical 5 x 5 x 3 m room the
   average positioning error is 26.0 cm using 4 luminaries and 12.9 cm with
   9 luminaries.}},

   studied using experimental data measured over a 1.87 km terrestrial FSO

   fluctuations induced by atmospheric turbulence and/or weather
   variations, a rate-adaptive communication system is implemented by
   puncturing low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in a rate-compatible
   fashion. Beside the conventional random puncturing method, an optimized
   intentional puncturing technique is employed. Using experimental data
   and on-off-keying (OOK) modulation, the performance of the rate-adaptive
   FSO system operating at different signaling rates is evaluated. Unlike
   uncoded OOK, the rate-adaptive technique provides reliable and efficient
   FSO communication under different weather conditions and scintillation
   indices. Applying intentional puncturing can further improve the
   efficiency of the FSO system in terms of throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Smart scheduling can be used to reduce infrastructure energy costs in
   vehicular roadside networks {[}1]. In this paper we consider the
   scheduling problem when there are multiple roadside units (RSUs) in
   tandem. In this case it is often desirable to load balance the energy
   consumption across the roadside units so that energy provisioning costs
   can be reduced as much as possible. We first derive an integer linear
   programming bound on the min-max energy usage of the roadside units for
   a given input sample function. This bound is used for comparisons with
   two proposed on-line scheduling algorithms. The first is a low
   complexity First-Come-First-Assigned (FCFA) scheduler that makes greedy
   RSU selections followed by a minimum energy time slot assignment. The
   second algorithm, the Greedy Flow Graph Algorithm (GFGA), makes the same
   RSU selection but reassigns time slots whenever a new vehicle is
   assigned to the same RSU. This is done using a locally optimum integer
   linear program that can be efficiently solved using a minimum cost flow
   graph. Results from a variety of experiments show that the proposed
   scheduling algorithms perform well when compared to the energy lower
   bounds. Our results also show that near-optimal results are possible but
   come with increased computation times compared to our heuristic
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Smart downlink scheduling can be used to reduce
   infrastructure-to-vehicle energy costs in delay tolerant roadside
   networks. In this paper we incorporate this type of scheduling into
   ON/OFF roadside unit sleep activity, to further reduce infrastructure
   power consumption. To achieve significant power savings however, the
   OFF-to-ON sleep transitions may be very lengthy, and this overhead must
   be taken into account when performing the ON state scheduling. We first
   incorporate the OFF/ON sleep transitions into a lower bound on energy
   usage that can be computed for given input sample functions. An online
   scheduling algorithm referred to as the Flow Graph Sleep Scheduler (FGS)
   is then introduced, which makes locally optimum decisions about when to
   initiate new ON/OFF cycles. This is done by computing an estimate of the
   energy needed to fulfill known vehicle communication requirements with
   and without the OFF period. This calculation is efficiently done using a
   novel minimum flow graph formulation. Results from a variety of
   experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm performs well
   when compared to the energy lower bound. It is especially attractive in
   situations where vehicle demands and arrival rates are such that the
   energy costs permit frequent ON/OFF cycling.}},

   errors for two description scalar quantizers. To this aim a permutation
   is applied to the indices of each description. We show how to construct
   permutation pairs that increase the minimum Hamming distance of the set
   of valid index pairs to 3 when the redundancy is sufficiently high.
   Additionally, for the case when one description is known to be correct
   we propose a new performance criterion, denoted by d(side,min). This
   represents the minimum Hamming distance of the set of valid indices of
   one description, when the index of the other description is fixed. We
   develop a technique for constructing permutation pairs achieving
   d(side,min) >= h based on a linear (R, {[}log 2 m]) channel code of
   minimum Hamming distance h + 1, where R is the rate of each description
   and m is the number of diagonals occupied by the valid index pairs in

Abstract = {{A new development of the shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP)
   technique for microwave design optimization is presented. The original
   SPRP method is enhanced by employing low-cost derivative information
   obtained through adjoint sensitivities. Sensitivity ensures first-order
   consistency between the SPRP surrogate and the high-fidelity
   electromagnetic (EM) model under optimization and to speed up the
   surrogate optimization process. Fast surrogate optimization allows us to
   use coarse-discretization EM simulations as an underlying low-fidelity
   model and, therefore, efficiently apply SPRP to cases where reliable
   circuit models are not available. Our approach is demonstrated using a
   dielectric resonator filter example.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional electrochemical dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors are expensive
   as they use Platinum in their construction. In addition, these sensors
   bio-foul when used in natural or wastewater, which leads to reduced
   sensitivity and variable performance. Here, we address these problems by
   i) replacing Platinum with Hemin as a low cost alternative for
   electrocatalysing the oxygen reduction reaction and ii) using silicone
   rubber (PDMS) functionalized with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) as the anti
   biofouling gas permeable membrane to provide selectivity with an
   increased lifetime. Our DO sensor has a sensitivity of 20.7 (mu
   A/cm(2))/(mg/L) over a DO concentration range of 7-2 mg/L. Also, the
   common interferences such as phosphate and nitrate show minor influence
   in DO detection. Furthermore, the PEG grafting PDMS membranes protects
   the sensor from biofouling for 20 days in accelerated bio-fouling
   condition, while the unfunctionalized sensor loses its sensitivity in
   less than one day.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a proliferation in the amount of data being generated and
   collected in the past several years. One of the leading factors
   contributing to this increased data scale is cheaper commodity storage,
   making it easier for organisations to house large data stores containing
   massive amounts of historical data. To effectively analyse these data
   sets, a preprocessing step is often required as most real data sets are
   inherently dirty and inconsistent. Existing data cleaning tools have
   focused on cleaning the errors at hand. In this paper, we take a more
   formal approach and propose the use of information algebra as a general
   theory to describe structured data sets and data cleaning. We formally
   define the notion of association rule, association function, and we
   present results relating these concepts. We also propose an algorithm
   for generating association rules from a given structured data set. (C)

   degree bends were measured under a range of two phase annular flow
   conditions. A dissolving wall technique at a high Schmidt number

   occurred on the centerline of the bend outer wall at an angle of
   approximately 50 degrees from the bend inlet under all tested
   conditions. The area of maximum mass transfer was found to span
   approximately 30 degrees in the circumferential direction. A second
   region of enhanced mass transfer occurred on the latter part of the bend
   with a local maximum occurring slightly off the bend centerline in some
   cases. Changing the air and water superficial velocities (J(v)=20 to 30
   m/s, J(L)=0.17 to 0.41 m/s) showed that the air velocity had a larger
   effect on the mass transfer than the water velocity; however the effect
   of the water velocity on the mass transfer was not insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{In the last 20 years, there has been a shift from studying
   entrepreneurship as a phenomenon to learning the skills needed to become
   an entrepreneur. More recently, there has been a shift towards teaching
   the skills in the context of starting an actual real business. This
   paper describes the results of an experiment that implemented an
   industry-proven technology-based new-venture-creation methodology into
   the academic environment in a Canadian university. It also describes the
   pedagogical design of the masters program that leveraged this
   methodology. First of its kind in Canada, The Xerox Centre for
   Engineering Entrepreneurship and Innovation (XCEEi) at McMaster
   University offers a masters program to students who want to pursue
   entrepreneurship as a career option. Students practice starting up their
   own businesses while they pursue their Masters degree. XCEEi students
   participate in commercializing technologies in real life situations.
   McMaster masters program is compared with the two-year masters program
   offered by the Entrepreneurship school at Chalmers University of
   Technology, which is considered one of the most successful
   new-venture-creation Masters programs in the Sweden. It is believed that
   top four factors, influencing the success of such programs, are: Access
   to seed funding, involvement of seasoned entrepreneurs in program
   delivery, integration with an existing university commercialization
   ecosystem, and finally financial sustainability of the programs. Based
   on interviews and surveys, the paper concludes that the first two
   factors are the most influential in determining the quality of
   experiential education and the students' learning experience. However,
   the commercial success of the students' ventures depends on the quality
   of the ideas and students, access to follow-on investment, and finally
   integration with the university commercialization ecosystem. Venture
   creation masters programs could be key tools in realizing economic value
   from universities research. Students should be perceived as crucial
   filters of ideas and human feeders for the different governmental and
   regional innovation centers.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic (EM) simulation is an essential component of
   contemporary microwave design. High-fidelity EM simulation allows
   accurate evaluation of microwave devices; however, it is computationally
   expensive. As a result, the use of EM solvers for automated design
   optimization may be prohibitive. This chapter describes space mapping
   (SM), one of the most popular surrogate-based optimization and modeling
   techniques in microwave engineering to date. The main concern of SM is
   to reduce the computational cost of automated EM-simulation-driven
   design by shifting the optimization burden onto a fast low-fidelity (or
   coarse) model of the device under consideration, for example, a circuit
   equivalent. By a proper combination of the knowledge contained in the
   coarse model, and simple transformations that aim at improving the
   alignment between the coarse and original high-fidelity EM-simulated (or
   fine) models, one can create cheap and reliable surrogates that can be
   used to predict the fine model optimum design and thus to dramatically
   reduce the cost of the design process. This chapter presents the concept
   and historical overview of space mapping. It offers various SM
   formulations, discusses practical issues and open problems, and presents
   application examples.}},

Abstract = {{The widely accepted space mapping technology of Chapter 4 facilitates
   optimal circuit design with electromagnetic (EM) accuracy and
   circuit-optimization speed. The so-called tuning space mapping approach
   combines the intuition of the space mapping concept and
   EM-simulator-based tuning. In this chapter, to begin with, we review the
   classical computer-based tuning technology. Then, through ``tuning space
   mapping{''} procedures, we explain microwave design optimization using
   various types of tuning models as surrogates. By means of simple
   examples, we demonstrate the implementation of these surrogates in
   design optimization. We provide illustrations utilizing commercial
   simulation software. Our purpose is to explain and clarify the
   differences among the tuning space mapping techniques and to inspire new
   implementations and applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we address the adjoint variable method (AVM) for
   accelerating gradient-based optimization. AVM efficiently estimates the
   sensitivities of a given objective function with respect to all

   their number. The AVM approach exploits only field values stored in both
   the original and adjoint simulations. This approach is more efficient
   than classical finite difference approaches whose cost scales linearly
   with the number of parameters. We illustrate the AVM approach using the
   transmission line modeling (TLM) method, which is widely used in
   time-domain modeling of high-frequency structures. The memory and
   computational cost of the TLM-based AVM approaches are addressed.
   Several suggested techniques for making this approach even more
   efficient are presented. Examples illustrate different aspects of this
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Atom probe tomography (APT) is capable of simultaneously revealing the
   chemical identities and three dimensional positions of individual atoms
   within a needle-shaped specimen, but suffers from a limited
   field-of-view (FOV), i.e., only the core of the specimen is effectively
   detected. Therefore, the capacity to analyze the full tip is crucial and
   much desired in cases that the shell of the specimen is also the region
   of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in the analysis of
   III-V nanowires epitaxially grown from a substrate, the presence of the
   flat substrate positioned only micrometers away from the analyzed tip
   apex alters the field distribution and ion trajectories, which provides
   extra image compression that allows for the analysis of the entire
   specimen. An array of experimental results, including field desorption
   maps, elemental distributions, and crystallographic features clearly
   demonstrate the fact that the whole tip has been imaged, which is
   confirmed by electrostatic simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Acoustic emission signals from interrupted machining operations exhibit
   spikes at workpiece entry and exit, which are particularly conspicuous
   in grinding. Although their occurrence has been widely reported, these
   spikes are yet to be clarified in terms of their origin or interpreted
   to yield useful process information. This paper hence reports on the
   analyses of time-averaged and raw acoustic emission signals from surface
   grinding, with reference to burr formation as well as dynamic and
   thermal effects, in order to elucidate this intriguing phenomenon. The
   transient spikes at the entry and exit are shown to be a consequence of
   the wheel establishing and losing contact with the work over the actual
   contact length, in terms of heat conduction and damping, which are
   reflected in characteristic frequency bands of the AE signal. The
   research is demonstrated to have consequently yielded a simple,
   non-destructive method for assessing the actual wheel-work contact
   length in grinding. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   of low adhesion of PPY films on stainless steel and Ni substrates is
   addressed by the use of pyrocatechol violet (PV) dye as an anionic
   dopant. The experimental data indicates that strong adhesion of PPY
   films is attributed to catecholate type of PV bonding. We also find that
   PV strongly adsorbs on MWCNT and allows efficient dispersion, charging
   and controlled electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of MWCNT. The use of PV
   for electropolymerization of PPY and EPD of MWCNT allows the formation
   of composite films by combined electrodeposition method. Results show
   that Ni-plaque current collectors developed for high power battery
   applications can be electrochemically impregnated with PPY-MWCNT to form
   electrodes for ES. Ni plaque based electrodes offer advantages of
   significantly higher materials loading and superior capacitive behavior
   compared to thin film electrodes formed on stainless steel current
   collectors. The electrodes obtained by pulse impregnation show higher
   specific capacitance compared to the electrodes prepared by
   galvanostatic impregnation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several Pd-composite Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 materials are synthesized by a
   two-step procedure, and employed as the Pt-Pd alloy catalyst support for
   the PEM fuel cell oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These supports and
   their supported catalysts are characterized using analytical and
   electrochemical methods with respect to their material morphology,
   chemical/electrochemical stability, electronic conductivity as well as
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activity/stability. For the
   supported Pt-Pd catalysts, the Pt-Pd nanoparticles adhered to both the
   Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 and composited Pd surfaces to form PtmPdn clusters. A
   possible synergetic interaction between the Pt-Pd alloy catalyst and its
   Pd-Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 composite support is believed to exist which enhances
   the ORR activity of these catalysts. The electronic conductivity of
   Nb0.06Ti0.94O2 can be greatly improved after forming composites with Pd
   to the desired levels required for electrocatalyst applications. Three
   supported Pt-Pd catalysts, 20 wt\%
   Pt0.62Pd0.38/Pd-10wt\%-(Nb0.06Ti0.94O2)(90wt\%), 20 wt\%
   Pt0.62Pd0.38/Pd-30wt\%-(Nb0.06Ti0.94O2)(70wt\%), and 20 wt\%
   Pt0.62Pd0.38/Pd-50wt\%-(Nb0.06Ti0.94O2)(50wt\%), are synthesized and
   tested using both cyclic voltammetric and rotating disk electrode
   techniques with respect to their surface electrochemistry, ORR mass
   activity, and electrochemical stability. All three catalysts show higher
   Pt mass activity (>130 mA mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9 V vs. RHE) than that of the
   baseline 47 wt\% Pt C-1 carbon supported catalyst (110 mA mg(Pt)(-1)).
   However, the durability of these catalysts needs to be further improved.

   elements of the resulting defect physics are characterized for the case

   are stabilized for the first time within the PFC formalism, and various
   properties of associated defect structures are characterized. These
   include the dissociation width of perfect edge and screw dislocations,
   the effect of applied stresses on dissociation, Peierls strains for

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Be-doped InP nanowires were grown by the gold-assisted
   vapour-liquid-solid mechanism in a gas source molecular beam epitaxy
   system. The InP nanowire length versus diameter {[}L(D)] dependence
   revealed an unexpected transition with increasing Be dopant
   concentration. At Be dopant concentration below similar to 10(18)
   cm(-3), nanowires exhibited the usual inverse L(D) relationship,
   indicating a diffusion-limited growth regime. However, as dopant
   concentration increased, the nanowire growth rate was suppressed for
   small diameters, resulting in an unusual L(D) dependence that increased
   before saturating in height at about 400 nm. The cause of this may be a
   change in the droplet chemical potential, introducing a barrier to
   island nucleation. We propose a model accounting for the limitations of
   diffusion length and monolayer nucleation to explain this behaviour. (C)

   paper looks at recent advances in the use of data-driven models built

   Multivariate latent variable monitoring and fault diagnosis methods are
   reviewed and contrasted with classical fault detection and diagnosis
   approaches. The integration of monitoring and diagnosis techniques by
   using an adaptive agent-based framework is outlined and its use for
   fault-tolerant control is compared with alternative fault-tolerant
   control frameworks. The concept of optimizing and controlling high
   dimensional systems by performing optimizations in the low dimensional
   latent variable spaces is presented and illustrated by means of several

Title = {{Integration of evolutionary based assimilation into Kalman-type methods
   for streamflow simulations in ungauged watersheds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{475}},
Pages = {{428-440}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Data assimilation (DA) has emerged as a valuable tool for the design and
   application of streamflow forecasting systems. But DA applications for
   streamflow simulations in ungauged basins are still very limited
   primarily because most updated ensemble members are not usually
   associated with converged state and model parameterizations. Other
   limitations include the evaluation of massive number of ensemble
   members, weak/unknown relationships between parameter values and
   predictors, and the transfer of several members from gauged watersheds
   to ungauged ones is computationally expensive. But the inherent dynamics
   of DA to account for uncertainties in model, forcing data, and imperfect
   observation provide an appealing approach to simulate watershed response
   in ungauged basins. This study proposes a DA method namely the
   Pareto-Particle-Ensemble Kalman Filter (ParetoParticleEnKF) to generate
   and archive a small number of continuously evolved members using
   multi-objective evolutionary strategy where these members are updated
   using particle and ensemble Kalman filtering methods. The archived
   members for gauged watersheds are combined using inverse distance
   weighting where they are applied to simulate watershed response in
   ungauged basins.
   The proposed method is demonstrated by assimilating daily streamflow
   into the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model for 10
   watersheds in southern Ontario, Canada. After successfully transferring
   ensemble members from gauged watersheds to ungauged ones, the updated
   ensembles were applied to simulate streamflow for up to 10-days ahead to
   determine how long into the future would the quality/accuracy of
   simulations persist before they begin to deteriorate in the ungauged
   basin. The results show that the designed method can facilitate
   simulation of accurate streamflows for any time step, and generate
   accurate simulations for up to 10 days ahead in the ungauged basins. A
   unique evaluation procedure is the transfer of updated members in the
   form of forcing data uncertainties, and state and model
   parameterizations from gauged to ungauged watersheds and their
   subsequent assessment for multiple time step ahead simulations. The
   overall decline in accuracy from gauged to ungauged watersheds for the
   entire 10-day lead time across all 10 watersheds is 20\% for
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and 12\% for percent bias. Crown Copyright C.

   transformed to their wurtzite counterparts via a well known tensor
   transformation. An energy criterion is then given to determine the shell
   thickness, at which coherency is lost and dislocations become
   favourable. Our model only considers axial strain relieved by edge
   dislocations since they were the only type of dislocation observed
   directly by TEM. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We examined the formation of the ternary complex hydride phase Mg2FeH6
   during the thermal hydrogen absorption of a ball-milled powder mixture
   of MgH2 and Fe. Analytical measurements, scanning transmission electron
   microscopy, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, with the sample
   cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, were utilized to identify the
   various phases present and to study the features of this phase
   transformation. The low-loss region of the electron energy-loss spectrum
   was mainly used to distinguish various constituents. Mg2FeH6 was
   initially formed during ball milling of MgH2 and Fe, demonstrating a
   co-continuous structure with MgH2 and Mg. Upon the first desorption,
   this phase was transformed into elemental Mg and Fe. During the initial
   stages of the subsequent thermal absorption, MgH2 was first formed with
   enhanced kinetics because of the presence of Fe. This was followed by
   the nucleation of Mg2FeH6 between MgH2 and Fe and its growth with a
   columnar morphology. This morphology was dictated by the diffusion
   direction of the atomic hydrogen from the catalytic Fe cap. As the
   Mg2FeH6 columns grew, the capping Fe particle and the MgH2 substrate
   were consumed. When the system was maintained at high temperature for a
   long time, these columnar Mg2FeH6 structures coalesced into a
   semispherical morphology.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that adsorbed proteins play a major role in cell
   adhesion. However, it has also been reported that cells can adhere to a
   protein-resistant surface. In this work, the behavior of L02 and
   BEL-7402 cells on a protein-resistant, 3D topographical surface was
   investigated. The topographical gold nanoparticle layer (GNPL) surfaces
   were prepared by chemical gold plating, and the topography was described
   by roughness parameters acquired from a multiscale analysis. Both smooth
   Au and GNPL surfaces were modified with POEGMA polymer brushes using
   surface-initiated ATRP. The dry and hydrated thicknesses of POEGMA
   brushes on both smooth and rough surfaces were measured by AFM using a
   nanoindentation method. Protein adsorption experiments using I-125
   radiolabeling revealed similarly low levels of protein adsorption on
   smooth and GNPL surfaces modified with POEGMA, thus allowing an
   investigation of the effects of topography on cell behavior under
   conditions of minimal protein adsorption. The roles of VN and FN
   adsorption in both L02 cells and BEL-7402 cells adhesion were
   investigated using cell culturing with and without a serum supplement.
   It was found that initial cell adhesion occurred via proteins adsorbed
   from the cell culture medium, whereas subsequent durable cell adhesion
   could be attributed to the topographical structure of the surface.
   Although cell spreading on protein-resistant surfaces was constrained
   because of the lack of adsorbed proteins, we found that cells adherent
   to topographical surfaces were more firmly attached and thus were more
   durable compared to those on smooth surfaces. In general, however, we
   conclude that topography is more important for cell adhesion on a
   protein-resistant surface.}},

Abstract = {{Facing the need of a better understanding of spot-weld strength and
   failure mechanisms of advanced high strength steels, we have developed a
   novel test for the in situ failure analysis of spot-welded joints.
   Providing loading conditions similar to the standard cross tension test,
   this new test is based upon the use of wedges to peel plates apart in a
   welded sample that has been cut in half, revealing the weld in the
   scanning electron microscope. We first perform finite element modeling
   and show why the wedge test approach is suitable for our purpose. We
   then perform experimental tests and observe failure in the scanning
   electron microscope chamber. We are able to both follow crack
   propagation and control the failure mode. As a corollary, this approach
   enables the use of local strain mapping, using digital image
   correlation, to measure local strains in the vicinity of the crack path.
   The wedge test should be valuable for assessing failure processes in
   spot-welded joints. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an LDGM-based practical successive coding scheme for
   the multiple description (MD) problem for finite alphabet sources. The
   scheme, which targets the Zhang-Berger (ZB) rate-distortion region, is
   shown to be asymptotically optimal with joint typicality encoding, while
   as a practical encoding solution a message passing algorithm is adopted.
   We further discuss in more detail the application of the coding scheme
   in three cases of the MD problem with the Hamming distortion measure: 1)
   no excess sum-rate for binary sources, 2) successive refinement, and 3)
   no excess marginal rate for the uniform binary source. In the no excess
   sum-rate case some progress is made in the characterization of
   fundamental limits by deriving the analytical expression of the
   distortion region for general binary sources, and of the auxiliary
   variables needed to achieve its boundary. The exact expression of the
   Zhang-Berger upper bound to the central distortion is also provided for
   the case of no excess marginal rate for the uniform binary source. The
   proposed LDGM-based coding scheme is tested in practice for all three
   aforementioned cases. The experimental results show very good
   performance, demonstrating its ability to approach the theoretical
   rate-distortion limits or the available upper bounds.}},

   4-pulse-position modulation (4-PPM) at different baud rates. To approach
   the capacity, error control coding is applied and a message passing
   decoding technique is outlined. Simulation results for a running example
   through the paper indicate that, at a given power, there is an optimum
   transmitted baud rate that maximizes the achievable data rate on such
   links. With the application of proper coding techniques, it is
   demonstrated that a near fifty-fold increase in rate over previous

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is a need to evaluate existing, and introduce new, masonry
   construction techniques within a performance-based seismic design
   context to advance their adoption in the next generation of seismic
   design codes in North America. In this regard, a reinforced masonry (RM)
   structural wall system that incorporates confining boundary elements in
   the plastic hinge region presently lacks specific design requirements in
   the Masonry Standards Joint Committee and Canadian Standards Association
   S304.1 design codes. In addition, RM structural wall systems are omitted
   completely from the plan to develop a new performance-based seismic
   design methodology laid out by FEMA 445. This paper presents
   experimental results of four specially detailed RM structural walls
   subjected to fully reversed cycles of displacement-controlled loading as
   tested by the authors. In addition, the resulting analysis also includes
   one wall from a previous study for comparison purposes. All walls were
   detailed with lateral reinforcing ties confining a grouted core and four
   vertical reinforcement bars located at each of the wall ends. The design
   and detailing of the walls represented a range of parameters that would
   be anticipated to vary within low-to-medium-rise RM buildings. Each of
   the half-scale walls had overall dimensions of 1.8 X 4.0 m but varied by
   the level of applied axial load, the presence of interstory floor slabs,
   and the presence of confining boundary elements above the first-story
   height. The results of this experimental program indicate that boundary
   elements delayed the onset of buckling in the vertical reinforcement and
   reduced the impact of face-shell spalling on overall wall strength
   degradation. At 20\% degradation from ultimate strength, the top drifts
   ranged from 1.82 to 3.73\% and the displacement ductilities ranged from
   6.6 to 15.2. This study is the first of a series of studies at McMaster
   University currently focused on introducing a broad set of experimental
   evidence aiming at establishing a new category of RM seismic force
   resisting systems in North American building codes. DOI:

Abstract = {{The C 1s inner shell excitation spectra of individual metallic and
   semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were measured
   using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy in an
   aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (TEM-EELS). On the
   basis of its diameter, the metallic SWCNT is most likely a (10,10)
   sample, whereas (11,12) and a number of other chiral vectors are
   consistent with the diameter of the semiconducting SWCNTs. The C 1s
   X-ray absorption spectra of the same electronically pure SWCNT materials
   were measured as individual bundles or agglomerations of bundles by
   scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. Spectral differences in the C 1s
   -> pi{*} transitions of metallic and semiconducting species, related to
   differences in the van Hove singularities in their unoccupied states,
   are observed by both methods. The fine structure of the C 1s -> pi{*}
   transitions is similar to that recently reported from nonspatially
   resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy of ensemble samples of
   high-purity metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs. The quality of the
   TEM-EELS spectra of individual SWCNTs is such that the line shape can be
   used to identify if they are metallic or semiconducting, thereby opening
   up the possibility to interrogate the electronic state of single-SWCNT
   devices. A strong X-ray linear dichroism in the C 1s -> pi{*} band of
   both types of SWCNTs was observed.}},

   was reactively modified in bulk using CEs at concentrations ranging from
   0.52.5?wt\% within a twin-screw extruder operating at 170 degrees C and
   150 RPM. Thermal and rheological analysis of the modified blends found
   that only one multi-functional polymeric CE was effective for altering
   the molecular structure of the blend while both significantly improved
   the foamability of the material. The two di-functional CEs did not
   produce detectable changes in melt elasticity for the blend but again
   had a notable influence on improved foamability. Foamability was
   evaluated based on improvements to the material that increased foam
   stability (i.e. higher cell densities and smaller bubbles), and the
   results in this study suggested that these CEs influenced bubble
   expansion in ways other than simply causing rheological change.}},

Abstract = {{A silicon (Si) solar cell structure with an integrated Si tunnel
   junction (TJ) is proposed for multijunction (MJ) solar cell
   applications. The TJ is fabricated on top of an ordinary Si solar cell
   via the proximity rapid thermal diffusion process. The fabricated solar
   cells with integrated TJs show nondegraded photovoltaic characteristics.
   The electrical performance of the TJs allows for normal operation of
   Si-based MJ solar cells under at least 250-sun illumination and can be
   improved to achieve compatibility for higher illumination levels. The
   structure reported in this letter serves as a promising candidate for
   use as a bottom cell with an integrated TJ for low-cost and

   fabricated and characterized. In addition, MOSFETs using organic copper
   phthalocyanine (CuPc) were fabricated with these SONOS gates to
   demonstrate proof of concept performance. Analog spiking circuits were
   then modeled using these low performance TFTs to demonstrate the general
   suitability of organic TFTs in neural circuits. The basic circuit
   utilizes a standard comparator with charge and discharge circuits. A
   simple Hebbian learning circuit was added to charge and discharge the
   SONOS device. The use of these elements allows for the design and

Title = {{l(2) Restoration of l(infinity)-Decoded Images Via Soft-Decision

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4797-4807}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The l(infinity)-constrained image coding is a technique to achieve
   substantially lower bit rate than strictly (mathematically) lossless
   image coding, while still imposing a tight error bound at each pixel.
   However, this technique becomes inferior in the l(2) distortion metric
   if the bit rate decreases further. In this paper, we propose a new soft
   decoding approach to reduce the l(2) distortion of l(infinity)-decoded
   images and retain the advantages of both minmax and least-square
   approximations. The soft decoding is performed in a framework of image
   restoration that exploits the tight error bounds afforded by the
   l(infinity)-constrained coding and employs a context modeler of
   quantization errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   l(infinity)-constrained hard decoded images can be restored to gain more
   than 2 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio PSNR, while still retaining
   tight error bounds on every single pixel. The new soft decoding
   technique can even outperform JPEG 2000 (a state-of-the-art
   encoder-optimized image codec) for bit rates higher than 1 bpp, a
   critical rate region for applications of near-lossless image
   compression. All the coding gains are made without increasing the
   encoder complexity as the heavy computations to gain coding efficiency
   are delegated to the decoder.}},

Volume = {{524}},
Pages = {{127-132}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was used to prepare substitutionaly
   disordered Pt3Sc. Deposition was performed by using a crossed-beam PLD
   setup and the laser intensity on the Pt and Sc targets was adjusted to
   reach the desired composition (Pt:Sc 3:1). Deposition was performed in
   vacuum, 133 Pa He and 133 Pa Ar, on both Cu and Si substrates. It was
   shown that a homogeneous and substitutionaly disordered Pt3Sc alloy is
   formed when deposition is performed in vacuum and 133 Pa Ar on a Cu
   substrate. Alternatively, a non-homogeneous and multilayered deposit is
   formed when deposition is performed in vacuum on a Si substrate. This is
   believed to arise as a consequence of re-sputtering (and decomposition)
   of the native silicon oxide when highly energetic ablated species
   impinge on the substrate. The kinetic energy of the ablated species is
   reduced by increasing the pressure of Ar in the deposition chamber,
   yielding to an increased stability of the native silicon oxide layer and
   the formation of a porous deposit made of substitutionaly disordered
   Pt3Sc. The same phenomenon is observed when deposition is performed on a
   Ti substrate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Failure criteria for rocks based on smooth approximations to

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{146-160}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Existing experimental evidence from true triaxial test (also referred to
   as poly-axial test) indicates that the influence of the intermediate
   principal stress (sigma(2)) on rock strength is substantial. In order to
   consider this effect in rock engineering design, an adequate 3D
   failurecriterion, which takes into account the effect of sigma(2), is
   required. Such a criterion should not only be a convex but also a
   smoothfunction of stress state; the latter to avoid singularities and to
   ensure the numerical stability. The most popular failurecriteria used in
   rock mechanics, i.e., MohrCoulomb (MC) and HoekBrown (HB), both ignore
   the effect of sigma(2) and also have singular corners. Hence, in this
   paper, the MC and HB criteria are modified to their 3D versions based on
   geometric approximations of deviatoric sections that lead to smooth and
   convex surfaces for a wide range of strength parameters. The derived
   criteria inherit all the key properties of the original ones and are
   formulated in terms of stress invariants introduced by Nayak and
   Zienkiewicz. The latter provides an easy way to identify the strength
   parameters from non-linear multiple regression analysis using the
   poly-axial test data. In order to validate the proposed criteria, eight
   sets of poly-axial tests selected from literature are fitted. The
   results clearly show that the new criteria are quite accurate for all
   rock types considered. Finally, an extension of the proposed criteria to
   account for anisotropic rock conditions is discussed and an illustrative
   example is provided incorporating the functional forms of HB and
   modified HB criteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Nb microalloying on microstructure, mechanical properties,
   and pitting corrosion properties of quenched and tempered 13 pct Cr-5
   pct Ni-0.02 pct C martensitic stainless steels with different Mo and N
   contents was investigated. The microstructure, density, and dispersion
   of high-angle boundaries, nanoscale precipitates, and amount of retained
   austenite were characterized by using electron backscattered
   diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction to
   correlate with properties. The results show that the combined effects of
   lowering nitrogen content in 13 pct Cr-5 pct Ni-1 similar to 2 pct
   Mo-0.02 pct C steels to 0.01 wt pct, and adding 0.1 pct Nb are to
   decrease the amount of Cr-rich precipitates, as Nb preferentially
   combines with residual carbon and nitrogen to form carbonitrides,
   suppressing the formation of Cr2N and Cr23C6. Austenite grain refinement
   can be achieved by Nb microalloying through proper heat treatment. If
   the nitrogen content is kept high, then Cr-rich precipitates would occur
   irrespective of microalloying addition. The NbN would also occur at high
   temperature, which will act as substrate for nucleation of coarse
   precipitates during subsequent tempering, impairing the toughness of the
   steel. It was shown that the addition of Nb to low interstitial super
   martensitic stainless steel retards the formation of reversed austenite
   and results in the formation of nanoscale precipitates (5 to 15 nm),
   which contribute to a significant increase in strength. More
   importantly, the pitting corrosion resistance was found to increase with
   Nb addition. This is attributed to suppression of Cr-rich precipitates,
   which can cause local depletion of Cr in the matrix and the initiation
   of pitting corrosion.}},

   characterization of PDF process, using an experimental apparatus with
   transparent shoe and die sections. In this paper, the influence of a
   newly designed perforated plate (PP), incorporated at the bottom of the
   feed shoe on PDF is studied. The effect of PP on powder redistribution
   in the feed shoe, powder transfer and resulting powder spatial density
   uniformity, and porosity within a thin ring-shaped die is compared with
   the powder flow and segregation behavior in standard shoe (SS) filling.
   Various colored salt powder experiments using arrangements in layers and
   columns within the feed shoe as well as a commercial iron power are
   considered in an attempt to analyze the subsequent powder redistribution
   within the shoe, during shoe motion and final powder packing in the die.
   It is determined that the colored salt is a promising medium for
   simulating the flow characteristics and segregation of commercial iron
   powder macroscopically. Further, critical shoe speed for powder delivery
   into the die-cavity using a perforated plate and a standard shoe are
   studied. Continuous imaging of the transparent shoe and die wall
   sections with an on-line high speed CCD camera are also used to record
   powder flow and to obtain resulting porosity from quantitative
   pixel-based analysis of the post-fill final images. The effectiveness
   and limitations of the perforated plate in achieving a more homogenous
   powder fill and reduced porosity in the die is explained with the help
   of both colored powder experiments and the surface porosity data from
   the transparent die face section. Finally, a successful attempt is made
   to bind the loose iron powder using a polymer resin blend into the shape
   of a ring within the die. This ring shaped component is then analyzed
   for its spatial porosity distribution, and thereby its spatial density
   distribution, using gamma ray densitometry. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the pseudometric used as a key concept in our
   previous work on optimal supervisory control of probabilistic discrete
   event systems. The pseudometric is employed to measure the behavioural
   similarity between probabilistic systems, and initially was defined as a
   greatest fixed point of a monotone function. This paper further
   characterizes the pseudometric. First, it gives a logical
   characterization of the pseudometric so that the distance between two
   systems is measured by a formula that distinguishes between the systems
   the most. A trace characterization of the pseudometric is then derived
   from the logical characterization, characterizing the similarity between
   systems from a language perspective. Further, the solution of the
   problem of approximation of a given probabilistic generator with another
   generator of a prespecified structure is suggested such that the new
   model is as close as possible to the original one in the pseudometric.
   The significance of the approximation is then discussed, especially with
   respect to previous work on optimal supervisory control of probabilistic
   discrete event systems.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2962-2974}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) is an optimal tracking method due
   to the enumeration of all possible measurement-to-track associations.
   However, its practical implementation is limited by the exponential
   growth in this enumeration. Feature data, in addition to kinematic
   measurements, can improve track quality and reduce false tracks. In this
   paper, a new approach whereby there is an intrinsic interaction between
   feature extraction and the MHT is presented. A measure of the feature
   extraction quality is input into the measurement-to-track association
   while the prediction step feeds back information to be used in the next
   round of feature extraction. The motivation for this interaction between
   feature extraction and tracking is to improve the performance in both
   steps. In addition, a track-specific detection probability becomes
   available to the prior. This prior probability moderates the state
   covariance growth when measurements are not available for track
   continuation. This moderation permits growth of the tracking gate when a
   target is out maneuvering the tracker, while this growth is limited when
   the target is within the tracking gate but with a low probability of
   detection. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
   approach with a small increase in computational load. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance of GaAs nanowire (NW)
   arrays are calculated by solving Maxwell's equations using the finite
   element method. The model is compared with measurement results from
   well-ordered periodic GaAs NW arrays fabricated by dry etching. The
   model results are also compared with the reflectance measured from NWs
   grown by the Au-assisted vapor-liquid-solid method. The optimum NW
   diameter, periodicity (spacing between NWs), and length are determined
   to maximize absorptance of the AM1.5G solar spectrum and short circuit
   current density in a NW array solar cell. The optimum NW diameter,
   period, and length were 180 nm, 350 nm, and 5 mu m, respectively, giving
   a photocurrent density from the NW of 27.3mA/cm(2) and corresponding to
   91.3\% absorption of the AM1.5G solar spectrum. The photocurrent density
   saturated for NW lengths greater than 5 mu m. A gold nanoparticle at the
   top of the NWs (used in the vapor-liquid-solid NW growth process)
   substantially reduced the optimum photocurrent density, while a polymer
   filling the space between NWs and a planar indium tin oxide contact had
   a relatively minor influence. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Preventative maintenance is common in industry and aids in sustaining
   reliable process operations. If maintenance is executed within the
   production schedule, it imposes restrictions on the shared resources of
   the manufacturing facility. In multipurpose batch plants, these
   restrictions can affect many product pathways and have a significant
   impact on plant profitability. The combined optimization of process
   maintenance and production scheduling should therefore exploit the
   inherent flexibility of such plants and provide solutions with the
   highest profitability. This paper presents a mathematical model capable
   of addressing the combined scheduling of maintenance and production
   tasks within a continuous-time state-task network based framework.
   Multiple maintenance types are addressed within the framework. The
   proposed formulation is illustrated on an adaptation of a well cited

Title = {{Psychiatric symptoms correlate with metabolic indices in the hippocampus
   and cingulate in patients with mitochondrial disorders}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that mitochondrial dysfunction may have
   a critical role in the pathophysiology of major psychiatric illnesses.
   Patients with mitochondrial disorders offer a unique window through
   which we can begin to understand the association between psychiatric
   symptoms and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo. Using proton magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS), we investigated metabolic indices in
   mitochondrial patients in regions of the brain that have been implicated
   in psychiatric illness: the caudate, cingulate cortex and hippocampus.
   In all, 15 patients with mitochondrial disorders and 15 age-and
   sex-matched controls underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment,
   including the administration of standardized psychiatric rating scales,
   followed by single voxel H-1-MRS of the caudate, cingulate cortex and
   hippocampus to measure N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr),
   glycerophosphocholine (GPC), myoinositol and glutamate + glutamine
   (Glx). Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to determine
   correlations between metabolites and the psychiatric rating scales.
   Anxiety symptoms in these patients correlated with higher GPC, Glx,
   myoinositol and Cr in the hippocampus. Impaired level of function as a
   result of psychiatric symptoms correlated with higher Glx and GPC in the
   cingulate cortex. In summary, we found remarkably consistent, and
   statistically significant, correlations between anxiety and metabolic
   indices in the hippocampus in patients with mitochondrial disorders,
   while overall impairment of functioning due to psychiatric symptoms
   correlated with metabolic markers in the cingulate cortex. These
   findings lend support to the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction in
   specific brain regions can give rise to psychiatric symptoms. In
   particular, they suggest that metabolic processes in the hippocampus may
   have an important role in the neurobiology of anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{The atomic-resolved reversal of the polarity across an antiphase
   boundary (APB) was observed in GaSb films grown on Si by high-angle
   annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (HAADF-STEM). The investigation of the interface structure at the origin
   of the APB reveals that coalescence of two domains with Ga-prelayer and
   Sb-prelayer causes the sublattice reversal. The local strain and lattice
   rotation distributions of the APB, attributed to the discordant bonding
   length at the APB with the surrounding GaSb lattice, were further
   studied using the geometric phase analysis technique. The
   crystallographic characteristics of the APBs and their interaction with
   other planar defects were observed with HAADF-STEM. The quantitative
   agreement between experimental and simulated images confirms the
   observed polarities in the acquired HAADF-STEM data. The
   self-annihilation mechanism of the APBs is addressed based on the
   rotation induced by anti-site bonds and APBs' faceting. (C) 2012

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A GaSb film was grown on a Si(211) substrate using molecular beam
   epitaxy indicating full lattice relaxation as well as full lattice
   registration and dislocation-free growth in the plane perpendicular to
   the {[}01 - 1]-direction. Heteroepitaxy of GaSb on a Si(211) substrate
   is dominated by numerous first order and multiple higher order
   micro-twins. The atomic-resolved structural study of GaSb films by
   high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
   reveals that slight tilt, along with twinning, favors the lattice
   registry to Si(211) substrates. Preferential bonding of impinging Ga and
   Sb atoms at the interface due to two distinctive bonding sites on the
   Si(211) surface enables growth that is sublattice-ordered and free of
   anti-phase boundaries. The role of the substrate orientation on the
   strain distribution of GaSb epilayers is further elucidated by
   investigating the local change in the lattice parameter using the
   geometric phase analysis method and hence effectiveness of the lattice
   tilting in reducing the interfacial strain was confirmed further. (C)

Abstract = {{Sparse representation based modeling has been successfully used in many
   image-related inverse problems such as deblurring, super-resolution and
   compressive sensing. The heart of sparse representations lies on how to
   find a space (spanned by a dictionary of atoms) where the local image
   patch exhibits high sparsity and how to determine the image local
   sparsity. To identify the locally varying sparsity, it is necessary to
   locally adapt the dictionary learning process and the
   sparsity-regularization parameters. However, spatial adaptation alone
   runs into the risk of over-fitting the data because variation and
   invariance are two sides of the same coin. In this work, we propose two
   sets of complementary ideas for regularizing image reconstruction
   process: (1) the sparsity regularization parameters are locally
   estimated for each coefficient and updated along with adaptive learning
   of PCA-based dictionaries; (2) a nonlocal self-similarity constraint is
   introduced into the overall cost functional to improve the robustness of
   the model. An efficient alternative minimization algorithm is present to
   solve the proposed objective function and then an effective image
   reconstruction algorithm is presented. The experimental results on image
   deblurring, super-resolution and compressive sensing demonstrate that
   the proposed image reconstruct method outperforms many existing image
   reconstruction methods in both PSNR and visual quality assessment. (C)

Abstract = {{We utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, with a
   cryogenically cooled sample stage, to detail the microstructure of
   partially transformed pure and titanium fluoride-catalyzed magnesium
   hydride powder during hydrogenation cycling. The TiF3-catalyzed MgH2
   powder demonstrated excellent hydrogen storage kinetics at various
   temperatures, whereas the uncatalyzed MgH2 showed significant
   degradation in both kinetics and capacity. TEM analysis on the partially
   hydrogen absorbed and partially desorbed pure Mg(MgH2) revealed a large
   fraction of particles that were either not transformed at all or were
   completely transformed. On the other hand, in the MgH2+TiF3 system it
   was much easier to identify regions with both the hydride and the metal
   phase coexisting in the same particle. This enabled us to establish the
   metal hydride orientation relationship (OR) during hydrogen absorption.
   The OR was determined to be (1 1 0)MgH2 parallel to (-1 1 0-1)Mg and
   {[}-1 1 1]MgH2 parallel to {[}0 1 - 1 1]Mg. During absorption the number
   density of the hydride nuclei does not show a dramatic increase due the
   presence of TiF3. Conversely, during desorption the TiF3 catalyst
   substantially increases the number of the newly formed Mg crystallites,
   which display a strong texture correlation with respect to the parent
   MgH2 phase. Titanium fluoride also promotes extensive twinning in the
   hydride phase. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the energy absorption potential offered by light
   weight concrete (LWC) floors, perhaps when a building is poised to
   collapse from some extreme loading event. It is assumed here that the
   failure of LWC structural floor slabs would likely result in both
   break-up and pulverization of the concrete. To estimate the extent to
   which crushing of large portions of floor slab material would absorb
   energy, a series of concrete penetration tests employing patch loading
   was undertaken on scaled down model slabs. Six specimens had free
   (unconfined) edges, while the other four were confined along the edges.
   The test results, together with research findings obtained from the
   mining and milling industry, indicate that such floor systems would
   likely play an important role in absorbing energy during global collapse
   catastrophes.}},

Abstract = {{Switched reluctance machines (SRMs) are of great interest because of
   their simplicity, low-cost, reliability, robustness, fault-tolerance and
   extended-speed constant-power operation. However, conventional SRMs
   suffer from high torque ripples. There exist several methods, which have
   been proposed to reduce torque ripples. One of the proposed methods is
   to change the geometric structure of the machine. However, analysis of
   the state-of-the-art designs show that, despite achieving favourable
   results in applications, the moulding pins of the machines are normally
   neglected. A motor that gives positive results may get affected
   negatively by its random moulding during its manufacturing. In this
   paper, mitigation of torque ripples in short-pitched SRMs (SPSRMs) and
   fully-pitched SRMs (FPSRMs) are investigated. Three-phase SPSRM and
   FPSRM are chosen for this study and the effects of the geometric points
   of moulding pins in the machines are studied comparatively. Maxwell 2D
   program is used for the analysis and two different models are compared
   for both SPSRM and FPSRM. The obtained results show that the torque
   ripples of the two machines are lower when moulding pins are closer to
   the rotor position. It is reduced by 2.56\% at 10 Amps in the proposed
   SPSRM and 12\% at 6 Amps in the proposed FPSRM. It is also observed that
   the applied method is more effective in reducing torque ripples of
   FPSRMs than SPSRMs.}},

Abstract = {{Model silicone hydrogel contact lenses, comprised of
   N,N-dimethylacrylamide and methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy)
   silane, were fabricated and hyaluronic acid (HA) was incorporated as an
   internal wetting agent using a dendrimer-based method. HA and dendrimers
   were loaded into the silicone hydrogels and cross-linked using
   1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide chemistry. The presence
   and location of HA in the hydrogels was confirmed using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy,
   respectively. The effects of the presence of HA on the silicone
   hydrogels on hydrophilicity, swelling behavior, transparency, and
   lysozyme sorption and denaturation were evaluated. The results showed
   that HA increased the hydrophilicity and the equilibrium water content
   of the hydrogels without affecting transparency. HA also significantly
   decreased the amount of lysozyme sorption (p < 0.002). HA had no effect
   on lysozyme denaturation in hydrogels containing 0\% and 1.7\%
   methacrylic acid (MAA) (by weight) but when the amount of MAA was
   increased to 5\%, the level of lysozyme denaturation was significantly
   lower compared to control materials. These results suggest that HA has
   great potential to be used as a wetting agent in silicone hydrogel
   contact lenses to improve wettability and to decrease lysozyme sorption

Abstract = {{Conventional time reversal can mitigate multipath delay dispersion by
   temporal focusing. But it is not applicable to time-varying channels
   with a Doppler spread. Although recently time reversal communication has
   been adapted to time-variant channels, the modified technique requires
   frequent channel updates to track channel variations and cannot handle
   large Doppler spread, which means that it cannot achieve frequency
   focusing. In this paper, two time reversal receivers for underwater
   acoustic communications over doubly spread channels are proposed. The
   proposed approach, which can be interpreted as time-frequency channel
   matching, is based on the channel spreading function rather than impulse
   response adopted by the existing techniques; this leads to much less
   frequent channel updates. Unlike existing methods that only correct a
   single Doppler shift, the proposed approach uses a rake-like structure
   to compensate for multiple Doppler shifts and hence can eliminate severe
   Doppler spread induced by temporal channel variations. Simulation
   results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, indicating
   that it can simultaneously counteract delay and Doppler spreads,
   achieving both temporal and frequency focusing. (C) 2012 Acoustical

Abstract = {{Catheters initiate coagulation by activating factor (f) XII, which can
   lead to catheter thrombosis. Fondaparinux, which only targets activated
   IX (fXa), is associated with more catheter thrombosis than heparin,
   which targets fXa and thrombin. To render catheters less thrombogenic
   and fondaparinux more effective, we examined whether coating catheters
   with corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI), which blocks fXIIa, attenuates
   catheter-induced clotting and promotes fondaparinux activity. Compared
   with unmodified catheters, CTI-coated catheters demonstrated (a)
   decreased adsorption of fibrinogen and fXII, (b) greater inhibition of
   fXIIa generated by catheter-induced autoactivation, (c) attenuated
   fXIIa-mediated activation of fXI and (d) longer plasma clotting times in
   the absence or presence of fondaparinux. In an accelerated catheter
   thrombosis model in rabbits, (a) the time to catheter occlusion was
   longer with CTI-coated catheters than with unmodified catheters and (b)
   an intravenous dose of fondaparinux that had no effect on the time to
   occlusion of unmodified catheters extended the time to occlusion of
   CTI-coated catheters. These findings support the concept that the
   prothrombotic activity of catheters reflects their capacity to activate
   fXII and identify CTI immobilization as a novel approach for rendering
   catheters and other blood-contacting medical devices less thrombogenic.

Abstract = {{A photonic-microfluidic integrated device is demonstrated with excellent
   and reliable fluorescence detection performance. CV values of 8\% for
   2.5-mu m beads and 14\% for 6-mu m beads were achieved through the
   correct deployment of carefully formed excitation beam shapes via
   integrated on-chip optics even without the use of 3D hydrodynamic
   focusing or a high-quality laser source and single mode beam
   propagation. The devices are fabricated in a monolithic planar fashion
   using a system of microlenses and waveguides integrated with
   microfluidic channels on-chip and packaged using a high-quality and
   low-cost channel sealing and high-performance interconnecting technology
   developed from our earlier works. Beam geometry in the excitation region
   is shown to affect the variation of fluorescence intensity from
   specimens, hence configurations of beam geometry targeted for a specific
   bead sizes are examined to ensure proper deployment of the lens designs.
   The formed high-quality optical excitation regions ensure reliable
   detection even with relaxed hydrodynamic focusing to ensure
   applicability with multiple specimen sizes. Device performance with each
   bead size was found to be acceptable for a range of beam geometries with
   a different ideal configuration for each bead size. These device designs
   help to form a device that will supplement conventional flow cytometry
   in point-of-care and remote detection applications by performing
   specific detections with an inexpensive and replaceable device.}},

Abstract = {{si-RAFT polymerization is widely used for surface modification. However,
   how the surface radicals terminate requires further elucidation. A
   kinetic model is developed for si-RAFT via the R group approach. The
   model describes the molecular weight of grafted polymers as well as
   polymer layer thickness and various chain concentrations. It is shown
   that surface/surface radical termination plays an important role. The
   termination is facilitated by the migration of surface radicals through
   hopping and rolling mechanisms. Hopping occurs through
   activation/deactivation cycles between surface and solution chains,
   dependent on the RAFT concentration in solution. Rolling occurs through
   transfers between surface/surface chains, dependent on the grafting
   density at surface.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of improving the hemocompatibility of blood-contacting
   devices, antithrombotic or fibrinolytic biological molecules-containing
   polyurethane (PU) materials have been developed. Cationic PU surfaces
   were prepared by grafting poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and
   quaternizing the tertiary amino groups with iodomethane. The surfaces
   were characterized by water contact angles and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The materials (PU-CH3I) were treated with antithrombotic
   or fibrinolytic drugs, such as hirudin or tissue plasminogen activator
   (tPA) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 9.0) to yield hirudin-loaded or
   tPA-loaded PU surfaces. The hirudin and tPA quantity of the surfaces was
   observed using a radiolabeling method. The quantities of hirudin and tPA
   taken up by the cationic surfaces were significantly greater than those
   on the unmodified PU: approximately 200-fold greater for hirudin and
   10-fold for tPA. The release of the bound hirudin and tPA from the
   materials in contact with plasma was slow, and at 48 h, similar to 78\%
   of the initial hirudin and similar to 26\% of the initial tPA remained
   bound. The activity of the bound hirudin and tPA, as measured by a
   plasma recalcification assay, was largely preserved. This approach may
   have potential for the development of surfaces having antithrombotic or
   fibrinolytic properties. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To accurately assess the ultimate load capacity of concrete slab-steel
   girder bridges, the effects of concrete nonlinearity and steel yielding
   on the truck load distribution in simply supported composite bridges are
   investigated using the nonlinear finite element (FE) method. In this
   study, fifty cases are analyzed to investigate the effect of the
   aforementioned parameters as well as the effects of other parameters
   including longitudinal and transversal truck position, number of loaded
   lanes (2-4), bridge length (12-20 m) and width (8-16 m), number of
   girders (3-6), girder spacing (2-3.75 m), and slab thickness (175-275
   mm). The moment in each girder, based on the nonlinear FE analysis, is
   used to obtain its Load Distribution Factor (LDF) at different load
   levels up to failure and is compared with the corresponding elastic LDF
   according to AASHTO LRFD specifications. The results show from zero to
   54\% increase in the internal girder LDF (average 32\%), and from zero
   to 29\% decrease in the external girder LDF (average 17\%) as the bridge
   traverses from the elastic to the ultimate state. This redistribution
   can be advantageously used when evaluating the load carrying capacity of
   existing bridges. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The results of gamma analyses of soil samples obtained from 50 locations
   in Fukushima prefecture on April 20, 2011, revealed the presence of a
   spectrum of radionuclides resulted from the accident of the Fukushima
   Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP). The sum gamma radioactivity
   concentration ranged in more than 3 orders of magnitude, depending on
   the sampling locations. The contamination of soils in the northwest of
   the FDNPP was considerable. The I-131/Cs-137 activity ratios of the soil
   samples plotted as a function of the distance from the F1 NPPs exhibited
   three distinctive patterns. Such patterns would reflect not only the
   different deposition behaviors of these radionuclides, but also on the
   conditions of associated release events such as temperature and
   compositions and physicochemical forms of released radionuclides. The
   Cs-136/Cs-131 activity ratio, on the other hand, was considered to only
   reflect the difference in isotopic compositions of source materials. Two
   locations close to the NPP in the northwest direction were found to be
   depleted in short-lived Cs-136. This likely suggested the presence of
   distinct sources with different Cs-136/Cs-137 isotopic ratios, although
   their details were unknown at present. Vertical gamma activity profiles
   of I-131 and Cs-137 were also investigated, using 20-30 cm soil cores in
   several locations. About 70\% or more of the radionuclides were present
   in the uppermost 2-cm regions. It was found that the profiles of
   I-131/(CS)-C-137 activity ratios showed maxima in the 2-4 cm regions,
   suggesting slightly larger migration of the former nuclide. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{To understand the formation mechanism of hot tearing defects generated
   during casting, a knowledge of the pressure at which cavities form
   spontaneously in the liquid metal is required. In this work, molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations were used to compute the cavitation pressure P
   (c) in liquid Al, where atomic interactions were described by an
   embedded atom method potential. The cavitation pressure was computed for
   various initial conditions and system sizes, and using classic
   nucleation theory, P (c) was extrapolated from MD length and time scales
   to those appropriate for casting. A value of P (c) a parts per thousand
   -670 MPa was obtained, which is several orders of magnitude less than
   that predicted from hot tearing models. To investigate the possible role
   of heterogeneous nucleation sites, the P (c) simulations were repeated
   on solid-liquid systems that were simultaneously solidifying. In
   addition, the influence of a trace impurity Mg on the cavitation
   pressure was also investigated. Neither the impure Mg atoms nor the
   solid-liquid interfaces act as heterogeneous sites.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Octopus cells, located in the mammalian auditory brainstem, receive
   their excitatory synaptic input exclusively from auditory nerve fibers
   (ANFs). They respond with accurately timed spikes but are broadly tuned
   for sound frequency. Since the representation of information in the
   auditory nerve is well understood, it is possible to pose a number of
   question about the relationship between the intrinsic electrophysiology,
   dentritic morphology, synaptic connectivity, and the ultimate functional
   role of octopus cells in the brainstem. This study employed a
   multi-compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley model to determine whether dendritic
   delay in octopus cells improves synaptic input coincidence detection in
   octopus cells by compensating for the cochlear traveling wave delay. The
   propagation time of post-synaptic potentials from synapse to soma was
   investigated. We found that the total dendritic delay was approximately
   0.275 ms. It was observed that low-threshold potassium channels in the
   dendrites reduce the amplitude dependence of the dendritic delay of
   post-synaptic potentials. As our hypothesis predicted, the model was
   most sensitive to acoustic onset events, such as the glottal pulses in
   speech when the synaptic inputs were arranged such that the models
   dendtritic delay compensated for the cochler travelling wave delay
   across the ANFs. The range of sound frequency input from ANFs was also
   investigated. The results suggested that input octopus cells is
   dominated by high frequency ANfs.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Hot melt granulation involves particle enlargement with a binder that is
   in its molten state during processing with accompanying solids.
   Fundamental studies of the technique have been presented for high shear
   mixers and fluidized bed systems in the literature but with the recent
   interest in twin screw extrusion machinery by the pharmaceutical
   industry for continuous granulation, further investigation was necessary
   to determine if similar mechanisms of wetting and growth were applicable
   to this new approach. Two different polyethylene glycols were used for
   the present study as model binders at 10-20\% concentrations to melt
   granulate a-lactose monohydrate in a co-rotating intermeshing twin screw
   extruder for operating temperatures between 80 degrees C and 120 degrees
   C. Three different screw configurations were tested, primarily composed
   of conveying elements with an incremental number of kneading blocks
   included to vary the intensity of mixing as well as the residence time
   of particulates inside the extruder. Characterization of the granule
   size, granule strength and binder concentration in the final product was
   done to determine the mechanism, which appeared to be best described as
   an Immersion type. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   as dislocations, on the energy barrier and the critical size for
   nucleation. In particular, through analysis of system energetics, we
   demonstrate that the growth of subcritical clusters into overcritical
   sizes occurs due to the fact that highly strained areas in the lattice
   locally reduce or even eliminate the free energy barrier for a
   first-order transition.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the energy states of electrons in a silicon nanowire are
   analytically calculated in the presence of a surface potential and an
   electric field, as in a nanowire field-effect transistor. The
   calculations are done for both partial and complete volume inversion and
   accumulation biasing conditions. Computations are performed for the <

   the effects of the surface potential, the electric field and the
   transverse dimensions of the nanowire on the electron energies and
   wavefunctions. Depending on the combinations of the surface potential
   and electric field, the energy level can increase, decrease or remain
   constant as the thickness of the nanowire increases. It is also observed
   that higher surface potentials can significantly change the energy
   states due to the increase of volume inversion/accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the atomic structure and the retrieval of
   information about reconstruction and bonding of metal oxide surfaces is
   challenging owing to the highly defective structure and insulating
   properties of these surfaces. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   offers extremely high spatial resolution (less than one angstrom) and
   the ability to provide systematic information from both real and
   reciprocal space. However, very few TEM studies(1-3) have been carried
   out on surfaces because the information from the bulk dominates the very
   weak signals originating from surfaces. Here we report an experimental
   approach to extract surface information effectively from a thickness
   series of electron energy-loss spectra containing different weights of
   surface signals, using a wedge-shaped sample. Using the (001) surface of
   the technologically important compound strontium titanate, SrTiO3 (refs
   4-6), as a model system for validation, our method shows that surface
   spectra are sensitive to the atomic reconstruction and indicate bonding
   and crystal-field changes surrounding the surface Ti cations. Very good
   agreement can be achieved between the experimental surface spectra and
   crystal-field multiplet calculations based on the proposed atomic
   surface structure optimized by density functional calculations(3). The
   distorted TiO6-x units indicated by the proposed model can be viewed
   directly in our high-resolution scanning TEM images. We suggest that
   this approach be used as a general method to extract valuable
   spectroscopic information from surface atoms in parallel with
   high-resolution images in TEM.}},

Abstract = {{A novel polarization beam splitter is designed on a slab waveguide
   platform where light is vertically confined. Planar lenses are formed to
   collimate and refocus a light beam by converting the phase front of the
   beam. A planar subwavelength grating of a wedge shape induces the form
   birefringence, where the transverse electric and transverse magnetic
   waves have different effective refractive indices and are steered to
   distinct directions. This design provides low insertion loss (< 0.9 dB)
   and low crosstalk (<-30 dB) for a bandwidth of 100 nm in a compact size,
   and can be realized by different material systems for easy fabrication
   and/or monolithic integration with other optical components.}},

Abstract = {{The hybrid model of a CDU introduced in this work can be used for both
   production planning and for RTO, since the model converges rapidly via
   SLP, it is small in size, its accuracy is comparable to rigorous models,
   and it can optimize the operating variables, including furnace duty and
   pumparound duties. This enables CDU part of the planning models to be as
   accurate as the RTO models, instead of using standard CDU modes of
   operation. The model includes mass and energy balances and statistical
   models relating crude distillation curve points, tower operating
   variables and tray temperatures to product distillation curves. Hybrid
   model of a sample CDU shows excellent agreement with property
   predictions from the rigorous model; RMSE of points on the product
   distillation curves is typically less than 0.5\% of the rigorous model
   predictions. Optimization of the hybrid model via SLP converged to a
   better point than equation-oriented AspenPlus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The predictive model based soft sensor technique has become increasingly
   important to provide reliable online measurements, facilitate advanced
   process control and optimization, and improve product quality in process
   industries. The conventional soft sensors are normally single-model
   based and thus may not be appropriate for processes with shifting
   operating phases or conditions and the underlying changing dynamics. In
   this study, a multiway Gaussian mixture model (MGMM) based adaptive
   kernel partial least-squares (AKPLS) method is proposed to handle online
   quality prediction of batch or semibatch processes with multiple
   operating phases. The three-dimensional measurement data are first
   preprocessed and unfolded into two-dimensional matrix. Then, the
   multiway Gaussian mixture model is estimated in order to identify and
   isolate different operating phases. Further, the process and quality
   measurements are separated into multiple segments corresponding to those
   identified phases, and the various localized kernel PLS models are built
   in the high-dimensional nonlinear feature space to characterize the
   shifting dynamics across different operating phases. Using Bayesian
   inference strategy, each process measurement sample of a new batch is
   classified into a particular phase with the maximal posterior
   probability, and thus, the local kernel PLS model representing the
   identical phase can be adaptively chosen for online quality variable
   prediction. The presented soft sensor modeling method is applied to a
   simulated multiphase penicillin fermentation process, and the
   computational results demonstrate that the proposed MGMM-AKPLS approach
   is superior to the conventional kernel PLS model in terms of prediction
   accuracy and model reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Highly \{100\} oriented Pt deposits were prepared by electrodeposition
   from a 10 mM HCl, 100 mM KCl and Na2PtCl6 center dot xH2O electrolyte.
   The deposits were prepared in the form of thin films and array of
   nanowires. A qualitative assessment of the proportion of \{100\}
   oriented Pt surfaces was obtained through X-ray diffraction measurements
   and cyclic voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4. The effect of the deposition
   potential, Edep, temperature of the electrolyte, Tdep, platinum salt
   concentration {[}Na2PtCl6.xH2O], and nature of the substrate were
   investigated. It was shown that the proportion of \{100\} oriented Pt
   surfaces reaches a maximum for Edep = -0.35 V vs SCE. Moreover, this
   proportion increases steadily as Tdep and {[}Na2PtCl6 center dot xH2O]
   are decreased from 75 to 25 degrees C and from 2.5 to 0.25 mM,
   respectively. Scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy micrographs indicate that the more
   oriented samples are made of pine tree-like structures that are
   effectively single crystals, and that the growth facets appear to be
   close to the \{001\} plane. This observation also clearly indicates that
   the plane exposed during the CV experiment is also \{001\}. As suggested
   by these micrographs, the films and nanowires are highly porous and
   roughness factors as large as 1000 were obtained on highly \{100\}
   oriented Pt nanowires. The predominance of \{100\} facets is attributed
   to their energetically favoured growth in the presence of hydrogen, and
   is shown to be significantly enhanced when the mass transport of Pt4+ is
   limited. Due to the predominance of \{100\} facets, the normalized
   electrocatalytic activity (mu A cm-2Pt) for the electro-oxidation of
   hydrazine and ammonia is higher than non-oriented polycrystalline Pt by
   a factor of 4 and 2.7, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A series of Cu-Sn alloys (pure Cu, Cu-0.2Sn, Cu-2Sn and Cu-5Sn) has been
   prepared to experimentally test the effect of solute on discontinuous
   dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) as a function of both temperature and
   strain rate. Hot compression tests were performed and the microstructure
   was characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Solute
   additions tend to broaden the peak in the flow stress curve and increase
   the peak stress, peak strain and steady-state stress. A reduction in the
   DRX grain size and a retardation of the kinetics of recrystallization
   are observed with solute additions, although the effect saturates at
   2Sn. A recently published, physically based model for DDRX of pure Cu
   has been extended to include the effect of solute. The effect on the
   plastic response of the material and the mobility of high-angle grain
   boundaries was incorporated and, through comparisons between experiment
   and simulated DRX phenomena, it is concluded that solute must also
   significantly affect the nucleation stage of DDRX. A model is developed
   for the effect of solute on the nucleation of DDRX in Cu-Sn alloys and
   comparisons with experiment indicate that the principal effects are well
   captured. Important areas for future work are discussed. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the self-organizing dynamic spectrum management
   (SO-DSM) for ad hoc cognitive radio (CR) networks. In this scheme, CR
   units try to exploit the primary networks' unused bands by establishing
   links with neighbouring CRs using those bands. Inspired by human brain,
   the CRs extract and memorize the activity patterns of the primary
   network and other CRs and create temporal channel assignments on
   sub-bands with no recent primary user activities using a self-organizing
   maps (SOM) technique. The proposed scheme is decentralized and employs a
   simple learning rule with low complexity and minimal memory
   requirements. The simulation results show that SO-DSM significantly
   decreases the probability of collision with primary users and also
   probability of CR link interruption.}},

Abstract = {{Free-space optical (FSO) communication links provide high data rates;
   however, their reliability is heavily dependent on weather conditions.
   This paper presents our experimental urban 1.87 km FSO link based on a
   customized commercial system and develops a library of channel
   measurements in clear and light rain weather conditions. A channel model
   for the link is proposed and experimentally quantified. Channel
   measurements are obtained by modulating a 60 mW laser source. At the
   receiver, a 2 GSa/s data converter is used and 16 fast-Fourier transform
   cores are implemented in the hardware to improve noise immunity. The
   resulting signal-to-noise ratio of the channel samples is around 40 dB
   under clear weather conditions. Fittings with log-normal, gamma-gamma,
   and Erlang distributions are presented, and the scintillation index and
   coherence time are measured. A computationally efficient finite-state
   Markov chain is derived for the channel to model both the distribution
   and the autocorrelation of the fading and is verified by the
   measurements. The Markov models and channel measurements in a variety of
   atmospheric conditions are available for download to permit easy
   verification of communication algorithms on this urban FSO channel.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, noncoherent cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF)
   half-duplex relay systems are considered. For such systems, an
   asymptotic formula of pairwise error probability (PEP) for the least
   square error (LSE) detector is derived by using the perturbation theory
   on the eigenvalues. The result shows that the full-diversity-gain
   function mimics coherent cooperative AF half-duplex relay systems,
   whereas the coding gain function mimics noncoherent
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In addition, it is proved
   that, for any given nonzero received signal, the unique blind
   identification of both the equivalent channel and the transmitted
   signals in a noise-free case is equivalent to full diversity with the
   LSE detector in a Gaussian noisy environment. In particular, for the
   noncoherent AF half-duplex protocol with three nodes, a full-diversity
   unitary diagonal distributed space-time block code (STBC) is designed by
   utilizing the full-diversity criterion established in this paper and
   recently developed uniquely factorable constellation. Furthermore, the
   generalized likelihood ratio test receiver is derived for this specific
   coded protocol. Simulation results show that the code presented in this
   paper substantially outperforms the differential code and the optimally
   precoded training scheme in the current literature.}},

Abstract = {{There are several statistical downscaling methods available for
   generating local-scale meteorological variables from large-scale model
   outputs. There is still no universal single method, or group of methods,
   that is clearly superior, particularly for downscaling daily
   precipitation. This paper compares different statistical methods for
   downscaling daily precipitation from numerical weather prediction model
   output. Three different methods are considered: (i) hybrids; (ii) neural
   networks; and (iii) nearest neighbor-based approaches. These methods are
   implemented in the Saguenay watershed in northeastern Canada. Suites of
   standard diagnostic measures are computed to evaluate and inter-compare
   the performances of the downscaling models. Although results of the
   downscaling experiment show mixed performances, clear patterns emerge
   with respect to the reproduction of variation in daily precipitation and
   skill values. Artificial neural network-logistic regression (ANN-Logst),
   partial least squares (PLS) regression and recurrent multilayer
   perceptron (RMLP) models yield greater skill values, and conditional
   resampling method (SDSM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based models show
   the potential to capture the variability in daily precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid thermal management system for electronics cooling is considered
   that incorporates a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) based active path in
   parallel with a conventional heat pipe based passive path. The passive
   path is used to transport the heat from the chip at moderate thermal
   conditions keeping the TEC electrically off while the TEC modules are
   turned on when the conditions become adverse, thus operating at a higher
   overall system coefficient of performance. An important design parameter
   is the fraction of the total heat sink area dedicated to each path,
   which will depend on the rated heat dissipation from the chip, thermal
   resistance of the entire heat sink and the operational ambient
   temperature. A thermal resistance network model for the hybrid system
   that takes into account the governing thermo-physical equations for the
   TEC is used to investigate the system. Controlled experiments are
   performed to validate the hybrid thermal management model. The model
   predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results. The
   operating envelope of different hybrid thermal management configurations
   are compared to a heat pipe based passive system and an only TEC system.
   Parametric studies are performed to analyze the effect of the number of
   TEC modules and the external thermal resistance.}},

   design parameters considering the requirements and restrictions for
   specific applications. According to the algorithms, it is feasible to
   design a flat field microconcave grating with a 4 mm grating radius as a
   key component in a micro-Raman spectrometer system for inline
   environmental monitoring applications. This microspectrometer operates
   over the spectral wavelength band from 785 nm to 1000 nm and has a
   spectral resolution of 2 nm at 900 nm. The total size of the system is 1
   mm x 4 mm x 3.7 mm, making it one of the smallest for this wavelength
   range and spectrum resolution. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of oligonucleotides onto model cellulose surfaces was
   investigated by comparing the Boese and Breaker's cellulose binding
   oligonucleotide (CBO) with a nonspecific oligonucleotide control (NSO).
   Measurements using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   technique confirmed that CBO adsorbed onto cellulose more than NSO,
   particularly at high ionic strengths (100 rnM CaCl2). CBO showed a
   higher maximum adsorption on nanofibrillated and nanocrystalline
   cellulose than on regenerated cellulose, indicating a preference for the
   native cellulose I crystal structure under conditions that favored
   specific adsorption over calcium-mediated electrostatically driven
   adsorption. In addition, an anionic polyacrylamide (A-PAM) with grafted
   CBO also adsorbed onto the surface of cellulose in CaCl2, whereas the
   unmodified A-PAM did not. This work shows that CBO performs as a
   ``sticker{''}, facilitating the adsorption of polyacrylamide onto
   cellulose, even under high ionic strength conditions where the
   adsorption of conventional polyelectrolytes is inhibited.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we outline two recent results which demonstrate the
   utility of deep-level engineering in silicon photonics. We describe the
   integration of silicon waveguide p-i-n photo-detectors in a ring (or
   race-track) resonator structure. The detectors are made sensitive to
   wavelengths around 1,550 nm via the introduction of deep-levels into the
   intrinsic volume of the waveguide detector. By exploiting the
   multiple-pass of the optical signal through the detector, we are able to
   significantly decrease the size of the detector structure (relative to
   straight waveguide detectors) while maintaining excellent responsivity
   on resonance. We also describe the use of deep-levels for optical
   modulation. Preliminary results show that thallium doped silicon
   waveguides may be switched between a dark and transparent condition
   through the variation of phosphorus doping. It is suggested that active
   devices may be fabricated in such a way as to vary the occupancy of the
   thallium level through field mediated modulation. The straightforward
   fabrication methods described lend themselves to a high-volume, high
   yield manufacturing process which should find general applicability in
   wavelength division multiplexing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nanogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) are attractive vehicles

   Nerve block durations of up to 9 h were achieved using acrylic
   acid-loaded nanogels loaded with bupivacaine. Increasing the anionic
   charge density of the nanogels or (for more highly acid-functionalized
   nanogels) decreasing the nanogel size facilitated longer duration of
   anesthetic release. Small (<300 nm diameter) nanogels formed dense
   aggregates upon injection in vivo and induced only mild inflammatory
   responses, while large (>500 nm diameter) nanogels typically remained as
   liquid-like residues in vivo and induced more severe inflammatory

Abstract = {{Color demosaicking is an ill-posed inverse problem of image restoration.
   The performance of a color demosaicking algorithm depends on how
   thoroughly it can exploit domain knowledge to confine the solution space

   technique for color demosaicking that exploits spectral and spatial
   sparse representations of natural images jointly. The spectral sparse
   representation is derived from a physical image formation model; the
   spatial sparse representation is based on a windowed adaptive principal
   component analysis. In some of most challenging cases of color
   demosaicking, the new technique outperforms many existing techniques by
   a large margin in PSNR and achieves higher visual quality. (C) 2012

Title = {{Model-based adaptive resolution upconversion of degraded images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1144-1157}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Resolution upconversion of a degraded image is an ill-posed inverse
   problem that is even harder than video superresolution due to lack of
   redundant observations from reference frames. To overcome this
   difficulty an adaptive 2D piecewise autoregressive (PAR) model is used
   to strengthen the constraints on the solution of the inverse problem.
   The PAR model can be fit to local image waveforms by adjusting its
   parameters. But estimating the model parameters needs the knowledge of
   the very original high-resolution pixels to be estimated by the model.
   We resolve this chicken-and-egg dilemma by adaptive nonlinear
   least-squares joint estimation of both model parameters and original
   pixels. This non-linear estimation problem is solved by the method of
   structured total least-squares, constrained by the degradation function
   (e.g., the point spread function of a camera plus noises) that forms the
   observed low-resolution image. As such, this work offers a unified
   general framework for joint upsampling, deconvolution, and denoising.
   Moreover, the upsampling can be carried out at an arbitrary scale rather
   than power of two. Experiments show that the proposed NEARU technique
   outperforms current methods in both PSNR and subjective visual quality,
   and its advantage becomes greater for larger scaling factors. (c) 2012

   have shown that targeting CO2 to the organoclay-compatibilizer interface
   can improve the extent of intercalation. However, reduced performance
   was observed when CO2 was introduced predominantly to the matrix or neat
   organoclay. In general, the different techniques of addition for CO2 did
   bring about greater structural changes to the organoclay, but the

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a comprehensive experimental program on
   medium-size and large-size fluid dampers in an effort to extract their
   force output during cyclic loading by simply measuring the strain on the
   damper housing and the end-spacer of the damper. The paper first
   discusses the stress path within the damper and, subsequently via the
   use of linear elasticity, shows that the experimental data obtained with
   commercially available strain gauges yield a force output of the damper
   that is in good agreement with the readings from the load cell. This
   comparison is achieved via the use of a position and velocity
   transducer, which combines good accuracy together with robust
   performance in a marine environment. The paper then examines the
   performance of a portable data acquisition system that can be used to
   collect and transmit data from a damper installed on a bridge to a
   nearby location (order of a km) where data are collected via either a
   wired or a wireless Local Area Network (LAN). Alternatively, the data
   may be transmitted to any remote location via mobile telecommunication
   networks; however, this requires leased telephone lines. The data show
   that the proposed arrangement is promising for monitoring in situ the
   force output of fluid dampers and detecting possible loss of their

Abstract = {{Recently, the Liu-Zhang-Wong's Toeplitz space-time block code and the
   Shang-Xia's Alamouti code-based overlapped space-time block code have
   been developed to enable coherent full diversity with the linear
   receivers for a wireless communication system having multiple
   transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna. In this paper, such
   a noncoherent system is considered, in which channel state information
   is unavailable at both the transmitter and receiver. Using the Alamouti
   coding scheme and the Toeplitz matrix structure, a novel noncoherent
   nonunitary space-time block code, which is called an Alamouti-based
   Toeplitz space-time block code, is proposed. By the fundamentals of
   Galois theory and algebraic number theory, two important properties on
   the two Alamouti codes generated from a pair of coprime phase shift
   keying (PSK) constellations, i.e., the uniqueness of factorization
   itself and the shift-invariant uniqueness of factorization, are first
   revealed and rigorously proved. Then, it is further shown that it is
   these two kinds of unique factorizations that enable the unique blind
   identification of both the channel coefficients and the transmitted
   signals by only processing two block received signals, as well as
   noncoherent full diversity with a generalized likelihood ratio test
   (GLRT) receiver. In addition, a full diversity unitary code design is
   also proposed by simply applying the QR decomposition to the full
   diversity nonunitary Alamouti-based Toeplitz space-time block code.
   Computer simulations demonstrate that the nonunitary and unitary codes
   presented in this paper outperform the differential codes and the
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-efficient training scheme based on the
   coherent orthogonal space-time block codes in the current literature.}},

   particle diameter can be reduced from 50 nm to approximately 10 nm in
   the presence of minor quantities of the cobalt(II) complex. The small
   particle size, combined with the relatively narrow particle size
   distribution, results in nanolatexes that are virtually transparent in
   appearance. Furthermore, the nucleation efficiency can be enhanced by up
   to two orders of magnitude, corresponding to approximately 1 particle
   nucleated for every 10(1) micelles. This represents a significant
   improvement as in microemulsion polymerization generally 1 particle is

   High temporal resolution (4 Hz) rsBOLD signal and single voxel (left

   patients and 13 NC. The rsBOLD data was analyzed using two types of
   fractal dimension (FD) analysis based on relative dispersion and
   frequency power spectrum. Comparisons in FD were performed between AD
   and NC, and FD measures were correlated with H-1-MRS findings.
   Temporal fractal analysis of rsBOLD, was able to differentiate AD from
   NC subjects (P = 0.03). Low FD correlated with markers of AD severity
   including decreased concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (R = 0.44, P =
   0.015) and increased myoinositol (mI) (R = -0.45, P = 0.012).
   Based on these results we suggest fractal analysis of rsBOLD could

Abstract = {{The optimal design and operation of flexible energy polygeneration
   systems using coal and biomass to coproduce power, liquid fuels, and

   optimization problem, which is a potentially large-scale nonconvex
   mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and cannot be solved to global
   optimality by state-of-the-art global optimization solvers, such as
   BARON, within a reasonable time. A duality-based decomposition method,
   which can exploit the special structure of this problem, is applied. In
   this work, the decomposition method is enhanced by the introduction of
   additional dual information for faster convergence. The enhanced
   decomposition algorithm (EDA) guarantees to find an e-optimal solution
   in a finite time. The case study results show that the EDA achieves much
   faster convergence than both BARON and the original decomposition
   algorithm, and it solved the large-scale nonconvex MINLPs to
   e-optimality in practical times. (c) 2011 American Institute of Chemical

Title = {{A single flexible tube in a rigid array as a model for fluidelastic
   instability in tube bundles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{14-32}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fluidelastic instability is considered the most critical flow induced
   vibration mechanism in tube and shell heat exchangers, and as such has
   received the most attention. The present study examines the concept of
   using a single flexible tube in a rigid array for predicting
   fluidelastic instability. The experimental work published in the open
   literature involving the use of a single flexible tube in a rigid array
   is critically reviewed. Based on this, an experiment is designed to
   facilitate precise control of the system parameters and to study tube
   response at different locations in the array. Experiments were conducted
   using a fully flexible array as well as a single flexible tube in the
   same rigid array. It is found that a single flexible tube located in the
   third row of a rigid parallel triangular array becomes fluidelastically
   unstable at essentially the same threshold as for the fully flexible
   array. However, when the single flexible tube is located in the first,
   second, fourth, or fifth rows, no instability behavior is detected.
   Thus, tube location inside the array significantly affects its
   fluidelastic stability behavior when tested as a single flexible tube in
   a rigid array. It is concluded that, in general, fluidelastic
   instability in tube arrays is caused by a combination of the damping and
   stiffness mechanisms. In certain cases, a single flexible tube in a
   rigid array will become fluidelastically unstable and provide a useful
   model for fundamental research and developing physical insights.
   However, it must be cautioned that this behavior is a special case and
   not generally useful for determining the stability limit of tube arrays.

Abstract = {{This paper examines aeroacoustic tone generation of a high-speed planar
   gas jet impinging normally on a flat, rigid surface. Experiments are
   performed over the complete range of subsonic jet velocities for which
   tones are generated, and over the complete range of impingement distance
   for which tones occur for a single nozzle thickness of h = 3 mm. The
   behavior of the planar impinging jet case is compared to that of the
   axisymmetric case and found to be significantly different, with tones
   being excited at much larger impingement ratios and lower flow
   velocities. The acoustic tones have been found to be generated by both
   symmetric and anti-symmetric jet instabilities, coupled with resonant
   acoustic modes occurring between the nozzle and plate surface. The
   nature of the flow instabilities has been investigated using
   phase-averaged particle image velocimetry measurements. The frequency
   behavior of the resulting tones is predicted using a simple feedback
   model, which allows the identification of the various shear layer modes
   of the instabilities driving tone generation. Finally, a thorough
   dimensionless analysis is performed in order to quantify the system
   behavior in terms of the appropriate length and velocity scales. (C)

Abstract = {{Venous vascular contributing factors to multiple sclerosis (MS) have
   been known for some time. Only recently has the scope of their potential
   role become more apparent with the theory of chronic cerebrospinal
   venous insufficiency (CCSVI). As research expands to further explore the
   role of vascular pathology in the MS population, it is expedient to
   review the evidence from an imaging perspective. In this paper, we
   review the current state-of-the-art methods using magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) as applied to imaging MS patients and CCSVI. This includes
   evaluating imaging signatures of vascular structure and flow as well as
   brain iron content. Upon review of the literature, we find that
   extracranial venous anomalies including stenosis, venous malformations,
   and collateralization of flow in the major veins of the neck have been
   observed to be prevalent in the MS population. Abnormal flow has been
   reported in MS patients both in major vessels using phase-contrast flow
   quantification and in the brain using perfusion-weighted imaging. We
   discuss the role of quantitative flow imaging and its potential in
   assessing possible biomarkers for abnormal flow. Finally, it has been
   suggested that the presence of high iron content may indirectly indicate
   progression of existing vascular pathology. To that end, we review the
   use of susceptibility-weighted imaging in monitoring iron in the
   thalamus, basal ganglia, and MS lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To study blood flow characteristics through the internal
   jugular veins (IJVs) at the cervical levels C2/C3 and C5/C6 in the neck
   of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
   Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging at 3T was performed on 323 MS
   patients. Phase contrast imaging was used to quantify blood flow at both
   the C2/C3 and C5/C6 levels. Total IJV flow (tIJF) was normalized by
   total arterial flow (tAF). Contrast-enhanced time-resolved 3D MR
   arteriovenography and 2D time-of-flight MR venography were performed to
   assess IJV anatomy. Based on this assessment, the MS population was
   divided into non-stenotic (NST) and stenotic (ST) subjects.
   Results: Of all the patients, 100 (31\%) belonged to the NST group and
   223 (69\%) belonged to the ST group. At the C2/C3 and C5/C6 levels, the
   normalized tIJF of the ST group was 56 +/- 26\% and 51 +/- 23\%,
   respectively. This was significantly lower than that of the NST group,
   85 +/- 85 +/- and 73 +/- 12\% (P<0.001). Zero percent and 5\% of the NST
   group had a normalized tIJF of less than 50\% at the C2/C3 and C5/C6
   levels, compared to 37\% and 47\% for the ST group. The tAF was smaller
   for the secondary and primary progressive MS patients than the relapsing
   remitting MS patients (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively), while the tIJF
   was similar among all MS types.
   Conclusion: Total blood flow through the IJVs at both the C2/C3 and
   C5/C6 levels was reduced in the ST group compared to the NST group.}},

Abstract = {{A novel energy-efficient collaborative Alamouti space-time block code
   (STBC) design is proposed for a wireless communication system having two
   transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna. This new design
   allows us to have more options for variable-rate modulation for fading
   channels with enhanced performance for signal transmission than the
   conventional Alamouti coding scheme while having
   complex-symbol-decodable complexity for the maximum likelihood (ML)
   detector. Subject to the constraints on a fixed transmission bit rate
   and unity average energy per each transmitter antenna, the optimal
   linear constellation combinations with the optimal energy-scales as the
   coefficients are attained by maximizing the coding gain. It is shown
   that the optimal coding gain of the newly-designed code is larger than
   that of the conventional Alamouti code if the transmission bit rate is
   greater than two bits per channel use.}},

Abstract = {{A slot micro/nano optical fiber with elliptical low-index core, referred

   hence lead to large field enhancement. Benefiting from the large
   low-index power confinement factor and the field enhancement, the ESMNF
   also yields significant nonlinearity enhancement by the proper selection
   of materials. In addition, large birefringence between the two
   fundamental polarized modes is observed, due to the breakage of the
   circular symmetry for the core. The nonlinearity and low-index
   confinement properties of a more practical elliptical-slot embedded
   suspended microstructure fiber are also studied.}},

   describing the terminal properties of the circuit elements are extracted

   conventional circuit simulation algorithms based on the complex

Abstract = {{A segmented polyurethane (PU) was modified with polyethylene oxides
   (PEO) of varying molecular weight and end group. The PEO served as
   linker/spacers to immobilize an antithrombin-heparin (ATH) anticoagulant
   complex on the PU. Isocyanate groups were introduced into the PU to
   enable attachment of either conventional homo-bifunctional dihydroxy-PEO
   (PEO-OH surface) or a hetero-bifunctional amino-carboxy-PEO (PEO-COOH
   surface). The PEO surfaces were functionalized with N-hydroxysuccinimide
   (NHS) groups using appropriate chemistries, and ATH was attached to the
   distal NHS end of the PEO (PEO-OH-ATH and PEO-COOH-ATH surfaces). Water
   contact angle and fibrinogen adsorption measurements showed increased
   hydrophilicity and reduced fibrinogen adsorption from buffer on all PEO
   surfaces compared to unmodified PU. ATH uptake on NHS-functionalized PEO
   was quantified by radiolabeling. Despite the different PEO molecular
   weights and end groups, and NHS-functionalization chemistries, the
   surface densities of ATH were similar. The adsorption of fibrinogen and
   antithrombin (AT) from plasma was measured in a single experiment using
   dual radiolabeling. On PEO-ATH surfaces fibrinogen adsorption was
   minimal while AT adsorption was high showing the selectivity of the
   heparin moiety of ATH for AT. The PEO-COOH-ATH surfaces showed slightly
   greater AT adsorption than the PEO-OH-ATH surfaces. Thrombin adsorption
   on all of the PEO-ATH surfaces was greater than on the corresponding PEO
   surfaces without ATH, and was highest on the PEO-OH-ATH, suggesting
   potential anticoagulant properties for this surface via direct thrombin
   inhibition by the AT portion of ATH. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{While the conventional Fe-C phase diagram predicts negligible solubility
   of carbon in alpha-Fe at room temperature, there are many examples where
   substantial carbon supersaturations have been reported. Non-equilibrium
   processing routes, such as physical vapour deposition (PVD), appear to
   be particularly well suited to generating very high levels of
   supersaturation. Few descriptions of the stability and microstructure of
   the supersaturated state exist, however. In this study, experiments have
   been performed using two PVD techniques allowing for the production of
   nanocrystalline films containing between 11 and 16 at\% C. Transmission
   electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy reveal no
   phase other than a nearly body-centred cubic iron in the as-deposited
   films. This result is discussed with respect to the kinetics of carbon
   rearrangement and the possibility of the stabilization of the
   supersaturated state via defects.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the
   deposition of halloysite nanotubes (HNT) and fabrication of composite
   chitosan-HNT and chitosan-HNT-hydroxyapatite(HA) films. The use of
   chitosan as a dispersing and charging agent for both HNT and HA allowed
   the formation of chitosan-HNT-HA monolayers, films of graded composition
   and multilayer laminates, containing different layers. The quartz
   crystal microbalance method was used for the investigation of the
   deposition kinetics. The composite films were studied by X-ray
   diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis
   and electron microscopy. The deposition yield, thickness of the films or
   individual layers and their composition can be varied. The results of
   potentiodynamic studies in the simulated body fluid solutions showed
   that the films provided corrosion protection of the stainless steel
   substrates. The composite films are promising materials for fabrication
   of biomedical implants with advanced functional properties. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Poisson's equation is solved to provide a comprehensive model of
   nanowire (NW) surface depletion as a function of interface state
   density, NW radius, and doping density. This model improves upon
   established theory by giving distinct solutions to the cases of full and
   partial NW depletion while implementing the charge neutrality level and
   accurate Fermi-Dirac statistics. To explain the underlying physics, key
   parameters were plotted as a function of both interface state density
   and NW radius, showing interesting features such as the lowering of the
   Fermi level in fully depleted NWs and marked increase in surface
   depletion width and built-in surface potential (relative to a planar
   film equivalent) in partially depleted NWs. Finally, examination of NW
   conductivity found that for NWs of radius a(crit), the minimum NW radius
   before which the entire NW is depleted, conductivity can be reduced by
   up to 95\% relative to bulk. Additionally, majority carrier inversion is
   predicted to occur in thin NWs. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{A mathematical model for void evolution in silicon by helium
   implantation and subsequent annealing process}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a physically based model that describes the diameter and the
   density of voids in silicon introduced via high dose helium ion
   implantation and subsequent annealing. The model takes into account
   interactions between vacancies, interstitials, small vacancy clusters,
   and voids. Void evolution in silicon occurs mainly by a migration and
   coalescence process. Various factors such as implantation energy and
   dose, anneal temperature, atmospheric pressure, and impurity level in
   silicon can influence the migration and coalescence mechanism and thus
   play a role in the void evolution process. Values for model parameters
   are consistent with known values for point defect parameters and assumed
   diffusion limited reaction rates. A single ``fitting parameter{''}
   represents the rate of cavity migration and coalescence and is,
   therefore, related to surface diffusion of adatoms. Results obtained
   from simulations based upon the model were compared to our experimental
   results and to previously reported experimental results obtained over a
   wide range of conditions. Data from the literature included experiments
   with helium ion implantation energies in the range 30-300 keV, doses of
   1 x 10(16)-1 x 10(17) cm(-2), subsequent annealing temperatures in the
   range 700-1200 degrees C, and annealing duration in the range 15 min-2
   h. Excellent agreement is found between the simulated results and those
   from reported experiments. The extracted migration and coalescence rate
   parameter show an activation energy consistent with surface diffusivity
   of silicon. It shows a linear dependence on helium dose, and increases
   with decreased implantation energy, decreased ambient pressure,
   decreased substrate impurities, increased temperature ramp rate, or
   increased Ge fraction in cavity layer, all consistent with the proposed
   physical mechanism. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   response, and the dynamic heterogeneity view of molecular liquids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{To investigate how non-exponential response could vary under different
   conditions, we studied the effects of adding 2 nm size polyhedral
   oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A,
   whose molecules have the same terminal (epoxide) dipoles as the
   tentacle-like side chains attached to the silsesquioxane core of the
   POSS molecule. Dielectric relaxation spectra show that, on initial
   addition, the POSS nano-heterogeneity decreases the non-exponential
   response parameter beta, which is consistent with the dynamic
   heterogeneity view, but it also decreases the relaxation time tau(m),
   which is inconsistent with that view. The variations in beta and tau(m)
   with the composition have a thermal equivalence. Despite the lack of
   translational diffusion required for dynamic heterogeneity, plastic
   crystals show non-exponential response and non-Arrhenius dynamics.
   Measurements of beta and tau(m) seem more appropriate than using probe
   molecules or modeling nonlinear response data as a sum of linear
   responses for testing the dynamic heterogeneity view. Data on molecular
   liquid mixtures is not generally consistent with this view, and adding a
   solute does not always decrease beta. Studies of mixtures of different
   size rigid molecules with identical dipolar groups, including polymers,
   may be useful for comparing the relative effects of temperature and
   molecular size on beta and tau(m). (C) 2012 American Institute of

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{36}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{The effect of nanomaterials on biological reactions has received much
   attention. We report herein that silicon nanowires (SiNWs) inhibit the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The inhibitory effect was found to be
   concentration-dependent, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of
   about 0.4 mg ml(-1). DNA polymerase, restriction endonucleases, lysozyme
   and horseradish peroxidase maintained their bioactivities after exposure
   to SiNWs. Also the interaction of SiNWs with primers and dNTP did not
   lead to decreased PCR yield. Compared to primers and dNTP, template DNA
   showed 4.7-10.5-fold greater adsorption on SiNWs. Template bound to
   SiNWs was ineffective in the PCR, whereas addition of free template to
   the PCR system increased the yield. The results of this work suggest
   that the inhibitory effect of SiNWs on the PCR was due to the selective
   adsorption of double-stranded DNA on SiNWs, thereby decreasing the
   availability of template for the reaction.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Reliable quality prediction of chemical processes often encounters
   different challenges including process nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity,
   shifting operating modes and dynamics, and system uncertainty. In this
   paper, a novel soft sensor prediction method is proposed by integrating
   finite mixture model (FMM) and nonlinear kernel Gaussian process
   regression (GPR). The finite mixture model is first estimated to
   identify the different operating modes of the process that correspond to
   the switching dynamics. Then the multiple localized Gaussian process
   regression models in the nonlinear kernel space are built to
   characterize the different dynamic relationships between process and
   quality variables within various operating modes. Further, the posterior
   probabilities of each new test sample with respect to different modes
   can be estimated through Bayesian inference strategy and used to
   incorporate multiple localized GPR models into a global model for
   quality variable prediction. The proposed FMM-GPR approach is applied to
   the Tennessee Eastman Chemical process with multiple operating modes and
   its performance is compared to that of the multi-model LSSVM method
   using two test cases. The soft sensor prediction results show that the
   FMM-GPR approach is superior to the LSSVM method in terms of much higher
   prediction accuracy and reliability. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The large strain torsion of polycrystalline materials with the hexagonal
   close packed (HCP) crystallographic structure is numerically studied by
   using a special purpose finite element. All simulations are based on the
   recently developed large strain elastic viscoplastic self-consistent
   (EVPSC) model for polycrystalline materials. For the first time, the
   effect of twinning on the large strain torsion is assessed in the
   present study. It is found that the response of the large strain torsion
   of HCP polycrystals is very sensitive to the initial texture and texture
   evolution. Numerical results indicate that excluding texture evolution
   dramatically reduces the development of the second-order axial strain
   under free-end torsion, or the axial force under fixed-end torsion. It
   is also numerically demonstrated that twinning has a significant
   influence on the large strain torsion of HCP polycrystals. For the
   magnesium alloy AZ31 extruded bar, the predicted results are in good
   qualitative agreement with experimental observations.}},

   (a-Si:H/c-Si) solar cells. The focus of this article is on plasma
   enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of these films from silane
   (SiH4). Very high frequency (VHF) PECVD deposition and its limitations
   are discussed. Properties and requirements of intrinsic and doped a-Si:H
   films are presented. Light-induced degradation of a-Si:H films are
   reviewed in detail. Current status of single junction a-Si:H solar cells
   and factors influencing cell performance are also discussed. Since the
   efficiency and stability of thin film a-Si:H solar cells are low, a-Si:H
   films can be successfully used in other solar cell technologies such as

Abstract = {{This paper studies the influence of slenderness on the behavior of

   were tested with different slenderness parameters and heights ranging
   between 500 and 3,000 mm. The confining pressure provided by the FRP
   jacket and the composite action between the constituent materials
   resulted in an enhanced compressive behavior of the composite columns.
   The compressive strength, elastic axial stiffness, and energy
   dissipation capacity of the composite columns increased by a ratio of up
   to 5.2, 2.5, and 14.0, respectively, compared with that of the bare

Abstract = {{In this study, the dynamic response of typical wide-flange steel beams
   was experimentally evaluated under blast loading. A total of 13 beams
   were field tested using live explosives, where the charge size ranged
   from 50 to 250 kg of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixture, and the ground
   stand-off distance was from 7.0 to 10: 3m. Blast wave characteristics,
   including incident and reflected pressures, were recorded. In addition,
   time-dependent displacements, accelerations, and strains at different
   locations along the steel members were measured, and the postblast
   damage and mode of failure of the test specimens were observed. The
   blast load characteristics were compared with those obtained using the
   Technical Manual UFC 3-340-02 results. The displacement response results
   were used to validate the results obtained from a nonlinear dynamic
   analysis based on a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model. Results
   showed that the UFC 3-340-02 pressure predictions compare reasonably
   well with the measured pressure in the positive phase in terms of both
   the peak pressure and overall time variations. The SDOF model predicted
   the maximum displacements of beams in the elastic range reasonably well,
   but it overestimated them in the plastic range. DOI:

Title = {{Allocating Urban Agricultural Reuse Strategies to Inventoried Vacant and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Community groups have a growing desire to use vacant and underutilized
   land for urban food production purposes; however, there are limited
   community-based tools available to assess the suitability of sites or
   location-allocation decisions. The purpose of this research is to
   provide decision support to community groups via a scientific software
   product developed in Microsoft Excel (R) that will aid users in
   identifying and inventorying the location and condition of vacant and
   underutilized land, determining the relative site suitability of the
   inventoried land, and allocating urban agricultural reuse strategies
   across the urban landscape. This paper describes an augmented capacity
   to the prototype community-based decision support tool (C-SAP) developed
   by Kirnbauer and Baetz (2011). C-SAP includes two existing tools that
   employ a binary scoring methodology for the vacant and underutilized
   land inventory process (VULI) and the analytic hierarchy process for the
   calculation of a set of site suitability indices (SSI). The additional
   capacity introduced herein, known as LOCAL, employs a multi-objective
   binary integer program formulation for the location-allocation of reuse
   strategies at a neighborhood, community or potentially city-wide
   planning level. The application of the prototype decision support tool
   to twenty one sites identified as potential future sites for urban
   agriculture is summarized and discussed. This tool has the potential to
   assist groups in clarifying both community needs and constraints, while
   producing outputs that provide a scoped, informed direction to users for
   the allocation of reuse strategies. This paper describes a methodology
   for engaging community groups in making well-informed decisions related
   to effectively and efficiently bringing vacant and underutilized land
   back into productive reuse in a way that complements city-wide land use
   planning initiatives related to sustainable growth.}},

Abstract = {{Voids were formed in silicon (Si) and silicon germanium/silicon
   (Si1-xGex/Si) samples containing 5\% or 9\% Ge (at. \%) by 30 keV, 5 x
   10(16) cm(-2) helium (He+) implantation followed by annealing in
   nitrogen (N-2) or dry oxygen (O-2) atmospheres in the temperature range
   960-1110 degrees C. Si1-xGex thicknesses were 60 nm and 20 nm for 5\%
   and 9\% Ge, respectively. He+ implantation energy was set such that in
   Si1-xGex/Si samples voids were formed inside the Si substrate. An
   increase in annealing temperature resulted in an increase in the average
   void diameter and decrease in the average void density. Due to the
   presence of implantation damage and the relatively high temperature
   anneals, Ge diffusion occurs, which results in a stress gradient in the
   sample that interacts with the void layer. The presence of Ge also
   results in weaker Si-Ge bonds (compared to Si-Si bonds). This leads to
   an increase in the rate of cavity migration providing a likely
   explanation for the increase in the average void diameter and decrease
   in the average void density in Si1-xGex/Si samples when compared to the
   similarly prepared Si samples. No impact on the void evolution process
   was observed as a result of changing the anneal atmosphere from N-2 to
   dry O-2. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Diversity and slow dynamics of diffraction rings: a comprehensive study

Abstract = {{Spatial self-phase modulation of a Gaussian beam in a photopolymer
   generated diffraction rings that propagated over unusually long
   distances (>> Rayleigh length) in the medium. Self-phase modulation was
   examined under negative, positive, and infinite wavefront curvatures (R)
   over different pathlengths. Resulting diffraction rings exhibited
   previously unobserved, slow dynamics, which could be directly monitored
   at the sample exit face. This study complements but differs
   fundamentally from previous ones that were predominantly carried out in
   thin films (<= Rayleigh length) and generated static diffraction rings,
   which were propagated through air and imaged in the far-field. In the
   photopolymer, an input beam with R < 0 generated diffraction rings with
   a dark center, which propagated through the medium while increasing in
   number, underwent filamentation, and finally transformed into a stable
   self-trapped beam. Diffraction rings generated under R > 0 bore a bright
   center and cyclically exchanged intensity with proximal diffraction
   rings. Statistical analyses of self-phase modulation at R = infinity
   identified diffraction rings, which (i) were superimposed with high
   order modes of a co-propagating self-trapped beam, (ii) resembled
   fingerprint-like rings, (iii) emerged sequentially, and (iv) possessed a
   bright center. Results were rationalized by combining self-phase
   modulation theory with the evolution of refractive index changes in the
   photopolymer. The findings expose a new facet of spatial self-phase
   modulation and the complex dynamics of diffraction rings that propagate
   over long distances. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The ability of polystyrene nanoparticles to promote glass bead flotation
   was measured as a function of nanoparticle diameter. In all cases,
   smaller nanoparticles were more effective flotation collectors, even
   when compared at constant nanoparticle number concentration. The
   superior performance of smaller particles was explained by two
   mechanisms, acting in parallel. First, smaller particles deposit more
   quickly giving more effective flotation in those cases where
   nanoparticle deposition kinetics is rate determining; the sensitivity of
   nanoparticle deposition rates to particle size was illustrated by
   kinetic measurements on a quartz crystal microbalance silica surface.
   Second, for a given coverage of nanoparticles on the glass beads, the
   mean distance between neighboring nanoparticle surfaces decreases with
   particle diameter. We propose that the expansion of the three phase
   contact line, after initial bead/bubble attachment, is favored with
   decreasing the distance between neighboring hydrophobic particles.}},

Abstract = {{The electromagnetic inverse source problem (ISP) for homogeneous

   within a TLM computational domain, a discrete linear inversion
   formulation is developed. Our formulation solves for the unknown source
   distribution inside a closed region using the knowledge of the
   near-field data on its boundary. Unlike the conventional
   frequency-domain treatments, both our source solution and the field
   measurements are in the time domain. The nonuniqueness of the ISP is
   addressed by additionally imposing smoothness constraints that minimize
   the first-order time and spatial derivatives of the source distribution.
   Our algorithm is illustrated through a number of numerical examples. It
   is also shown that our algorithm is robust against the noisy field
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the application of four nonlinear estimation
   techniques on two benchmark target tracking problems. The first problem
   is a generic air traffic control (ATC) scenario, which involves
   nonlinear system equations with linear measurements. The second study is
   a classical ground surveillance problem, where a moving airborne
   platform with a sensor is used to track a moving target. The tracking
   scenario is set in two dimensions, with the measurement providing
   nonlinear bearing-only observations. These two target tracking problems
   provide a good benchmark for comparing the following nonlinear
   estimation techniques: the common extended and unscented Kalman filters
   (EKF/UKF), the particle filter (PF), and the relatively new smooth
   variable structure filter (SVSF). The results of applying the SVSF on
   the two target tracking problems demonstrate its stability and
   robustness. Both of these attributes make use of the SVSF advantageous
   over other popular methods. The filters performances are quantified in
   terms of robustness, resilience to poor initial conditions and
   measurement outliers, and tracking accuracy and computational
   complexity. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of applying the SVSF on nonlinear target tracking
   problems, which in the past have typically been solved by Kalman or
   particle filters. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006374]}},

Abstract = {{A new multiway discrete hidden Markov model (MDHMM)-based approach is
   proposed in this article for fault detection and classification in
   complex batch or semibatch process with inherent dynamics and system
   uncertainty. The probabilistic inference along the state transitions in
   MDHMM can effectively extract the dynamic and stochastic patterns in the
   process operation. Furthermore, the used multiway analysis is able to
   transform the three-dimensional (3-D) data matrices into 2-D
   measurement-state data sets for hidden Markov model estimation and state
   path optimization. The proposed MDHMM approach is applied to fed-batch
   penicillin fermentation process and compared to the conventional
   multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) and multiway dynamic
   principal component analysis (MDPCA) methods in three faulty scenarios.
   The monitoring results demonstrate that the MDHMM approach is superior
   to both the MPCA and MDPCA methods in terms of fault detection and false
   alarm rates. In addition, the supervised MDHMM approach is able to
   classify different types of process faults with high fidelity. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Foam granulation is a newly developed method for the wet agglomeration

   This paper examines aspects of foamed binder addition during the

   methylcellulose species. The work looks at the generation of foams with
   differing liquid drainage and shear stability behaviors based on varying
   the volume fraction of the dispersed gas and the binder viscosity for
   the liquid phase. Final granule properties related to their size and
   fracture strength showed strong dependency on the operating conditions
   of the process, indicating a mechanical dispersion controlled nucleation
   mechanism. Foam properties influencing the process were most strongly
   controlled by the binder viscosity, with lower viscosity solutions
   giving larger, more consolidated granules. A two-region nucleation zone
   model was proposed for the extruder based observations and experimental

Abstract = {{Hamilton's historical roots as an electric, industrial and
   transportation-oriented city provide it with a high potential for rapid
   transit, especially when combined with its growing population,
   developing economy, redeveloping downtown core and its plans for
   sustainable growth. This paper explores the health, environmental,
   social and economic impacts of light rail transit, a component of the
   City of Hamilton's rapid transit initiative. It performs a comparative
   analysis with other major North American cities that have successfully
   implemented this form of mass transit. The analysis concentrates on
   three main areas: urban development and land values, health and
   environmental impact and socio-economic factors. The results of the
   research on light rail transit (LRT) and its possible benefits indicate
   overwhelming support for the economic, health, environmental and social
   benefits of LRT, especially when compared to other forms of transit,
   including rapid bus and local transit schemes. According to the results,
   LRT in a medium sized, growing city such as Hamilton should be
   considered a viable and desirable transit option; a catalyst for transit
   oriented, high density, mixed use development; an economically sound
   investment opportunity, providing a return on investment to property
   owners, businesses and the municipality; and a catalyst for social
   change, improving the health, environment and connectivity of the

Abstract = {{This paper examines the change in air pollutant concentrations between
   2005 and 2010 occurring in the City of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. After
   analysis of stationary air pollutant concentration data, we analyze
   mobile air pollutant concentration data. Air pollutants included in the
   analysis are CO, PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, and NOX. Stationary monitoring
   indicates a continuous reduction in air pollutant concentrations.
   Stationary monitors only cover a small spatial extent of Hamilton.
   Mobile monitoring of air pollutant concentrations, averaged over census
   tract boundaries, indicates both improvement and decline in air quality.
   These improvements and declines in air quality are spatially clustered
   throughout Hamilton. Mobile data indicated significant decline in median
   pollutant concentration for CO, SO2, PM2.5, and NO2; but significant
   increase for NO and NOX. Air quality change in Hamilton is spatially
   heterogeneous, and is not captured based on the current stationary
   monitoring network. Coupling of mobile and stationary air pollutant
   concentration monitoring provides a more accurate spatial assessment of
   local air quality.}},

Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been under intensive studies, due to
   their attractive properties such as large scale, low cost, lightweight.
   However, their short lifetime, compared with the inorganic counterparts,
   has placed a severe restriction on the potential applications. To reveal
   the cause of the short life, here we report the finding of two
   distinguishable degradation mechanisms, from a typical organic/polymeric
   solar cell, based on polymer blend of regioregular
   poly(3-hexylthiophene):{[}6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester,
   fabricated on indium tin oxide-coated glass substrate. The first mode is
   associated with a localized failed area due to moisture encroachment,
   where the confronted areas are either completely dead or still 100\%
   functioning. The second mode was found to be related to a mild decrease
   in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and was induced by a possible
   interfacial passivation occurred at the organic/cathode interface, due
   to the presence of residual oxygen, moisture and other impurities. The
   simulation results agree well with our experimental findings in showing
   that the degradation due to the localized moisture encroachment may be
   delayed by encapsulating the OSCs with desiccant. The degradation due to
   the interfacial passivation could be eliminated by the removal of low
   work function cathode at the sacrifice of PCE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for charge transport in organic and
   polymeric diodes that provides a physical explanation of the transition
   from ohmic to space-charge limited current (SCLC) regimes. The proposed
   model is based on two established models: a unified model for the
   injection and transport of charge in organic diodes, including a proper
   boundary condition for the free charge density at the metal-organic
   interface; and a temperature and electric-field dependent mobility
   model. The model reproduces published experimental current-voltage
   characteristics (for different temperatures and device lengths). The
   modeling results highlight the importance of the boundary condition at
   the interface that is used to explain different trends and their
   transitions in the current-voltage characteristics: linear, quadratic
   and a higher than quadratic trend at high electric fields. The model
   uses a finite charge at the interface to eliminate any dependence of the
   parameters of the mobility model with the length of the organic layer.
   Importantly, this result differs from others that consider an infinite
   charge at the interface, and make use of a length-dependent mobility, or
   other more complex models that incorporate a dependence with the free
   charge density in order to avoid such a dependence with the device
   length. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of alternating current (AC) induced
   electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow and heat transfer augmentation for
   boiling inside an annular channel containing working fluid refrigerant
   HFC-134a has been conducted in a single-pass, counter-flow heat
   exchanger with a rod electrode placed concentric to a grounded tube.
   Experiments were conducted for an inlet quality of 0\%, a heat flux of
   10.2 kW/m(2), mass fluxes from 100 kg/m(2) s to 500 kg/m(2) s and
   applied voltages from 0 kV to 8 kV DC and 0 kV to 24 kV peak to peak AC.
   The AC tests were conducted for both low frequency (60 Hz) and high
   frequency (6.6 kHz) near sinusoidal waveforms. The results show that
   there is no apparent difference between the DC and the 6.6 kHz AC test
   cases, whereas the 60 Hz AC tests show significantly different behavior.
   The flow boiling heat transfer results indicate that the averaged heat
   transfer coefficients can be increased by as much as 3-fold for a 24 kV
   p.p. 60 Hz AC applied voltage. This also incurs a pressure drop penalty
   of 2.6-fold across the heat exchanger. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{It is well-known that, a dielectric cylinder on a metal surface offers
   the advantage of not yielding singular field, which would effectively
   reduce the propagation loss as opposed to a rectangle-shaped waveguide
   on a metal surface. In this article, a novel hybrid plasmonic waveguide
   consisting of two identical dielectric nanowires symmetrically placed on
   each side of a thin metal film is presented. With the strong interaction
   between the dielectric cylindrical waveguide mode and long-range surface
   plasmon polaritons (LRSPP) mode of a thin metal film, deep-subwavelength
   mode confinement can be achieved. Compared with the hybrid plasmonic
   mode guided in only one dielectric nanowire above a metal film, a much
   larger propagation length as well as improved figure of merit (FoM) can
   be simultaneously realized. A typical propagation length is 434 mu m,
   and optical field is confined into an ultra-small area of approximately
   0.0096 mu m(2) at 1.55 mu m. This structure could enable various
   applications such as nanophotonic waveguides, high-quality nanolasers,
   and optical trapping and transportation of nanoparticles and
   biomolecules. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Batch or semibatch process monitoring is a challenging task because of
   various factors such as strong nonlinearity, inherent time-varying
   dynamics, batch-to-batch variations, and multiple operating phases. In
   this article, a novel nonlinear and non-Gaussian dissimilarity method
   based on multiway kernel independent component analysis (MKICA) and
   multidimensional mutual information (MMI) is developed and applied to
   batch process monitoring and abnormal event detection. MKICA models are
   first built on the normal benchmark and monitored batches to
   characterize the nonlinear and non-Gaussian variable relationship of
   batch processes. Then, the kernel independent component (IC) subspaces
   are extracted from the benchmark and monitored batches. Further, a
   multidimensional mutual information based dissimilarity index is defined
   to quantitatively evaluate the statistical dependence between the
   benchmark and monitored subspaces through the moving-window strategy.
   With the corresponding control limit estimated from the kernel density
   function, the integrated MKICA MMI index can be used to detect the
   abnormal events in dynamic batch processes. The effectiveness of the
   proposed batch process monitoring approach is demonstrated using the
   fed-batch penicillin fermentation process, and its performance is
   compared to that of the MKICA method. The computational results show
   that the presented dissimilarity approach is faster and more accurate in
   detecting different types of process faults.}},

Abstract = {{Potato flour is abundant and less expensive than starch, though its
   major component is starch. It would therefore seem to be an attractive
   and viable source of biomass for biodegradable thermoplastic products.
   This study prepared thermoplastic potato flour (TPF) and thermoplastic
   potato starch (TPS) films by extrusion and investigated their
   properties. A mixture of glycerol and triethyl citrate (25-35\% of total
   weight) was chosen for the plasticizer. Properties of the TPF film, such
   as mechanical properties, surface hydrophilicity, surface energy,
   moisture sorption isotherm, and glass transition temperature (Tg), were
   characterized and compared with TPS film. The results showed that TPF
   film was comparable to TPS film in many properties. The mechanical
   properties of the TPF film, including tensile strength, elongation at
   break, and tensile modulus, were similar in magnitude to TPS film. In
   addition, TPF film showed lower Tg and surface hydrophilicity, but
   higher surface wetting capacity than TPS film. Components other than
   starch in potato flour were believed to have had a plasticization effect
   on TPF properties. Overall, potato flour demonstrated a comparable
   capacity for manufacturing thermoplastic film similar to the more
   expensive starch feedstock. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl

Abstract = {{The effect of ammonium polysulfide solution, (NH4)(2)S-x, on the surface
   passivation of p-doped InP nanowires (NWs) was investigated by
   micro-photoluminescence. An improvement in photoluminescence (PL)
   intensity from individual NWs upon passivation was used to optimize the
   passivation procedure using different solvents, sulfur concentrations
   and durations of passivation. The optimized passivation procedure gave
   an average of 24 times improvement in peak PL intensity. A numerical
   model is presented to explain the PL improvement upon passivation in
   terms of a reduction in surface trap density by two orders of magnitude
   from 10(12) to 10(10) cm(-2), corresponding to a change in surface
   recombination velocity from 10(6) to 10(4) cm s(-1). The diameter
   dependence of the PL intensity is investigated and explained by the
   model. The PL intensity from passivated nanowires decreased to its
   initial (pre-passivation) value over a period of seven days in ambient

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Duckbill valves (DBVs), made of a fabric reinforced layered rubber
   composite, are extensively used for nonreturn axial water flows with low
   back pressures. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is directly involved
   in the opening process of the DBV, with the opening depending on the
   pressure differential across the valve. In this paper, a simplified FSI
   model of the DBV is presented using a finite element method (FEM). The
   valve is modeled as a laminated thick shell structure with some
   simplifications to the boundary conditions. The pressure load acting on
   the shell surface of the DBV is a function of the variable valve
   cross-sectional area and determined, for preliminary analysis purposes,
   by using a simple potential flow model for the fluid mechanics. The
   hyperelasticity of the rubber and orthotropy of the fiber reinforcement,
   as well as large deflections of the DBV, are considered in the
   simulation. The valve is modeled as being closed when the upstream
   pressure is applied, and the transient opening process is tracked until
   a steady state opening is achieved. Several static cases of viscous flow
   passing through the deformed valve structure have also been carried out
   to compare the pressure and velocity fields of fluid flow with the
   corresponding pressure and velocity distribution predicted by the
   simplified model and to compare the hydraulic performance of the DBV
   predicted by both models. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005941]}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive wear-resistant coatings produced by physical vapor deposition
   (PVD) are a relatively new generation of coatings which are attracting
   attention in the development of nanostructured materials for extreme
   tribological applications. An excellent example of such extreme
   operating conditions is high performance machining of hard-to-cut
   materials. The adaptive characteristics of such coatings develop fully
   during interaction with the severe environment. Modern adaptive coatings
   could be regarded as hierarchical surface-engineered nanostructural
   materials. They exhibit dynamic hierarchy on two major structural
   scales: (a) nanoscale surface layers of protective tribofilms generated
   during friction and (b) an underlying nano/microscaled layer. The
   tribofilms are responsible for some critical nanoscale effects that
   strongly impact the wear resistance of adaptive coatings. A new
   direction in nanomaterial research is discussed: compositional and
   microstructural optimization of the dynamically regenerating nanoscaled
   tribofilms on the surface of the adaptive coatings during friction. In
   this review we demonstrate the correlation between the microstructure,
   physical, chemical and micromechanical properties of hard coatings in
   their dynamic interaction (adaptation) with environment and the
   involvement of complex natural processes associated with
   self-organization during friction. Major physical, chemical and
   mechanical characteristics of the adaptive coating, which play a
   significant role in its operating properties, such as enhanced mass
   transfer, and the ability of the layer to provide dissipation and
   accumulation of frictional energy during operation are presented as
   well. Strategies for adaptive nanostructural coating design that enhance
   beneficial natural processes are outlined. The coatings exhibit emergent
   behavior during operation when their improved features work as a whole.
   In this way, as higher-ordered systems, they achieve multifunctionality
   and high wear resistance under extreme tribological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the application of an offset-free model predictive
   controller (OF-MPC) to a vapor compression cycle (VCC). To this end,
   first a linear model is identified from data generated from a
   first-principle model of a VCC, interfaced with a building model
   implemented in EnergyPlus. Next, a model predictive controller is
   designed that includes an augmented model (including disturbance states)
   and an associated Luenberger observer to estimate the disturbance
   (plant-model mismatch) at steady state and eliminate it. Tuning
   guidelines are presented that enable partial `decoupling' of the
   Luenberger design and choice of MPC parameters, leading to offset
   elimination and superior tracking performance while reducing the energy
   demand on the VCC, relative to traditional control approaches. The
   superior closed-loop performance of the OF-MPC strategy is demonstrated
   for a VCC model in isolation, subject to realistic disturbances and
   subject to measurement noise. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The low erosion resistance of titanium and its alloys has prevented
   their widespread application as joint implants. In addition, one
   essential requirement for the implants to bond with the living bone is
   the formation of a bone-like apatite on their surfaces in the host body.
   To enhance the erosion resistance of the surface, a diffused layer of
   TiB2 was formed at 1000 degrees C on the commercial pure titanium.
   Hydroxyapatite was then coated on the boronised titanium by means of dip
   coating in a sol-gel solution. In order to confirm the biocompatibility
   of the specimens, they were soaked in a simulated body fluid for several
   days. The surface morphology of the specimens after exposure was studied
   by scanning electron microscopy, whereas X-ray diffraction patterns
   clearly revealed the growth of a calcium phosphate phase on top of the
   surface. Results showed that both wear resistance and biocompatibility
   of the hydroxyapatite coated samples on boronised films were improved.}},

Title = {{Effect of mean flow on the trapped modes of internal cavities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{70-84}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Flowexcited acoustic resonance of trapped modes in ducts has been
   reported in different engineering applications. The excitation mechanism
   of these modes results from the interaction between the hydrodynamic
   flow field and the acoustic particle velocity, and is therefore
   dependent on the mode shape of the resonant acoustic field, including
   the amplitude and phase distributions of the acoustic particle velocity.
   This paper investigates numerically the effect of mean flow on the
   characteristics of the resonant trapped modes for a cavity-duct system,
   which is known to generate strong resonances at moderate Mach numbers.
   The numerical simulations are performed for two dimensional planar and
   three dimensional axisymmetric geometries at different flow Mach numbers
   up to 0.3. A twostep numerical scheme is adopted in which the mean flow
   is solved in the first step, and in the second step a system of
   linearized acoustic perturbation equations is used to predict the
   acoustic field. Comparison of the results with the available
   experimental data illustrates that the current approach can predict
   accurately the dependence of the trapped mode frequency on the mean flow
   Mach number. More importantly, as the Mach number is increased, the
   acoustic pressure is observed to develop an axial phase gradient and the
   amplitude and phase distributions of the acoustic particle velocity are
   found to change significantly near the cavity shear layer. These results
   demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of the mean flow
   on the flowsound interaction mechanism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid)
   (poly(NIPAM-co-MAA)) microgels were prepared via semi-batch free radical
   copolymerization in which the functional monomer (methacrylic acid) was
   continuously fed into the reaction vessel at various speeds. Microgels
   with the same bulk MAA contents (and thus the same overall compositions)
   but different radial functional group distributions were produced, with
   batch copolymerizations resulting in core-localized functional groups,
   fast-feed semi-batch copolymerizations resulting in near-uniform
   functional group distributions, and slow-feed semi-batch
   copolymerizations resulting in shell-localized functional groups.
   Functional group distributions in the microgels were probed using
   titration analysis, electrophoresis, and transmission electron
   microscopy. The induced functional group distributions have particularly
   significant impacts on the pH-induced swelling and cationic drug binding
   behavior of the microgels; slower monomer feeds result in increased
   pH-induced swelling but lower drug binding. This work suggests that
   continuous semi-batch feed regimes can be used to synthesize
   thermoresponsive microgels with well-defined internal morphologies if an
   understanding of the relative copolymerization kinetics of each
   comonomer relative to NIPAM is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the

   acid (THB), hydrocinnamic acid (HCA) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic
   acid (HPA), were investigated as dispersing agents. It was shown that
   DHB, DHP, DHC and THB molecules, containing adjacent OH groups bonded to
   the aromatic rings, provide efficient stabilisation of MnO2
   nanoparticles and enable EPD of MnO2 films. The results obtained for the
   DHB, DHP, DHC and THB molecules with different numbers of OH groups and
   different lengths of hydrocarbon chains were analysed and compared with
   corresponding experimental data for HCA and HPA without adjacent OH
   groups. It was demonstrated that the adsorption mechanisms of DHB, DHP,
   DHC and THB on MnO2 nanoparticles involved the interaction of adjacent
   OH groups of organic molecules with Mn ions on the particle surfaces and
   complexation. The deposits were studied by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The deposition yield
   measurements showed that the amount of deposited material can be
   controlled by variation of dispersant concentration in the solutions and
   deposition time. The deposition mechanism and kinetics of deposition are
   discussed. The films prepared by EPD method are promising materials for
   application in electrochemical supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{The recently developed large strain elastic visco-plastic
   self-consistent (EVPSC) model, which incorporates both slip and twinning
   deformation mechanisms, is used to study the lattice strain evolution in
   extruded magnesium alloy AZ31 under uniaxial tension and compression.
   The results are compared against in-situ neutron diffraction
   measurements done on the same alloy. For the first time, the effects of
   stress relaxation and strain creep on lattice strain measurements in
   respectively displacement controlled and load controlled in-situ tests
   are numerically assessed. It is found that the stress relaxation has a
   significant effect on the lattice strain measurements. It is also
   observed that although the creep does not significantly affect the trend
   of the lattice strain evolution, a better agreement with the experiments
   is found if creep is included in the simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of chloride-binder
   interactions on the physical pore structure of concrete containing
   0-60\% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as cement
   replacement. Physical and chemical chloride binder interaction was
   measured based on chloride binder isotherms. Physical chloride binder
   interaction was estimated to be the difference between the total binding
   capacity and chemically bound chloride. In this study it was assumed
   that the chemical binding is the binding capacity of the alumina phases
   which was estimated, using differential scanning calorimetry, as the
   area under the Friedel's salt peaks. The assumption that chemical
   binding capacity is controlled by alumina phases is supported by
   multiple linear regression analysis that was conducted to assess the
   relationship between Fruendlich isotherm constants and the concrete's
   chemical composition. To determine the effect physical and/or chemical
   chloride-binder interaction on the physical microstructure, paste
   samples were exposed to distilled water and 0.5 M NaCl solution for 6 h,
   and the total porosity and pore size distribution was evaluated using
   mercury intrusion porosimetry. Three key findings from this study are:
   (i) At a chloride concentration up to 0.5 M, and for mixtures containing
   0 and 40\% GGBFS the contribution of physically and chemically bound
   chloride are similar. (ii) At chloride concentrations greater than 0.5 M
   and less than 1 M, the total bound chloride is predominantly chemically
   bound for the 40\% GGBFS mixture. (iii) Concrete specimens exposed to
   NaCl solution for 6 h exhibited different pore characteristics in
   comparison to concrete exposed to distilled water. The differences in
   the concrete microstructure are not linearly dependant on GGBFS content,
   but are found to be mutually influenced by the total bound chloride
   content, the percentage of chemically bound chlorides, and the pore size
   distribution of the mixture.}},

Abstract = {{For the high luminance and quantum efficiency, we propose a novel
   structure of white organic light-emitting diode (WOLED) using two white
   emissive layers (EML). The host material of MADN with the blue dopant of
   BCzVBi and the red dopant of DCJTB was used for one EML and DPVBi as
   host material with those dopants for the other EML. By considering the
   order of the EMLs and their energy band gaps in the device structure,
   the charge carrier trapping can be generated. They play a role in the
   barrier function at the EML enhancing the recombination where the holes
   and electrons were trapped in the DPVBi and MADN. The quantum efficiency
   can be improved by the charge carrier trapping in the WOLED with the
   double white EMLs as obtaining 4.23\% at 10 mA/cm(2), and it is vastly
   superior to that of the WOLED with a single EML. White color balance is
   also excellent with color coordinates of (0.36, 0.34) in the CIE 1931
   (x, y) chromaticity diagram. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A tissue engineered corneal equivalent (TECEs) requires host integration
   to achieve adequate anchorage and long-term device stability. Corneal
   integration through epithelialization and stromal integration can be
   manipulated by growth factors. We investigated the potential of
   heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) for mediating
   interactions with human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) and compared its
   efficacy to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in vitro. Furthermore, we
   utilized heparinized dendrimer crosslinked collagen gels, intended for
   use as TECE, for delivery of HB-EGF in a sustained manner. HCEC were
   exposed to HB-EGF at varying concentrations between 0.1 and 1000 ng/mL.
   Cell proliferation increased with growth factor concentration up to a
   concentration of 50 ng/mL, suggesting growth factor receptor
   down-regulation at higher HB-EGF concentrations. Response to HB-EGF was
   comparable to EGF at low concentrations of 0.1 and 1 ng/mL but at a
   concentration of 10 ng/mL, HB-EGF induced significantly better
   proliferation than EGF. Proliferation was found to be dependent on the
   initial seeding density. Heparinized dendrimer crosslinked collagen
   (CHG) gels were capable of HB-EGF uptake, which was influenced by
   heparin concentration within the gel, growth factor concentration and
   exposure time to the growth factor. HB-EGF release followed first order
   kinetics, with similar to 90\% of the growth factor released after 2
   weeks. Growth factor stability was verified with in vitro HCEC culture
   studies. Bioavailability was maintained in the gels through heparin
   interaction. Overall, HB-EGF induced proliferation of HCEC in vitro and
   can be released from heparinized collagen gels making it potentially
   suitable for promoting epithelialization of TECEs. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Photocrosslinkable methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HA) was prepared and
   incorporated into model conventional and silicone hydrogel contact
   lenses as an internal wetting agent. The molecular weight of the HA, the
   degree of methacrylation as well as the amount (0.25 to 1.0 wt \%)
   incorporated were varied. The HA-containing hydrogels were analyzed
   using a variety of techniques including water contact angles,
   equilibrium water content (EWC), and lysozyme sorption. The presence of
   HA could be detected in the materials using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopyattenuated total
   reflectance. The materials containing methacrylated HA had improved
   hydrophilicity and reduced lysozyme sorption. Effects of modified HA on
   EWC were dependent upon the materials but generally increased water
   uptake. Increased mobility of the HA associated with a lower molecular
   weight and lower degree of methacrylation was found to be more effective
   in improving hydrophilicity and decreasing lysozyme sorption than the
   less mobile HA. All results found suggest that photocrosslinkable HA has

Abstract = {{The mechanism triggering failure during deformation in Al-Mg alloys
   often includes localization of the plastic flow into narrow and intense
   transgranular shear bands propagating through the microstructure with
   little evidence of damage prior to the final fracture event. The cracks
   initiate in the sheared zones and propagate by conventional ductile
   mechanism of fracture, including nucleation of voids at second-phase
   particles, followed by their growth and ultimate coalescence. In an
   attempt to fully understand the mechanism of damage in continuous cast
   (CC) AA5754 aluminium alloy sheet, a methodology for characterization of
   the microscopic fracture strain distribution during bending was adopted
   in this work. A batch of digital images representing the deformation
   history of the samples bent during in situ V-bending tests performed in
   a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was recorded and later used as an
   input to a digital image correlation system (DIC) for strain
   calculations. Local strain maps of the tensile through-thickness
   cross-section of the bent sheets were built. The results clearly reveal
   development of spatial inhomogeneity of the strain at microscopic level.
   The strain concentration inside the formed intensive shear bands, which
   were the predecessors of the subsequent crack propagation, was found to
   be considerably larger than the macro-strains typically suggested by the
   forming limit diagrams for aluminium sheet materials. The presented
   results are consistent with previously published results on the general
   forming characteristics of continuous cast AA5754 aluminium alloy sheet
   materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are used to
   investigate pressure-driven water flow passing through carbon nanotube
   (CNT) membranes at low pressures (5.0 MPa) typical of real
   nanofiltration (NF) systems. The CNT membrane is modeled as a simplified
   NF membrane with smooth surfaces, and uniform straight pores of typical
   NF pore sizes. A NEMD simulation system is constructed to study the
   effects of the membrane structure (pores size and membrane thickness) on
   the pure water transport properties. All simulations are run under
   operating conditions (temperature and pressure difference) similar to a
   real NF processes. Simulation results are analyzed to obtain water flux,
   density, and velocity distributions along both the flow and radial
   directions. Results show that water flow through a CNT membrane under a
   pressure difference has the unique transport properties of very fast
   flow and a non-parabolic radial distribution of velocities which cannot
   be represented by the Hagen-Poiseuille or Navier-Stokes equations.
   Density distributions along radial and flow directions show that water
   molecules in the CNT form layers with an oscillatory density profile,
   and have a lower average density than in the bulk flow. The NEMD
   simulations provide direct access to dynamic aspects of water flow
   through a CNT membrane and give a view of the pressure-driven transport
   phenomena on a molecular scale. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We report a real-time dielectric study of polymerization of a
   diepoxide-triamine mixture containing varying amounts of a chemically
   reacting, 2 nm size structural heterogeneity of a silica based molecule,
   polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), bearing similar to 11
   epoxide groups. As the amount of substituent POSS in the polymerizing
   liquid was increased, the dc conductivity, the time for gelation, the
   static permittivity and the time to reach a certain relaxation time
   increased, and the dielectric relaxation spectra broadened. The rate of
   increase in the relaxation time during isothermal polymerization varied
   with the amount of the substituent POSS. Continuous change in the
   covalent bonded structure on polymerization with POSS alone showed
   pronounced features caused by an increase in the interfacial or
   electrode polarization. The added nano-heterogeneity of POSS that
   becomes ultimately a part of the polymer's network structure had
   qualitatively the same effect on the relaxation features during
   polymerization as the postulated dynamic heterogeneity on cooling a pure
   liquid. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of carboxylated PNIPAM microgels bearing adsorbed PVAm to
   increase the strength of wet paper and wet cellulose film laminates was
   measured as a function of the microgel diameter, cross-linking degree,
   PVAm molecular weight, and roughness of the cellulose substrates. The
   experimental results and simulations from a model led to the following
   design rules: (1) For low microgel dosages, small microgels are better
   because they cover more surface; however, very small gels can get buried
   in pores. (2) For high microgel dosages, larger gels are better because
   a saturated monolayer of adsorbed large gels puts more adhesive in the
   joints. (3) Adhesion increases with decreasing microgel modulus
   (cross-linking). (4) Adhesion is not sensitive to the molecular weight
   of the reactive PVAm microgel coating polymer.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-fiber architecture is proposed to mitigate the nonlinear
   impairments in fiber-optic systems. The power launched to each fiber is
   reduced in multi-fiber architecture as compared to the case of single

   propagating in the fibers undergo different amount of phase shifts and
   timing delays. Optical and electrical equalization techniques to
   compensate for these channel effects are discussed. Our numerical
   simulation results show that for unrepeatered systems, the performance
   (Q factor) is improved by 6.2 dB using 8-fiber configuration as compared
   to single-fiber system. In addition, for multi-span system, the
   transmission reach at a bit error rate (BER) of 2.1 x 10(-3) is
   quadrupled in 8-fiber configuration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A single welding thermal-cycles with different heat inputs (8, 16, 20,
   25, 30 and 50 kJ/cm) were simulated by Gleeble 3800 to study the
   correlation of toughness, hardness and microstructure in heat affect
   zone (HAZ) of the X100 pipeline steel with multi-phases and 0.10\%Nb
   (mass fraction). The microstructures of the CGHAZ in HAZ were
   characterized by means of OM, SEM and EBSD, and mechanical properties
   were tested. The results show that for a low heat input of less than 20
   KJ/cm, the microstructure is lath bainite or acicular ferrite structure
   with high-density of large-angle boundaries (>= 15 degrees), which
   exhibits good Charpy impact toughness. However, for a large heat input
   over 25 kJ/cm, the uniformity of prior austenite grains becomes worse,
   the M/A constituents and the granular bainite (GB) are coarsening, and
   the amount of large-angle boundaries decreases with the increase of heat
   input. The results of the instrumented Charpy impact test and the
   observation of fracture surfaces on the specimens indicate that the
   cracks are induced near the coarse M/A constituents and the large-angle
   boundaries can remarkably restrict crack propagations. Therefore, in
   order to ensure a strong match between the HAZ and the base metal, and
   the resistance to hydrogen induced delayed damage because of high
   hardness of HAZ, the heat input energy should be about between 15 and 20
   kJ/cm.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned ZnO nanowires (NWs) were grown on
   Au-nanocluster-seeded amorphous SiO2 films by the advective transport
   and deposition of Zn vapours obtained from the carbothermal reaction of
   graphite and ZnO powders. Both the NW volume and visible-to-UV
   photoluminescence ratio were found to be strong functions of, and hence
   could be tailored by, the (ZnO C C) source-SiO2 substrate distance. We
   observe C flakes on the ZnO NWs/SiO2 substrates which exhibit short NWs
   that developed on both sides. The SiO2 and C substrates/NW interfaces
   were studied in detail to determine growth mechanisms. NWs on Au-seeded
   SiO2 were promoted by a rough ZnO seed layer whose formation was
   catalysed by the Au clusters. In contrast, NWs grew without any seed on
   C. A correlation comprising three orders of magnitude between the
   visible-to-UV photoluminescence intensity ratio and the NW volume is
   found, which results from a characteristic Zn partial pressure profile
   that fixes both O deficiency defect concentration and growth rate.}},

   composition and a maximum (57\%) observed when NH2/MA molar ratio was
   1.5. Two melting transitions were observed for thermosets, representing
   the semicrystalline polyethylene fraction in the gel and sol part of the
   material in contrast to a single transition for the starting
   polyethylene. Overall crosslinking suppressed the crystallinity of the
   polyethylene in the thermoset. A single Tg observed in the DMA analysis
   suggested phase mixing between the polyethylene and polyether chains. A
   shift in the Tg observed was related to the degree of crosslinking in
   the thermosets. Tensile properties of the thermosets were observed to be
   a strong function of composition and the degree of crosslinking and the
   optimum mechanical performance was shown by thermosets when NH2/MA molar

Abstract = {{In a discrete network design problem, an optimal subset is chosen from a

   path-based traffic assignment problem is used as the lower-level
   problem. The path-based algorithms not only provide the link-flow
   solution, but also the useful path-flow solution (path information) that
   may be required or used in certain applications, such as network design
   problem. To solve a network design problem, the traffic assignment
   problem will need to be solved many times. The main objective of this
   paper is to expedite the solution of the network design problem by
   initializing traffic assignment problems with path sets already found in
   previously performed traffic assignments. The rationale behind this idea
   is that the addition of a number of proposed links to a network will not
   change the used paths for the majority of origin-destination (OD) pairs.
   In this paper, the network design problem is solved by a branch and
   bound algorithm for a small network and a relatively large network. It
   is shown that the proposed method is capable of reducing the computation
   time to one-fifth in real-size networks. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper considers the blind detection for a two-way relay system in
   which two source nodes exchange information via a relay node by
   amplify-and-forward relaying. An efficient transmission scheme is first
   proposed to achieve unique identifications of both the transmitted
   symbols and channel coefficients at a noise-free receiver using the
   M-ary phase shift keying modulation. Blind receivers based on the
   generalized likelihood ratio test are then derived for both the
   reciprocal and nonreciprocal channels with additive Gaussian noise. The
   least square error-based receiver is also studied for the case without
   prior knowledge of the noise power for detection. Moreover,
   constellation selection algorithms are proposed to achieve a uniform
   transmission bit rate for the ease of implementation. Finally, numerical
   results are provided to validate the proposed schemes.}},

   determined with a simple closed-form solution. The other significant

Abstract = {{Copolymers based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), acrylic acid
   N-hydroxysuccinimide (NAS) and varying concentrations of acrylic acid
   (AA) and acryloyloxy dimethyl-gamma-butyrolactone (DBA) were synthesized
   to create thermoresponsive, resorbable copolymers for minimally invasive
   drug and/or cell delivery to the posterior segment of the eye to combat
   retinal degenerative diseases. Increasing DBA content was found to
   decrease both copolymer water content and lower critical solution
   temperature. The incorporation of NAS provided an amine-reactive site,
   which can be exploited for facile conjugation of bioactive agents.
   Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed the onset of
   hydrolysis-dependent opening of the DBA lactone ring, which successfully
   eradicated copolymer phase transition properties and should allow the
   gelled polymer to re-hydrate, enter systemic circulation and be cleared
   from the body without the production of degradation byproducts.
   Hydrolytic ring opening occurs slowly, with over 85\% copolymer mass
   remaining after 130 days of incubation in 37 degrees C phosphate
   buffered saline. These slow-degrading copolymers are hypothesized to be
   ideal delivery vehicles to provide minimally invasive, sustained,
   localized release of pharmaceuticals within the posterior segment of the
   eye to combat retinal degenerative diseases. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{In this paper localization and tracking of multiple unresolved targets
   using a colocated multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar is
   addressed. The commonly-used model for colocated MIMO radars is modified

   a maximum likelihood estimator is derived for localizing multiple
   targets falling within a certain resolution cell. The Cramer-Rao lower
   bound (CRLB) for localization with the new model is also derived. For
   the tracking part, a multiple-hypothesis-based approach is used to deal
   with the uncertainty in target state estimation. In addition, an
   unscented Kalman filter (UFK) based estimator is used to tackle the
   nonlinearity in the measurement model. Finally, the posterior CRLB
   (PCRLB) is derived to evaluate the consistency of tracking results.
   Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in
   resolving multiple targets over using the standard localization results

Abstract = {{Passive coherent location (PCL) systems, which use existing commercial
   signals (e. g., FM broadcast, digital TV) as the illuminators of
   opportunity, is an emerging technology in air defence systems. PCL
   systems have many advantages such as low cost, covert operation, and low
   vulnerability to electronic countermeasures, over conventional radar
   systems. However, the limitations of PCL include lack of control over
   illuminators, limited observability, and poor detection due to low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This leads to high clutter with low
   probability of detection of target. Also, it is possible to transmit
   through multiple transmitters the same signal/frequency inside the
   coverage region of the receiver. Even though using multiple transmitters
   will facilitate better estimates of the target states due to spatial
   diversity, one cannot use these measurements without resolving
   transmitter-and measurement-origin uncertainties. Another limitation is
   that the elevation measurement, which is required to estimate the target
   altitude, is not available in most currently available PCL system
   receivers. In this paper, multiple target tracking algorithms for PCL
   systems are derived to handle low probability of detection and high
   nonlinearity in the measurement model due to high measurement error.
   Also, tracking algorithms are proposed to track multiple targets by
   resolving transmitter-origin uncertainty. Finally, algorithms are
   proposed for fusing multiple PCL system estimates by incorporating the
   altitude estimate uncertainty in order to improve the tracking accuracy
   and to increase the area coverage. The major contributions of this paper
   are the new algorithms for tracking using PCL systems with
   transmitter-origin and target-altitude uncertainties. The feasibility of
   using transmitters of opportunity for tracking airborne targets is shown
   on simulated and real data sets.}},

Abstract = {{The interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator has been proven to be
   effective in tracking agile targets. Smoothing or retrodiction, which
   uses measurements beyond the current estimation time, provides better
   estimates of target states. Various methods have been proposed for
   multiple model (MM) smoothing in the literature. A new smoothing method
   is presented here which involves forward filtering followed by backward
   smoothing while maintaining the fundamental spirit of the IMM. The
   forward filtering is performed using the standard IMM recursion, while
   the backward smoothing is performed using a novel interacting smoothing
   recursion. This backward recursion mimics the IMM estimator in the
   backward direction, where each mode-conditioned smoother uses standard
   Kalman smoothing recursion. The resulting algorithm provides improved
   but delayed estimates of target states. Simulation studies are performed
   to demonstrate the improved performance with a maneuvering target
   scenario. Results of the new method are compared with existing methods,
   namely, the augmented state IMM filter and the generalized
   pseudo-Bayesian estimator of order 2 smoothing. Specifically, the
   proposed IMM smoother operates just like the IMM estimator, which
   approximates N-2 state transitions using N filters, where N is the
   number of motion models. In contrast, previous approaches require N-2
   smoothers or an augmented state.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized multisensor-multitarget tracking has numerous advantages
   over single-sensor or single-platform tracking. In this paper, a
   solution for one of the main problems in decentralized tracking, namely,
   distributed information transfer and fusion among the participating
   platforms, is presented. A decision mechanism for collaborative
   distributed data fusion that provides each platform with the required
   data for the fusion process while substantially reducing redundancy in
   the information flow in the overall system is presented as well. A
   distributed data fusion system consisting of platforms that are
   decentralized, heterogenous, and potentially unreliable is considered.
   In this study, the approach to use an information-based objective
   function is utilized. The objective function is based on the posterior
   Cramer-Rao lower bound and constitutes the basis of a reward structure
   for Markov decision processes that are used to control the data-fusion
   process. Three distributed data-fusion algorithms-associated measurement
   fusion, tracklet fusion, and track-to-track fusion-are analyzed. This
   paper also provides a detailed analysis of communication and
   computational load in distributed tracking algorithms. Simulation
   examples demonstrate the operation and the performance results of the

Abstract = {{Since the year 2000, semicontinuous separation processes have been
   studied as a unique process intensification technique for the thermal
   separation of chemical mixtures. Typically, a single separation unit is
   used for multiple purposes with the aid of an auxiliary storage tank
   called a middle vessel. The system is operated cyclically but without
   startup or shutdown phases. As a result, multiple separation steps can
   be carried out with fewer capital expenses. In several cases, a
   significant profitability advantage over continuous or batch process
   alternatives has been shown, particularly for intermediate production
   capacities. The progress in semicontinuous systems is reviewed,
   including the development of semicontinuous ternary distillation,
   liquid-liquid extraction, azeotrope distillation, reactive distillation,
   and semicontinuous systems with integrated reaction and distillation or
   extraction. Control and operational strategies for semicontinuous

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The building floor plan may place restrictions on the shape of a tuned
   liquid damper (TLD) tank, forcing a tank of complex geometry to be used.
   The behavior of these types of TLDs is not well understood, and a design
   procedure for this type of TLD is unavailable.
   Obtaining suitable TLD dimensions and damping screen properties is
   paramount to TLD efficiency. This study develops a preliminary design
   procedure for a TLD of complex tank geometry coupled to a 1D structure.
   First, a linearized equivalent mechanical model representing the fluid
   is coupled to a linear 1D structure to predict the structure-TLD
   interaction. Since the structure is 1D, the mechanical model properties
   are transformed to be aligned with the structural direction of motion.
   Structure-TLD system tests are conducted to show that the transformed
   TLD properties can be used to model the system.
   A design methodology is presented which enables a TLD tank to be
   designed to conform to space restrictions. To do this, the transformed
   TLD properties are related to the tank shape using normalized charts.
   The charts enable a designer to rapidly match transformed TLD properties
   to a specific tank shape. A tank shape that simultaneously satisfies the
   geometric restrictions, structure-TLD mass ratio, and natural frequency
   can be identified from a single chart. Subsequently, charts are used to
   identify the proper fluid depth and damping screen properties. An
   example is used to demonstrate the design method, and the resultant
   TLD's performance is found to meet the design requirements using the
   mechanical model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Structural evidence of exercise-induced muscle disruption
   has traditionally involved histological analysis of muscle tissue
   obtained by needle biopsy, however, there are multiple limitations with
   this technique. Recently, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging
   (DT-MRI) has been successfully demonstrated to noninvasively assess
   skeletal muscle abnormalities induced by traumatic injury. Methods: To
   determine the potential for DT-MRI to detect musculoskeletal changes
   after a bout of eccentric exercise, 10 healthy men performed 300
   eccentric actions on an isokinetic dynamometer. DT-MRI measurements and
   muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were obtained before and 24 h
   post-exercise. Results: Z-band streaming was higher 24 h post-exercise
   compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The histological indices of damage
   coincided with changes in DT-MRI parameters of fractional anisotropy

Abstract = {{The bioavailability and toxicity of metal ions including radionuclides
   in the biosphere are greatly influenced by their speciation. Humic
   substances (HSs) are important constituents of various soil and water
   systems and have significant impact on the speciation and mobility of
   metal ions because of their high affinity to metal ions.
   In this study, the speciation of europium (Eu3+), a chemical homologue
   of trivalent actinides, with HSs collected from various origins was
   investigated by time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS).
   The difficulties associated with the separation of the contribution of
   different Eu3+ species due to overlapping spectra or similar
   fluorescence lifetimes were addressed and mitigated by applying a
   multi-mode factor analysis, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), which
   resulted in the number, spectra, decay curves and relative fluorescence
   intensity profiles of different Eu3+ species. Subsequently, the
   interpretation of the Eu3+ species, was tackled by principal component
   analysis (PCA) and partial linear square (PLS) regression to deduce the
   nature of the Eu3+ species by taking into account the physicochemical
   properties of the HSs.
   Three factors corresponding to different Eu3+ species were obtained at
   70 mu M Eu3+ for all HSs investigated except for one humic acid. One of
   the factors corresponded to free Eu3+ ion interacting with HSs via
   diffusion. The remaining two factors were thought to be Eu3+ bound to
   HSs: one bound to acidic functional groups of HSs and the other to the
   sites of HSs influenced by the carbon backbone structures. It was also
   found that the latter factor exhibited strong energy transfer from the
   excited Eu3+ center to HSs. At lower Eu3+ concentration (10 mu M), two
   factors having similar fluorescent characteristics to those of the
   second and third factors were obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper investigates foam granulation in a twin screw extruder as a
   new continuous wet granulation technique for pharmaceutical powder drug
   formulations. Foamed aqueous binder has a reportedly lower
   soak-to-spread ratio than drop or spray liquid addition in batch
   granulation. This work demonstrates a twin screw extruder configuration
   for foam granulation and subsequently compares the new approach against
   liquid injection in the granulation of a-lactose monohydrate with a
   methylcellulose binder. Trials were conducted at high powder output
   rates (20-40 kg/h) and high screw speeds (220-320 RPM) with two screw
   configurations. Process stability improved with the new technique
   allowing granulation with less binder. The extruded mass maintained a
   low exit temperature, being insensitive to operating conditions unlike
   the liquid injection approach, where temperatures rose significantly as
   flow rate increased. The particle size distribution by foam granulation
   reflected a more uniformly wetted mass with larger granule growth noted
   even for conditions where dry powder exited by liquid injection. Other
   factors were found similar between the two binder delivery methods such
   as consumed mechanical energy, as well as fracture strength and
   compressibility of produced granules.}},

Abstract = {{We have synthesized and investigated the anisotropic growth of
   interesting silver nanorice. Its growth is kinetically controlled at 100
   degrees C, and both oriented attachment and Ostwald ripening are
   involved, with the former growth mode dominating the anisotropic growth
   of the nanorice along the < 111 > direction. This one-directional growth
   is initiated by an indispensable seed-selection process, in which oxygen
   plays a critical role in oxidatively etching twinned silver crystals.
   The inhibition of this process by removing oxygen essentially blocks the
   nanorice growth. Although increasing reaction temperature to 120 degrees
   C accelerates the one-dimensional growth along the < 111 > direction,
   further temperature increase to 160 degrees C makes the oriented
   attachment dominated one-directional growth disappear; instead, the
   diffusion-controlled two-dimensional growth leads to the emergence of
   highly faceted truncated triangular and hexagonal plates mainly bound by
   low energy faces of \{111\}. Interestingly, we also found that the
   longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of the nanorice structures is
   highly sensitive to the refractive index of surrounding dielectric
   media, which predicts their promising applications as chemical or
   biological sensors. Moreover, the multipolar plasmonic resonances in
   these individual nanorice structures are visualized in real space, using
   high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The indium-tin-oxide/active layer interface is critical to the
   performance of organic solar cell devices. In this study, submonolayer
   films of LiF nanoparticles are deposited on the electrode surface with
   the assistance of polymeric micelle reactors, with controlled nanoscale
   surface coverage. Incorporation of the solution-processed bi-layer
   electrodes into a conventional poly(3-hexyl-thiophene): {[}6,6]-phenyl
   C-61-butyric acid methyl ester device shows significant improvement in
   device performance, especially when used in combination with a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene: poly(styrene sulfonate) layer. The
   nearly 5x improvement in the short circuit current and decrease in the
   contact resistance is mostly likely related to the increase in surface
   work function from the use of LiF nanoparticles. The results strongly
   indicate that engineering of the interfaces is a useful tool for future
   device optimization. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{A new dissimilarity method integrating multidimensional mutual

   process monitoring}},
Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Traditional multivariate statistical processes monitoring (MSPM)
   techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least
   squares (PLS) are not well-suited in monitoring non-Gaussian processes
   because the derivation of T-2 and SPE indices requires the approximate
   multivariate Gaussian distribution of the process data. In this paper, a
   novel pattern analysis driven dissimilarity approach is developed by
   integrating multidimensional mutual information (MMI) with independent
   component analysis (ICA) in order to quantitatively evaluate the
   statistical dependency between the independent component subspaces of
   the normal benchmark and monitored data sets. The new MMI based ICA
   dissimilarity index is derived from the higher-order statistics so that
   the non-Gaussian process features can be extracted efficiently.
   Moreover, the moving-window strategy is used to deal with process
   dynamics. The multidimensional mutual information based ICA
   dissimilarity method is applied to the Tennessee Eastman Chemical
   process. The process monitoring results of the proposed method are
   demonstrated to be superior to those of the regular PCA, PCA
   dissimilarity, regular ICA and angle based ICA dissimilarity approaches.

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{134-144}},

Abstract = {{Inherent process and measurement uncertainty has posed a challenging
   issue on soft sensor development of batch bioprocesses. In this paper, a
   new soft sensor modeling framework is proposed by integrating Bayesian
   inference strategy with two-stage support vector regression (SVR)
   method. The Bayesian inference procedure is first designed to identify
   measurement biases and misalignments via posterior probabilities. Then
   the biased input measurements are calibrated through Bayesian estimation
   and the first-stage SVR model is thus built for output measurement
   reconciliation. The inferentially calibrated input and output data can
   be further used to construct the second-stage SVR model, which serves as
   the main model of soft sensor to predict new output measurements. The
   Bayesian inference based two-stage support vector regression (BI-SVR)
   approach is applied to a fed-batch penicillin cultivation process and
   the obtained soft sensor performance is compared to that of the
   conventional SVR method. The results from two test cases with different
   levels of measurement uncertainty show significant improvement of the
   BI-SVR approach over the regular SVR method in predicting various output
   measurements. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic rainfall-runoff transformation considering both

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Many rainfall-runoff models consider only the infiltration excess runoff
   generation process. The use of green roofs, bio-retention areas, and
   pervious pavements for urban storm water management purposes requires
   the modeling of surfaces where both infiltration and saturation excess
   runoff generation mechanisms need to be considered. Expanded from
   previous results of probabilistic rainfall-runoff transformation,
   analytical equations transforming the input rainfall frequency
   distribution to output runoff frequency distribution are derived to
   incorporate both runoff generation processes. These analytical equations
   can be used to calculate the average annual runoff volume and runoff
   event volume return period. Results from deterministic continuous
   simulation of various urban surfaces were compared to those from the
   analytical equations and satisfactory agreement was obtained. The
   analytical equations are therefore proposed as a complement to
   continuous simulation models for the modeling of urban catchments where
   both runoff generation processes occur.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time block code designs based on algebraic field extension for
   full rate, large diversity product, and nonvanishing minimum determinant
   of codewords have received great attention. There are many different
   types of codes available for two-transmitter antennas, such as
   cyclotomic space-time block codes, the golden space-time block code, and
   rotation-based space-time block codes. In this paper, a more general
   space-time block code design scheme, which is called quadratic
   space-time block coding, is proposed for the two-transmitter antennas
   using quadratic field extension. The optimal design of the quadratic
   space-time block codes in terms of a diversity product criterion is also
   presented. It is shown that the optimal quadratic space-time block codes
   designed in this paper do not belong to the existing space-time block
   code family such as the cyclotomic, golden, and rotation-based
   space-time block codes. The simulation results demonstrate that the
   average codeword error rate of the optimal quadratic space-time block
   code attains about 0.5 dB signal to noise ratio gain over those of the
   optimal cyclotomic and golden space-time block codes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop two kinds of closed-form decompositions on
   phase-shift-keying (PSK) constellations by exploiting linear congruence
   equation theory: the one for factorizing a pq-PSK constellation into a
   product of p- and q-PSK constellations and the other for decomposing a
   specific complex number into a difference of a point in p-PSK
   constellation and a point in q-PSK constellation. With this, we present
   a novel and simple signal design technique to blindly and uniquely
   identify frequency selective channels with zero-padded block
   transmission by only processing the first two block received signals. In
   a noise-free case, a closed-form solution to determine the transmitted
   signals and the channel coefficients is obtained. In a Gaussian noise
   and Rayleigh fading environment, we prove that our scheme enables full
   diversity for the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver.
   When only finite received data are given, the linearity of our signal
   design allows us to use iterative sphere decoders to approximate GLRT
   detection so that the joint estimation of the channel and symbols can be
   efficiently implemented.}},

Abstract = {{In this work,(1) the authors study the classification of
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the determination of the state of
   sleep of a patient. They employ the power spectral density (PSD)
   matrices as the feature for the distinction between different classes of
   EEG signals. This not only allows us to examine the power spectrum
   contents of each signal as well as the correlation between the
   multi-channel signals, but also complies with what clinical experts use
   in their visual judgement of EEG signals. To establish a metric
   facilitating the classification, the authors exploit the specific
   geometric properties, and develop, with the aid of fibre bundle theory,
   an appropriate metric in the Riemannian manifold described by the PSD
   matrices. To use this new metric effectively for the EEG signal
   classification, the authors further need to find a weighting for the PSD
   matrices so that the distances of similar features are minimised whereas
   those for dissimilar features are maximised. A closed form of this
   weighting matrix is obtained by solving an equivalent convex
   optimisation problem. The effectiveness of using these new metrics is
   examined by applying them to a collection of recorded EEG signals for
   sleep pattern classification based on the k-nearest neighbour decision
   algorithm with excellent outcome.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel concept called a uniquely factorable
   constellation (UFC) is proposed for the systematic design of noncoherent
   full-diversity constellations for a wireless communication system that
   is equipped with a single transmitter antenna and multiple receiver
   antennas {[}single input-multiple output (SIMO)], where neither the
   transmitter nor the receiver knows channel-state information. It is
   proved that such a UFC design guarantees the unique blind identification
   of channel coefficients and transmitted signals in a noise-free case by
   processing only two received signals, as well as full diversity for the
   noncoherent maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver in a noise case. By using
   the Lagrange four-square theorem, an algorithm is developed to
   efficiently and effectively design various sizes of energy-efficient
   unitary UFCs to optimize the coding gain. In addition, a closed-form
   optimal energy scale is found to maximize the coding gain for the
   unitary training scheme based on the commonly used quadrati-camplitude
   modulation (QAM) constellations. Comprehensive computer simulations show
   that, using the same generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver,
   the error performance of the unitary UFC designed in this paper
   outperforms the differential scheme, the optimal unitary training scheme
   presented in this paper, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficient
   training scheme using the QAM constellation, which, so far, yields the
   best error performance in the current literature. However, with the same
   training ML receiver, the error performance of the UFCs is worse than
   the training scheme based on the QAM constellations.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to obtain the mobility, in
   pure Fe, of a face-centered cubic (fcc)-body-centered cubic (bcc)
   interphase boundary with an orientation given by (110)(bcc)//(776)(fcc)
   and {[}001](bcc)//{[}-110](fcc). The interface is best described by a
   4.04 degrees rotation, about an axis lying in the boundary plane, from
   the Nishiyama-Wasserman orientation and the boundary consists of a
   parallel array of steps (disconnections). An embedded atom method
   interatomic potential was employed to model Fe, and the free energy
   difference as a function of temperature between the fcc and bcc phases,
   which provided the driving force for boundary motion, was determined by
   a thermodynamic integration procedure. Although the boundary was found
   to be very mobile, the transformation did not proceed by a martensite
   mechanism. The boundary mobility was obtained for several temperatures
   in the range 600-1400 K and Arrhenius behavior was found with an
   activation energy of 16.5 +/- 2.7 kJ mol(-1) and a pre-exponential
   factor equal to 7.8(+/- 0.9) x 10(-3) mmol J(-1) s(-1). The activation
   energy is much lower than that extracted from experiments on the massive
   transformation in Fe alloys and possible reasons for the discrepancy are
   discussed. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An optimal control solution to the highly non-linear problem of orbit
   transfer mission is achieved by using a newly proposed analytical
   perturbation technique. The problem is classified as a two-point
   boundary value problem in order to optimize a performance measure in a
   given time. Assuming a constant thrust operating in a given length of
   time, it is sought to find the thrust direction history of a transfer
   from a given initial orbit to the largest possible orbit. The system
   dynamical model is stated by regarding a variable mass spacecraft moving
   in the variable gravitational field of the Earth, based on the two-body
   problem. To assess the perturbation solution fidelity, a numerical
   solution based on the Gauss pseudospectral method has been employed. The
   main novelty of this work is in applying a new analytical solution
   strategy that is a combination of perturbation technique and backward
   integration to a highly non-linear problem in the calculus of variations

Abstract = {{We report high-power efficient green light generation by frequency
   doubling from a periodically poled MgO doped LiNbO3 ridge waveguide. The
   ridge waveguide is fabricated by the annealed proton-exchanging and
   precise diamond blade dicing techniques. The ridge structure exhibits a
   surface roughness of only 3.7 nm, and near-90 degrees vertical sidewall.
   The total insertion loss of an 8.5 mu m wide and 1.4 cm long uncoated
   waveguide is 3.0 dB under direct fiber coupling. 466 mW of
   continuous-wave green light with an optical-to-optical conversion
   efficiency of 69.7\% is obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the highest green light output power reached to date using a ridge-type
   LiNbO3 waveguide device. Phase-matching temperature shift, tuning curve
   distortion, and waveguide loss increase are observed under high power
   operation. Our analysis shows that the photorefractive effect and the
   green induced infrared absorption are responsible for the observed
   phenomena, which becomes prominent under several megawatt per square
   centimeter power density. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the interfacial reactions to synthetic bone
   regenerative scaffolds in vivo is fundamental for improving
   osseointegration and osteogenesis. Using transmission electron
   microscopy, it is possible to study the biological response of
   hydroxyapatite (HA) and zirconia (ZrO2) scaffolds at the nanometer
   scale. Purpose: In this study, the bone-bonding abilities of HA and ZrO2
   scaffolds produced by free-form fabrication were evaluated in the human
   maxilla at 3 months and 7 months. Materials and Methods: HA and ZrO2
   scaffolds (Phi: 3 mm) were implanted in the human maxilla, removed with
   surrounding bone, embedded in resin, and sectioned. A novel focused ion
   beam (FIB) sample preparation technique enabled the production of thin
   lamellae for study by scanning transmission electron microscopy.
   Results: Interface regions were investigated using high-angle annular
   dark-field imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis.
   Interfacial apatite layers of 80 nm and 50 nm thickness were noted in
   the 3- and 7-month HA samples, respectively, and bone growth was
   discovered in micropores up to 10 mu m into the samples. Conclusions:
   The absence of an interfacial layer in the ZrO2 samples suggest the
   formation of a direct contact with bone, while HA, which bonds through
   an apatite layer, shows indications of resorption with increasing
   implantation time. This study demonstrates the potential of HA and ZrO2
   scaffolds for use as bone regenerative materials.}},

Abstract = {{Research on pool boiling of nanofluids has shown contradicting trends in
   the heat transfer coefficient (HTC). Such trends have been attributed,
   in part, to nanoparticle deposition on the heater surface. An
   experimental investigation of the transient nature of nanoparticle
   deposition and its effect on the HTC of pool boiling of nanofluids at
   various concentrations has been carried out. Pool boiling experiments
   have been conducted on a horizontal flat copper surface for alumina
   (40-50 nm) water based nanofluids at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5
   vol.\%. Nanofluids boiling experiments have been followed by pure water
   boiling experiments on the same nanoparticle-deposited (NPD) surfaces.
   This technique has been employed in order to separate the effect of
   nanoparticle deposition from the effect of nanofluids properties on the
   HTC. Contrary to what was expected, boiling of pure water on the NPD
   surface produced using the highest concentration nanofluid resulted in
   the highest HTC. A closer look at the nature of the NPD surfaces
   explained such trend. A new approach using a transient surface factor in
   Rohsenow correlation has been proposed to account for the transient
   nature of nanoparticle deposition. The applicability of such approach at
   different concentrations has been investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   efficiencies in blended structures, whereas the trivalent and
   tetravalent phthalocyanines tend to yield higher efficiencies in a

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole (PPY) films were obtained on stainless steel substrates by
   anodic electropolymerization using 2,6-naphthalenedisulfonic acid
   disodium salt (NSA) and chromotropic acid disodium salt (CHR) as anionic
   dopants. The deposition potential of PPY from the solutions containing
   CHR was similar to 0.4 V lower than that for NSA. Adherent PPY films
   were obtained from pyrrole solutions containing CHR. The comparison of
   the experimental data for CHR, containing OH groups bonded to the
   aromatic rings, and NSA without OH groups showed that the interaction of
   OH groups with metal atoms at the substrate surface promoted the
   formation of adherent films. The deposition was performed
   galvanostatically or potentiodynamically and the deposition yield was
   studied. The PPY films showed capacitive behaviour in the 0.5 M Na2SO4
   electrolyte. The specific capacitance (SC) increased with increasing
   pyrrole and CHR concentration in the solutions used for deposition.
   Electron microscopy investigations showed that the increase in SC with
   increasing CHR concentration can be attributed to decreasing particle
   size and increasing film porosity. The highest SC of 343 F g(-1) was
   observed at 2 mV s(-1) for the films prepared from the solutions
   containing 150 mM pyrrole and 50 mM CHR. The SC decreased with
   increasing scan rate. The SC decrease in thick films was attributed to
   increasing electrochemical impedance, which was analysed at different
   frequencies using an equivalent circuit. The cycling stability of the
   films was investigated. The PPY films prepared on stainless steel
   substrates by electropolymerization are promising electrode materials
   for electrochemical supercapacitors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) has been recently and enthusiastically promoted
   as a joint sampling and compression approach. The advantages of CS over
   conventional signal compression techniques are architectural: the CS
   encoder is made signal independent and computationally inexpensive by
   shifting the bulk of system complexity to the decoder. While these
   properties of CS allow signal acquisition and communication in some
   severely resource-deprived conditions that render conventional sampling
   and coding impossible, they are accompanied by rather disappointing
   rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel coding
   technique that rectifies, to a certain extent, the problem of poor
   compression performance of CS and, at the same time, maintains the
   simplicity and universality of the current CS encoder design. The main
   innovation is a scheme of progressive fixed-rate scalar quantization
   with binning that enables the CS decoder to exploit hidden correlations
   between CS measurements, which was overlooked in the existing
   literature. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the
   efficacy of the new CS coding technique. Encouragingly, on some test
   images, the new CS technique matches or even slightly outperforms JPEG.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing size of modern designs and more strict time-to-market
   constraints, design errors can unavoidably escape pre-silicon
   verification and reside in silicon prototypes. Due to those errors and
   faults in the fabrication process, silicon debug has become a necessary
   step in the digital integrated circuit design flow. Embedded hardware
   blocks, such as scan chains and trace buffers, provide a means to
   acquire data of internal signals in real time for debugging. However,
   the amount of the data is limited compared to pre-silicon debugging.
   This paper presents an automated software solution to analyze this
   sparse data to detect suspects of the failure in both the spatial and
   temporal domain. It also introduces a technique to automate the
   configuration process for trace-buffer-based hardware in order to
   acquire helpful information for debugging the failure. The technique
   takes the hardware constraints into account and identifies alternatives
   for signals not part of the traceable set so that their values can be
   restored by implications. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed software solution in terms of run-time and resolution.}},

   making use of the Alamouti coding scheme and jointly processing the

   to make the equivalent channel at each source node be a product of the
   two Alamouti channels and thus, is called distributed concatenated

Abstract = {{In half-duplex cooperative systems the problem of finding the jointly
   optimal power and channel resource allocation that maximizes the
   weighted sum rate (WSR) can be difficult to solve. Algorithms to solve
   that problem are provided herein for two classes of orthogonal
   half-duplex systems. For a class of systems in which the set of rates
   that can be achieved without time sharing is convex, the WSR problem is
   decomposed into a direct search in which a target rate problem is solved
   at each step. The target rate problem involves maximizing one of the
   rates subject to target values for the others, and can often be
   efficiently solved. For a subclass of those systems, the notion of
   perspective is used to transform the WSR problem into an
   efficiently-solvable convex optimization problem. Numerical examples
   involving a multiple access relay system and a pairwise cooperation
   scheme show that joint optimization can result in significantly larger
   weighted sum rates than optimization over the powers alone with a fixed
   channel resource allocation.}},

Abstract = {{For nearly four decades, the Great Lakes regime has invoked the Great
   Lakes Water Quality Agreement as the mechanism for binational
   cooperation on programs and policies. Many advances in water quality
   have led to unquestionable improvements in ecosystem quality, habitat
   and biodiversity, and water infrastructure. Still, Great Lakes
   scientists have issued compelling evidence that the ecological health of
   the basin ecosystem is at significant risk. In 2012, the Agreement will
   be revised for the first time in 25 years. The degree of engagement in a
   future Agreement, including scope, issues of significant importance,
   governance and collaboration will hinge on a thorough analytical
   process, so far seemingly absent, coupled with real consultation, so far
   marginally evident. Renegotiating the Agreement to generate a
   revitalized and sustainable future mandates that science inform
   contemporary public policy, and that inclusive discourse and public
   engagement be integral through the process. Many of these steps are
   still absent, and the analysis presented here strongly suggests that the
   constituents of the Great Lakes regime voice their views critically,
   emphatically, and often. If the negotiators listen, we can collectively
   make the Lakes Great.}},
