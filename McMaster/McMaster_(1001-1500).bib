Abstract = {{A reversibly dispersible/collectable metal-organic framework (MOF)
   system has been developed. The MOF particles were modified by grafting
   the thermally switchable copolymers of 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl
   methacrylate and oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate through a
   surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP)
   approach. The resulted MOF materials preserved their original framework
   structure and could be readily dispersed in water at room temperature to
   form stable dispersions. The dispersed MOF particles could also be
   recollected by heating the dispersions to above the lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST) of the grafted copolymer. The dispersion and
   collection processes were reversible.}},

Abstract = {{High-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus (BE) poses increased
   risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. To date, early detection
   and treatment of HGD regions are still challenging due to the sampling
   error from tissue biopsy and relocation error during the treatment after
   histopathological analysis. In this study, CP-A (metaplasia) and CP-B
   (HGD) cell lines were used to investigate the ``seek-and-treat{''}
   potential using 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX).
   The photodynamic therapy photosensitizer then provides both a phototoxic
   effect and additional image contrast for automatic detection and
   real-time laser treatment. Complementary to our studies on automatic
   classification, this work focused on characterizing subcellular
   irradiation and the potential phototoxicity on both metaplasia and HGD.
   The treatment results showed that the HGD cells are less viable than
   metaplastic cells due to more PpIX production at earlier times. Also,
   due to mitochondrial localization of PpIX, a better killing effect was
   achieved by involving mitochondria or whole cells compared with just
   nucleus irradiation in the detected region. With the additional toxicity
   given by PpIX and potential morphological/textural differences for
   pattern recognition, this cellular platform serves as a platform to
   further investigate real-time ``seek-and-treat{''} strategies in
   three-dimensional models for improving early detection and treatment of

Abstract = {{Crosstalk between the left-eye and right-eye images is one of the main
   artifacts affecting the visual quality of stereoscopic liquid crystal
   display (LCD) systems. In this paper, a novel technique, called Optimal
   Backlight Modulation (OBM), is proposed to reduce crosstalk by taking
   the advantage of newly emerged light-emitting diode (LED) backlight
   panel. Unlike most existing techniques which solely aim at eliminating
   the effect of crosstalk, ignoring image brightness and contrast, OBM
   strikes a better balance by maximizing the output luminance while
   confining the crosstalk within a given level. A simple closed-form
   approximation of the optimization problem can be easily employed and
   solved in real time on LCD control hardware. Simulation results show
   that the proposed OBM algorithm provides the same or higher luminance
   while reducing the crosstalk by 60\% compared with the other tested
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the parameter optimization and H-infinity control problem
   of active suspensions equipped in in-wheel motor driven electric ground
   vehicles are investigated. In order to better isolate the force
   transmitted to motor bearing, dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) is
   installed in the active suspension. Parameters of the vibration
   isolation modules are also optimized in order to achieve better
   suspension performances. As the human body is much sensitive to
   vibrations between 4 and 8 Hz, a finite-frequency state-feedback
   H-infinity controller is designed to achieve the targeted disturbance
   attenuation in the concerned frequency range while other performances
   such as road holding capability and small suspension deflection are also
   maintained. The performance of the proposed finite-frequency H-infinity
   controller is compared with that of an entire frequency one, simulation
   results prove the effectiveness of the proposed control method. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Quantifying flow from phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) data requires that the
   vessels of interest be segmented. The estimate of the vessel area will
   dictate the type and magnitude of the error sources that affect the flow
   measurement. These sources of errors are well understood, and
   mathematical expressions have been derived for them in previous work.
   However, these expressions contain many parameters that render them
   difficult to use for making practical error estimates. In this work,
   some realistic assumptions were made that allow for the simplification
   of such expressions in order to make them more useful. These simplified
   expressions were then used to numerically simulate the effect of
   segmentation accuracy and provide some criteria that if met, would keep
   errors in flow quantification below 10\% or 5\%. Four different
   segmentation methods were used on simulated and phantom MRA data to
   verify the theoretical results. Numerical simulations showed that
   including partial volumed edge pixels in vessel segmentation provides
   less error than missing them. This was verified with MRA simulations, as
   the best performing segmentation method generally included such pixels.
   Further, it was found that to obtain a flow error of less than 10\%
   (5\%), the vessel should be at least 4 (5) pixels in diameter, have an
   SNR of at least 10:1 and have a peak velocity to saturation cut-off
   velocity ratio of at least 5:3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{ObjectiveDecline in cognitive function begins by the 40s, and may be
   related to future dementia risk. We used data from a
   community-representative study to determine whether there are
   age-related differences in simple cognitive and gait tests by the 40s,
   and whether these differences were associated with covert
   cerebrovascular disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   MethodsBetween 2010 and 2012, 803 participants aged 40 to 75 years in
   the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study, recruited from
   prespecified postal code regions centered on 4 Canadian cities,
   underwent brain MRI and simple tests of cognition and gait as part of a
   substudy (PURE-MIND).
   ResultsMean age was 588 years. Linear decreases in performance on the
   Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST),
   and Timed Up and Go test of gait were seen with each age decade from the
   40s to the 70s. Silent brain infarcts were observed in 3\% of 40- to
   49-year-olds, with increasing prevalence up to 18.9\% in 70-year-olds.
   Silent brain infarcts were associated with slower timed gait and lower
   volume of supratentorial white matter. Higher volume of supratentorial
   MRI white matter hyperintensity was associated with slower timed gait
   and worse performance on DSST, and lower volumes of the supratentorial
   cortex and white matter, and cerebellum.

   cognitive and gait performance and brain atrophy are manifest in some
   clinically asymptomatic persons as early as the 5th decade of life. Ann

Pages = {{146-159}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the filiform-like corrosion behavior of Mg alloy AZ31B
   was characterized using analytical microanalysis. Recent electrochemical
   measurements have shown that the corrosion filaments on AZ31B support
   enhanced cathodic reaction kinetics, but there has been little strong
   physical evidence published to explain this behavior. Hence, the
   specific aim of the investigation was to contribute to the understanding
   of the physical origin of the ``cathodic activation{''} of the corrosion
   filaments. Highlights of this investigation include the presence of
   through-thickness cracks within the corrosion filaments, Al-Mn particles
   (identified as Al11Mn4 with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
   quantification) in the preexisting films and filament corrosion
   products, and a significant enrichment of Zn at the corrosion
   filament/metal interface after aging of the filament. Diffraction
   patterns of the corrosion filaments indicated they were composed of
   nanocrystalline magnesium oxide (MgO), which was suggested as the
   product of the direct reaction of Mg and H2O responsible for rapid H-2
   evolution at the propagating corrosion front of the filaments.}},

Title = {{Modeling twinning and detwinning behavior of Mg alloy ZK60A during
   monotonic and cyclic loading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{61-84}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A recently developed crystal plasticity model for describing twinning
   and detwinning behavior is employed to simulate the behavior of extruded
   Mg alloy, ZK60A. Notably, accounting for the initial texture and
   calibrating the model using tension and compression along one direction
   permits prediction of the strength anisotropy, strength asymmetry, and
   strain hardening behavior along other directions, for cases for which
   the contribution of twinning is large, small and intermediate. The model
   discriminates between the stress required to initiate twinning and that
   required to grow (thicken) previously existing twins. This enables the
   model to simulate the unusual stress-strain hysteresis behavior during
   twinning (e.g., sharp yielding behavior) as well as that of detwinning
   (characterized by quite gradual yielding). The strain hardening plateau
   which occurs during both twinning and detwinning are captured, as are
   the rapid hardening induced by the exhaustion of these mechanisms.
   Finally, the modeling is validated using previously published in-situ
   neutron diffraction data. The predicted diffracted intensity evolution,
   which is indicative of the volume fraction of twinning compares well
   with the experimental data. For the first time, the lattice strain
   evolutions during cyclic loading (involving twinning and detwinning) of
   an extruded magnesium alloy are predicted. Most features of the
   experimentally observed internal strain evolution are well-described. In
   particular, the inflections which may be associated with the initiation
   of particular deformation mechanisms: basal and non-basal slips, as well
   as deformation twinning are predicted. Careful analysis of the lattice
   strains reveals greater than expected load sharing by the precipitate
   phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of three color single emissive layer white
   phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs), with different

   1,1-bis{[}(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC), was analyzed. It
   is found that the luminous efficiency of white PHOLEDs is closely
   related to the triplet exciton energy level in the hole transporting
   layer (HTL). White PHOLEDs with a TAPC as HTL, having the highest
   triplet exciton energy level amongst the three different hole
   transporting materials, yielded external quantum efficiency of 25.5\% at
   4.5 V and a high luminous efficiency of 51 cd/A at 4.5 V with CIE color
   coordinates of (0.34, 0.39) at 10 V. The results reveal that the
   effective confinement of triplet excitons in white PHOLEDs with a high
   triplet exciton energy level HTL (TAPC) allows improving the luminous
   efficiency, as compared to the devices made with NPB and TCTA.
   Additionally, we demonstrated possibility for the loss of intensity in
   EL spectra of the white PHOLED devices with NPB and TCTA as HTL compared
   to that of the device with TAPC as HTL. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The potential of ensemble meteorological forecasts in improving ensemble
   spring peak flow prediction up to 14 days ahead is investigated for the
   Saguenay-Lac-Saint Jean watershed located in northeastern Canada.
   Large-scale ensemble meteorological forecasts (precipitation and
   temperature) generated by the National Center for Environmental
   Prediction's (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) are bias corrected for
   two meteorological stations in the watershed. The bias corrected NCEP
   ensemble meteorological forecast data are used as input in the
   hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalan-avdelning (HBV) to
   simulate ensemble reservoir inflows and Serpent River flows up to 14
   days ahead. The ensemble inflow and flow forecasts are compared with
   climatology as well as with the case in which only observed historical
   data are used for spring peak flow forecasting. The study results show
   that there is a significant improvement for the longer forecast range in
   the model forecast performance when bias-corrected NCEP forecast data
   are used. The improvement for forecasts for the spring season as well as
   for the entire year is revealed by Brier and rank probability skill

   Concrete Block Shear Walls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{There is a need to develop a reinforced masonry (RM) seismic performance
   database (SPD) of experimental results in order to facilitate adoption
   of RM seismic force-resisting systems (SFRS) in the next generation of
   performance-based seismic design (PBSD) codes. As a contribution to this
   SPD, and within a larger ongoing research program, this paper reports on
   recent shake table tests performed on lightly reinforced masonry shear
   walls. The test walls covered a range of design parameters to facilitate
   benchmarking, further performance investigation, and calibration of
   numerical models as well as future development of fragility curves
   within the context of PBSD. The design parameters of the walls were
   selected to meet the requirements of the lightly reinforced conventional
   construction category. This particular RM wall category is not permitted
   in moderate and high seismic zones in the Canada based on Canadian
   masonry design code. Within the context of PBSD, the wall seismic
   performances, in terms of damage levels observed during the shake table
   tests, were generally acceptable considering the levels of earthquake
   record intensities to which the walls were subjected. The walls did not
   experience any damage during low amplitude tests, corresponding to
   frequent minor earthquake events, incurred repairable damage under
   higher level tests, and maintained their integrity under the highest
   level record selected to mimic the seismic hazard levels of the highest
   seismicity zones in Canada. The tests also demonstrated the capability
   of lightly reinforced masonry shear walls to adequately dissipate energy
   through nonlinear flexural response. The test results are expected to
   contribute to the growing SPD of RM SFRS components, and to facilitate a
   better understanding of the behavior and performance of lightly
   reinforced masonry walls under realistic seismic loads. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Inclusion type and content in steel is critical in steelmaking,
   affecting both productivity through clogging, and downstream physical
   properties of the steel. They are normally removed from steel by
   reacting with a slag (liquid oxide) phase. For efficient inclusion
   removal, the inclusions must attach/bond with this liquid phase. The
   strength of the attachment can be in part characterized by the
   wettability of the liquid oxide on the inclusions. In this study, the
   dynamic wetting of liquid oxides of the CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-MgO system on a
   solid spinel (MgAl2O4) substrate with low porosity of 1.9 pct was
   measured at 1773 K (1500 degrees C) using a modified sessile drop
   technique. The dynamic contact angle between the liquid and solid spinel
   was determined for different CaO/Al2O3 mass percent ratios ranging from
   0.98 to 1.55. Characteristic curves of wettability (theta) vs time
   showed a rapid decrease in wetting in the first 10 seconds tending to a
   plateau value at extended times. A mathematical model for spreading
   behavior of liquid oxides by Choi and Lee was adopted and shown to
   provide a reasonable representation of the spreading behavior with time.
   The chemical interaction at the interface between spinel (MgAl2O4) and
   slag was analyzed by carrying out detailed thermodynamic evaluation and
   characterization using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive
   spectroscopy. There is evidence of liquid penetrating the substrate via
   pores and along grain boundaries, forming a penetration layer in the
   substrate. The depth of the penetration layer was found to be a function
   of substrate porosity and sample cooling rate. It decreased from similar
   to 350 mu m for 6.7 pct-porous substrate to similar to 190 mu m for
   substrate with porosity of 1.9 pct and from similar to 190 mu m to
   similar to 50 mu m for a slow-cooled liquid oxide-spinel substrate
   sample in the furnace to a rapidly cooled liquid cooled-spinel substrate
   sample, respectively.}},

   Comparing to previous experimental results, we rationalize the
   observations that an artificial alteration of the surface termination,
   through the addition of aluminum on the substrate surface, will affect
   rotational domain alignment. Our findings show that Al adatoms will
   occupy sites on the sapphire surface that otherwise would be beneficial

Abstract = {{A novel methodology is developed here to measure wall mass transfer
   rates non-destructively using Xray computed tomography (CT). The mass
   transfer was measured using a gypsum lined 203 mm diameter straight pipe
   section using a dissolving wall method to water. The measurements were
   performed at a Reynolds number of 86,000 and Schmidt number of 1200. The
   local wear of the internal surface is obtained from the CT scans by
   aligning and analyzing the cross-sectional scanned images of the test
   section before and after the experiment. The full surface wear contours
   and the corresponding mass transfer rates are obtained by a
   three-dimensional reconstruction of the entire test section. The
   measurements from the CT scans are compared to results obtained from
   ultrasonic (UT) measurements of the wall thickness and internal surface
   measurements using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) and digital
   laser scans. The results from the CT scan methodology are in good
   agreement with the other methods, indicating that the method is robust
   and can be used to obtain the local mass transfer and roughness over the
   entire surface. Thus, it can be used as a principal method to
   investigate mass transfer non-intrusively in complex piping geometries.

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation to study the effect of
   electrohydrodynamics (EHD) on the thermal performance of a latent heat
   thermal storage cell during melting of paraffin wax was performed. The
   test section was designed to eliminate natural convection and to ensure
   conduction dominated melting environment to isolate the influence of the
   electric field. The results showed that by applying a (-8 kV) voltage
   potential across the storage module, the time required to melt 7 mm
   thickness of the PCM can be reduced by 40\% when compared to 0 kV case.
   This heat transfer enhancement effect can be attributed to an EHD
   induced ``solid extraction{''} phenomenon. This phenomenon was observed
   using flow visualization where solid dendrites within the mushy zone
   were extracted from the mushy zone into the liquid bulk towards regions

Abstract = {{Two fundamental principles of the mode-matching method-mode
   orthogonality and tangential field continuity conditions have been
   revisited in depth. With a finite number of modes employed in the
   conventional method, the tangential field continuity condition at the
   waveguide-discontinuity interface fails leading to a field mismatch
   error. We propose an alternate, superior mode-matching method
   implemented by reconstruction of the auxiliary coefficient matrix,
   rather than by applying the abovementioned continuity and orthogonality.
   Detailed transfer-matrix equations have been derived for the
   finite-mode-number case. We showed that the improved mode-matching
   method yields a smaller field mismatch error under equal computational
   effort. Examples of bent and faceted waveguide structure have been
   investigated and the numerical simulation results demonstrated that the
   newly proposed method has the merits of simple implementation, high
   accuracy, and high computational efficiency for application in
   high-index-contrast photonic integrated circuits.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{439}},
Pages = {{139-148}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The effect of surfactants on the Properties of Pickering emulsion
   stabilized by cellulose nanomystals (CNCs) was investigated.
   Electrophoretic mobility, interfacial tension, confocal microscopy and
   three-phase contact angle measurements were used to elucidate the
   interactions between anionic CNCs and cationic alkyl ammonium
   surfactants didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DMAB) and
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Both surfactants were found to
   adsorb onto CNCs with concentration-dependent morphology. At low
   concentrations, individual surfactant molecules adsorbed with alkyl
   tails pointing outward leading to hydrophobic CNCs. At higher
   concentrations, above the surfactant's apparent critical micelle
   concentration, surfactant aggregate morphologies on CNCs were inferred
   and the hydrophobicity of CNCs decreased. DMAB, which has two alkyl
   tails, rendered the CNCs more hydrophobic than CTAB which has only a
   single alkyl tail, at all surfactant concentrations. The change in CNC
   wettability from surfactant adsorption was directly linked to emulsion
   properties; adding surfactant increased the emulsion stability,
   decreased the droplet size, and controlled the internal phase of CNC
   Pickering emulsions. More specifically, a double transitional phase
   inversion, from oil-in-water to water-in-oil and back to oil-in-water,
   was observed for emulsions with CNCs and increasing amounts of DMAB (the
   more hydrophobic surfactant). With CNCs and CTAB, no phase inversion was
   induced. This work represents the first report of CNC Pickering
   emulsions with surfactants as well as the first CNC Pickering emulsions,
   that can be Abase inverted. The ability to surface modify CNCs in situ
   and tailor emulsions by adding surfactants may extend the potential of
   CNCs to new liquid formulations and extruded/spray-dried materials. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of estimating in situ the force output

   by simply measuring strains on the damper housing and the end-spacer of
   the damper. Subsequently, the paper discusses various practical issues

   strain gauges, temperature effects, and the efficiency of commercially
   available velocity transducers. The experimental program concludes that
   the proposed technology is promising for monitoring in situ the force
   output of fluid dampers and detecting possible loss of their energy

Title = {{Confined-space synthesis of single crystal TiO2 nanowires in atmospheric
   vessel at low temperature: a generalized approach}},
Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Extensive efforts have been devoted to develop innovative synthesis
   strategies for nanomaterials in order to exploit the true potential of
   nanotechnology. However, most approaches require high temperature or
   high pressure to favor crystallization. Here we highlight an
   unconventional approach for the confined-space synthesis of the single
   crystal TiO2 nanowires in the atmospheric vessel at low temperature by
   cleverly manipulating the unique physical properties of straight-chain
   saturated fatty acids. Our method also applys to icosane due to its
   straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon structure and similar physical
   properties to the saturated fatty acids. Interestingly, we also found
   that the unsaturated fatty acids can facilitate the crystal growth, but
   their bent chains lead to the formation of TiO2 particle aggregates. In
   addition, we demonstrate the growth of TiO2 nanowires on arbitrary
   substrates, which are of great importance for their wider applications.
   We thus anticipate our presented method to be a possible starting point
   for non-classical crystallization strategies and be easily adapted for
   the fabrication of all other inorganic materials.}},

   Evolutions of absorption peaks in APE MgO:LiNbO3 crystals were recorded
   and analyzed. Comparing with none-doped APE LiNbO3 crystals, a different
   phase transition behavior was found during thermal annealing. A
   periodically poled MgO:LiNbO3 slab waveguide was prepared using
   identical procedures, and the second harmonic generation (SHG) signals
   were measured. Comparing the obtained SHG results with the infrared
   spectra, relationships between the phase transitions and the recovery of
   second-order nonlinear coefficients during thermal annealing were
   investigated. Finally, a method for optimizing the performance of
   MgO:LiNbO3 waveguides was proposed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an offset-free model predictive control (OF-MPC)
   design for energy-efficient control of a heat pump. A model developed
   from a combination of first-principles and empirical components with
   parameters estimated using real heat pump data is used as a test bed for
   the implementation of the MPC design. Open-loop system dynamics are
   examined first to design and implement the appropriate control
   structure. Next, a linear model is identified using appropriate step
   test simulations on the detailed heat pump model. Subsequently, a model
   predictive controller formulation, which eliminates the tradeoff between
   tracking and energy objectives, is designed. The MPC includes an
   augmented model (including disturbance states) and an associated
   Luenberger observer to estimate the disturbance (plant-model mismatch at
   steady state). Simulation results subject to realistic disturbances and
   measurement noise demonstrate that energy savings can be achieved
   (anywhere between 1.7\% and 1.9\%), while preserving a safer operating
   window (a 43\% improvement, with respect to a safe operation measure)
   with the proposed OF-MPC design that achieves tighter tracking
   regulation (improvement of 40\% and above), compared to a traditional
   control approach.}},

   the crystal phase, yielding a switch with two self-sustaining states.
   This phase change material was selected for its very low absorption loss
   at the operation wavelength, along with its electro-refraction Delta n
   similar to 0.6. All switches are cascadeable into N x M devices. The
   free-space prism-shaped structures use III-V prism material to match the

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{We extend the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of atomically rough bcc-liquid
   interfaces {[}Wu et al., Phys. Rev. B 73, 094101 (2006)] outside of
   equilibrium. We use this extension to derive an analytical expression
   for the kinetic coefficient, which is the proportionality constant
   mu((n) over cap) between the interface velocity along a direction (n)
   over cap normal to the interface and the interface undercooling. The
   kinetic coefficient is expressed as a spatial integral along the normal
   direction of a sum of gradient square terms corresponding to different
   nonlinear density wave profiles. Anisotropy arises naturally from the
   dependence of those profiles on the angles between the principal
   reciprocal lattice vectors (K) over right arrow (i) and (n) over cap.
   Values of the kinetic coefficient for the (100), (110), and (111)
   interfaces are compared quantitatively to the prediction of linear
   Mikheev-Chernov (MC) theory {[}J. Cryst. Growth 112, 591 (1991)] and
   previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of crystallization
   kinetics for a classical model of Fe. Additional MD simulations are
   carried out here to compute the relaxation time of density waves in the
   liquid in order to make this comparison free of fit parameters. The GL
   theory predicts an expression for mu similar to the MC theory but yields
   a better agreement with MD simulations for both its magnitude and
   anisotropy due to a fully nonlinear description of density wave profiles
   across the solid-liquid interface. In particular, the overall magnitude
   of mu predicted by GL theory is an order of magnitude larger than
   predicted by the MC theory. GL theory is also used to derive an inverse
   relation between mu and the solid-liquid interfacial free energy. The
   general methodology used here to derive an expression for mu((n) over
   cap) also applies to amplitude equations derived from the
   phase-field-crystal model, which only differ from GL theory by the
   choice of cubic and higher order nonlinearities in the free-energy
   density.}},

Title = {{Magnetoconductance signatures of subband structure in semiconductor
   nanowires}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{The radial confining potential in a semiconductor nanowire plays a key
   role in determining its quantum transport properties. Previous reports
   have shown that an axial magnetic field induces flux-periodic
   conductance oscillations when the electronic states are confined to a
   shell. This effect is due to the coupling of orbital angular momentum to
   the magnetic flux. Here, we perform calculations of the energy level
   structure, and consequently the conductance, for more general cases
   ranging from a flat potential to strong surface band bending. The
   transverse states are not confined to a shell, but are distributed
   across the nanowire. It is found that, in general, the subband energy
   spectrum is aperiodic as a function of both gate voltage and magnetic
   field. In principle, this allows for precise identification of the
   occupied subbands from the magnetoconductance patterns of quasiballistic
   devices. The aperiodicity becomes more apparent as the potential
   flattens. A quantitative method is introduced for matching features in
   the conductance data to the subband structure resulting from a
   particular radial potential, where a functional form for the potential
   is used that depends on two free parameters. Finally, a short-channel
   InAs nanowire field-effect transistor device is measured at low
   temperature in search of conductance features that reveal the subband
   structure. Features are identified and shown to be consistent with three
   specific subbands. The experiment is analyzed in the context of the weak
   localization regime; however, we find that the subband effects predicted
   for ballistic transport should remain visible when backscattering
   dominates over interband scattering, as is expected for this device.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the demonstration of a new type of axial nanowire LED
   heterostructures, with the use of self-organized InGaN/AlGaN
   dot-in-a-wire core-shell nanowire arrays. The large bandgap AlGaN shell
   is spontaneously formed on the sidewall of the nanowire during the
   growth of AlGaN barrier of the quantum dot active region. As such,
   nonradiative surface recombination, that dominates the carrier dynamics
   of conventional axial nanowire LED structures, can be largely
   eliminated, leading to significantly increased carrier lifetime from
   similar to 0.3 ns to 4.5 ns. The luminescence emission is also enhanced
   by orders of magnitude. Moreover, the p-doped AlGaN barrier layers can
   function as distributed electron blocking layers (EBLs), which is found
   to be more effective in reducing electron overflow, compared to the
   conventional AlGaN EBL. The device displays strong white-light emission,
   with a color rendering index of similar to 95. An output power of >5 mW
   is measured for a 1 mm 3 1 mm device, which is more than 500 times
   stronger than the conventional InGaN axial nanowire LEDs without AlGaN
   distributed EBLs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A substantial proportion of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
   risk resides in de novo germline and rare inherited genetic variation.
   In particular, rare copy number variation (CNV) contributes to ASD risk
   in up to 10\% of ASD subjects. Despite the striking degree of genetic
   heterogeneity, case-control studies have detected specific burden of
   rare disruptive CNV for neuronal and neurodevelopmental pathways. Here,
   we used machine learning methods to classify ASD subjects and controls,
   based on rare CNV data and comprehensive gene annotations. We
   investigated performance of different methods and estimated the
   percentage of ASD subjects that could be reliably classified based on
   presumed etiologic CNV they carry.
   Results: We analyzed 1,892 Caucasian ASD subjects and 2,342 matched
   controls. Rare CNVs (frequency 1\% or less) were detected using Illumina
   1M and 1M-Duo BeadChips. Conditional Inference Forest (CF) typically
   performed as well as or better than other classification methods. We
   found a maximum AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.533 when considering
   all ASD subjects with rare genic CNVs, corresponding to 7.9\% correctly
   classified ASD subjects and less than 3\% incorrectly classified
   controls; performance was significantly higher when considering only
   subjects harboring de novo or pathogenic CNVs. We also found rare losses
   to be more predictive than gains and that curated neurally-relevant
   annotations (brain expression, synaptic components and
   neurodevelopmental phenotypes) outperform Gene Ontology and
   pathway-based annotations.
   Conclusions: CF is an optimal classification approach for case-control
   rare CNV data and it can be used to prioritize subjects with variants
   potentially contributing to ASD risk not yet recognized. The
   neurally-relevant annotations used in this study could be successfully
   applied to rare CNV case-control data-sets for other neuropsychiatric
   disorders.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{A magnetization model of nanocrystalline materials incorporating
   intragrain anisotropies, intergrain interactions, and texture effects
   has been extended to include the thermal fluctuations. The method relies
   on the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory of magnetization
   dynamics and permits to study the magnetic properties of nanocrystalline
   materials at arbitrary temperature below the Currie temperature. The
   model has been used to determine the intergrain exchange constant and
   grain boundary anisotropy constant of nanocrystalline Ni at 100K and 298
   K. It is found that the thermal fluctuations suppress the strength of
   the intergrain exchange coupling and also reduce the grain boundary
   anisotropy. In comparison with its value at 2K, the interparticle
   exchange constant decreases by 16\% and 42\% and the grain boundary
   anisotropy constant decreases by 28\% and 40\% at 100K and 298 K,
   respectively. An application of the model to study the grain
   size-dependent magnetization indicates that when the thermal activation
   energy is comparable to the free energy of grains, the decrease in the
   grain size leads to the decrease in the magnetic permeability and
   saturation magnetization. The mechanism by which the grain size
   influences the magnetic properties of nc-Ni is discussed. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{This paper studies the path following control problem for four-wheel
   independently actuated (FWIA) autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) through
   integrated control of active front-wheel steering (AFS) and direct
   yaw-moment control (DYC). A modified composite nonlinear feedback (CNF)
   strategy is proposed to improve the transient performance and eliminate
   the steady-state errors in the path following control considering the
   tire force saturations, in the presence of the time-varying road
   curvature for the desired path. The path following is achieved through
   vehicle lateral and yaw control, i.e., the lateral velocity and yaw rate
   are simultaneously controlled to track their respective desired values,
   where the desired yaw rate is generated according to the path following
   demand. CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results indicate that the
   proposed CNF controller can effectively improve the transient response
   performance, inhibit the overshoots and eliminate the steady-state
   errors in path following within the tire forces saturation limits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the yaw control problem for in-wheel-motor (IWM)
   electric ground vehicles (EGVs) based on the differential steering in
   the presence of the complete failure of the active front-wheel steering.
   Differential steering is an emerging steering mechanism, generated from
   the differential torque between the left and right wheels in IWM EGVs.
   In case that the regular steering system is defective, differential
   steering can be utilized to act as the sole steering power, and thus
   avoid dangerous consequences for vehicles. For this purpose, a robust
   H-infinity output-feedback controller based on differential steering is
   designed to achieve yaw stabilization, considering the desired steering
   angle is uncertain and hard to obtain. The front steering angle is
   provided by the differential driving torque generated by independently
   actuated IWMs mounted in the front wheels. Parametric uncertainties for
   the cornering stiffnesses and the external disturbances are considered
   to make vehicle robust to different driving conditions. CarSim-Simulink
   joint simulation results based on a high-fidelity and full-car model
   have verified the effectiveness of the proposed controller to guarantee
   the equal handling and stability.}},

Abstract = {{We study sequential transmission of Gauss-Markov sources over erasure
   channels under a zero decoding delay constraint. A two-stage coding
   scheme which can be described as a hybrid between predictive coding with
   limited past and quantization \& binning is proposed. This scheme can
   achieve significant performance gains over baseline schemes in
   simulations involving i.i.d. erasure channels, and in certain regimes
   can attain performance close to a fundamental lower bound. We consider
   an information theoretic model for streaming that explains the weakness
   of baseline schemes (e.g., predictive coding, memoryless binning, etc.)
   and illustrates the advantage of our proposed hybrid scheme over these.
   Techniques from multi-terminal source coding are used to derive a new
   lower bound on the compression rate and identify cases when the hybrid
   coding scheme is close to optimal. We discuss qualitatively the
   interplay between the parameters of our information theoretic model and
   the statistical models used in simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the compress-and-forward scheme for an uplink
   cloud radio access network (C-RAN) model, where multi-antenna
   base-stations (BSs) are connected to a cloud computing based central
   processor (CP) via capacity-limited fronthaul links. The BSs perform
   Wyner-Ziv coding to compress and send the received signals to the CP;
   the CP performs either joint decoding of both the quantization codewords
   and the user messages at the same time, or the more practical successive
   decoding of the quantization codewords first, then the user messages.
   Under this setup, this paper makes progress toward the optimization of
   the fronthaul compression scheme by proving two results. First, it is
   shown that if the input distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, then
   under joint decoding, the optimal Wyner-Ziv quantization scheme for
   maximizing the achievable rate region is Gaussian. Second, for fixed
   Gaussian input, under a sum fronthaul capacity constraint and assuming
   Gaussian quantization, this paper shows that successive decoding and
   joint decoding achieve the same maximum sum rate. In this case, the
   optimization of Gaussian quantization noise covariance matrices for
   maximizing sum rate can be formulated as a convex optimization problem,
   therefore can be solved efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel initial rotor position estimation algorithm
   for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM) drives. First,
   the rotor position is determined based on the machine saliency using the
   flux equations in the stationary reference frame. Since the machine
   saliency performs two periods in one electrical cycle, there exists an
   ambiguity of 180 degrees in the estimation result. The location of the
   magnetic north pole is detected using a generalized polarity detection
   method. This method injects voltage pulses and compares the current
   response with the expected response using the d-axis differential
   inductance profile. An accurate nonlinear machine model is introduced
   for analysis and simulation of sensorless control in IPMSM drives. The
   model uses the machine flux as dynamic equation and the flux current
   relationship as output function avoiding approximations due to
   saturation. The initial position detection procedure is validated with
   this model using experimental current-flux data.}},

   decade. However, despite extensive research efforts, sub-meter location
   accuracy with low-cost infrastructure continues to be elusive. In this

   measurement units (IMU) and photodiode sensors on smartphones. Using a
   novel illumination peak detection algorithm, IDyLL augments IMU-based
   pedestrian dead reckoning with location fixes. We devise a robust
   particle filter framework to mitigate identity ambiguity due to the lack
   of communication capability of conventional luminaries and sensing
   errors. Experimental study using data collected from smartphones shows
   that IDyLL is able to achieve high localization accuracy at low costs.

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) are emerging as a
   promising solution for achieving an enhanced level of seismic resilience
   relative to traditional systems. In a CRSBF, selected columns are
   designed to uplift from the foundation in response to seismic loads,
   resulting in a reduction in lateral stiffness. This rocking action
   limits the maximum structural forces in a way that can avoid both
   residual deformations and also damage to main structural members. The
   response of a CRSBF can be controlled using a combination of
   post-tensioning and supplemental energy dissipation. This paper gives an
   overview of the behavior of CRSBFs before presenting three case studies
   of buildings that have been built in New Zealand recently. The paper
   introduces a New Zealand Design Guide for CRSBFs and also discusses some
   potential advantages and design considerations for CRSBFs in retrofit

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the optimal design of linear space codes for
   an indoor multiple input multiple output (MIMO) visible light
   communication (VLC) system with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, where
   we assume that the full knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is
   available at both the transmitter and the receiver. For such a system
   with on-orr-keying (OOK) modulation, an optimal closed-form linear space
   code that maximizes the minimum Euclidean distance for ML detection is
   attained for the scenario with two transmitters and multiple receivers.
   Our results reveal the fact that when the channel is good, the optimal
   code has either a diagonal or an anti-diagonal structure, and when the
   channel is bad, the optimal code is to diagonalize the channel matrix
   first, then, optimally distribute the total transmission power into each
   eigen-subchannel, and then, follow a repetition coding (RC) scheme.
   Computer simulations verify both the accuracy and the validity of our
   theoretical analysis, and show that our newly proposed linear space code
   provides significant error performance gains over currently available
   space modlution (SM) and RC in literature without CSI at the
   transmitter.}},

   is transformed equivalently into two subproblems, i.e., transmit power

Abstract = {{Bandlimited optical intensity channels, such as visible light
   communication (VLC) systems, require that all signals satisfy a
   bandwidth constraint as well as average and nonnegativity amplitude
   constraints. In this paper, a two-dimensional signal space for optical
   intensity channels is presented in which all signals are strictly
   bandlimited. A novel feature of this model is that the strict
   non-negativity constraint is relaxed and the signal space parameterizes
   the probability that the resulting output amplitude is negative. The
   motivation for this relaxation is that even though the optical intensity
   channel only supports non-negative amplitudes, if the likelihood of a
   negative amplitude excursion is small enough the impact of clipping or
   biasing on system performance will be negligible. For a given signal
   space, the probability that the output signal assumes a negative
   amplitude is rigorously upperbounded and also numerically found with a
   tractable and tight approximation. The uncoded power and spectral
   efficiencies are computed for two-dimensional hexagonal lattice
   constellations. For a given optical power, constellations developed with
   the new signal space have larger spectral efficiencies over M-PAM using
   the minimum bandwidth optical intensity Nyquist pulse.}},

   cycles, traditionally defined as velocity-time profiles serve as

Abstract = {{Power losses calculation is important in inverter design since it
   provides a reference for the inverter thermal management. For MOSFET
   based inverters, many of MOSFET datasheets do not provide switching
   power losses directly. In order to estimate MOSFET switching power
   losses, MOSFET switching time has to be estimated firstly. The purpose
   of this paper is to develop an improved method for MOSFET voltage
   rise-time and fall-time estimation in switching power loss calculation.
   To obtain accurate MOSFET switching power losses, rise-time and
   fall-time of voltage should be estimated as accurately as possible. Two
   methods are introduced here, an existing method and a proposed method. A
   certain MOSFET product has been used for the implementation and
   comparison of these two methods. In the end, the calculated results are
   verified by experiments. Double pulse test is utilized for the
   experimental verification. It is proved that the estimation accuracy is
   improved by the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of the number of phases in an
   interleaved dc-dc boost converter. Indeed, in high power applications
   where more than hundreds of amperes are requested, the use of
   interleaving topologies can yield to significant advantages as they
   permit to divide the current into several phases. This ultimately
   reduces the current rating of each power inductor and switch, and
   provides benefits in terms of current and voltage ripple, if a proper
   control scheme is used. In this paper, an investigation of the impact of
   the number of phases in interleaved dc-dc boost converter topology is
   proposed. Several criteria are considered such as the cost and volume of
   switches, efficiency, input current ripple, and power inductor volume to
   identify the optimal topology for a given application. Several
   comparison results have been established to determine the optimal number
   of phases requested for the given converter specifications.}},

Abstract = {{Although the joint source and channel coding (JSCC) systems constructed
   from double protograph low-density parity-check (DP\_LDPC) codes has
   been demonstrated to possess good performance, especially when they are
   applied into the transmission of radiography images, where the
   frameworks of both transmitter and receiver still need to be further
   optimised for the sake of achieving bit error rate (BER) performance
   under 1 0 6 over wireless transmission environment. This paper focuses
   on the perspective of transmitting terminal to investigate what factors
   will affect the performance of DP\_LDPC schemes so that the new
   transmitting models can be further designed. Specifically, this paper
   mainly concentrates on the sensitivity of DP\_LDPC scheme to source
   statistics. The simulation results show that the entropy of source
   information is a dominate factor for sources with low entropy while the
   correlated side information plays a vital role in sources with large
   entropy, which provides explicit directions for further JSCC coding

   constraints on the power transmitted by each antenna and a total
   transmitted power constraint. The proposed algorithm exploits a recently

   That approximation results in a problem formulation that can be
   efficiently solved by adapting existing low-computational-cost
   algorithms for scenarios with perfect CSI and per-antenna power
   constraints. Simulation results show that robust designs with a uniform

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a low-complexity scheme for the integration of

   an LED luminary, a simple all-analog PLC/VLC amplify-and-forward (AF)
   module is described. The incoming PLC signals, which occupy a band of
   2-28 MHz, are frequency down-shifted prior to transmission to increase
   the usable bandwidth of the LEDs. The required DC bias is then added to
   make the signals compatible with intensity modulation/direct detection
   (IM/DD). In addition to DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM), spatial
   optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) is applied to PLC/VLC integration. In SO-OFDM,
   the LEDs are divided into groups, and each group of LEDs is modulated by
   a different filtered OFDM signal. The results show that frequency
   down-conversion of the PLC spectrum prior to forwarding provides an
   improvement in capacity, while SO-OFDM provides a peak-to-average power
   ratio (PAPR) reduction which translates into improved capacity when the
   VLC link is operating in the high signal-to-noise ratio (high-SNR)
   regime.}},

   on the incident angle of illumination and optical gain of the
   concentrator have been analyzed in this manuscript. Simulation of the
   performance parameters of the bifacial module has been accomplished to
   estimate the average electrical output from summer to winter solstice.
   It has been possible to obtain more than 180 \% enhancement in I-sc, 250
   \% in P-m, and 35 \% in eta from the rear surface of the module when

   a flow loop by flowing water through the test section. The topography of
   the unworn and the worn inner surface was quantified using
   non-destructive X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The two scanned
   surfaces were aligned to a common coordinate system using commercial
   software and in-house routines. The local mass transfer rate was
   obtained from the local change in radius over the flow time. Two regions
   of high mass transfer were present: (i) along the intrados of the first
   bend near the inlet and (ii) at the exit of the extrados of the first
   bend that extends to the intrados of the second bend. The latter was the
   region of highest mass transfer in the S-bend.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell gas turbine hybrid
   system (SOFC/GT) from both open and closed loop transients in response
   to sudden changes in fuel composition was experimentally investigated. A
   pilot-scale (200kW - 700kW) hybrid facility available at the U.S.
   Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory was used to
   perform the experiments using a combination of numerical models and
   actual equipment.
   In the open loop configuration, the turbine speed was driven by the
   thermal effluent fed into the gas turbine system, where the thermal
   effluent was determined by the feedforward fuel cell control system.
   However, in the closed loop configuration, a load-based speed control
   system was used to maintain the turbine speed constant at 40,500rpm by
   adjusting the load on the turbine, in addition to the implementation of
   the fuel cell system control.
   The open loop transient response showed that the impacts of fuel
   composition changes on key process variables, such as fuel cell thermal
   effluent, turbine speed and cathode feed stream conditions in the
   SOFC/GT systems were propagated over the course of the test, except for
   the cathode inlet temperature. The trajectories of the aforementioned
   variables are discussed in this paper to better understand the resulting
   mitigation/propagation behaviors. This will help lead to the development
   of novel control strategies to mitigate the negative impacts experienced
   during fuel composition transients of SOFC/GT systems.}},

Abstract = {{Switched Reluctance Motors are becoming increasingly popular in the
   automotive industry for their capability for high-speed operation, low
   manufacturing cost and relatively simple and robust design. Like other
   electric machines, SRM requires a thermal management system to dissipate
   the excessive thermal energy generated during use. By utilizing advanced
   materials, it is possible to develop an axial cooling system for SRM.
   This paper discusses the role of axial cooling and the development of
   improved materials and their contribution to the axial cooling
   application.}},

Abstract = {{A linear precoding scheme is developed for unbounded MIMO downlink
   networks with quasi-static channels that have a hexagonal cell
   architecture. In the scheme developed herein, the equivalent channel
   model is structured to be decomposable, and the linear precoders at the
   base stations are designed to be decomposable as well. The proposed
   scheme is based the principles of fractional spatial reuse precoding.
   Spatial reuse precoding (SRP) is a precoding scheme that exploits the
   fact that interfering sources that employ the same structured precoder
   arrive in the same subspace, regardless of the particular channel
   matrices between the interfering sources and the receiver. The proposed
   scheme is fractional in the sense that each cell is partitioned and
   different precoders, with different power levels, are assigned in each
   partition. The proposed fractional SRP scheme enables the elimination of
   the dominant sources of interference without requiring cooperation
   between base stations.}},

   under a transmitted power constraint. By approximating the outage
   constraint by a zero-outage region, employing a semidefinite relaxation,
   and applying an extension of the S-Lemma, the problem is converted into

Abstract = {{One of the challenges of utilizing soft sensors is that their prediction
   accuracy deteriorates with time due to multiple factors, including
   changes in operating conditions. Once soft sensors are designed, a
   mechanism to maintain or update these models is highly desirable in
   industry. This paper proposes an index that can monitor the prediction
   performance of soft sensor models and provide guidance about when to
   update these models. In the proposed approach, a Kalman filter based
   model mismatch index is developed to monitor time prediction performance
   of soft sensors with the support of traditional process monitoring
   indexes, T-2 and SPE. Then, the soft, sensor model can be updated
   through partial least squares (PLS) regression by using samples from the
   off-line training set and new process conditions. The proposed online
   update method is applied to an industrial process case study and the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing with
   traditional recursive partial least squares (RPLS). (C) 2015, IFAC

Abstract = {{Due to ever-challenging global marker, conditions, plant economic
   optimization is becoming more critical. Recent advances have transformed
   the traditional steady-state real-time optimization (RTO) system of
   plant economic optimization to dynamic real-time optimization (DRTO)
   based on a dynamic prediction model. DRTO strategies that have been
   proposed perform economic optimization in an open-loop fashion without
   raking into account the presence of the plant control system. In this
   work, we propose a bilevel programming formulation for DRTO that
   includes effects of the closed-loop dynamics of an underlying
   constrained model predictive controller (MPC). The bilevel program is
   subsequently reformulated and solved as a single-level mathematical
   program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). We investigate the
   economics and control performance of the proposed strategy under varying
   MPC controller design parameters, and compare them to open-loop DRTO and
   rigorous multilevel closed-loop DRTO approaches. (C) 2015, IFAC

Abstract = {{Fluidelastic instability is generally regarded as the most severe type
   of flow excitation mechanism. When this mechanism prevails, it could
   cause serious damage to tube arrays in a very short period of time. This
   mechanism is characterized by a critical flow velocity beyond which the
   tubes undergo unstable oscillations. Recently, a number of experimental
   investigations showed that it is possible to have instability in the
   streamwise direction; previously, it was believed that fluidelastic
   instability was only a concern in the direction transverse to the flow.
   The purpose of this study is to characterize the flow in the channels
   surrounding a vibrating tube in a normal triangular bundle with P/d =
   1.5. The tube is oscillating in the stream wise direction with a
   constant amplitude. Numerical simulations were conducted by solving the
   unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (uRANS) cast in
   Arbitrary LagrangianEulerian (ALE) form. The unsteady flow perturbation
   is estimated along the flow channel. The pressure perturbation is used
   to compute the streamwise unsteady force coefficients in the context of
   Chen's model. The perturbation phase and decay are extracted and
   utilized in the framework of the Lever \& Weaver model to study the
   stability of tube bundles due to tube motion in the streamwise
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{If the main steam line from a nuclear steam generator were to break, the
   water in the steam generator would rapidly flash off in what is called a
   blowdown. Such an event could produce significant loading on the steam
   generator tubes, which if fractured, could lead to a loss of radioactive
   materials from containment. Thus, knowing the tube loading during such
   an event is an important input for safe design. This paper presents the
   results of an experimental laboratory study of the transient tube
   loading during a simulated blowdown. The working fluid was R-134a and
   the sectional tube model was a normal triangular array with a pitch
   ratio of 1.36. Tests were conducted with various levels of liquid R-134a
   and various numbers of tube rows. The transient tube loading is
   explained in terms of the associated flow physics and the maximum load
   is compared with existing models for tube loading obtained under steady
   flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Car tracking algorithms are important for a number of applications,
   including self-driving cars and vehicle safety systems. The
   probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm, in conjunction with

   studied, specifically in the aero-tracking applications. This paper
   studies single targets while performing maneuvers in the presence of
   clutter, which is a common scenario for road vehicle tracking
   applications. The relatively new smooth variable structure filter (SVSF)
   is demonstrated to be robust and stable filtering strategy under the
   presence of modeling uncertainties. In this paper, SVSF based PDA
   technique is combined with IMM method. The new method, referred to as
   IMM-PDA-SVSF is simulated under several possible car motion scenarios.
   Also, the algorithm is tested on a real experimental data acquired by

Abstract = {{Multifocus image fusion is an important research area in image
   processing and machine vision applications. Due to use of optical
   lenses, captured images are not usually focused everywhere in the image.
   Therefore objects near the focal range have evident details while other
   objects appear blurry. Multifocus image fusion algorithm takes several
   images with different focal ranges and combines them to produce an image
   that is focused everywhere. To identify focused regions in each of input
   images, generally spatial domain and transform domain methods are used.
   These methods usually suffer from artifacts such as blockiness or
   ringing. In this paper we propose a new criteria to determine focused
   pixels in an image. We find the points that have the same intensities in
   input images and segment the input images based on them. Subsequently we
   calculate surface area of pixels inside every segment based on intensity
   variations over rows and columns. Segment with more surface area of
   input images selected as the focus segment. Experimental results reveal
   the superiority of our method in comparison to compared algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In solving the inverse problem of haze removal, the most commonly used
   prior in the literature is perhaps that of dark channel, which assumes
   that at least one pixel in a small patch has a zero or near zero
   intensity level in one of the RGB color channels. However, this
   assumption is not physically based; it can be significantly off from the
   reality because most colors in outdoor natural scenes are unsaturated
   (e.g., the sky). Chances are that none of the R, G, B values in a patch
   of the latent image is close to zero. This paper offers detailed
   analysis on the effects of invalid dark channel assumption on dehazed
   images; in particular, it reveals the causes and behavior of spectral
   distortions that are inherent to the dark channel type of dehazing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Having a key role in 3D and free viewpoint TV applications, view
   interpolation techniques have attracted many researchers in recent
   years. In this paper we present a patch-based reconstruction scheme for
   view interpolation using optical flow disparity estimation. In the first
   step of the algorithm, reconstructed versions of the left and right
   views are obtained using the proposed patch-based scheme. Then mismatch
   masks are generated to find the best patches for final reconstruction.
   Finally the intermediate view is obtained by fusing the selected patches
   and the remaining holes are filled with a simple holefilling algorithm.
   The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with recent
   methods in terms of objective and subjective quality. The results show
   that the proposed method achieves an improvement of 3.3 dB on average.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer detection is one of the most important problems in health
   care as it is second most frequent cancer according to WHO. Breast
   cancer is among cancers which are most probably curable, only if it is
   diagnosed at early stages. To this purpose it has been recently proposed
   that microwave imaging could be used as a cheaper and safer alternative
   to the commonly used combination of mammography. From a physical
   standpoint breast cancer can be modelled as a scatterer with a
   significantly (tenfold) larger conductivity than a healthy tissue. In
   our previous work we proposed a maximum likelihood based method for
   detection of cancer which estimates the unknown parameters by minimizing
   the residual error vector assuming that the error can be modelled as a
   multivariate (multiple antennas) random variable. In this paper we
   utilize stochastic optimization technique and evaluate its applicability
   to the detection of cancer using numerical models. Although these models
   have significant limitations they are potentially useful as they provide
   insight in required levels of noise in order to achieve desirable
   detection rates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study multicasting media traffic that uses multiple
   description coding (MDC) in a wireless mesh network (WMN), where an
   access point (AP) transmits multiple descriptions to the mobile stations
   (MSs) through relay stations (RSs). The MSs have different quality of
   service (QoS) requirements in terms of number of required descriptions,
   and each RS can forward at most one description. All RSs forwarding the
   same descriptions form a multicast tree. Our objective is to minimize
   total transmission power of the RSs, subject to satisfying the QoS
   requirements of the MSs. We study two problems, building node-disjoint
   multicast trees and allocating transmission power. The former is to
   decide which RSs should forward the same description, and the latter is
   to determine an adequate transmission power level for each RS. An
   optimization problem is first formulated, and two heuristic schemes are
   then proposed. The first scheme is a greedy method that iteratively adds
   new paths to individual multicast trees and assigns transmission power
   to RSs, and the second one is a simplified version of the first.
   Numerical results demonstrate that both schemes achieve much lower power
   consumption compared to a spanning-tree-based scheme that builds the
   multicast trees one after another.; and the power consumption of the
   first scheme is much lower than the second one at a price of higher
   complexity.}},

   guaranteeing a certain level of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio (SINR) for both the CUs and D2D groups. We formulate the problem
   of power and channel allocations as a mixed integer nonlinear
   programming (MINLP) problem where each D2D group can reuse the channel
   of at most one CU and each CU can share their resources with at most one
   D2D group. A maximum weight bipartite matching based scheme is developed
   to assign the optimal channel for each feasible D2D group to reuse. A
   heuristic algorithm is then proposed which has less complexity compared
   to the matching algorithm. The performance of both schemes is evaluated
   through simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider mobile users that employ computation
   offloading. In computational offloading, users can reduce energy
   consumption by executing jobs on a remote cloud server, rather than
   locally. In order to execute a job in the cloud, a mobile user must
   upload the job over a base station channel which is shared by all of the
   uploading users. The jobs are subject to hard deadline constraints, and
   since the channel quality may be different for each user, this may
   restrict the users ability to reduce energy usage. The system is
   modelled as a competitive game where each user is interested in
   minimizing its own energy use. The game is subject to the real-time
   constraints imposed by job execution deadlines, user specific channel
   bit rates, and the competition over the shared communication channel.
   The paper shows that for known classes of parameters, a game where each
   user independently adjusts its offload decisions always has a pure Nash
   equilibrium, and a Gauss-Seidel-like method for determining this
   equilibrium is presented. Results are then presented which illustrate
   that the system always converges to a Nash equilibrium using
   Gauss-Seidel. Data is presented which show the number of Nash equilibria
   that are found, the number of iterations required, and the quality of
   the solutions obtained. In particular, we find that the solutions
   perform well compared to a lower bound on total energy performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the asymptotic analysis of symbol error probability
   (SEP) for either optimally precoded or uniformly precoded large
   correlated MIMO fading channels using the zero-forcing (ZF) detector.
   For such systems, we reveal some very nice structures which naturally
   lead us to the exploration of two very strong and very useful
   mathematical tools for the systematic study of asymptotic behaviors on
   their error performance. The first tool is the Szego's theorem on large
   Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and the second tool is the well known limit:
   lim(x ->infinity) (1 + 1/x)(x) = e. This new approach enables us to
   attain a very simple expression for the SEP limit as the number of the
   transmitter antennas goes to infinity. One of the major advantages for
   this method is that its convergence rate is very fast. Hence, this
   expression is very efficient and effective SEP approximation for the
   large MIMO systems. Due to the constraint on allowable space and limited
   (sparse) multi-path scattering, fading correlation between neighbouring
   antenna elements is almost inevitable in a large MIMO architecture. By
   specifically examining an exponential correlation matrix model, we show
   that channel fading correlation can lead to significant performance
   loss. The optimal precoding technique can yield substantial power gain
   over the uniform power allocation strategy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the mechanical design of a mobile
   manipulating unmanned ground vehicle (MM-UGV) coupled with an existing
   commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to create a novel hybrid
   aerial/ground mobile manipulator. A novel systematic optimization-based
   approach is presented for making important design choices, such as the
   selection of gearboxes and electric DC motors in the drive-train,
   manipulator link lengths, and UGV base length. The objective is to
   minimize the overall mass of the MM-UGV. Constraints related to
   workspace, dynamic tip-over stability, actuator torque/force limits in
   static and dynamic motions, executed in the air or on the ground, and
   battery properties are incorporated into the problem formulation. The
   system operating conditions in the form of the range of end-effector
   forces, operating surface grade, and various position, velocity and
   acceleration variables are provided by the designer. The resulting
   problem is a robust bilevel nonlinear optimization, in which some of the
   constraints are derived from maximization/minimization over the
   operational variables to ensure constraint satisfaction in all possible
   operation scenarios. The problem is solved using a genetic algorithm.
   Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy produces a
   design that meets the user-specified requirements.}},

Abstract = {{With rapid increase of image resolution in modern video processing and
   display systems, the bandwidth and power consumption of external memory
   are becoming serious bottlenecks. This problem can be alleviated by
   high-fidelity embedded compression (EC) techniques for video frame
   buffers. Classic lossless or near-lossless coding methods like CALIC are
   ill suited for embedded systems due to their high complexity. In this
   work, a new, simple infra-frame EC technique based on downsampling and
   side-information aided upsampling is developed. Through a study of a
   family of downsampling schemes, an optimal one is found and analyzed for
   EC. This downsampling scheme gives birth to the new EC technique. The
   main idea is to first split an image into blocks, and then adaptively
   choose different down sampling patterns and upsampling methods to
   code/decode these blocks. For a memory bandwidth reduction of 60\%, the
   proposed EC system can achieve PSNR above 40dB, while allowing very
   simple, low-cost real-time hardware realization. A noteworthy novelty of
   this work is compression without entropy coding. The resulting code
   stream is of fixed-rate, supporting random access to pixel blocks.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of post-silicon validation is to detect design errors on
   early silicon prototypes. Electrically-induced errors commonly manifest
   as bit-flips in the logic domain and they occur under unique operating
   conditions, which are often not-easily-repeatable. In order to shorten
   the long detection latencies from an error's manifestation until its
   observation (i.e. system crash), embedded assertion checkers can be
   employed. Nonetheless, relying on simulation-based experiments for
   selecting and assessing the usefulness of a subset of assertion checkers
   (to be committed to silicon) suffers from limitations associated with
   the slow simulation speed. To address this concern, in this paper we
   present a systematic method to automatically design emulation-based
   experiments that can aid the selection and assessment of the embedded
   assertion checkers. Our results indicate improvements of up to 10\% on
   average for the coverage of flip-flops that are affected by bit-flips
   when compared to results obtained from simulation-based experiments.}},

   constraint controller is proposed to deal with the lateral offset
   control in path following and maintain the vehicle lateral stability in

   includes the following two aspects: (1) A novel output constraint
   control strategy, hyperbolic projection method, is proposed to strictly
   bound the lateral offset to prevent vehicle transgressing the safety
   bound in the path following; (2) A robust LQR controller, is adopted to
   obtain the optimal active front steering (AFS) and direct yaw moment
   (DYC) control inputs, with the vehicle stability consideration, and to
   eliminate the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances.
   CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results indicate that the proposed
   controller can compactly bound the lateral offset to avoid transgressing
   the safe boundary during path following process, especially in extreme
   driving condition, in presence of tire sliding effects, system

Abstract = {{The path following problem for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is investigated
   in this paper. The desired value of the vehicle heading is commonly
   chosen as the tangent direction at the orthogonal projection point of
   vehicle CG (center of gravity) on the desired path. This paper points
   out that the traditional definition of the desired heading may
   deteriorate the path following performance, especially when the vehicle
   is tracking a path with large curvature. That is because the sideslip
   angle control and the yaw rate control are conflicting in the presence
   of sliding effects, and the sideslip angle cannot equal to zero when
   vehicle is tracking a curve path. This paper further provides an
   amendment to the definition of the desired heading direction, which
   renders the path following objective realized more accurately. In the
   controller design phase, backstepping is used to generate the required
   yaw rate, which has a form of the P controller, then an LQR controller
   is adopted to obtain the optimal active front steering (AFS) input. The
   Carsim-Simulink joint simulation verifies the reasonability of the
   amendment to the heading error.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel integrated optimal dynamics control of
   4WS4WD electric vehicles via hierarchical control methodology. In the
   higher-level design, an LQR controller is proposed to obtain the
   generalized longitudinal force, lateral force and yaw moment, according
   to their respective reference values. In the lower-level design, the
   control signals from the higher-level controller are allocated through a
   cost function to generate the eight optimal tire forces. A barrier
   function based on the friction limit circle is proposed to calculate the
   coefficients in the cost function. The lower-level controller is
   designed to ensure all the tires work in the stable region while
   realizing the tracking control of the vehicle dynamics. The tire-road
   friction coefficient is estimated through the integrated longitudinal
   force and lateral force, respectively, using a brush tire model. To
   reduce the estimation error, a novel data fusion function is employed to
   generate the final estimation value. Finally, the effectiveness of the
   proposed control and estimation strategies is validated via
   CarSim-Simulink joint simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework for human recognition based on
   Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We particularly consider a verification
   scenario in which only one recording session is available for enrolling
   a subject. Capturing the non-stationarity of ECG and constructing a
   robust model which can be well generalized to unseen data may not be
   possible via having only one training session. Under this scenario, we
   propose to use an auxiliary multisession ECG data set to extract a prior
   knowledge about the behaviour of ECG signal across sessions. A pool of
   different types of features is formed and a subset of good features is
   selected using auxiliary data set. By considering only the selected
   features for enrollment and test, significant performance improvement is
   achieved. Existing feature selection approaches are designed to be used
   in conventional classification problems which are based on a set of
   training samples and a vector of class labels. Our work is different
   from the previous works in that we not only consider the class labels
   but also consider session labels. Features selected from a multisession
   auxiliary data set are used as a prior knowledge to build robust
   templates in the enrollment stage where only one training session is
   available. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the
   proposed method to cope with non-stationarity of ECG signals across
   different sessions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of the new developed second-order
   Smooth Variable Structure Filter, 2nd-order SVSF, for fault detection
   under uncertain conditions. The 2nd-order SVSF is a novel model-based
   state estimation method formulated in a predictor-corrector form. It
   produces robust state estimation under uncertain conditions, while
   decreasing the measurement error and its difference, at the same time.
   The stability of the 2nd-order SVSF is proven using the Lyapunov's
   stability criterion with the given bounded noise and modeling
   uncertainties. The corrective gain of the filter is pushing the
   measurement error and its difference toward zero. This results in
   providing higher degrees of accuracy, robustness and smoothness in state
   estimation under uncertain situations. Due to the robust performance of
   the 2nd-order SVSF for state estimation, it applies to an experimental
   setup of an Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA) for fault detection.
   Experimentation are performed for the EHA setup under the normal and
   faulty conditions. For the faulty EHA setup, there exists a major
   friction condition in the EHA's cylinders. The robustness of the new
   developed 2nd-order SVSF is then verified by comparing its performance
   with the state-of-the-art filters including the Kalman Filter (KF) and
   the 1st-order SVSF.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative analysis of well-known state

   this research is to measure and then evaluate the robustness (i. e., a

   the method conditions) of these methods against modeling uncertainties.
   The state estimation methods include the Kalman Filter, the 1st-Order
   Smooth Variable Structure Filter (1st-order SVSF), and the new developed
   Dynamic 2nd-Order SVSF. A relatively new performance robustness
   criterion (so-called robustness index) is adopted in this work to first
   measure the robustness of the estimation methods, and then, evaluate
   their performance. The robustness index is calculated for each method
   when modeling uncertainties are explicitly considered. Simulation
   analysis is performed using the linear model of an Electro-Hydrostatic

   Simulation results showed the superior performance of the Dynamic

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of narrow-band signal detection in a passive
   sonar environment. The classical method employs a fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT) delay-sum beamformer in which the feature used in detection is the
   output of the FFT spectrum analyser in each frequency bin. This is
   compared to a locally estimated mean noise power to establish a
   likelihood ratio test (LRT). In this paper, we suggest to use the power
   spectral density (PSD) matrix of the spectrum analyser output as the
   feature for detection due to the additional cross-correlation
   information contained in such matrices. However, PSD matrices have
   structural constraints and describe a manifold in the signal space.
   Thus, instead of the widely used Euclidean distance (ED), we must use
   the Riemannian distance (RD) on the manifold for measuring the
   similarity between such features. Here, we develop methods for measuring
   the Fr ` echet mean of noise PSD matrices and optimum weighting matrices
   for measuring similarity of noise and signal PSD matrices. These are
   then used to develop a decision rule for the detection of narrow-band
   sonar signals using PSD matrices. The results yielded by the new
   detection method are very encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation is becoming widely adopted because it runs
   significantly faster than pre-silicon verification and hence it helps
   uncover subtle design errors that escape to silicon prototypes. However,
   it is hindered by limited controllability and observability, which makes
   it challenging to reuse pre-silicon content. In order to enable the
   reuse of stimuli constraints from pre-silicon verification environments,
   we present a method that facilitates the on-chip generation of uniformly
   distributed constrained-random stimuli. More specifically, our method,
   which relies on new pre-processing steps and on-chip hardware features,
   can generate in real-time pseudo cyclic-random stimuli with no
   repetition until the space of the compliant stimuli is exhausted.}},

Abstract = {{The outstanding adsorption properties of proteins, containing catecholic
   amino acid, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), and recent advances in
   nanoparticle functionalization using molecules from the catechol family
   have generated interest in the investigation of catechol adsorption and
   applications of catecholates in nanotechnology. Caffeic acid (CA) is the
   closest molecular analogue of DOPA. Density functional theory has been
   applied for the modelling of CA adsorption on the surface of ZnO and
   TiO2. Different adsorption modes have been investigated and
   corresponding adsorption energies were evaluated. According to the
   calculated energies, the adsorption of CA is energetically favourable at
   both surfaces with a stronger affinity to TiO2. The results of
   theoretical studies were supported by experimental investigations of CA
   adsorption. The use of CA as a dispersant for hydrothermal synthesis of
   ZnO allowed for the fabrication of ZnO nanorods with reduced size and
   increased aspect ratio. The CA, adsorbed during the hydrothermal
   synthesis on ZnO nanorods, allowed for their electrosteric dispersion
   and the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of ZnO films from stable
   colloidal suspensions. In another strategy, CA was added as a dispersant
   for the dispersion of TiO2 nanorods and the EPD of TiO2 films. The
   advantages of catecholates for the synthesis of nanoparticles and
   fabrication of thin films are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The solid oxide fuel cell gas turbine hybrid system (SOFC/GT) is an
   exciting new approach to producing electricity with high efficiency and
   lower environmental impacts than conventional power plants. One of its
   key strengths is the potential for fuel flexibility, which is the
   ability to transition between different kinds or qualities of fuels
   during operation. However, there has been very little research into the
   dynamic performance of SOFC/GT systems in response to changes in fuel.
   Therefore, the open loop behaviour of SOFC/GT systems in response to
   fuel composition transients was experimentally investigated. In this
   study, hardware-based simulations were used to study transitions between
   using coal-derived syngas and humidified methane. A hybrid test facility
   at the U.S Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory,
   Morgantown, West Virginia, was used to adequately capture the coupling
   of fuel cell stacks (simulated with hardware driven by a real time
   dynamic model) and a gas turbine system (from actual equipment) during
   transient events. Given the dynamic trajectories of key process
   variables, the impact on the hybrid system was quantified via transfer
   functions. The results show that the open-loop dynamic behaviour
   exhibited significant inverse response which limited the range of
   transitions that could be achieved safely without damage to various
   system components such as the compressor or fuel cells. However, the
   results also showed that if a control system could be designed which
   limited the impact of the inverse response, then transitions between
   even very different kinds of fuels could potentially be achieved without
   operational problems. The resulting transient information will be used
   to develop a new control system for thermal management of SOFC/GT hybrid
   systems in future work.}},

Abstract = {{Semicontinuous separation is a distillation based process
   intensification technique devised for the purification of ternary
   mixtures to desired purities. It is particularly promising for small
   scale production processes where the semicontinuous system has a lower
   total annualized cost relative to the conventional continuous process,
   thus it can be a suitable option for the purification of biofuels.
   Semicontinuous systems are dynamic, control driven processes that work
   in a stable limit cycle with several modes of operations. Therefore,
   designing the system and its controllers is a challenging task which has
   not been thoroughly considered in the literature. In this work, for the
   first time, a methodology is presented to simultaneously obtain the
   optimum design parameters of the semicontinuous system such as the
   number of column stages, feed and side stream locations, as well as the
   optimum tuning parameters for the PI control structure. To design the
   semicontinuous process, it is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear
   dynamic optimization problem using the equation oriented gPROMS software
   which has built-in deterministic optimization packages. The benzene,
   toluene and o-xylene mixture is chosen as a case study to demonstrate
   the methodology. The optimization took 1.03 CPU hours and the optimum
   design parameters are obtained. The results show that the total
   annualized cost of the designed semicontinuous system is lower than the
   respective conventional continuous process.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, particle packing density, grain size and morphology are the
   important factors that affect the transparency of ceramics. In order to
   achieve better transparency of ceramics, efforts should be developed to
   eliminate or minimize light scattering or absorption. Therefore the
   porosity and size of crystals in a ceramic body should be strictly
   controlled. Typical transparent ceramics are fabricated by
   pressure-assisted sintering techniques such as hot isostatic pressing
   (HIP), spark plasma sintering (SPS), and pressure-less sintering (PLS).
   However, a simple energy efficient production method remains a
   challenge. In this study, we describe a simple fabrication process via a
   facile filtration system that can fabricate translucent hydroxyapatite
   based ceramics. The translucent pieces yielded from filtration exhibit
   optical transmittance that was confirmed by UV spectroscopy. Briefly,
   the morphology and size of ceramic nanoparticles, filtration pressure
   and filtration time are important parameters to be discussed. Compared
   with different hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, spherical nanoparticles
   easily form a densely packed structure, followed by sintered ceramics.
   When the strontium content in HA increases, the morphology of HA changes
   from nano-spheres to nano-rods, following a decrease in transparency. A
   pressure filtration model combining Darcy's law and the Kozeny-Carman
   relation has been discussed to simulate and explain why the translucent
   ceramics can be fabricated via such a simple process. This method could
   be further applied to prepare other translucent functional ceramics by
   controlling the size and morphology of ceramic particles.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled radical polymerization often loses control over polymer
   molecular weight at high monomer conversions due to diffusion-controlled
   reactions. This is particularly true for bulk polymerization systems. In
   this work, bulk atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) was carried out by employing an initiator for
   continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) method. Binary systems of ICAR
   agents, that is, low temperature azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and high
   temperature tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) or tert-butyl peroxide
   (TBP) were used. The polymerization was run at 70 degrees C at the
   beginning and completed at an elevated temperature. The objective was to
   investigate the effects of ICAR agent concentration on the system
   livingness and control at high conversions. It was found that both ICAR
   agents significantly affected the rate of catalyst regeneration and
   consequently the rate and control of polymerization. By optimizing the
   concentrations of the ICAR agents and employing step temperature
   profile, MMA was polymerized with 50 ppm CuBr2 up to 98\% conversion in
   less than 5 hours. The final products had dispersity (D) about 1.3.}},

Title = {{One-step in-mould modification of PDMS surfaces and its application in
   the fabrication of self-driven microfluidic channels}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{4322-4330}},
Abstract = {{Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) has become the material of choice for
   fabricating microfluidic channels for lab-on-a-chip applications. Key
   challenges that limit the use of PDMS in microfluidic applications are
   its hydrophobic nature, and the difficulty in obtaining stable surface
   modifications. Although a number of approaches exist to render PDMS
   hydrophilic, they suffer from reversion to hydrophobicity and,
   frequently, surface cracking or roughening. In this study, we describe a
   one-step in-mould method for the chemical modification of PDMS surfaces,
   and its use to assess the ability of different surfactants to render
   PDMS surfaces hydrophilic. Thin films of ionic and non-ionic surfactants
   were patterned into an array format, transferred onto silicone
   pre-polymer, and subsequently immobilized onto the PDMS surface during
   vulcanization. The hydrophilicity of the resulting surfaces was assessed
   by contact angle measurements. The wettability was observed to be
   dependent on the chemical structure of the surfactants, their
   concentration and interactions with PDMS. The morphology of modified
   PDMS surfaces and their change after wetting and drying cycles were
   visualized using atomic force microscopy. Our results show that while
   all surfactants tested can render PDMS surfaces hydrophilic through the
   in-mould modification, only those modified with PEG-PDMS-PEG copolymer
   surfactants were stable over wetting/dying cycles and heat treatments.
   Finally, the in-mould functionalization approach was used to fabricate
   self-driven microfluidic devices that exhibited steady flow rates, which
   could be tuned by the device geometry. It is anticipated that the
   in-mould method can be applied to a range of surface modifications for
   applications in analytical separations, biosensing, cell isolation and
   small molecule discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes were investigated for the
   application as charging agents for the electrophoretic deposition (EPD)
   of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and composite coatings, containing
   huntite or alumina platelets. The use of cationic chitosan (CT) allowed
   for the fabrication of PEEK coatings by cathodic EPD. Anodic PEEK
   coatings were prepared using sodium alginate (AL) and
   poly{[}1-{[}4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-etha
   nediyl, sodium salt] (PAZO). The EPD of huntite and PEEK-huntite
   composites was achieved using AL and PAZO. The EPD of alumina and
   PEEK-alumina coatings was performed using PAZO. The comparison of the
   experimental results and molecular structures of AL and PAZO provided an
   insight into the influence of salicylate ligands of PAZO on adsorption
   of this polyelectrolyte on inorganic surfaces. The unique physical
   properties of PAZO, coupled with strong adsorption of this material on
   organic and inorganic surfaces, pave the way for the fabrication of
   functional composites by EPD. The deposition mechanism, deposition
   kinetics and deposit microstructure were investigated. Huntite is
   advanced flame retardant material with relatively high decomposition
   temperature, which is of special interest for the incorporation in
   polymers, such as PEEK, which require thermal processing. It was found
   that PEEK composites, containing flame retardant huntite additives, can
   be prepared by EPD. The composite coatings provided corrosion protection
   of steel. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusion removal is key in the production of high quality steel. The
   inclusions are primarily removed from liquid steel by reacting with a
   liquid slag phase. For efficient inclusion removal, the inclusions
   transfer across the steel-slag interface to dissolve in the slag. This
   transfer process is strongly influenced by interfacial phenomena. In
   this study, the dynamic wetting (theta) of a range of slags in the
   CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-(MgO) system on solid oxides representing inclusion
   phases (Al2O3, MgAl2O4 and CaO.Al2O3) at 1 773 K was investigated using
   a sessile drop technique. It was found that for all systems studied 9
   versus time showed a rapid decrease in wetting in the first 10 s tending
   to a plateau value at extended times. Further, for basic type ladle
   slags the plateau value was independent of slag composition and for acid
   type tundish slags the plateau value decreased with increasing basicity.
   Through work of adhesion analysis it was shown that ladle type slags
   appeared more suitable for inclusion removal and that from a wetting
   perspective calcium aluminate would be easier to remove than spinel and
   alumina. Choi and Lee's dynamic wetting model was evaluated and found to
   not only represent the data well but have physical relevance for the
   basic, but not the acid, slags investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid transition to cloud-based infrastructures has introduced a
   number of uncharted risks, threats, and challenges that are faced by
   security experts. In particular, concerns surrounding the
   confidentiality of information in cloud-based systems and the existence
   of covert communication channels ought to be addressed.
   In this paper, we outline a schema for certifying covert channel
   freeness in cloud-based systems. The proposed schema provides an
   application of the formal foundation laid out in our previous work and
   is based on a strategy derived from the necessity and formal
   verification of the conditions for covert channel existence in
   cloud-based systems specified using the mathematical framework of
   Communicating Concurrent Kleene Algebra (C(2)KA). We also discuss how
   the proposed schema can be used for identifying ways in which an analyst
   may amend, modify, or redesign a system in order to make it more
   resilient to covert channels, and to potentially certify it to be free
   from covert channels on the basis of the non-existence of the potential
   for communication amongst its agents. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Raspberry-like ZIF-8/PS composite spheres are prepared via dispersion
   polymerization of styrene with ZIF-8 and PVP as co-stabilizers. PVP is
   found to be crucial in determining morphology of the final product. It
   helps adherence of ZIF-8 nanoparticles to PS spheres. It is found that
   ZIF-8 nanoparticles thus prepared are partially embedded into PS sphere
   surfaces, resulting in a stable raspberry-like structure. Surface
   coverage of ZIF-8 can reach up to similar to 32\%. The effects of ZIF-8
   content and PVP concentration on the particle size and morphology are
   examined in detail with the mechanisms elucidated. The raspberry-like
   spheres can be used as a template to grow thick ZIF-8 layers on the PS
   spheres through subsequent solvothermal treatment, leading to the
   formation of polymer-core MOF-shell structure.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous delivery of proteins by engineered cells encapsulated in
   biocompatible polymeric microcapsules is of considerable therapeutic
   potential. However, this technology has not lived up to expectations due
   to inadequate cell-matrix interactions and subsequent cell death. In
   this study we hypothesize that the presence of fibronectin in an
   alginate matrix may enhance the viability and functionality of
   encapsulated human cord blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
   expressing the human Factor IX (FIX) gene. MSCs were encapsulated in
   alginate-PLL microcapsules containing 10, 100, or 500 mu g/ml
   fibronectin to ameliorate cell survival. MSCs in microcapsules with 100
   and 500 mu g/ml fibronectin demonstrated improved cell viability and
   proliferation and higher FIX secretion compared to MSCs in
   non-supplemented microcapsules. In contrast, 10 mu g/ml fibronectin did
   not significantly affect the viability and protein secretion from the
   encapsulated cells. Differentiation studies demonstrated osteogenic (but
   not chondrogenic or adipogenic) differentiation capability and efficient
   FIX secretion of the enclosed MSCs in the fibronectin-alginate
   suspension culture. Thus, the use of recombinant MSCs encapsulated in
   fibronectin-alginate microcapsules in basal or osteogenic cultures may
   be of practical use in the treatment of hemophilia B.}},

Abstract = {{Twin screw granulation (TSG) is a new process of interest to the
   pharmaceutical community that can continuously wet granulate powders,
   doing so at lower liquid concentrations and with better product
   consistency than found by a high shear batch mixer. A considerable body
   of research has evolved over the short time since this process was
   introduced but generally with little comparison of results. A certain
   degree of confidence has been developed through these studies related to
   how process variables and many attributes of machinery configuration
   will affect granulation but some major challenges still lay ahead
   related to scalability, variations in the processing regimes related to
   degree of channel fill and the impact of wetting and granulation of
   complex powder formulations. This review examines the current literature
   for wet granulation processes studied in twin screw extrusion machinery,
   summarizing the influences of operational and system parameters
   affecting granule properties as well as strives to provide some
   practical observations to newly interested users of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we report the characterization of localized corrosion of AZ31B
   magnesium alloy electrochemically coated with
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) from ionic liquid electrolyte.
   Several scanning probe techniques including high resolution electron
   microscopy, SVET, SECM amperometric detection of H-2 fluxes,
   potentiometric SECM detection of local pH and localized potentiodyanmic
   measurements were used to evaluate the microstructure of the coating and
   its corrosion protectiveness. In order to examine long-term durability
   of corrosion protection due to the PEDOT coating, these measurements
   were performed after different immersion times. It was observed that
   PEDOT coating appears to lose its protective ability after localized
   coverage of corrosion products. The results of this study provide
   important information considering the interest in this coating for use
   in biomedical implants and prior indications of beneficial passivation.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide and direct bandgap semiconductor, which can
   be structurally tuned to create materials having an extensive range of
   simple and complex morphologies. The ability to translate this
   structural tunability to functional tunability has made ZnO the subject
   of intense scientific and engineering research. ZnO films composed of
   nanoscale hemispherical and gradient-index building blocks have great
   potential for use in photovoltaic devices as antireflection, light
   trapping, and light scattering elements. Electrodeposition is an
   inexpensive, scalable, and low-temperature method for depositing
   nanostructured materials directly on device surfaces. In this work, we
   investigate the electrodeposition parameter space for developing
   hemispherical and gradient-index nanostructures directly on
   semiconducting substrates. We observe that lowering the nucleation and
   growth rate of ZnO in a hydrogen peroxide bath transforms the structures
   from continuous films to the desired hemispherical and gradient index
   morphologies. Furthermore, we combine this bottom-up fabrication method
   with top-down photolithography for integrating these structures into
   periodic microelectrode configurations. We optically characterize these
   nanostructured films and observe that the nanostructured ZnO film
   reduces reflection significantly from silicon surfaces in the 0.35 mu m
   (from 49\% to 3.6\%) to 1.3 mu m (from 35\% to 21\%) wavelength range.

Abstract = {{A rapid and accurate method to identify severe sepsis patients at high
   risk of death is critically needed for clinical practice. In a recent
   study, the concentration of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood was found to
   be a prognostic indicator for ICU mortality in patients with severe
   sepsis. However, current DNA quantification techniques are
   time-consuming and involve extensive sample preparation. In this paper,
   we demonstrate a low-cost microfluidic device capable of rapid
   quantification of cfDNA in a small droplet (<10 mu l) of blood plasma
   and whole blood in 5 min using only electrical power. The cfDNA in
   samples is selectively labeled by PicoGreen and is extracted and
   concentrated by electrophoresis into a gel by application of a DC
   potential of 9 V. This device has potential as a prognostic tool for
   early and rapid assessment of septic patients.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of the cyclone tracks that caused precipitation
   events of variable intensity for the period 1979-2011 over the island of
   Crete are presented. The data set used for cyclone identification is the
   0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, 30 years European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim mean sea-level pressure. Cyclone
   characteristics are calculated with the aid of the Melbourne University
   algorithm (MS scheme). Daily precipitation data from a dense gauging
   network over the island of Crete are also used for the classification of
   the precipitation events in terms of rain accumulation (intensity).
   Daily precipitation is classified in three categories and the associated
   cyclones are chosen according to their distance from Crete island. The
   seasonal and annual cycle of the physical characteristics of the cyclone
   tracks are investigated with respect to the cyclones' relative position
   to the island of Crete. It was found that cyclones affecting Crete most
   frequently approach from the western side of the island and the actual
   cyclone centers associated with precipitation events are usually located
   northwest and southeast of the Crete domain. Cyclone-induced rainfall
   increases in function to cyclones' depth, radius and propagation
   velocity increase as well as cyclones' pressure decrease. Spring
   cyclones that affect Crete with rainfall present lower pressures and
   higher cyclone propagation velocity in contrast to the ones associated
   with winter and autumn precipitation events. The examination of the
   relation between cyclone characteristics and precipitation occurrence
   provides valuable information related to forecasting potential and
   management of the water resources and the rainfall extremes.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification with affinity ligands capable of capturing
   bioactive molecules in situ is a widely used strategy for developing
   biofunctional materials. However, many bioactive molecules, for example
   zymogens, exist naturally in a ``quiescent'' state, and become active
   only when ``triggered'' by specific activators. In the present study, in
   situ activation of a surface-integrated zymogen was achieved by
   introducing affinity ligands for both the zymogen and its activator.
   Specifically a dual affinity surface was designed for the integration of
   plasminogen (Plg) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This surface
   was expected to have plasmin-generating and, therefore, fibrinolytic
   properties. A polyurethane surface was modified with a copolymer of
   2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 1-adamantan-1-ylmethyl methacrylate
   poly(HEMA-co-AdaMA). The affinity ligands, ARMAPE peptide (for t-PA) and
   e-lysine-containing beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD-(Lys)(7)) (for Plg), were
   attached in sequence via covalent bonding and host-guest interactions,
   respectively. The resulting surfaces were shown to have high binding
   capacities for both t-PA and Plg while resisting nonspecific protein
   adsorption. Pre-loading with t-PA followed by Plg uptake from plasma
   generated plasmin and thus endowed the surface with fibrinolytic
   activity. In general the incorporation of dual affinity ligands to
   achieve surface-promoted bioactivity is a promising approach for the
   development of biofunctional materials. The method reported herein for
   the sequential attachment of plasminogen and t-PA affinity ligands can
   be extended to systems of multiple ligands generally.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous, real-time monitoring of the level of pH and free chlorine in
   drinking water is of great importance to public health. However, it is
   challenging when conventional analytical instruments, such as bulky pH
   electrodes and expensive free chlorine meters, are used. These
   instruments have slow response, are difficult to use, prone to
   interference from operators, and require frequent maintenance. In
   contrast, microfabricated electrochemical sensors are cheaper, smaller
   in size, and highly sensitive. Therefore, these sensors are desirable
   for online monitoring of pH and free chlorine in water. In this review,
   we discuss different physical configurations of microfabricated sensors.
   These configurations include potentiometric electrodes, ion-sensitive
   field-effect transistors, and chemo-resistors/transistors for
   electrochemical pH sensing. Also, we identified that micro-amperometric
   sensors are the dominant ones used for free chlorine sensing. We
   summarized and compared the structure, operation/sensing mechanism,
   applicable materials, and performance parameters in terms of
   sensitivity, sensing range, response time and stability of each type of
   sensor. We observed that novel sensor structures fabricated by solution
   processing and operated by smart sensing methodologies may be used for
   developing pH and free chlorine sensors with high performance and low
   cost. Finally, we highlighted the importance of the concurrent design of
   materials, fabrication processes, and electronics for future sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Poly{[}1-{[}4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)
   benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt] (PAZO) exhibits a
   number of unique physical properties, which are important for diverse
   applications of this functional polymer in photonics, optoelectronics,
   memory devices and sensors. A conceptually new strategy has been
   utilized for the fabrication of thin films of PAZO using electrophoretic
   deposition (EPD). The deposition kinetics and mechanism have been
   investigated and the advantages of EPD have been discussed. Our new
   findings in the surface and interface chemistry allowed for the
   development of surface modification methods, which were utilized for the
   electrosteric dispersion and EPD of MnO2 nanofibers, multiwalled carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNT), polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles and PPy coated MWCNT.
   New method has been developed for the fabrication of PPy coated MWCNT,
   using bromothymol blue sodium salt as a dopant for PPy and dispersant
   for MWCNT. The aromatic PAZO monomers, containing chelating salicylate
   ligands provided multiple adsorption sites for PAZO adsorption on
   different materials and allowed for their efficient electrosteric
   dispersion. Another major finding was the possibility of efficient
   deposition of composites, using PAZO as a co-dispersant for MnO2
   nanofibers and MWCNT. The MnO2 nanofibers, MWCNT, PPy nanoparticles, PPy
   coated MWCNT and composites, deposited by EPD, were used for energy
   storage in electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors. Testing
   results showed beneficial effect of PAZO for the dispersion and EPD of
   advanced supercapacitor materials. The results of this investigation
   paved the way for EPD of other composites utilizing properties of
   different functional materials and unique physical properties of PAZO.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{65328-65336}},
Abstract = {{The effect of multi wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the thermoelectric
   properties of Mg2Si0.877Ge0.1Bi0.023 was examined. While introducing
   CNTs increases the electrical conductivity from around 450 Omega(-1)
   cm(-1) to 500 Omega(-1) cm(-1) at 323 K, the increase is neutralized at
   higher temperature, with the conductivity resulting to be 440
   Omega(-1)cm(-1)-470 Omega(-1)cm(-1) at 773 K. The Seebeck coefficient of
   all nanocomposites is enhanced at 773 K due to energy filtering that
   stems from the introduction of CNTs-Mg2Si0.877Ge0.1Bi0.023 interfaces.
   The combined effect of CNTs on Seebeck coefficient and electrical
   conductivity leads to an approximately 20\% power factor improvement,
   with the best sample reaching a maximum value of 19 RW cm(-1) K-2 at 773
   K. The lattice thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites is reduced due
   to the phonon scattering by nanodomains and grain boundaries,
   particularly at medium temperatures, resulting in a slight reduction in
   total thermal conductivity. According to high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy studies, bismuth is homogenously distributed within
   the grains, while germanium is accumulated at the grain boundaries. All
   in all, the enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit of 0.67 at 773 K for
   the sample containing 0.5 weight\% MWCNT as compared to 0.55 for the
   pristine sample, demonstrates the promising effect of CNTs on the
   thermoelectric properties of Mg(2)Si(0.877)Geo.iBi(0.023).}},

Abstract = {{Fully-integrated electro-fluidic systems with micro-/nano-scale features
   have a wide range of applications in lab-on-a-chip systems used for
   biosensing, biological sample processing, and environmental monitoring.
   Rapid prototyping of application-specific electro-fluidic systems is
   envisioned to facilitate the testing, validation, and market translation
   of several lab-on-a-chip systems. Towards this goal, we developed a
   rapid prototyping process for creating wrinkled micro-/nano-textured
   electrodes on shrink memory polymers, fabricating microfluidics using
   molds patterned by a craft-cutter, and bonding electrical and fluidic
   circuitries using a PDMS partial curing method optimized for creating
   void-free bonds at the side walls and surfaces of tall (>5 mu m)
   micro-/nano-textured wrinkled electrodes. The resulting electro-fluidic
   devices, featuring closely spaced high topography electrodes for
   electrochemical analysis, can withstand flow-rates and burst pressures
   larger than 25 mL min(-1) and 125 kPa, respectively. In addition, the
   fully-integrated electrochemical flow-cell developed here demonstrates
   excellent electrochemical behaviour, with negligible scan to scan
   variation for over 100 cyclic voltammetry scans, and expected redox
   signatures measured under various voltage scan rates and fluidic flow
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the dynamic response of an aircraft seat

   The described model is validated by performing experimental dynamic
   response measurements of an aircraft seat subjected to actual take off
   excitation recordings obtained onboard an aircraft. The accuracy of the
   model is investigated by comparing the simulated properties with
   experimental modal analysis and seat plate dynamics data. Moreover, the
   severity of the transmitted vibrations to the seat surface is assessed
   using the seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) method.
   Results show that the numerical model is able to replicate the dynamic
   and modal properties of the aircraft seat. The numerical and
   experimental SEAT values computed through different methods were also
   found to be in good agreement. This developed model can be used to
   predict and improve the dynamic comfort of aircraft seats.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied a UV responsive phototransistor and how the addition of
   various azobenzene derivatives alters the rise and relaxation times when
   exposed to and removed from UV light, respectively. A three-component
   semiconductor system was studied consisting of a UV responsive material
   C5-BTBT, a polymer binder PMMA, and 1 of 5 different azobenzene
   materials for UV response enhancement. The highest occupied molecular
   orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were
   determined experimentally and found from DFT theory. Azobenzene units
   with a pendent nitro group have lower HOMO and LUMO levels than the
   semiconductor C5-BTBT. This combined with their electron withdrawing
   nature allows them to stabilize excited electrons, extending the
   lifetime of excitons, and keeping the system at a high current longer.
   Using a bi-exponential model, we see the relaxation rate constant tau
   increase from 278 to 578 s when nitro-azobenzene is used. Meanwhile,
   when azobenzene contains the electron donating unit -NH2, the HOMO of
   the material is found to be higher than that of C5-BTBT. This allowed
   another pathway for excited electrons to decay to their ground state,
   causing hole pair recombination, reducing I-DS. The relaxation curves
   when UV light is removed demonstrate a clear increase in decay rate over
   the control system, showing that the charge donating amino-azobenzene
   assists in charge recombination.}},

Title = {{Changing the magnetic properties of microstructure by directing the
   self-assembly of superparamagnetic nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{423-435}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in a liquid dispersion can be organized
   through controlled self-assembly by applying an external magnetic field
   that regulates inter-particle interactions. Thus, micro-and
   nanostructures of desired morphology and superlattice geometry that show
   emergent magnetic properties can be fabricated. We describe how
   superferromagnetism, which is a specific type of emergence, can be
   produced. Here, superparamagnetic nanoparticles that show no individual
   residual magnetization are organized into structures with substantial
   residual magnetization that behave as miniature permanent magnets. We
   investigate the emergence of superferromagnetism in an idealized system
   consisting of two MNPs, by considering the influence that interparticle
   magnetostatic interactions have on the dynamics of the magnetic moments.
   We use this model to illustrate the design principles for self-assembly
   in terms of the choice of material and MNP particle size. We simulate
   the dynamics of the interacting magnetic moments by applying the
   stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to verify our principles.
   The findings enable a method to pattern material magnetization with
   submicron resolution, a useful feature that has potential applications
   for magnetic recording and microfluidic particle traps. The analysis
   also yields useful empirical generalizations that could facilitate other
   theoretical developments.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel process for integrating germanium with
   silicon-on-insulator (SOT) wafers. Germanium is implanted into SOT which
   is then oxidized, trapping the germanium between the two oxide layers
   (the grown oxide and the buried oxide). With careful control of the
   implantation and oxidation conditions this process creates a thin layer
   (current experiments indicate up to 20-30nm) of almost pure germanium.
   The layer can be used potentially for fabrication of integrated
   photo-detectors sensitive to infrared wavelengths, or may serve as a
   seed for further germanium growth. Results are presented from electron
   microscopy and Rutherford back-scattering analysis, as well as
   preliminary modelling using an analytical description of the process.}},

Abstract = {{A modified poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) material is under development
   for use in an extracorporeal microfluidic blood oxygenator designed as
   an artificial placenta to treat newborn infants suffering from severe
   respiratory insufficiency. To prevent thrombosis triggered by

   was coated on PDMS surface using polydopamine (PDA) as a ``bioglue''.
   Experiments using radiolabelled ATH showed that the ATH coating on
   PDA-modified PDMS remained substantially intact after incubation in
   plasma, 2\% SDS solution, or whole blood over a three day period. The
   anticoagulant activity of the ATH-modified surfaces was also
   demonstrated: in contact with plasma the ATH-coated PDMS was shown to
   bind antithrombin (AT) selectively from plasma and to inhibit clotting
   factor Xa. It is concluded that modification of PDMS with polydopamine
   and ATH shows promise as a means of improving the blood compatibility of
   PDMS and hence of the oxygenator device.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Recent results from compressive sampling (CS) have demonstrated that
   accurate reconstruction of sparse signals often requires far fewer
   samples than suggested by the classical Nyquist-Shannon sampling
   theorem. Typically, signal reconstruction errors are measured in the
   l(2) norm and the signal is assumed to be sparse or compressible. Our
   spectrum estimation by sparse optimization (SpESO) method uses a priori
   information about isotropic homogeneous turbulent flows with power law
   energy spectra and applies the methods of CS to one- and two-dimensional
   turbulence signals to estimate their energy spectra with small
   logarithmic errors. SpESO is distinct from existing energy spectrum
   estimation methods which are based on sparse support of the signal in
   Fourier space. SpESO approximates energy spectra with an order of
   magnitude fewer samples than needed with Shannon sampling. Our results
   demonstrate that SpESO performs much better than lumped orthogonal
   matching pursuit, and as well as or better than wavelet-based best
   M-term or M/2-term methods, even though these methods require complete
   sampling of the signal before compression.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper a combined empirical-numerical (finite element)
   approach for predicting the tool life has been introduced. This approach
   is based on the similarities found among the worn cutting edge
   geometries which have been obtained from the orthogonal tool life tests
   at different cutting speeds. The main difference between the proposed
   approach and those used in other finite element based tool wear
   prediction attempts is the lower computational time. Based on this
   approach finite element simulations of the cutting process based on worn
   tool geometries at several stages during the cut are run in parallel and
   provide the influential parameters on wear rate. Employing these
   parameters as input in the three well-known empirical wear rate
   equations, the relation between flank wear and cutting time are
   estimated. Predictions show agreement with experiment in terms of trend
   while some deviations exist in terms of the estimated magnitudes. (C)

Abstract = {{The durability of Pt catalysts in polymer membrane electrolyte fuel

   reports on a variety of Pt nanostructures with improved durability, a
   clear understanding of the structure-durability relationship is still
   missing as a rigorous correlative investigation is lacking. Using
   five-fold twinned Pd nanowires as templates, we have prepared Pt
   nanotubular skeleton structures which duplicate the crystal structure of
   the template. By comparing the durability of these structures with
   commercial Pt/C catalysts and Pt nanotubes, we found that grain
   boundaries in Pt nanocatalysts contribute most to the instability of the
   catalyst structures. These results not only highlight a strategy to
   prepare more durable fuel cell catalysts, but also provide a new method
   to prepare elongated Pt catalysts with controlled crystal structures,

Abstract = {{A non-rigid registration method is presented for the alignment of
   pre-procedural magnetic resonance (MR) images with delineated suspicious
   regions to intra-procedural 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images in
   TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. In the first step, 3D MR and TRUS images
   are aligned rigidly using six pairs of manually identified approximate
   matching points on the boundary of the prostate. Then, two image volumes
   are non-rigidly registered using a finite element method (FEM)-based
   linear elastic deformation model. A vector of observation prediction
   errors at some points of interest within the prostate volume is computed
   using an intensity-based similarity metric called the modality
   independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND). The error vector is employed
   in a classical state estimation framework to estimate prostate
   deformation between MR and TRUS images. The points of interests are
   identified using speeded-up robust features (SURF) that are scale and
   rotation-invariant descriptors in MR images. The proposed registration
   method on 10 sets of prostate MR and TRUS images yielded a target
   registration error of 1.99 +/- 0.83 mm, and 1.97 +/- 0.87 mm in the
   peripheral zone (PZ) and whole gland (WG), respectively, using 68
   manually-identified fiducial points. The Dice similarity coefficient
   (DSC) was 87.9 +/- 2.9, 82.3 +/- 4.8, 93.0 +/- 1.7, and 84.2 +/- 6.2
   percent for the WG, apex, mid-gland and base of the prostate,
   respectively. Moreover, the mean absolute distances (MAD) between the WG
   surfaces in the TRUS and registered MR images was 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm.
   Registration results indicate effectiveness of the proposed method in
   improving the targeting accuracy in the TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.}},

Abstract = {{The speckle, which is due to the interference of coherent light
   scattered by a random surface, can severely degrades the image quality.
   The speckle properties are usually measured by a camera, which takes
   images of the center of a projection screen. As a result, the effects of
   different viewing angles are not considered. In this paper, the
   dependence of speckle contrast ratio on the viewing angles in a laser
   projection system is studied. Two major effects have been considered in
   the studies. First, different viewing angles result different projection
   distances. Secondly, for a rough screen, there exists an angular
   intensity distribution for the reflected/scattered light, which is
   determined by the structure of the screen surface. By combining these
   two effects, the experiment results show that the speckle contrast can
   vary significantly for different viewing angels. It is found that
   speckle contrast decreases with increase of viewing angle. As a result,
   when evaluating the speckle contrast in a laser projection system, the
   dependence of viewing angle should be considered.}},

   hard blocks exhibited a high level of crystallinity and the soft blocks
   gave good low temperature flexibility. The block copolymers thus
   prepared have potential in thermoplastic elastomer applications.}},

Abstract = {{Point-of-use (POU) water treatment provides households in rural and
   remote communities with a means of obtaining greater control over their
   water quality and its effects on human health. One of the most prevalent
   POU interventions, the BioSand filter (BSF), is a household-scale,
   intermittently operated slow sand filter used by over 300,000
   households. The sand and gravel media within BSFs can be housed in
   concrete (cBSF) or Hydraid plastic (pBSF) bodies, with the latter
   becoming increasingly popular due to their portability, durability, and
   anticipated scalability. This study evaluated whether pBSFs, which are
   lighter and thinner than their concrete counterparts, can maintain their
   integrity and performance after being subjected to disturbances that
   could occur in a typical household. Eight pBSFs and two cBSFs were run
   in parallel for 13 weeks, and three disturbances - one-time filter
   movement, one-time side impacts, and daily bucket impacts - were
   applied. Moving and side impacts affected pBSFs more dramatically than
   cBSFs, causing marked decreases in sand column height (6-29 mm decrease,
   p<0.001) and decreases in maximum initial flow rate (18-84\% decrease,
   p<0.001). Brief spikes in pBSF effluent turbidity (0.98-15.2 NTU greater
   than mean effluent levels) also occurred immediately after disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{``Off the shelf design{''} principles are applied to fabricate
   injectable poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) hydrogels
   with well-defined thermal phase transitions by mixing two sets of
   aldehyde and hydrazide-functionalized hydrogel precursors, one set with
   a low lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and one set with a high
   LCST, at different ratios. Macroscopically, gelation rates, swelling
   kinetics, degradation kinetics, and mechanical properties of hydrogels
   produced by mixing different precursor polymers can be predicted and
   designed based on the simple rule of mixtures. Microscopically, phase
   separated domains result in localized phase transitions within the
   hydrogels, inducing significant changes in protein affinity, drug
   release kinetics, transparency, and cell adhesion compared to hydrogels
   with only single-LCST precursors that may be leveraged in biomedical
   applications. Such an ``off the shelf{''} design approach involving the
   simple mixing of a limited number (four) of precursor polymers with

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole (PPy) and PPy-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites
   were prepared for charge storage application in electrodes of
   electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). Chemical polymerization of PPy was
   performed using 4-amino-5hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid
   monosodium salt hydrate (AHDA) and diamine green black (DAGB) as new
   anionic dopants. It was found that DAGB improved colloidal stability of
   MWCNT dispersions and allowed the fabrication of PPy coated MWCNT.
   Testing results provided an insight into the influence of the chemical
   structure of the dopants on the microstructure of the PPy-MWCNT
   composites and electrochemical performance. The PPy-MWCNT composites
   showed significant improvement in capacitance, compared to pure PPy
   electrodes for active mass loading of 10 mg cm(-2). The highest
   capacitance of 220 F g(-1) was achieved at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1) for
   PPy coated MWCNT, prepared using DAGB. The capacitance retention at 100
   mV s-1 was found to be 60.9\%. The integral and differential
   capacitances, calculated from the cyclic voltammetry and impedance
   spectroscopy data were analyzed at different conditions. The PPy coated
   MWCNT, prepared using DAGB, were used for the fabrication of symmetric
   devices, containing two similar PPy-MWCNT electrodes and asymmetric
   devices containing PPy-MWCNT positive electrode and vanadium nitride
   (VN)-MWCNT negative electrodes. The asymmetric devices offered
   advantages of higher capacitance, lower impedance, larger voltage window
   and improved power-energy characteristics. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Implantable electrodes with high flexibility, high mechanical fixation
   and low electrochemical impedance are desirable for neuromuscular
   activation because they provide safe, effective and stable stimulation.
   In this paper, we report on detailed materials and electrical analyses
   of three metal implantable electrodes - gold (Au), platinum (Pt) and
   titanium (Ti) - using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning
   acoustic microscopy, drop shape analysis and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. We investigated the cause of changes in electrochemical
   impedance of long-term immersed Au, Pt and Ti electrodes on liquid
   crystal polymers (LCPs) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We analyzed
   the surface wettability, surface and interface defects and the elemental
   depth profile of the electrode-adhesion layers on the LCP. The impedance
   of the electrodes decreased at lower frequencies, but increased at
   higher frequencies compared with that of the short-term immersion. The
   increase of impedances was influenced by the oxidation of the
   electrode/adhesion-layers that affected the double layer capacitance
   behavior of the electrode/PBS. The oxidation of the adhesion layer for
   all the electrodes was confirmed by XPS. Alkali ions (sodium) were
   adsorbed on the Au and Pt surfaces, but diffused into the Ti electrode
   and LCPs. The Pt electrode showed a higher sensitivity to surface and
   interface defects than that of Ti and Au electrodes. These findings may
   be useful when designing electrodes for long-term implantable devices.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2837-2843}},
Abstract = {{In emulsion atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), escape of
   catalytic copper ion species from the particle to the aqueous phase
   represents one of the major challenges which causes uncontrollable
   polymerization and/or unstable latex. We addressed this issue by
   employing a functional surfactant-ligand (SL) design as the capture
   agent (CA), which prevented the copper species from escape in the
   emulsion ATRP. In this work, emulsion ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA)
   mediated CuCl2/4,4-di-(5-nonyl)-2,2'-bipyridine (dNbpy) was carried out
   with Brij-98 as a surfactant in the presence of a small amount of CA.
   The CA molecules effectively captured dissociated copper ions inside the
   particle, thus efficiently decreasing the copper ion concentration in
   the aqueous phase. Only 3 wt\% of surfactant loading (0.6 wt\% CA and
   2.4 wt\% Brij-98 based on MMA) was needed to achieve well-controlled
   ATRP and to stabilize the emulsion system, which is a significant
   reduction from a typical 13-18 wt\% often used in the studies reported
   in the literature.}},

Title = {{Disruption of Cortical Connectivity during Remifentanil Administration

Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{Background: The authors investigated the effect of remifentanil
   administration on resting electroencephalography functional connectivity
   and its relationship to cognitive function and analgesia in healthy
   volunteers.
   Methods: Twenty-one healthy male adult subjects were enrolled in this
   placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study. For each subject, 2.5
   min of multichannel electroencephalography recording, a cognitive test
   of sustained attention (continuous reaction time), and experimental pain
   scores to bone-pressure and heat stimuli were collected before and after
   infusion of remifentanil or placebo. A coherence matrix was calculated
   from the electroencephalogram, and three graph-theoretical measures
   (characteristic path-length, mean clustering coefficient, and relative
   small-worldness) were extracted to characterize the overall cortical
   network properties.
   Results: Compared to placebo, most graph-theoretical measures were
   significantly altered by remifentanil at the alpha and low beta range (8
   to 18 Hz; all P < 0.001). Taken together, these alterations were
   characterized by an increase in the characteristic path-length (alpha
   17\% and low beta range 24\%) and corresponding decrements in mean
   clustering coefficient (low beta range -25\%) and relative
   small-worldness (alpha -17\% and low beta range -42\%). Changes in
   characteristic path-lengths after remifentanil infusion were correlated
   to the continuous reaction time index (r = -0.57; P = 0.009), while no
   significant correlations between graph-theoretical measures and
   experimental pain tests were seen.
   Conclusions: Remifentanil disrupts the functional connectivity network
   properties of the electroencephalogram. The findings give new insight
   into how opioids interfere with the normal brain functions and have the
   potential to be biomarkers for the sedative effects of opioids in
   different clinical settings.}},

   change will test the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin over the next

   to this special issue, this paper presents one plausible 50-year
   scenario of the emergence of these challenges and the region's response
   to them. In it early signs of economic, environmental, and governmental
   vulnerability are not adequately addressed. Investments aren't made to
   provide needed funding for monitoring and evaluation. The region's
   intellectual and environmental capital isn't leveraged, limiting the
   region's ability to address its economic and environmental challenges
   and compete with the rest of the world. The pursuit of local
   self-interest and short-term survival outweighs cooperation across
   jurisdictions and long-term planning. The vision of the future presented
   here is one in which the region's economy is dependent on stagnant
   extractive industries, its ecosystems are compromised, and its global
   standing is greatly reduced. In response to all of these developments,
   by 2063 hopelessness and violent tension is spreading throughout the

Abstract = {{Envisioning possible futures is challenging due to the interactive and
   interdependent nature of myriad anthropogenic pressures on the Great
   Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. To overcome this challenge, we used the
   intuitive logistics method of scenario analysis and identified two
   independent forces of high impact and high uncertainty by engaging a
   broad spectrum of basin stakeholders from academia, government,
   non-governmental organizations, and industry organizations. A workshop
   was held to debate and identify the two key forces among many drivers of
   change for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. From the workshop
   activities, two key forces emerged. The first axis, ``Human Capacity for
   Change,{''} was characterized on its positive end by an adaptive system
   where shared values, collectivism, inclusivity, and a respect for
   obligations by all segments of society are a reality, and on its
   negative end by an individualistic, overly hierarchical, short sighted,
   reactionary, oppressive, and gridlocked governance system. The second
   axis, ``Environment and Economic Balance,{''} was characterized on its
   positive end by a thriving synergy between economy and environment, and
   on its negative end by an environment, economy, or both that were in
   poor shape. The intersection of these axes framed four alternative
   50-year projections, characterized by combinations of their positive
   and/or negative axis end points. These four alternate futures portrayed
   a basin that was: living on the edge (-/+); thriving and prosperous
   (+/+); trying hard to adapt (+/-); and out of control (-/-), and reveal
   policy and strategic research needs and policy recommendations to reach
   a thriving future. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{In this future, citizens of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin
   recognize their dependence upon and became united around a common vision
   for a thriving Great Lakes basin. However, in 2063 the environment and
   economy are out of balance; citizens are constantly forced to make
   difficult trade-offs. Climate warming, geopolitical pressures such as
   environmental refugees, an aging population, and a sluggish economy have
   overwhelmed the region's efforts to find a balance that would have
   ensured human prosperity without diminishing the integrity of the Great
   Lakes basin. This narrative illustrates the time period 2013 to 2063,
   depicting how the collision of multiple drivers of change cause
   declining social and environmental conditions, and force a gradual
   transformation in societal values. While society was initially
   complacent, the groundwork for social transformation was laid over three
   decades. Impacts of education programs, opposition to environmentally
   degrading natural resource extraction, and widespread effects of both
   failing social services and physical infrastructure galvanize grassroots
   mobilization of communities around ``iceless hockey rink{''} meetings.
   These meetings act as a catalyst, translating this social movement into
   governance that works towards a common vision based on shared values.
   However, despite innovative technologies and cohesive efforts, it
   becomes obvious that attempts to oppose the complex and interrelated
   forces driving changes in the Great Lakes region are limited. These
   efforts come at huge economic costs, and the harsh reality forces people
   in the region to make difficult decisions that threaten some facets of
   economic, social and environmental well-being while protecting others.

Abstract = {{In 2063, the Great Lakes-St Lawrence River basin is Living on the Edge
   of system resilience, characterized by poor governance yet good
   environmental/economic balance. The Great Lakes region benefits from and
   depends upon human choices and natural forces outside the region pushing
   and pulling it toward that balance. Choices within the basin are
   insufficient to maintain system resilience, and there is minimal
   government involvement in Great Lakes governance. The Great Lakes region
   perseveres like a pampered but powerless slave, contributing value but
   lacking liberty. The predominant drivers of change that have brought the
   basin to this perpetual knife's-edge existence of dependency are the
   global economy, societal values, and technological innovation. Climate
   change, energy, and demographics in turn drive those drivers on a global
   scale, but the region itself has evaded the most extreme climate-change
   impacts, which proved highly variable through space and time. Global
   changes in energy demand resulted in the most massive investment in
   green energy technology in planetary history, dramatically shifting the
   global demand for wind, solar, wave, and nuclear power. Coupled with
   aggressive pro-business North American policies and endemic
   private-sector intellectual capital, the Great Lakes region reemerged as
   an economic engine to serve the demand. This shift occurred despite the
   death of cooperative federalism and after decades of ideological
   politics gutted science-based, citizen-participatory regulatory
   structures. Governance at local scales remains highly variable, so the
   Great Lakes region rides on the coattails of past policies. This
   scenario represents one of four described in the Great Lakes Futures
   Project. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{Scenario analysis can be a useful tool to explore paths to a desirable
   future. This paper is a `future history' describing the how stakeholders
   in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin of North America rallied to
   confront regional challenges 50 years into the future (2013-2063). This
   future scenario was developed by considering how nine drivers of change
   (aquatic invasive species; biological and chemical contaminants; climate
   change; demographics and societal values; economy; energy; governance
   and geopolitics; water quantity; and technology) might impact the
   region. This ``thriving and prosperous{''} scenario envisions that in
   the beginning, Great Lakes residents, scientists, and policymakers saw
   ``the writing on the wall,{''} recognizing that past approaches to
   environmental policy failed to provide long-term environmental, social,
   and economic prosperity. In response, policymakers in the Great Lakes
   region began formulating and implementing new policies, but actions were
   scattered across the region and uncoordinated across geopolitical
   boundaries. Recognizing the need to coordinate their efforts, Great
   Lakes stakeholders began ``marching in step{''} by agreeing on a common
   set of guiding principles for future policy actions. Building on this
   momentum, Great Lakes policymakers implemented a suite of regulations
   and initiatives that recognized the Great Lakes region as a complex
   social-ecological system. Between 2053 and 2063, the region began to
   reap the benefits of coordinated policy action. By 2063, the Great Lakes
   region showed how a long-term commitment to improving the environment
   can sustain a thriving and prosperous ecosystem and economy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Despite the existence of agreements, legislation, and institutions at
   the international, national, and subnational levels within both Canada
   and the United States, significant policy implementation and reform
   challenges exist for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. The Great
   Lakes Futures Project (GLFP) fostered collaboration among individuals
   from academia, government, industry, nongovernment organizations, and
   others to understand the past, present, and potential futures of the
   Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin, explore in what direction current
   policies are taking us, and assessing how potential changes in policies
   and approaches can move us toward the more desirable future.
   Participants within the GLFP emphasized the importance of stakeholder
   engagement within the policy recommendations and implementation
   strategies for reaching a ``thriving and prosperous{''} future for the
   Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. Here, we propose an implementation
   strategy founded on stakeholder engagement that I) identifies clear
   basin-wide, cross sector, binational, and inclusive priorities, goals,
   objectives and tactics and 2) increases the roles and responsibilities
   of local actors and non-governmental sectors to provide a better balance
   between topdown and bottom-up efforts, all nested within a framework of
   strong stakeholder engagement. In taking such an approach, the GLFP
   presents an opportunity to implement mechanisms for fostering change to
   lead to a more sustainable future for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River
   basin. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{The need for ubiquitous broadband connectivity is continually growing,
   however, radio spectrum is increasingly scarce and limited by
   interference. In addition, the energy efficiency of many radio
   transmitters is low and most input energy is converted to heat. A widely
   overlooked resource for positioning and broadband access is optical
   wireless communication reusing existing illumination installations. As
   many of the 14 billion incandescent bulbs in use worldwide are converted
   to energy efficient LED lighting, a unique opportunity exists to augment
   them with visible light communications (VLC) and visible light
   positioning (VLP). VLC- and VLP-enabled LED lighting is not only energy
   efficient but enables a host of new use cases such as location-aware
   ubiquitous high-speed wireless communication links.
   This talk presents the recent work of the Free-space Optical
   Communication Algorithms Laboratory (FOCAL) at McMaster University in
   Hamilton, Canada in developing novel signaling and indoor localization
   techniques using illumination devices. Developments in the signaling
   design for VLC systems will be presented along with several prototype
   VLC communication systems. Novel approaches to the integration of VLC
   networks with power line communications (PLC) are discussed. The role of
   visible light communications and ranging for automotive safety will also
   be highlighted. Several approaches to indoor positioning using
   illumination devices and simple smartphone-based receivers will be
   presented. Finally, a vision for VLC and VLP technologies will be
   presented along with our ongoing research directions.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the spatial distribution of false alarms is assumed to be
   a non-homogeneous Poisson point (NHPP) process. Then, a new method is
   developed under the kernel density estimation (KDE) framework to
   estimate the spatial intensity of false alarms for the multitarget
   tracking problem. In the proposed method, the false alarm spatial
   intensity estimation problem is decomposed into two subproblems: (i)
   estimating the number of false alarms in one scan and (ii) estimating
   the variation of the intensity function value in the measurement space.
   Under the NHPP assumption, the only parameter that needs to be estimated
   for the first subproblem is the mean of false alarm number, and the
   empirical mean is used here as the maximum likelihood estimate of that
   parameter. Then, for the second subproblem, an online multivariate local
   adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimator is proposed. Furthermore, the
   proposed estimation method is seamlessly integrated with widely used
   multitarget trackers, like the joint integrated probabilistic data
   association algorithm and the multiple hypotheses tracking algorithm.
   Simulation results show that the proposed KDE-based method can provide a
   better estimate of the false alarm spatial intensity and help the
   multitarget trackers yield superior performance in scenarios with
   spatially non-homogeneous false alarms.}},

   requirements for bacterial cell lysis}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1599-1608}},
Abstract = {{Lab-on-a-chip systems used for nucleic acid based detection of bacteria
   rely on bacterial lysis for the release of cellular material. Although
   electrical lysis devices can be miniaturized for on-chip integration and
   reagent-free lysis, they often suffer from high voltage requirements,
   and rely on the use of off-chip voltage supplies. To overcome this
   barrier, we developed a rapid prototyping method for creating
   multi-scale electrodes that are structurally tuned for lowering the
   voltage needed for electrical bacterial lysis. These three-dimensional
   multi-scale electrodes - with micron scale reaction areas and nanoscale
   features - re fabricated using benchtop methods including craft cutting,
   polymer-induced wrinkling, and electrodeposition, which enable a lysis
   device to be designed, fabricated, and optimized in a matter of hours.
   These tunable electrodes show superior behaviour compared to
   lithographically-prepared electrodes in terms of lysis efficiency and
   voltage requirement. Successful extraction of nucleic acids from
   bacterial samples processed by these electrodes demonstrates the
   potential for these rapidly prototyped devices to be integrated within
   practical lab-on-a-chip systems.}},

   without a middle vessel}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{100-112}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a novel semicontinuous process for the separation of
   ternary mixtures is presented. The new semicontinuous without middle
   vessel (SwoMV) configuration is a process intensification technique that
   makes separation of three components to desired purities possible in a
   single distillation column without the necessity of the middle vessel as
   opposed to the conventional semicontinuous processes. The elimination of
   the middle vessel omits the charging and discharging modes of
   conventional semicontinuous processes, reduces the direct costs of plant
   and facilitates the retrofit of available distillation columns for
   purification of new products. Furthermore, SwoMV configuration improves
   the conventional semicontinuous system by reducing the energy
   consumption in most cases and expanding the range of system capacities
   at which it is economically optimal. The separation of benzene, toluene,
   and o-xylene is used as a case study to show the feasibility of the
   SwoMV configuration. An economic analysis is performed, and conventional
   continuous distillation, conventional semicontinuous, SwoMV and single
   side stream column configurations are compared by calculating the total
   annualized cost of these systems over a range of production rates. The
   results show the feasibility, applicability and profitability of the
   novel proposed configuration. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical

Pages = {{1116-1122}},
Abstract = {{Two microfluidic devices (pneumatic chip and FlexiChip) have been
   developed for immobilization and live-intact fluorescence functional
   imaging of Drosophila larva's Central Nervous System (CNS) in response
   to controlled acoustic stimulation. The pneumatic chip is suited for
   automated loading/unloading and potentially allows high throughput
   operation for studies with a large number of larvae while the FlexiChip
   provides a simple and quick manual option for animal loading and is
   suited for smaller studies. Both chips were capable of significantly
   reducing the endogenous CNS movement while still allowing the study of
   sound-stimulated CNS activities of Drosophila 3rd instar larvae using
   genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5. Temporal effects of sound
   frequency (50-5000 Hz) and intensity (95-115 dB) on CNS activities were
   investigated and a peak neuronal response of 200 Hz was identified. Our
   lab-on-chip devices can not only aid further studies of Drosophila
   larva's auditory responses but can be also adopted for functional
   imaging of CNS activities in response to other sensory cues. Auditory
   stimuli and the corresponding response of the CNS can potentially be
   used as a tool to study the effect of chemicals on the neurophysiology
   of this model organism.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The influence of filler selection in wet granulation was studied for the
   novel case where the binder is delivered as an unstable, semi-rigid
   aqueous foam to an extrusion process. The work primarily examined the
   impact of differing concentrations of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel
   PH (R) 101) in a formulation with spray-dried alpha-lactose monohydrate
   (Flowlac (R) 100) in regards to wetting and granule nucleation for this
   relatively new technique known as continuous foam granulation. Foam
   stability was varied within the work to change its drainage and
   coarsening behavior atop these powder excipients, by use of different
   foamable binding agents (METHOCEL (TM) F4 PLV and METHOCEL (TM) Premium
   VLV) as well as by adjusting the foam quality. A static bed penetration
   test was first used to study the foam behavior in wetting these powders
   without the processing constraints of an extruder which limit possible
   liquid-to-solids ratios as well as introduce shear which may complicate
   interpretation of the mechanism. The test found that the penetration
   time to saturate these powders decreased as their water absorption
   capacity increased which in turn decreased the size of the formed
   nuclei. Differences in the stability of the foamed binder had minimal
   influence on these attributes of wetting despite its high spread-to-soak
   behavior. The size of granules produced by extrusion similarly
   demonstrated sensitivity to the increasing water absorption capacity of
   the filler and little dependency on foam properties. The different
   liquid-to-solids ratios required to granulate these different
   formulations inside the extruder highlighted an evolving concept of
   powder lubricity for continuous foam granulation.}},

Abstract = {{A major issue in the therapeutic use of tissue plasminogen activator

   (t-PA/AuNP) conjugate prepared via bio-affinity ligation under
   physiological conditions. The ligation is based on the specific
   interactions between t-PA and epsilon-lysine (a ligand that has affinity
   to a specific domain in t-PA) immobilized on the AuNP surface through
   polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a spacer. The conjugate can not only
   retain almost full enzymatic activity and clot dissolving efficiency,
   but also protect t-PA from inhibition by PAI-1 to some extent as
   compared with free t-PA in vitro. Moreover, the conjugate showed
   prolonged circulation time in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the self-excited oscillations of two co-planar
   air jets impinging on each other, referred to, hereafter, by opposing
   planar jets. The study is performed for a single jet thickness of h = 2
   mm and a span-wise aspect ratio of 50. The effects of flow velocity of
   the jets and the distance between them are examined. The opposing planar
   jets are found to produce strong acoustic tones over a wide range of jet
   Mach number and separation distance. Phase-locked averaged particle
   image velocity measurements showed that the tone is generated by
   out-of-phase flapping oscillations of the planar jets. These
   oscillations are sustained by two effects. The first is the high
   stagnation pressure at the impingement region, which deflects the jets
   laterally in opposite directions away from their common centerline,
   while the second effect is the cross stream oscillating velocity in the
   entrainment regions around the jet exits, which forces the jets back
   towards their common centerline. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid asymptotic-numerical method is formulated and implemented to
   accurately calculate the mean first passage time (MFPT) for the expected
   time needed for a predator to locate small patches of prey in a 2-D
   landscape. In our analysis, the movement of the predator can have both a
   random and a directed component, where the diffusivity of the predator
   is isotropic but possibly spatially heterogeneous. Our singular
   perturbation methodology, which is based on the assumption that the
   ratio of the radius of a typical prey patch to that of the overall
   landscape is asymptotically small, leads to the derivation of an
   algebraic system that determines the MFPT in terms of parameters
   characterizing the shapes of the small prey patches together with a
   certain Green's function, which in general must be computed numerically.
   The expected error in approximating the MFPT by our semi-analytical
   procedure is smaller than any power of , so that our approximation of
   the MFPT is still rather accurate at only moderately small prey patch
   radii. Overall, our hybrid approach has the advantage of eliminating the
   difficulty with resolving small spatial scales in a full numerical
   treatment of the partial differential equation (PDE). Similar
   semi-analytical methods are also developed and implemented to accurately
   calculate related quantities such as the variance of the mean first
   passage time (VMFPT) and the splitting probability. Results for the
   MFPT, the VMFPT, and splitting probability obtained from our hybrid
   methodology are validated with corresponding results computed from full
   numerical simulations of the underlying PDEs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an engine fault detection and classification technique
   using vibration data in the crank angle domain is presented. These data
   are used in conjunction with artificial neural networks (ANNs), which
   are applied to detect faults in a four-stroke gasoline engine built for
   experimentation. A comparative study is provided between the popular
   backpropagation (BP) method, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method, the
   quasi-Newton (QN) method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the
   smooth variable structure filter (SVSF). The SVSF is a relatively new
   estimation strategy, based on the sliding mode concept. It has been
   formulated to efficiently train ANNs and is consequently referred to as
   the SVSF-ANN. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with the
   standard accuracy of the Kalman-based filters and the popular BP
   algorithms in an effort to validate the SVSF-ANN performance and
   application to engine fault detection and classification. The
   customizable fault diagnostic system is able to detect known engine
   faults with various degrees of severity, such as defective lash
   adjuster, piston chirp (PC), and chain tensioner (CT) problems. The
   technique can be used at any dealership or assembly plant to
   considerably reduce warranty costs for the company and manufacturer.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a wireless mesh network (WMN), where a number of
   access points (APs) form a wireless infrastructure and provide
   communications to the mobile stations (MSs). Different APs share the
   same frequency channel. We study how to provide fair long-term
   throughput for the MSs while efficiently utilizing the channel resources
   through effective handoff management and channel timeline allocations,
   where the channel time is allocated at two levels: first among the APs
   and then among the MSs. An optimization problem is first formulated and
   solved. The optimum solution is based on the assumption of having global
   information about the channel conditions of all the MSs and cannot be
   easily implemented in a practical WMN. Two distributed schemes are
   proposed by decoupling the handoff management and channel time
   allocations. The HO-CA scheme performs heuristic handoff decisions for
   the MSs based on their link gains to nearby APs and then optimizes the
   channel time allocations through an iterative process. The CA-HO scheme
   allocates the channel time to individual APs based on interfering
   relationship of the APs and then allows the MSs to make handoff
   decisions based on possible utilities from nearby APs. In both schemes,
   individual APs solve a local optimization problem to allocate channel
   time for their associated MSs. Numerical results indicate that both the
   proposed schemes can achieve very good fairness and that the HO-CA
   scheme achieves higher throughput.}},

Title = {{Modeling the impacts of dryland agricultural reclamation on groundwater
   resources in Northern Egypt using sparse data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{520}},
Pages = {{420-438}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Demand for freshwater in many dryland environments is exerting negative
   impacts on the quality and availability of groundwater resources,
   particularly in areas where demand is high due to irrigation or
   industrial water requirements to support dryland agricultural
   reclamation. Often however, information available to diagnose the
   drivers of groundwater degradation and assess management options through
   modeling is sparse, particularly in low and middle-income countries.
   This study presents an approach for generating transient groundwater
   model inputs to assess the long-term impacts of dryland agricultural
   land reclamation on groundwater resources in a highly data-sparse
   context. The approach was applied to the area of Wadi El Natrun in
   Northern Egypt, where dryland reclamation and the associated water use
   has been aggressive since the 1960s. Statistical distributions of water
   use information were constructed from a variety of sparse field and
   literature estimates and then combined with remote sensing data in
   spatio-temporal infilling model to produce the groundwater model inputs
   of well-pumping and surface recharge. An ensemble of groundwater model
   inputs were generated and used in a 3D groundwater flow (MODFLOW) of
   Wadi El Natrun's multi-layer aquifer system to analyze trends in water
   levels and water budgets over time. Validation of results against
   monitoring records, and model performance statistics demonstrated that
   despite the extremely sparse data, the approach used in this study was
   capable of simulating the cumulative impacts of agricultural land
   reclamation reasonably well. The uncertainty associated with the
   groundwater model itself was greater than that associated with the
   ensemble of well-pumping and surface recharge estimates. Water budget
   analysis of the groundwater model output revealed that groundwater
   recharge has not changed significantly over time, while pumping has. As
   a result of these trends, groundwater was estimated to be in a deficit
   of approximately 24 billion m(3) (+/- 15\%) in 2011, compared to 1957. A
   significant trend in water level declines beginning in the 1990s that
   has been observed in monitoring records was evident in the model results
   and is directly attributed to abstraction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Conditional averaging techniques were used to examine the periodic
   motions that were observed in flows consisting of an offset planar jet
   and a co-flowing planar wall jet. The offset jet is one jet height (H-j)
   away from the wall and has a Reynolds number of approximately 40, 000,
   based on H-j and flow-rate averaged velocity U-o; for the co-flowing
   jets, different heights (i.e., 0.18H(j) and 0.5H(j)) and velocities
   (i.e., 0.56U(o) and 0.36U(o)) were considered. The flows had periodic
   motions with frequencies fH(j)/U-o = 0.28 and 0.49 or fH(c)/U-o = 0.23
   and 0.25, where H-c is the distance between the jets. The periodic
   motions were present in both the inner shear layer of the offset jet
   above the re-circulation region and the outer shear layer of the wall
   jet below the re-circulation region. The motions from the inner shear
   layer of the offset jet persisted in the shear layer that formed
   downstream of the re-circulating region. There were periodic motions in
   the outer shear layer of the offset jet particularly in the flow with
   the smaller wall jet. The relative contribution of the motions to the
   total fluctuations increased as the flow evolved downstream reaching a
   maximum approximately 4H(c) downstream of the flow exit. The relative
   contribution of the periodic motions to the turbulent fluctuations was
   similar in the two flows but the periodic motions had a much larger
   impact on the near-wall velocity and pressure fluctuations in the flow
   with the smaller wall jet due to the trajectory of the periodic
   structures, the distance of the periodic structures to the wall and the
   size of these structures.}},

Abstract = {{Osseointegration, the direct bonding of titanium implant materials with
   bone, is critical for implant success where nanostructured surface
   features contribute to nano-osseointegration. However, we also know that
   features and processes on the microscale influence the biocompatibility

   scale analyses, focusing on three-dimensional techniques, ranging from
   X-ray microcomputed tomography, to focused ion beam, to high resolution
   electron tomography to identify markers of osseointegration. A titanium
   implant with modified biomimetic coating studied in vitro and in vivo at
   various time points is used to exemplify the complementary information
   gained from three-dimensional analyses from the micro-to nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{With the dramatic improvement in the spatial resolution of scanning
   transmission electron microscopes over the past few decades, the
   tolerance of a specimen to the high-energy electron beam becomes the
   limiting factor for the quality of images and spectra obtained.
   Therefore, a deep understanding of the beam irradiation processes is
   crucial to extend the applications of electron microscopy. In this
   paper, we report the structural evolution of a selected oxide, MgAl2O4,
   under an 80 keV focused electron probe so that the beam irradiation
   process is not dominated by the knock-on mechanism. The formation of
   peroxyl bonds and the assisted atomic migration were studied using
   imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopic techniques. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Uncertainties in nuclear data are a fundamental source of uncertainty in
   reactor physics calculations. To determine their contribution to
   uncertainties in calculated reactor physics parameters, a nuclear data
   sensitivity and uncertainty study is performed on the Canadian
   supercritical water reactor (SCWR) concept. The nuclear data uncertainty
   contributions to the neutron multiplication factor k(eff) are 6.31 mk
   for the SCWR at the beginning of cycle (BOC) and 6.99 mk at the end of
   cycle (EOC). Both of these uncertainties have a statistical uncertainty
   of 0.02 mk. The nuclear data uncertainty contributions to Coolant Void
   Reactivity (CVR) are 1.0 mk and 0.9 mk for BOC and EOC, respectively,
   both with statistical uncertainties of 0.1 mk. The nuclear data
   uncertainty contributions to other reactivity parameters range from as
   low as 3\% of to as high as ten times the values of the reactivity
   coefficients. The largest contributors to the uncertainties in the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a simple, yet reliable methodology to expedite
   yield estimation and optimization of microwave structures. In our
   approach, the analysis of the entire response of the structure at hand
   (e.g., S-parameters as a function of frequency) is replaced by response
   surface modeling of suitably selected feature points. On the one hand,
   this is sufficient to determine whether a design satisfies given
   performance specifications. On the other, by exploiting the almost
   linear dependence of the feature points on the designable parameters of
   the structure, reliable yield estimates can be realized at low
   computational cost. Our methodology is verified using two examples of
   waveguide filters and one microstrip hairpin filter and compared with
   conventional Monte Carlo analysis based on repetitive electromagnetic
   simulations, as well as with statistical analysis exploiting linear
   response expansions around the nominal design. Finally, we perform
   yield-driven design optimizations on these filters.}},

Abstract = {{Strengthening in age-hardenable alloys is mainly achieved through
   nano-scale precipitates whose formation paths from the atomic-scale,

   leading to three successive variants of face-centered cubic (fcc)
   clusters, followed by the formation of non-fcc GP-zones. The clusters,
   which originally assume a spherical morphology (Cl), evolve into
   elongated clusters and orient themselves on \{111\}(Al), (C2) and
   subsequently on \{100\}(Al) planes and < 100 >(Al) directions (C3). We
   also analyze the association of quenched-in dislocations with clustering
   phenomena. The results of this work can open a new frontier in advancing
   alloy-process-property design for commercially important age-hardenable

Abstract = {{Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a new technique for
   quantifying magnetic susceptibility. It has already found various
   applications in quantifying in vivo iron content, calcifications and
   changes in venous oxygen saturation. The accuracy of susceptibility
   mapping is dependent on several factors. In this review, we evaluate the
   entire process of QSM from data acquisition to individual data
   processing steps. We also show preliminary results of several new
   concepts introduced in this review in an attempt to improve the quality
   and accuracy for certain steps. The uncertainties in estimating
   susceptibility differences using susceptibility maps, phase images, and
   T-2{*} maps are analyzed and compared. Finally, example clinical
   applications are presented. We conclude that QSM holds great promise in
   quantifying iron and becoming a standard clinical tool. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We report the evaluation of lignin for the development of
   high-performance broad-spectrum sunscreens. Lignin is added into several
   commercial sunscreen products. Significant enhancements in ultraviolet
   (UV) absorbance are observed. The results show that the sunscreen effect
   of sun protection factor (SPF) 15 could reach that of SPF 30 with the
   addition of 2 wt\% lignin. Adding 10 wt\% lignin makes SPF 15 outperform
   SPF 50. It is also interesting to find that the sunscreen performance
   improves with UV-radiation time. After 2 h of UV radiation, the UV
   absorbance of the 10 wt\% lignin SPF 15 lotion increases dramatically.
   This has been attributed to certain synergistic effects between lignin
   and other sunscreen actives in the lotions, as well as the antioxidant
   property of lignin. This nature-inspired lignin system may provide a
   green alternative to replace some synthetic sunscreen actives.}},

Abstract = {{A quadratically constrained minimum dispersion (QCMD) beamformer that is
   robust against model uncertainties is devised for non-Gaussian signals.
   Different from the minimum variance based beamformers, the QCMD
   beamformer minimizes the l(p)-norm (p >= 1) of the output while
   constraining the magnitude response of any steering vector within a
   spherical uncertainty set to exceed unity. A gradient projection
   algorithmic framework is proposed to efficiently solve the resulting
   convex optimization problem instead of directly applying the standard
   optimization algorithm which has a high computational complexity. In
   each iteration, the gradient projection updates the solution along the
   gradient direction and projects it back to the constraint set.
   Importantly, a closed-form expression of the projection onto the
   constraint set is derived, which only needs a low complexity of with
   being the sensor number. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is much
   faster and simpler to implement compared with the standard method. In
   addition, the robust constant modulus beamformer (RCMB) is also
   discussed as a special case of the QCMD beamformer. Simulation results
   demonstrate the efficiency of the gradient projection algorithm and
   superiority of the QCMD beamformer over several representative robust
   beamformers, indicating that it can approach the optimal performance
   bound.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which austenite particles coarsen in a delta-ferrite
   matrix was investigated in a model Al-containing steel. Special emphasis
   was placed on the effect of volume fraction on the coarsening kinetics
   as well as the ability of the particles to pin the growth of
   delta-ferrite grains. The specimens were heated to temperatures in the
   range of 1123 K to 1583 K (850 A degrees C to 1305 A degrees C) in the
   austenite plus delta-ferrite two-phase region and held for times between
   5 minutes and 288 hours, followed by water quenching. When the reheating
   temperature was higher than 1473 K (1200 A degrees C), the coarsening of
   austenite particles was found to evolve as t (1/3), which is typical of
   volume diffusion-controlled behavior. For lower temperatures, the
   particle coarsening behavior followed t (1/4) kinetics which is
   consistent with a grain boundary diffusion-controlled process. The
   observations were interpreted in terms of the modified
   Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wanger theory by considering multi-component diffusion,
   particle volume fraction, and the fact that this two-phase material is a
   non-ideal solid solution. Three types of interaction between particle
   coarsening and grain growth were observed. Grain growth was completely
   pinned when the particle pinning force was much larger than the driving
   force for grain growth. When the particle pinning force was comparable
   to the driving force for grain growth, the delta-ferrite grains were
   observed to grow at a rate which is controlled by the kinetics of
   coarsening of the austenite particles. Finally, when the particle
   pinning force was smaller than the driving force for grain growth,
   significant grain growth occurred but its rate was lower than that
   expected in the absence of particle pinning. The results point to an
   effective approach for controlling grain growth at high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve a fine uniform grain-size distribution using the
   process of thin slab casting and directing rolling (TSCDR), it is

   Coarsening Mechanism and Particle Pinning Effects, a new steel
   composition which uses a small volume fraction of austenite particles to
   pin the growth of delta-ferrite grains at high temperature was proposed
   and grain growth was studied in reheated samples. This paper will focus
   on the development of a simple laboratory-scale setup to simulate
   thin-slab casting of the newly developed steel and demonstrate the
   potential for grain size control under industrial conditions. Steel bars
   with different diameters are briefly dipped into the molten steel to
   create a shell of solidified material. These are then cooled down to
   room temperature at different cooling rates. During cooling, the
   austenite particles nucleate along the delta-ferrite grain boundaries
   and greatly retard grain growth. With decreasing temperature, more
   austenite particles precipitate, and grain growth can be completely
   arrested in the holding furnace. Additional applications of the model
   alloy are discussed including grain-size control in the heat affected
   zone in welds and grain-growth resistance at high temperature.}},

   Space-Time Float Prisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Space and time planning of construction activities is a key factor
   affecting safety and field performance in construction sites. When
   scheduling and controlling linear projects, identification of potential
   congestion and/or idling can assist in the timely execution of a
   project. With the advent of location-aware technologies, it becomes
   possible to track availability of resources in (quasi-) real time during
   project execution. This provides better oversight over the movement of
   materials, equipment, and workforce in the jobsite. Space and time
   floats are currently defined and used separately in the scheduling
   literature. In this paper, the concept of space-time floats is proposed
   as a new type of float to simultaneously consider space and time
   constraints. Space-time floats are envelopes for all possible movement
   patterns that an activity or its associated resources can take
   considering the time and space constraints of that activity.
   Simultaneous consideration of space and time floats makes it possible to
   trade-off one for the other, which is the significance of this new
   float. Introduction of the space-time floats into the schedules offers
   new possibilities to forecast the availability of resources at a
   specific time and location. Use of the space-time float for each
   activity also enables the scheduling and control methods to forecast
   potential zones and times of congestion between activities and detect
   activity idle times as well as actual and/or potential delays.
   Eliminating congestions and potential risks for delays have been shown
   to offer considerable advantages for linear projects. Generation of
   space-time float for each activity in the project also helps the project
   team to be informed about the space and time available to them at each
   time and location, respectively. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining the protein activity and stability under acidic conditions
   is important in bioengineering and biomedical applications.
   Polyelectrolyte conjugation as a means of stabilizing proteins has
   received much recent attention. Retention of protein activity, and
   especially, improvement of protein stability by minimizing the number of
   polymer chains in the conjugate, as well as by choosing the optimal site
   for conjugation, is critical in practical applications. In this
   research, the cationic polyelectrolyte poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl
   methacrylate) (pDMAEMA) was conjugated to the inorganic pyrophosphatase
   (PPase) site specifically. Conjugation of pDMAEMA to the specific site
   N124 on the protein surface led to a significant increase in activity at
   acidic pH. At pH 4.0, the activity of the pDMAEMA-conjugated protein was
   increased 3-fold relative to the unconjugated one. Dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) measurements showed that the aggregation state of the
   protein depended on the polymer charge as the pH was varied. Protein
   aggregation at low pH was prevented by pDMAEMA conjugation, resulting in
   an increase in protein stability under acidic conditions. The conjugate
   retained 60\% of its initial activity after 4 h at pH 4.0, whereas the
   unconjugated protein lost 40\% of its initial activity within 15 min at
   this pH. These results suggest an approach for preserving the protein
   activity and stability at low pH based on site-specific polyelectrolyte
   conjugation to the protein surface, thereby providing a new strategy for
   expanding the use of proteins in an acidic environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the retest of a set of Neoprene (Polychloroprene)
   steel reinforced elastomeric isolator bearings that were originally
   tested as part of an experimental program in 1981. The original bearings
   were tested on a shake table as a demonstration of the feasibility of
   base isolation for the seismic protection of buildings. Two types of
   bearings were provided, and not all were used. The unused bearings were
   stored unloaded at room temperature for over 30years. Although there has
   been a very substantial improvement in the number and quality of the
   instrumentation available to the test program over the span of 30years,
   it is possible to compare the results of relatively similar shake table
   tests on the bearings. The shake table tests are used to assess the
   changes in the horizontal stiffness and damping values for the bearings
   over this period. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown many times that cosputtering low-friction coatings of
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) with other
   elements can improve the structural, mechanical, and tribological
   properties. To achieve the lowest friction, MoS2 or WS2 should be doped
   with element(s) improving the hardness and density of the coatings. On
   the other hand, such elements, or their compounds, should not be present
   in the outermost molecular layers at the sliding interface. This article
   suggests that there are important differences between how MoS2 and WS2
   coatings respond to or react with doping elements, despite the almost
   identical structure and behavior of the undoped materials. Two systems
   have been investigated by high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) electron energy loss
   spectroscopy (EELS), W-S-C-Cr and W-S-C-Ti, and showed significant
   amounts of oxides, which typically formed a layer just underneath the
   crystalline WS2 top layer. Further, carbon was almost completely absent
   in the tribofilms, despite the fact that the as-deposited coatings
   contained as much as 40-50 at\% C. An interesting observation here is
   that WS2 basal planes surround or embed Fe wear particles, suggesting a
   relatively strong adhesion or a Fe-S chemical bonding between iron/steel
   and WS2. The result of this is that the wear particles become pacified
   and remain in the contact as low-friction material.}},

Abstract = {{Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are coated with nitrogen doped

   discharge of the supercapacitor, also fully regenerating the electrode

   testing of anionic and cationic dyes and analysis of the influence of
   dye concentration, charge as well as charge to mass ratio on the
   capacitance, impedance, specific power and energy of the devices. Cyclic
   voltammetry and chronopotentiometry data, obtained in different voltage
   windows, are used for the optimization of device performance. The
   discussion of quartz crystal microbalance data provides an insight into

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation is concerned with detecting design errors that
   escape to silicon prototypes and need to be fixed before committing to
   high-volume manufacturing. Electrical errors are particularly difficult
   to catch during the pre-silicon phase because of the insufficient
   accuracy of device models, which is often traded-off against simulation
   time. This challenge is further aggravated by the rising number of
   voltage domains, especially if subtle errors are excited in unique
   electrical states. Since these electrically-induced subtle errors most
   commonly manifest in the logic domain as bit-flips, to the best of our
   knowledge there are no systematic methods to design embedded hardware
   monitors for generic logic blocks that can detect bit-flips with low
   detection latency. Toward this goal, we propose a methodology that
   relies on design assertions that are ranked based on their potential to
   detect bit-flips and subsequently mapped into user-constrained embedded
   hardware monitors with the aim to increase bit-flip coverage estimate.}},

Abstract = {{Criteria which stipulate the minimum pressure at which water is to be
   delivered to customers from a water distribution system (WDS) differ
   around the world. Thus, interestingly, the pressure delivered to a
   customer might be judged high enough to meet standards in some
   countries, while water delivered under the same pressure in other
   countries is considered unacceptable. This paper provides a description
   of consequences and implications of changes in the minimum pressure
   criterion (MPC) to WDS design. Reducing the MPC may cause a decrease in
   pressure-based demands such as faucet, showers, and lawn watering and
   also improve system performance through reduced energy use, leakage, and
   the frequency of pipe breaks. However, lowering this criterion may make
   the system more susceptible to low pressure failures, either hydraulic
   (e.g., an inability to supply the required flow) or safety related
   (e.g., increasing the risk of an intrusion event associated with
   hydraulic transients). Therefore, there should be a clear understanding
   of the consequences and challenges prior to changes the MPC. Moreover,
   policies to control and avoid low pressure events are seldom fully
   linked to the value of the minimum pressure standard and the issue how
   the MPC is enforced/ensured in WDSs. The inter-related issues associated

Title = {{First-principles investigations of Mn doped zinc-blende ZnO based

Abstract = {{ZnO based magnetic semiconductors are intensively investigated because
   of showing strong potential as base materials for spintronic devices. In
   this study, full potential linearized augmented plane-wave plus local
   orbitals FP-L(APW+lo) scheme of computation is used to explore the
   structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Manganesedoped ZiaO
   based magnetic semiconductors in zinc-blende (ZB) phase. For
   comprehensive understanding of Mn-doping effect on ZnO, several
   compositions of Mn:ZnO for 12.5\%, 25\%, 37.5\%, 50\%, 62.5\%, 75\% and
   87.5\% of Mn concentration are investigated. Our obtained results show a
   successful induction of the magnetic moment (MM) by Mn-doping into the
   ZnO matrix, without any geometrical deformation. However a marginal
   increase in the value of lattice constants is found up to 25\%
   concentration of Mn for this system and for above compositions, it tends
   to decrease revealing the formation of secondary phases. It is also
   found that Mn:ZnO system favors ferromagnetic coupling for 12.5\% and
   25\% of Mn contents that has been switched to anti-ferromagnetic
   coupling for higher Mn contents. The spin polarized electronic structure
   of Mn:ZnO system was calculated within the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA). In addition, the Hubbard parameter was also
   employed to improve the electronic band structure calculations. The
   calculations performed at GGA+U level related to electronic band
   structures show zero energy gap for majority spin carriers, whereas a
   considerable energy gap is noted for minority spin carriers. This
   distinguished response of Mn-ZnO system to majority and minority spin
   carriers, in terms of resistivity and conductivity, highlights its
   importance for diverse applications as based material in spintronic
   devices like spin dependent transports, currents and other spin based
   electronic applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with particle subgrid scale (SGS) modelling in
   large-eddy simulations (LESs) of particle-laden turbulence. Although
   many particle-laden LES studies have neglected the effect of the SGS on
   the particles, several particle SGS models have been proposed in the
   literature. In this research, the approximate deconvolution method (ADM)
   and the stochastic models of Fukagata et al. (Dynamics of Brownian
   particles in a turbulent channel flow, Heat Mass Transf. 40 (2004),
   715-726) Shotorban and Mashayek (A stochastic model for particle motion
   in large-eddy simulation, J. Turbul. 7 (2006), 1-13) and Berrouk et al.
   (Stochastic modelling of inertial particle dispersion by subgrid motion
   for LES of high Reynolds number pipe flow, J. Turbul. 8 (2007), pp.
   1-20) are analysed. The particle SGS models are assessed using both a
   priori and a posteriori simulations of inertial particles in a periodic
   box of decaying, homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with an initial
   Reynolds number of Re-lambda = 74. The model results are compared with
   particle statistics from a direct numerical simulation (DNS). Particles
   with a large range of Stokes numbers are tested using various filter
   sizes and stochastic model constant values. Simulations with and without
   gravity are performed to evaluate the ability of the models to account
   for the crossing trajectory and continuity effects. The results show
   that ADM improves results but is only capable of recovering a portion of
   the SGS turbulent kinetic energy. Conversely, the stochastic models are
   able to recover sufficient SGS energy, but show a large range of results
   dependent on the Stokes number and filter size. The stochastic models
   generally perform best at small Stokes numbers, but are unable to
   predict preferential concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium alloys under cyclic shear show different deformation behaviour

   slips and the simultaneous activation of deformation twinning and

Abstract = {{With the highest content of primary amine functional groups of any
   polymer, polyvinylamine (PVAm) is a potent tool for the modification of
   macroscopic and nanoparticle surfaces. Based on the free radical

   prepared as linear polymers (0.8 kDa to >1 MDa), microgels, macrogels,
   and copolymers. The amine groups serve as reaction sites for grafting
   PVAm to surfaces and for the preparation of derivatives. Coupling
   low-molecular-weight molecules and oligomers gives PVAm-X, where X
   includes hydrophobes, carbohydrate oligomers, proteins, TEMPO
   (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), phenylboronic acids, and
   fluorocarbons. This contribution highlights the use of PVAm and PVAm-X
   to modify solid surface properties. Where possible, the PVAm properties

   polyethylenimine, polyallylamine, and chitosan.}},

Abstract = {{In the presence of pre-dispersion, an exact solution of nonlinear
   Schrodinger equation (NLSE) is derived for impulse input. The phase
   factor of the exact solution is obtained in a closed form using the
   exponential integral. The nonlinear interaction among periodically
   placed impulses launched at the input is investigated, and the condition
   under which these pulses do not exchange energy is examined. It is found
   that if the complex weights of the impulses at the input have a
   secant-hyperbolic envelope and a proper chirp factor, they will
   propagate over long distances without exchanging energy. To describe
   their interaction, a discrete version of NLSE is derived. The derived
   equation is a form of discrete self-trapping (DST) equation, which is
   found to admit fundamental and higher order soliton solutions in the
   presence of high pre-dispersion. Nonlinear eigen-modes derived here may
   be useful for description of signal propagation and nonlinear
   interaction in highly pre-dispersion fiber-optic systems. (c) 2014

Title = {{On the solubility advantage of a pharmaceutical's glassy state over the

Journal = {{THERMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{598}},
Pages = {{16-27}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{At equilibrium, the saturation solubility and vapor pressure of a
   material in a state of high free energy are greater than in its state of
   low free energy. This knowledge from classical thermodynamics is
   currently used for increasing the solubility of crystalline
   pharmaceuticals by producing them in their glassy state, or in other
   solid states of high free energy. The ratio of the apparent saturation
   solubility of these solids to that of a crystal, calculated from the
   thermodynamic data of the pure solute, phi(cal), is called the
   solubility advantage, and it is used as a guide for increasing the
   solubility of a pharmaceutical. We argue that the phi(cal) differs from
   the measured solubility ratio, phi(meas), because, (i) phi(cal) is
   independent of the solvent, but phi(meas) is not so, (ii) phi(cal) would
   increase with the dissolution time monotonically to a constant value,
   but phi(meas) would first reach a maximum and then decrease, and (iii)
   approximations are made in estimating phi(cal) and the effect of thermal
   history on high free energy solids is ignored. On the other hand,
   phi(meas) is affected by, (a) another chemical equilibrium in the
   solution, e.g., hydrogen-bond formation and ionic dissociation, (b) the
   production method and thermal history of a glass or an amorphous
   samples, and (c) mutarotation in the solution, isomerization or
   tautomeric conversion in the solid. We also discuss the effects of
   structural relaxation and crystallization on phi(meas). The phi(meas)
   value of a (crystal) polymorph would be affected by all the three, and
   further if the polymorph is orientationally disordered. We provide
   evidence for these effects from analysis of the known data. The
   phi(meas) value is preferable over phi(cal). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{271}},
Pages = {{360-365}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Excessive amounts of ammonia are known to inhibit exoelectrogenic
   activities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, the threshold
   ammonia concentration that triggers toxic effects is not consistent
   among literature papers, indicating that ammonia inhibition can be
   affected by other operational factors. Here, we examined the effect of
   substrate concentration and feed frequency on the capacity of
   exoelectrogenic bacteria to resist against ammonia inhibition. The high
   substrate condition (2 g L-1 sodium acetate, 2-day feed) maintained high
   electricity generation (between 1.1 and 1.9 W m(-2)) for total ammonia
   concentration up to 4000 mg-N L-1. The less frequent feed condition (2 g
   L-1 sodium acetate, 6-day feed) and the low substrate condition (0.67 g
   L-1 sodium acetate, 2-day feed) resulted in substantial decreases in
   electricity generation at total ammonia concentration of 2500 and 3000
   mg-N L-1, respectively. It was determined that the power density curve
   serves as a better indicator than continuously monitored electric
   current for predicting ammonia inhibition in MFCs. The chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) removal gradually decreased at high ammonia concentration
   even without ammonia inhibition in electricity generation. The
   experimental results demonstrated that high substrate concentration and
   frequent feed substantially enhance the capacity of exoelectrogenic
   bacteria to resist against ammonia inhibition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Biosensing platforms are ideal for addressing the diagnostic needs of
   resource-poor areas; however, the translation of such systems from the
   laboratory to the point-of-need has been a slow process. Rapid
   prototyping methods that enable an application-specific biosensor to be
   created in a matter of hours from design to fabrication would expedite
   the clinical and field testing of such systems. Here, we demonstrate a
   benchtop method based on craft cutting and polymer-induced wrinkling for
   creating multiplexed electrochemical DNA biosensors. This fabrication
   method allows multiscale wrinkled electrodes with features in the
   millimeter to nanometer length scales to be created in a matter of
   hours. These wrinkled electrodes display an enhanced surface area
   compared to planar electrodes and are shown to be structurally tunable
   by changing the film thickness. We demonstrate that structural
   tunability of these electrodes is translatable to functional tunability
   as the density of surface-immobilized probe molecules can be manipulated
   using wrinkled electrodes of different thicknesses. Furthermore, a
   simple proof-of-concept electrocatalytic DNA biosensor is demonstrated
   for distinguishing between complementary and noncomplementary
   oligonucleotides.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting RNA-partner interactions in cells is often difficult due to a
   lack of suitable tools. Here we describe a dual reporter system capable
   of detecting intracellular interactions in which one of the partners is
   an RNA. The system utilizes two fluorescent proteins with similar
   maturation rates but distinct spectral properties, specifically cyan
   fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). By
   placing the CFP gene upstream and the YFP gene downstream of an RNA gene
   of interest, the production of YFP becomes sensitive to RNA-partner
   interaction, whereas the synthesis of CFP is not disturbed. Therefore,
   the RNA-partner interaction can be simply measured by the change in the
   ratio of fluorescence of YFP over CFP. The utility of our approach is
   demonstrated through verification of three known RNA-partner
   interactions in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Our two-reporter
   strategy should be broadly useful to the study of RNA-targeted
   interactions in bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The etching of native oxides on compound semiconductors is an important
   step in the production of electronic and optoelectronic devices.
   Although it is known that the native oxide on CdTe can be etched through
   a rinsing in purified water, a deeper investigation into this process
   has not been done. Here we present results on both surface morphology
   changes and reaction rates for purified water etching of the native
   oxide on heteroepitaxial CdTe thin films, as studied by atomic force
   microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Together with a
   characterization of both the structure and stoichiometry of the initial
   native oxide, we show how an altering of the pH-level of the etchant
   will affect the etching rates. If oxide regrowth was allowed, constant
   etching rates could be observed for all etchants, while a logarithmic
   decrease in oxide thickness was observed if regrowth was inhibited. Both
   acidic and basic etchants proved to be more efficient than neutral
   water.}},

   high PPy to current collector mass ratio. The specific capacitance of
   4.2 F cm(-2) is achieved at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1). The analysis of
   electrochemical testing results provides an insight into the influence
   of the chemical structure of amaranth on microstructure, electrochemical
   properties and cycling stability of PPy. New method is introduced for
   the fabrication of PPy coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The
   use of amaranth allows fine microstructure of PPy coatings formed on
   MWCNT, which are well dispersed in the presence of pyrocatechol violet
   dispersant. The use of PPy coated MWCNT allows significant improvement
   in capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates, compared to
   pure PPy material, and good cycling stability of individual electrodes

Abstract = {{Identification of faults in process systems can be based purely on
   measurement (e.g. PCA), or can exploit knowledge of process model
   structure to construct a causal network. This work introduces a method
   to identify most likely causal network in cases when process model is
   not known. An incidence matrix, showing location of measurements in the
   plant network structure, and historical process data are used to
   identify the optimal causal network structure by means of maximizing
   Bayesian scores for alternative causal networks. Causal subnetworks,
   corresponding to subgraphs of the process network, are identified by
   finding the most probable graph based on highest posterior probability
   of graph features computed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation.
   Novel Bayesian contribution indices within the probabilistic graphical
   network are proposed to identify the potential root-cause variables.
   Application to Tennessee Eastman Chemical plant demonstrates that the

Abstract = {{This work uses multi-period, inventory pinch-based algorithm with
   continuous-time model (MPIP-C algorithm(1)) for scheduling linear or
   nonlinear blending processes. MPIP-C decomposes the scheduling problem
   into (i) approximate scheduling and (ii) detailed scheduling.
   Approximate scheduling model is further decomposed into two parts: a
   level model which optimizes nonlinear blend models (with time periods
   delineated by inventory pinch points), and a 2nd level multi-period
   mixed-integer linear programming model (which uses fixed blend recipes
   from the level solution) to determine optimal production plan and swing
   storage allocation, while minimizing the number of blend instances and
   product changeovers in the swing tanks. The 3rd level computes schedules
   using a continuous-time model including constraints based on the
   short-term plan solution. Nonlinear constraints are used for the Reid
   vapor pressure in our case studies. Excellent computational performance
   is illustrated by comparisons with previous approach with discrete-time
   scheduling model.}},

   series of field experiments are conducted on highways with new and old
   pavements. The variations of the traffic flow and traffic noise pressure
   levels together with the functional relationship between them are
   analyzed based on the noise data collected from the highways in an urban
   area. With the collected data, the maximum traffic flow and traffic
   noise pressure levels are determined in a time specified manner.
   Logarithmic functional relationships are found between the traffic noise
   pressure level and traffic flow for both the old and new pavements. It
   is also found in the research, the improvement in the road re-pavement
   may promote the absorption of the traffic noise. A single value index is
   developed for quantitatively and conveniently evaluating the acoustic
   quality of highways. The findings in this research may give some
   inspiration for construction and management of low noise highways.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation analyzes the effect of vortex wakes on the Lagrangian
   displacement of particles induced by the passage of an obstacle in a
   two-dimensional incompressible and inviscid fluid. In addition to the
   trajectories of individual particles, we also study their drift and the
   corresponding total drift areas in the Foppl and Kirchhoff potential
   flow models. Our findings, which are obtained numerically and in some
   regimes are also supported by asymptotic analysis, are compared to the
   wakeless potential flow which serves as a reference. We show that in the
   presence of the Foppl vortex wake, some of the particles follow more
   complicated trajectories featuring a second loop. The appearance of an
   additional stagnation point in the Foppl flow is identified as a source
   of this effect. It is also demonstrated that, while the total drift area
   increases with the size of the wake for large vortex strengths, it is
   actually decreased for small circulation values. On the other hand, the
   Kirchhoff flow model is shown to have an unbounded total drift area. By
   providing a systematic account of the wake effects on the drift, the
   results of this study will allow for more accurate modeling of
   hydrodynamic stirring. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In the previous work on multiple description lattice vector quantizers
   (MDLVQs) with L >= 3 descriptions, once the central and side lattice
   codebooks are fixed, the decoding quality is determined for all numbers
   k of received descriptions. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve
   tradeoffs between the quality of reconstruction for different values of
   k, 1 <= k <= L - 1. This paper proposes a flexible MDLVQ capable of
   overcoming the above drawback. For this, a different reconstruction
   method is employed and a heuristic index assignment (IA) algorithm,
   which uses L - 2 parameters to control the distortions for 2 <= k <= L -
   1, is developed. Experimental results show that the proposed MDLVQ, in
   addition to achieving the desired tradeoffs, significantly outperforms
   the classicMD scheme based on unequal erasure protection. The second
   contribution of this paper is a structured IA for the case of L = 3 and
   the derivation of the corresponding expressions of the distortions at
   high resolution. The proposed IA has a simple mechanism for controlling
   the tradeoff between the reconstruction quality for k = 1, 2. The IA is
   able to achieve a wide range of distortion values, while keeping the
   product of the distortions for k = 1, 2 the same as in the prior work.}},

Abstract = {{This initial study shows that hydrophobic modification of guar polymers

   Specifically, hydroxypropyl guar samples were oxidized and derivatized
   with linear alkyl amines to give a series of modified guar polymers
   (MGuar) bearing hydroxypropyl, N-alkylamide, and carboxyl moieties.
   MGuar interactions with lysozyme and HSA were measured by binding and
   rheological methods as functions of the alkyl chain length and the
   extent of hydrophobic modification. HSA binds MGuar, giving weak gels,
   whereas lysozyme shows little tendency to bind MGuar or to interfere
   with HSA binding. Six mole percent substitution of decyl hydrophobes

Abstract = {{In a previous study we showed that most of the mineral in bone is

   Using dark-field transmission electron microscopy, we viewed mineral
   structures in ion-milled sections of cortical human bone cut parallel to
   the collagen fibrils. Within the mineral structures we observe single
   crystals of apatite averaging 5.8 +/- 2.7 nm in width and 28 +/- 19 nm
   in length, their long axes oriented parallel to the fibril axis. Some
   appear to be composite, co-aligned crystals as thin as 2 nm. From their
   similarity to TEM images of crystals liberated from deproteinated bone
   we infer that we are viewing sections through platy crystals of apatite

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel polygeneration process has been proposed which
   combines coal gasification and natural gas reforming with either one or
   two chemical looping systems to produce electricity, methanol, and
   dimethyl ether (DME). Optionally, a modular helium reactor (MHR) is used
   to provide the heat required for the natural gas reforming step, which
   minimizes the amount of fossil fuels used for heating purposes. The
   process is fully integrated such that essentially 100\% of all CO2
   produced by the process can be captured and sequestered. Techno-economic
   analysis of different design strategies are presented, considering three
   options for coal gasification, incorporation of various ratios of
   natural gas input, utilization of carbonless energy from MHR, power
   generation using chemical looping combustion and also CO2 sequestration
   based on liquefaction or hydration technologies. Moreover, the impact of
   varying the proportions of products on the thermal efficiency and
   profitability of the plant is investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{High frame rate video (HFV) is an important investigational tool in
   sciences, engineering, and military. In ultrahigh speed imaging, the
   obtainable temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions are limited by
   the sustainable throughput of in-camera mass memory, lower bound of
   exposure time, and illumination conditions. To break these bottlenecks,
   we propose a new coded video acquisition framework that employs K >= 2
   cameras, each of which makes random measurements of the video signal in
   both temporal and spatial domains. For each of the K cameras, this
   multicamera strategy greatly relaxes the stringent requirements in
   memory speed, shutter speed, and illumination strength. The recovery of
   HFV from these random measurements is posed and solved as a large-scale
   l(1) minimization problem by exploiting joint temporal and spatial
   sparsities of the 3D signal. Three coded video acquisition techniques of
   varied tradeoffs between performance and hardware complexity are
   developed: 1) framewise coded acquisition; 2) pixelwise coded
   acquisition; and 3) columnwise-rowwise coded acquisition. The
   performances of these techniques are analyzed in relation to the
   sparsity of the underlying video signal. Simulations of these new HFV
   capture techniques are carried out and experimental results are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of two-stage sequential coding (TSSC), which is an
   extension of sequential coding of correlated sources. Let X and Y be
   dependent random variables. The network contains two encoders and two
   decoders: 1) a Y encoder with input Y; 2) an X encoder with inputs X and
   Y; 3) a Y decoder that reconstructs Y; and 4) an X decoder that
   reconstructs X. The first stage is traditional sequential coding, where
   the Y encoder describes Y to both the X decoder and Y decoder, and the X
   encoder describes X and Y to the X decoder. At the second stage, the Y
   encoder refines the description of Y, and the X encoder refines the
   description of X. The TSSC model is a theoretical abstraction of
   scalable video coding; here, Y and X represent successive frames of a
   video sequence, and the two stages together give an embedded description
   that allows the video to be decoded at two distinct rates. We give an
   inner bound on the rate distortion region for this TSSC model. The tight
   bound on the rate distortion region is derived when Y must be
   reconstructed losslessly (in the usual Shannon sense) in the second
   stage. We also study the minimum total rate of the TSSC model and show
   that the minimum total rate of one-stage sequential coding cannot be
   achieved at both stages for jointly Gaussian sources. This theoretical
   result can shed light on the rate-distortion performance behavior of
   scalable video coding widely noted by practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a transient trajectory shaping (TTS) control method
   for the SISO strict feedback nonlinear systems. The TTS control refers
   to explicitly constraining the system output tracking error transient
   trajectories within predesigned time-varying boundaries while they are
   converging to equilibrium. By this method, the boundaries of system
   output transient trajectories can be designed a priori according to the
   system transient control performance requirements in both symmetric and
   asymmetric ways. With a class of time-varying boundary functions,
   control laws can be devised by utilizing the enhanced differential
   unbounded function techniques. Such control laws can ascertain that the
   system output tracking errors travel within their respectively
   predesigned time-varying boundaries while converging to origin. To
   handle the control input exaggeration issue in TTS, input constraint
   control techniques are proposed to effectively reduce the required
   control input magnitude for second-order systems. A numerical example is
   utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed TTS control methods.

Abstract = {{Healthcare systems have made a dramatic shift towards ubiquitous
   monitoring in the recent past. The reasons for such a change have been
   ease of timely diagnosis, convenience and comfort of clinical
   treatments. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are mainly characterized
   by deployment of biomedical sensors around human body which transmit
   vital signs measurements about the health status of the patient.
   Unfortunately, the huge traffic load of clinical data and limited
   resources of biomedical sensors make the efficiency of long-term
   operations almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to make
   significant advances in sensor's energy saving. Our idea is to reduce
   the activities of some sensors depending on the relevance between the
   data they measure and the diseases to detect. This paper shows how to
   extend the lifetime of medical WBANs by appropriately taking benefit of
   correlation between the knowledge about the disease and sensing data to
   drive the best scheduling of the medical sensors. For that, the
   theoretical framework of an economic approach, i.e., network utility
   maximization, is developed for sensor scheduling under operations cost
   constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found
   to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based
   on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection
   and information gain is then proposed. Simulation results show that the
   algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy saving vs latency
   in disease detection.}},

Abstract = {{In compressive sensing, wavelet space is widely used to generate sparse
   signal (image signal in particular) representations. In this paper, we
   propose a novel approach of statistical context modeling to increase the
   level of sparsity of wavelet image representations. It is shown,
   contrary to a widely held assumption, that high-frequency wavelet
   coefficients have nonzero mean distributions if conditioned on local
   image structures. Removing this bias can make wavelet image
   representations sparser, i.e., having a greater number of zero and
   close-to-zero coefficients. The resulting unbiased probability models
   can significantly improve the performance of existing wavelet-based
   compressive image reconstruction methods in both PSNR and visual
   quality. An efficient algorithm is presented to solve the compressive
   image recovery (CIR) problem using the refined models. Experimental
   results on both simulated compressive sensing (CS) image data and real
   CS image data show that the new CIR method significantly outperforms
   existing CIR methods in both PSNR and visual quality.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the dosages of Class F fly ash, lithium nitrate and
   their combinations to suppress the excessive expansion caused by
   alkali-silica reactivity (ASR). In order to serve the proposed
   objective, the mortar bar specimens were prepared from (1) four dosages
   of Class F fly ash, such as 15, 20, 25 and 30 \% as a partial
   replacement of Portland cement, (2) up to six dosages of lithium
   nitrate, such as lithium-to-alkali molar ratios of 0.59, 0.74, 0.89,
   1.04, 1.19 and 1.33, and (3) the combination of lithium salt
   (lithium-to-alkali molar ratio of 0.74) and two dosages of Class F fly
   ash (15 and 20 \% as a partial replacement of Portland cement). Percent
   contribution to ASR-induced expansion due to the fly ash or lithium
   content, test duration and their interaction was also evaluated. The
   results showed that the ASR-induced expansion decreased with an increase
   in the admixtures in the mortar bar. However, the specimens made with
   the both Class F fly ash and lithium salt produced more effective
   mitigation approach when compared to those prepared with fly ash or
   lithium salt alone. The ASR-induced expansions of fly ash or lithium
   bearing mortar bars by the proposed models generated a good correlation
   with those obtained by the experimental procedures.}},

Abstract = {{This studypresents a remote sensing application of using time series
   Landsat satellite images for monitoring the Trail Road and Nepean
   municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal sites in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
   Currently, the Trail Road landfill is in operation; however, during the
   1960s and 1980s, the city relied heavily on the Nepean landfill. More
   than 400 Landsat satellite images were acquired from the US Geological
   Survey (USGS) data archive between 1984 and 2011. Atmospheric correction
   was conducted on the Landsat images in order to derive the landfill
   sites' land surface temperature (LST). The findings unveil that the
   average LST of the landfill was always higher than the immediate
   surrounding vegetation and air temperature by 4 to 10 A degrees C and 5
   to 11.5 A degrees C, respectively. During the summer, higher differences
   of LST between the landfill and its immediate surrounding vegetation
   were apparent, while minima were mostly found in fall. Furthermore,
   there was no significant temperature difference between the Nepean
   landfill (closed) and the Trail Road landfill (active) from 1984 to
   2007. Nevertheless, the LST of the Trail Road landfill was much higher
   than the Nepean by 15 to 20 A degrees C after 2007. This is mainly due
   to the construction and dumping activities (which were found to be
   active within the past few years) associated with the expansion of the
   Trail Road landfill. The study demonstrates that the use of the Landsat
   data archive can provide additional and viable information for the aid
   of MSW disposal site monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Exploratory work has been undertaken to compare the performance of
   nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) with fumed silica in styrene/ acrylic
   latex coatings. NCC has emerged as a promising candidate for the
   reinforcement of polymeric materials because of its impressive
   mechanical properties and renewable nature. However, a better
   understanding of NCC in nanocomposites, compared to more conventional
   fumed silica-filled systems, is critical to identify feasible commercial
   applications for NCC. While the dispersion of nanomaterials in polymer
   matrices is often a challenge, by working with hydrophilic nanoparticles
   in a waterborne latex, the authors demonstrate that both NCC and fumed
   silica were dispersed in the latex coatings (up to 9 wt\% loadings). The
   hardness, elastic modulus, resistance to plastic deformation and impact
   strength were similar for coatings with both types of nanomaterials at
   loadings below the percolation threshold of NCC (similar to 3 wt\%);
   however, the mechanical performance of NCC-filled coatings was
   significantly better at higher loadings. In abrasion and corrosion
   resistance tests, NCC-filled coatings underperformed relative to
   unfilled and fumed silica-filled coatings. This is the first report that
   directly compares NCC-filled polymeric coatings with silica-filled
   coatings including evaluation using industry standards like
   nanoindentation and corrosion resistance testing. This article contains
   supporting information that will be made available online once the issue
   is published.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{125-132}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate the application of high
   voltage DC waveforms as a mechanism of load control for convective
   boiling systems. Electrohydrodynamics (EHD) induces flow pattern
   redistribution, which directly influences the system performance. EHD
   can provide a low power (<1 W), fast responding method of enhancing two
   phase flow systems such as heat exchangers. This study compares the use
   of EHD for load control with control via changing the refrigerant side
   flow rate in terms of required power, response time and effect on flow
   parameters. It was found that EHD responds faster and requires less
   power when a constant exit condition is required for the heat exchanger.
   Two EHD based controllers; PI controller and a Smith predictor were
   established using LabVIEW and compared in terms of their response time
   and regulation behaviour subject to dynamic loading. The Smith predictor
   resulted in less overshoot and approximately a 50\% reduction in
   settling time in response to dynamic loading. It has been shown that
   this EHD based controller can regulate subject to +/- 25\% deviation in
   load from the designed steady state load condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   promoted protein binding and lower temperature favored protein release
   in this process, which was can out using lyotropic salt-free mobile

Abstract = {{Composite materials, containing fibrous VN nanoparticles and multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are prepared by a chemical method for
   application in electrochemical supercapacitors. We demonstrate for the
   first time that VN-MWCNT electrodes exhibit good capacitive behavior in
   0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte in a negative voltage window of 0.9 V. Quartz
   crystal microbalance studies provide an insight into the mechanism of
   charge storage. Composite VN-MWCNT materials show significant
   improvement in capacitance, compared to individual VN and MWCNT
   materials. Testing results indicate that VN-MWCNT electrodes exhibit
   high specific capacitance at high mass loadings in the range of 10-30 mg
   cm(-2), good capacitance retention at scan rates in the range of 2-200
   mV s(-1) and good cycling stability. The highest specific capacitance of
   160 F g(-1) is achieved at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1). The new findings
   open a new and promising strategy in the fabrication of hybrid devices
   based on VN. The proof-of-principle is demonstrated by the fabrication
   of hybrid supercapacitor devices based on VN-MWCNT negative electrodes
   and MnO2 - MWCNT positive electrodes with voltage window of 1.8 V in
   aqueous 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The hybrid VN-MWCNT/MnO2-MWCNT

Abstract = {{Silicon-rich silicon oxide films, with various Si concentrations, were
   deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and annealed at
   1100 degrees C in order to form silicon nanocrystals. For these films,
   it has been found that the absorption edge shifts as a function of the
   nanocrystal size due to the quantum confinement of exciton. This result
   showed that the size-related effects are present in the investigated
   films. Next, we examined the influence of the nanocrystal size on the
   vibrational modes. In this case, the Raman line related to silicon
   nanocrystals significantly down-shifts as a function of the nanocrystal
   size, which is against the predictions of the phonon confinement model.
   It has been shown that this effect is due to stress exerted on the
   nanocrystals. It has been also found that this stress changes from
   compressive to tensile, and the stress character depends on the film
   stoichiometry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were prepared from acid-treated expandable
   graphite using a novel method of electric heating the graphite in an
   evaporation chamber under high vacuum, followed by solvent exfoliation.
   Such prepared graphene nanoplatelets, the eGNPs, were compared to GNPs
   prepared from two conventional methods: thermal expansion in an
   isothermal oven followed by solvent exfoliation (oGNPs), and direct
   solvent exfoliation (sGNPs), using various characterization techniques
   including UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic
   force microscopy. It was found that the eGNPs were very thin, with a
   thickness of 4-16 nm, and showed no oxidation. On the other hand, oGNPs
   exhibited much thicker sheets, upward of 40 nm, and the sGNPs showed a
   high degree of oxidation. Utilizing the high purity eGNPs as an additive
   in PQT-12 semiconductor layer has been shown to improve the mobility by
   a factor of 2 in thin-film transistor devices.}},

Abstract = {{We report an ab initio emulsion atom transfer radical polymerization

   designed and synthesized for this purpose. The SL design was an
   amphiphilic macromolecule, and it acted as the surfactant for micelle
   formation and as the ligand for ATRP catalyst. The micelles were
   converted into to polymer particles with both water-soluble and
   oil-soluble initiators. The micellar nucleation mechanism was confirmed
   by the growth of polymer particles during polymerization, in comparison
   to a control experiment without SL addition. It was also found that
   diffusion-controlled deactivation inside particles occurred, which
   broadened the polymer molecular weight distribution. Adding a small
   amount of free catalyst significantly improved the molecular weight
   control. The polymers resulting from the ab initio emulsion ATRP were
   proven living by chain extension experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A unified framework for automatic non-rigid 3D-3D and 3D-2D registration
   of medical images with static and dynamic deformations is proposed in
   this paper. The problem of non-rigid image registration is approached as
   a classical state estimation problem using a generic deformation model
   for the soft tissue. The registration technique employs a dynamic linear
   elastic continuum mechanics model of the tissue deformation, which is
   discretized using the finite element method. In the proposed method, the
   registration is achieved through a Kalman-like filtering process, which
   incorporates information from the deformation model and a vector of
   observation prediction errors computed from an intensity-based
   similarity/distance metric between images. With this formulation, single
   and multiple-modality, 3D-3D and 3D-2D image registration problems can
   all be treated within the same framework. The performance of the
   proposed registration technique was evaluated in a number of different
   registration scenarios. First, 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images of
   uncompressed and compressed breast tissue were co-registered. 3D MR
   images of the uncompressed breast tissue were also registered to a
   sequence of simulated 2D interventional MR images of the compressed
   breast. Finally, the registration algorithm was employed to dynamically
   track a target sub-volume inside the breast tissue during the process of
   the biopsy needle insertion based on registering pre-insertion 3D MR
   images to a sequence of real-time simulated 2D interventional MR images.
   Registration results indicate that the proposed method can be
   effectively employed for the registration of medical images in
   image-guided procedures, such as breast biopsy in which the tissue
   undergoes static and dynamic deformations.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial atomic structure of a metallic LaNiO3/LaAlO3
   superlattice grown on a LaSrAlO4 substrate was investigated using a
   combination of atomically resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
   (EELS) at the Al K, Al L-2,L-3, Sr L-2,L-3, Ni L-2,L-3, La M-4,M-5, and
   O K edges as well as hybridization mapping of selected features of the O
   K-edge fine structure. We observe an additional La1-xSrxAl1-yNiyO3 layer
   at the substrate-superlattice interface, possibly linked to diffusion of
   Al and Sr into the growing film or a surface reconstruction due to Sr
   segregation. The roughness of the LaNiO3/LaAlO3 interfaces is found to
   be on average around one pseudocubic unit cell. The O K-edge EELS
   spectra revealed reduced spectral weight of the prepeak derived from
   Ni-O hybridized states in the LaNiO3 layers. We rule out oxygen
   nonstoichiometry of the LaNiO3 layers and discuss changes in the Ni-O
   hybridization due to heterostructuring as possible origin.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in theoretical aspects of spin noise and relaxation

   absence of any radio frequency excitation. With the prospect of
   ultrafast digitization, the role of spin noise in real-time parameter
   extraction for (NMR) spin systems, and the advantage over standard
   techniques, is of essential importance, especially for systems
   containing a small number of spins. In this article we outline prospects

Abstract = {{In this study, samples of magnesium alloys with composition of Mg-3\%
   A1-1\% Zn (A231) were employed to conduct a series of tensile tests
   along different directions. The anisotropy and diverse mechanical
   performances were systematically investigated, and a synchronous
   improvement trend of strength and plasticity of the rolled Mg alloy with
   the orientation angle increasing was observed. Simulation output and
   some observation methods verified the activation of prismatic slip which
   can contribute to this tendency. To thoroughly explain the influence of
   prismatic slip, crystallographic analysis was adopted. A tilt angle of
   12.7 degrees was then calculated to serve as the critical condition of
   the activation of basal and prismatic slip, and it was applied to
   explain the optimization of mechanical properties of the rolled Mg
   alloy. The synchronous improvement of strength and plasticity proves to
   be essentially ascribed to the higher applied stress and larger
   displacement component of certain grains. It is of great significance to
   get an access to the development of mechanical performance of AZ31 for
   the industrialized manufacture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   dispersion and promoted coating formation by PPy polymerization on
   MWCNT. The PPy coated MWCNT were used for energy storage in
   electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). The use of PPy coated MWCNT
   allowed excellent electrochemical performance for high active mass
   loadings, required for commercial ES applications. The electrodes and

Volume = {{470}},

Abstract = {{A high-throughput technique for downstream processing studies was
   developed by integrating 96-well Filter plates with a magnetic tumble
   stirrer that simultaneously mixes the solution above the membrane in
   each well akin to the conventional stirred-cell filtration module - thus
   we call this technique `stirred-well filtration' (SWF). The performance
   of 30 kDa Omega (TM) ultrafiltration membranes was assessed via
   hydraulic permeability measurements and protein sieving tests conducted
   in constant flux mode using a multi-rack syringe pump; individual
   pressure transducers were used to simultaneously monitor the
   transmembrane pressure (TMP) in eight wells on the filter plate. The
   stirring action was found to be critically important in controlling the
   effects of concentration polarization during protein sieving tests for
   example, the maximum TMP in the unstirred wells were on average 7.5,
   3.8, and 2.6 times higher than those in the stirred wells at fluxes of
   12, 36, and 60 LMH respectively. To demonstrate the usefulness of the
   SWF technique, we simultaneously ran the eight tests for a simple 22
   factorial design-of-experiments (DOE) test with duplicates to evaluate
   the effect of solution pH and salt concentration on protein filtration.
   The results indicate that combining the SWF technique with statistical
   methods is a powerful approach for high-throughput testing of filtration
   processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   structure anisotropy of Cr2AlC}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{The anisotropy of the electronic structure of the MAX phase Cr2AlC has
   been investigated by electron- energyloss spectroscopy ( EELS) at the C
   K edge, and x- ray- absorption spectroscopy ( XAS) at the Al K, Cr
   L-2,L-3, andCr K edges. The experimental spectra were interpreted using
   either a multiple- scattering approach or a full- potential band-
   structure method. The anisotropy is found to be small around C atoms
   because of the rather isotropic nature of the octahedral site, and of
   the averaging of the empty C p states probed by EELS at the C K edge. In
   turn, a pronounced anisotropy of the charge distribution around Al atoms
   is evidenced from polarized XAS measurements performed on textured
   Cr2AlC sputtered thin films. From the analysis of the XAS data using the
   multiple- scattering FEFF code, it is demonstrated that the probed thin
   film is constituted of 70\% ( 0001) and 30\% ( 10 (1) over bar3) grains
   oriented parallel to the film surface. A decomposition of the calculated
   spectrum in coordination shells allows for the ability to connect XAS
   fine structures to the Cr2AlC structure. Combining high- resolution data
   with up- to- date multiple- scattering calculations, it is shown that
   the crystalline orientations of the grains present in a probe of 100 x
   100 mu m(2) can be determined from the Cr K edge. Interestingly, it is
   also revealed that a static disorder is involved in the studied thin
   films. These findings highlight that, given the overall agreement
   between experimental and calculated spectra, the Cr2AlC electronic
   structure is accurately predicted using density functional theory.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of added molecular heterogeneity on the
   hysteretic features of liquid-glass-liquid transition, we studied
   acetaminophen, sulfathiazole, and three of their mixtures by
   calorimetry, and determined the T-g and the fictive temperature, T-f,
   from changes in the enthalpy and entropy on the cooling and heating
   paths, as well as the non-exponential parameter, beta(cal). We find
   that, (i) T-f for cooling is within 1-3 K of T-f for heating and both
   are close to T-g, (ii) the closed loop entropy change in the
   liquid-glass-liquid range is negligibly small, (iii) T-g and T-f
   increase on increasing sulfathiazole in the mixture, (iv) beta(cal)
   first slightly increases when the second component is added and then
   decreases, and (v) ageing causes deviations from a non-exponential,
   nonlinear behavior of the glass. In terms of fluctuations in a potential
   energy landscape, adding a solute heterogeneity would shift the state
   point to another part of the landscape with a different distribution of
   barrier heights and a different number of minima accessible to the state
   point. Part of the change in beta(cal) is attributed to hydrogen-bond
   formation between the two components. Ageing changes the relaxation
   times distribution, more at short relaxation times than at long
   relaxation times, and multiplicity of relaxation modes implied by
   beta(cal) < 1 indicates that each mode contributing to the enthalpy has
   its own T-g or T-f. beta(cal) differs from beta(age) determined from
   isothermal ageing, and the distribution parameter of a-relaxation times
   would differ from both beta(cal) and beta(age). (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Disruption of calmodulin (CaM)-based protein interactions has been
   touted as a potential means for modulating several disease pathways.
   Among these is SOX9, which is a DNA binding protein that is involved in
   chrondrocyte differentiation and regulation of the hormones that control
   sexual development. In this work, we employed a magnetic fishing/mass
   spectrometry assay in conjunction with intrinsic fluorescence to examine
   the interaction of CaM with the CaM-binding domain of SOX9 (SOX-CAL),
   and to assess the modulation of this interaction by known anti-CaM
   compounds. Our data show that there is a high affinity interaction
   between CaM and SOX-CAL (27 +/- 9 nM), and that SOX-CAL bound to the
   same location as the well-known CaM antagonist melittin; unexpectedly,
   we also found that addition of CaM-binding small molecules initially
   produced increased SOX-CAL binding, indicative of binding to both the
   well-known high-affinity CaM binding site and a second, lower-affinity
   binding site.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state single photon detectors are playing a significant role in
   the development of high-performance single-photon imaging systems for
   fluorescence lifetime imaging, time-of-flight positron emission
   tomography and Raman Spectroscopy applications. The main driving factors
   are the unparalleled levels of miniaturization and portability, low
   fabrication costs, and high overall performance resulting from the
   integration of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with mixed-signal
   circuits in deep-submicron (DSM) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
   (CMOS) technology. At the heart of such imaging systems is the SPAD,
   capable of single-photon sensitivity and sub-nanosecond time resolution,
   and its associated circuitry, which in DSM CMOS, is capable of
   high-speed, low-power mixed-mode signal processing. In this paper, we
   review and discuss the most recent developments in DSM CMOS SPAD
   detectors, circuits and arrays and investigate issues of scalability,
   miniaturization and performance trade-offs involved in designing SPAD
   imaging systems. Design considerations, research challenges, and future
   directions for CMOS SPAD image sensors will be highlighted and

Abstract = {{We give a proposal for plasmonic rainbow trapping based on a novel
   structure comprised of a silica-graphene-silica on a sloping silicon
   substrate, which, importantly, overcomes the intrinsic constraints that
   are required by metal/dielectric interface. As compared with previous
   plasmonic grating structures for rainbow trapping, the adiabatic control
   of the dispersion curve for the present one is achieved by gradually
   changing the equivalent permittivity of the graphene monolayer via the
   gap separation between the graphene monolayer and the silicon substrate.
   We attribute the rainbow trapping effect to the correlative dispersive
   relation between the slow plasmonic mode and the gap separation between
   the graphene monolayer and silicon substrate, which leads to the
   localization of light waves of different frequencies at different
   positions on the graphene surface. The group velocity can be reduced to
   be 1000 times smaller than light velocity in air, which is 1-2 smaller
   than that was previously reported in dielectric gratings-based plasmonic
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of propagation loss of terahertz graphene plasmon can be made
   by increasing the chemical potential of graphene layer, but at the cost
   of significantly increasedmodal area, which fundamentally limits the
   packing density on a chip. By utilizing the strong coupling between the
   dielectric waveguide and plasmonic modes, we propose hybrid plasmonic
   terahertz waveguides that not only significantly suppress the mode field
   confinement, but also maintain a compact modal size. A typical
   propagation length is 127 mu m, and optical field is confined into an
   ultra-small area of approximately 32.6 mu m(2) at 3 THz. This structure
   also exhibits ultra-low crosstalk, which shows great promise for
   constructing various functional devices in future terahertz integrated
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{To enhance growth factor (GF) bioavailability, epidermal growth factor
   (EGF) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) were
   tethered, via carbodiimide chemistry, to dendrimer crosslinked collagen
   (CG) gels, either during or following gel fabrication. GF tethering was
   achieved either via step-wise modification, with gels soaked in
   activated GF solutions, or via bulk modification with various GF
   solutions added to the collagen suspension prior to full dendrimer
   crosslinking of CG gels. Conjugation of EGF and HB-EGF to CG gels was
   tunable in relation to the original concentration of activated GF
   exposed to gels. Slightly higher amounts of tethered EGF, compared to
   HB-EGF, were initially obtained following step-wise conjugation, but
   differences were not evident following extensive rinsing, indicating the
   presence of both sorbed and tethered protein. Final tethered GF amounts
   were found to be dependent on solution concentration. As with step-wise
   modification, bulk modification of CG gels resulted in GF retention that
   could be tailored by adjusting the amount of GF added to the collagen
   suspension during gel fabrication. However, the various GF solutions
   utilized for CG bulk modification did not differ in terms of GF
   incorporation, following extensive rinsing, and represented between
   2-5\% of the originally added GF amount. Bioactivity of EGF and HB-EGF
   was enhanced following step-wise conjugation to gels, as was verified
   with proliferation of human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC); however,
   bulk modification of CG gels, with tethered GF, only maintained HCEC
   proliferation, suggesting step-wise conjugation is a favourable method
   for HB-EGF and EGF tethering to CG gels.}},

   the flow stresses decreased monotonically, showing a dynamic flow
   softening. As the strain increased, the dislocation tangled to cell
   structure and sub-grain structure, which indicated the occurrence of

   (Al2CuMg), theta(Al2Cu) and Al3Zr phase were accelerated and coarsened
   by deformation. Continuous S phases precipitated in the Al matrix and
   discontinuous S phases were found to be nucleated near the Al3Zr phase

Abstract = {{This paper experimentally investigates the flow-sound interaction
   mechanisms in a T-junction combining the flow from its two co-axial
   side-branches into the central branch. The T-junction has a sudden area
   expansion at each side-branch entrance. Flow separation at these area
   expansions forms free shear layers which are shown to excite the
   acoustic mode(s) of the branches over several ranges of flow velocity,
   each of which results from the coupling of the acoustic mode with a
   different shear layer oscillation mode. Phase-locked particle image
   velocimetry is utilized to detail the unsteady flow Field over the
   acoustic cycle for two shear layer oscillation modes. Finite element
   analysis is used to characterize the excited acoustic mode shape and its
   associated particle velocity field. In-depth analysis of the flow-sound
   interaction mechanism inside the T-junction is performed by means of
   Howe's acoustic analogy. It is concluded that the flow-sound interaction
   mechanism in the entrance region of the T-junction produces a spatially
   alternating pattern of acoustic energy generation and absorption. This
   alternating pattern of energy exchange between the flow and sound fields
   results in a minimal amount of net acoustic power being generated in the
   entrance region. However, the increasing orthogonality between the
   acoustic particle streamlines and the flow streamlines near the exit of
   the T-junction at its center results in the majority of the generated
   sound power which sustains the acoustic resonance. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Long-term muscle denervation leads to severe and
   irreversible atrophy coupled with loss of force and motor function.
   These factors contribute to poor functional recovery following delayed
   reinnervation. The authors' previous work demonstrated that temporarily
   suturing a sensory nerve to the distal motor stump (called sensory
   protection) significantly reduces muscle atrophy and improves function
   following reinnervation. The authors have also shown that 1 month of
   electrical stimulation of denervated muscle significantly improves
   function and reduces atrophy. In this study, the authors tested whether
   a combination of sensory protection and electrical stimulation would
   enhance functional recovery more than either treatment alone.
   Methods: Rat gastrocnemius muscles were denervated by cutting the tibial
   nerve. The peroneal nerve was then sutured to the distal tibial stump
   following 3 months of treatment (i.e., electrical stimulation, sensory
   protection, or both). Three months after peroneal repair, functional and
   histologic measurements were taken.
   Results: All treatment groups had significantly higher muscle weight (p
   < 0.05) and twitch force (p < 0.001) compared with the untreated group
   (denervated), but fiber type composition did not differ between groups.
   Importantly, muscle weight and force were significantly greater in the
   combined treatment group (p < 0.05) compared with stimulation or sensory
   protection alone. The combined treatment also produced motor unit counts
   significantly greater than sensory protection alone (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The combination treatment synergistically reduces atrophy
   and improves reinnervation and functional measures following delayed
   nerve repair, suggesting that these approaches work through different
   mechanisms. The authors' research supports the clinical use of both
   modalities together following peripheral nerve injury.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate model of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) may assist in
   developing improved cochlear implant (CI) stimulation strategies.
   Previous studies have shown that the original Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model
   may be better at describing nodes of Ranvier in ANFs than models for
   other mammalian axon types. However, the HH model is still unable to
   explain a number of phenomena observed in auditory nerve responses to CI
   stimulation such as adaptation to high-rate stimulation and the time
   course of relative refractoriness. Recent physiological investigations
   of ANFs have shown the presence of a number of ion channel types not
   considered in the previous modeling studies, including low-threshold
   potassium (KLT) channels and hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN)
   channels. In this paper, we investigate inclusion of these ion channel
   types in a stochastic HH model of a single node of Ranvier. Simulation
   results for pulse trains with rates of 200, 800, and 2000 pulse/s
   suggests that both the KLT channels and HCN channels can produce
   adaptation in the spike rate. However, the adaptation due to KLT is
   restricted to higher stimulation rates, whereas the adaptation due to
   HCN is observed across all stimulation rates. Additionally, using pulse
   pairs it was found that KLT increased both the absolute and the relative
   refractory periods. HCN on its own increased just the relative
   refractory period, but produced a synergistic increase in the absolute
   refractory period when combined with KLT. Together these results argue
   strongly for the need to consider HCN and KLT channels when studying CI
   stimulation of ANFs.}},

Abstract = {{Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) were fabricated for the first time
   using a semiconductor copolymer of diketopyrrolopyrrole-quarterthiophene
   (DPP-QT) and unsorted single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Three
   different SWCNTs having different tube diameters, length, and shape were
   used to investigate the effects of carbon nanotubes' properties on
   dispersion of the SWCNTs in DPP-QT polymer, as well as the mobility and
   current on/off ratio of the OTFTs. The DPP-QT polymer was able to
   selectively disperse two types of SWCNTs. An optimal SWCNT loading was
   found to be 1.5-2.5 wt\% for these SWCNTs, before the on/off ratio fell
   below 10(5) due to increased metallic tube content of the film. At this
   optimal loading, the field effect mobility was improved by a factor of
   two, with the maximum mobility reaching 1.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), when the
   SWCNTs with a short length and small tube diameter were used. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{AimsTo produce light-activated antimicrobial materials composed of the
   photodynamic dye phloxine B incorporated into paper or cellulose
   membranes and to investigate ability of these materials to decrease
   bacterial loads on their surfaces as well as on food surfaces that were
   in contact with these materials under illumination with regular white
   light.
   Methods and ResultsAntimicrobial cellulose-based materials with
   incorporated phloxine B were produced using a layer-by-layer deposition
   method. Antimicrobial properties of the materials were tested in model
   systems as well as for decontamination of food and food contact
   surfaces. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus
   anthracis were efficiently killed by exposure of the bacterial
   suspension to the dye-containing material under illumination with white
   light, but Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were only
   partially affected. Application of the materials for decontamination of
   food surfaces artificially contaminated with L.monocytogenes was shown
   to be ineffective, while the self-decontamination of the material
   surface by exposure to white light resulted in eradication of
   L.monocytogenes cells from the material surface.
   ConclusionsThe developed materials showed significant
   self-decontaminating ability when under illumination; however,
   decontamination of food surfaces in contact with the developed materials
   was not achieved.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe study demonstrates the
   antibacterial activity of materials with incorporated photodynamic dyes
   when under illumination with regular-intensity white light. Possible
   uses of the light-activated antimicrobial materials for food processing,
   as food contact surfaces, and surfaces in public areas to prevent
   cross-contamination are discussed.}},

Title = {{Flow and heat transfer measurements in a planar offset attaching jet
   with a co-flowing wall jet}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{721-731}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Measurements were performed to characterize the flow, mean skin
   friction, and heat transfer rate in flows consisting of a turbulent
   planar jet with Reynolds number of approximately 42,000 offset one jet
   height above a wall and a co-flowing wall jet with an initial height
   0.18 times the offset distance (H-s). The results were compared to
   previous measurements for flows with similar offset jets and a
   co-flowing wall jet with initial height 0.5 times the offset distance.
   Low velocity wall jets in both geometries were quickly entrained into
   the offset jet increasing the attachment length of the offset jet and
   reducing the turbulent fluctuations and the heat transfer rate in the
   near field of the attaching jet. These changes increased with the mass
   flow rate of the wall jet as less mass is recirculated upstream from the
   attachment region. Higher velocity wall jets in both geometries
   initially remained attached to the wall causing a recirculation region
   to form between the jets that induce periodic motions that significantly
   increase the wall normal turbulent fluctuations in the flow. The
   periodic motions in the flows with the smaller wall jets significantly
   increased the pressure fluctuations on the wall below the near field
   flow and enhanced the heat transfer in this region. This differed from
   the results for the offset jet with the larger co-flowing wall jet where
   the flow fluctuations did not have a significant effect on the wall
   pressure fluctuations and the heat transfer below the flow. The
   difference in the effect of the periodic motions for flows appears to be
   due to differences in the forcing of the offset jet by the periodic
   motions and differences in the interaction between the recirculation
   region and the wall due to the height and mass flux of the wall jets.

Title = {{Investigation of deformation dynamics in a wrought magnesium alloy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{105-120}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the present research, the real-time in-situ neutron diffraction
   measurements under a continuous-loading condition and
   elastic-viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) polycrystal modeling were
   employed to study the deformation dynamics and the effect of the
   deformation history on plastic deformation in a wrought magnesium alloy.
   The experimental results reveal that pre-deformation delays the
   activation of the tensile twinning during the subsequent compression,
   mainly resulting from the residual strains. Detwinning does not occur
   until the applied stress exceeds the tensile yield strength during the
   reverse loading. It is believed that the grain rotation plays an
   important role in the elastic region during the reverse loading. The
   EVPSC model, which has been recently updated by implementing the
   twinning and detwinning model, was employed to characterize the
   deformation mechanism during the strain-path changes. The simulation
   result predicts well the experimental observation from the real-time
   in-situ neutron diffraction measurements. The present study provides a
   new insight of the nature of deformation mechanisms in a hexagonal
   close-packed (HCP) structured polycrystalline wrought magnesium alloy,
   which has significant implications for future work on studying the
   deformation mechanisms of HCP-structured materials. Published by

Abstract = {{An experimental study of quenching of a hot vertical tube by sudden
   introduction of a falling liquid film was investigated under different
   methods of venting the generated steam. The steam generated during the
   quenching process may form a countercurrent vapor velocity which exceeds
   the onset of flooding limit causing flooding of the liquid film and
   resisting the propagation of the quench front delaying the rewetting
   process. To study the effect of this steam countercurrent flow,
   experiments were carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the
   tube was closed from top to force the steam generated to be vented from
   bottom. In the second stage, both ends of the tube were opened to allow
   venting of the steam from both ends. In the third stage, the tube was
   closed at bottom and the steam was vented from top. The results showed
   that, the rewetting velocity in case of bottom steam-venting is higher
   than that in case of top and bottom steam-venting which in turn is
   higher than that in case of top steam-venting. For the three methods of
   steam venting, the quenching velocity decreases with increasing the
   initial tube temperature and the inlet liquid temperature and decreasing
   the liquid flow rate. Experimental correlations for rewetting velocities
   were deduced from experimental data for different cases of steam venting
   directions. Predictions of equations were compared with the present and
   previous experimental data and good agreement was found. (C) 2014

Title = {{Energy efficient reconcentration of diluted human urine using ion

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{61-72}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Nutrients can be recovered from source separated human urine; however,
   nutrient reconcentration (i.e., volume reduction of collected urine)
   requires energy-intensive treatment processes, making it practically
   difficult to utilize human urine. In this study, energy-efficient
   nutrient reconcentration was demonstrated using ion exchange membranes
   (IEMs) in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) where substrate oxidation
   at the MEC anode provides energy for the separation of nutrient ions
   (e.g., NH4+, HPO42-). The rate of nutrient separation was magnified with
   increasing number of IEM pairs and electric voltage application (E-ap).
   Ammonia and phosphate were reconcentrated from diluted human urine by a
   factor of up to 4.5 and 3.0, respectively (E-ap = 1.2 V; 3-IEM pairs).
   The concentrating factor increased with increasing degrees of volume
   reduction, but it remained stationary when the volume ratio between the
   diluate (urine solution that is diluted in the IEM stack) and
   concentrate (urine solution that is reconcentrated) was 6 or greater.
   The energy requirement normalized by the mass of nutrient reconcentrated
   was 6.48 MJ/kg-N (1.80 kWh/kg-N) and 117.6 MJ/kg-P (32.7 kWh/kg-P). In
   addition to nutrient separation, the examined MEC reactor with three IEM
   pairs showed 54\% removal of COD (chemical oxygen demand) in 47-hr batch
   operation. The high sulfate concentration in human urine resulted in
   substantial growth of both of acetate-oxidizing and H-2-oxidizing
   sulfate reducing bacteria, greatly diminishing the energy recovery and
   Coulombic efficiency. However, the high microbial activity of sulfate
   reducing bacteria hardly affected the rate of nutrient reconcentration.
   With the capability to reconcentrate nutrients at a minimal energy
   consumption and simultaneous COD removal, the examined
   bioelectrochemical treatment method with an IEM application has a
   potential for practical nutrient recovery and sustainable treatment of
   source-separated human urine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) is a structural
   material with advanced mechanical properties. The structural design of
   HPFRC members is based on the post-cracking residual strength provided
   by the addition into the mix of the fibers. Moreover, the addition of
   different types of mineral admixtures influences the overall behavior of
   this material. In order to optimize the performance of HPFRC in
   structural members, it is necessary to evaluate the mechanical
   properties and the post-cracking behavior in a reliable way. As a
   result, an experimental study on six different sets of HPFRC specimens
   was carried out. The main parameters that varied were the fiber volume
   content and the types of mineral addition. The behavior in compression,
   in flexural tension and the shrinkage properties were evaluated and
   critically analyzed in order to give a guide for structural use.
   The results showed that by adding high fiber volume content and the
   Algerian blast furnace slag into the mix, the HPFRC material obtained
   has a very good performance and it is suitable for use in practice. (C)

Abstract = {{Due to increasing global energy concerns, alternative sustainable
   methods to create energy such as thermoelectric energy conversion have
   become increasingly important. Originally, research into thermoelectric
   materials was focused on tellurides of bismuth and lead because of the
   exemplary thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te3 and PbTe. These materials,
   however, contain toxic lead and tellurium, which is also scarce and thus
   expensive. A viable alternative material may exist in Mg2Si, which needs
   to be doped and alloyed in order to achieve reasonable thermoelectric
   efficiency. Doping is a major problem, as p-type doping has thus far not
   produced competitive efficiencies, and n-type doping is problematic
   because of the tow solubility of the typical dopants Sb and Bi. This
   investigation shows experimentally that these dopants can indeed replace
   Si in the crystal lattice, and excess Sb and Bi atoms are present in the
   grain boundaries in the form of Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Bi2. As a consequence, the
   carrier concentration is lower than the formal Sb/Bi concentration
   suggests, and the thermal conductivity is significantly reduced. DFT
   calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data, including
   the band gap and the Seebeck coefficient. Overall, this results in
   competitive efficiencies despite the low carrier concentration. While
   ball-milling was previously shown to enhance the solubility of the
   dopants and thus the carrier concentration, this did not lead to
   enhanced thermoelectric properties.}},

Abstract = {{Structure-mechanical property relationship studies were carried out on
   Gleeble simulated intercritically reheated coarse-grained heat affected
   zone (ICCGHAZ) of 700 MPa linepipe steel microalloyed with Nb. The
   design of experiments was aimed at varying reheat temperature in the
   first pass to obtain different coarse grain size in the HAZ. This
   enabled the study of the effect of prior austenite grain size on
   martensite-austenite (M-A) constituent during the second pass reheating
   and its consequent influence on impact toughness. We elucidate here the
   role of phase transformation and the fraction, size, shape,
   distribution, and carbon content of M-A constituent on impact toughness.
   The data suggests that the fraction of M-A constituent is not influenced
   by grain size, but the size of M-A constituent is influenced by the
   prior austenite grain size, which consequently governs toughness. Coarse
   austenite grain size increases the size of M-A constituent and lowers
   the HAZ toughness. Coarse austenite grain associated with coarse M-A
   constituent along grain boundary is the dominant factor in promoting
   brittle fracture. The combination of fine prior austenite grain size and
   smaller M-A constituent is favorable in obtaining high toughness. Good
   toughness is obtained on refining the prior austenite grain size in the
   CGHAZ during first pass and hence ICCGHAZ in the second pass. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Vertically oriented and ordered GaAs nanowire arrays have been grown by
   the self-assisted mechanism using substrates prepared with
   nano-patterned oxide templates. Patterned Ga-assisted GaAs nanowire
   growth on (111) silicon by molecular beam epitaxy showed that the axial
   and radial growth rates increased with increasing interhole spacing. A
   model is described which accounts for the correlation of the final
   length and diameter with pattern pitch. The model considers that growth
   material is supplied by a secondary flux of both gallium and arsenic
   adatoms desorbing from the oxide surface between the nanowires which
   subsequently impinge on the liquid droplet and nanowire sidewalls. We
   show that shading of the incident and scattered flux by neighboring
   nanowires in the array can strongly affect the axial and radial growth
   rates, leading to significant differences in final nanowire

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{58-65}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Tubular structures made of alginate and similar hydrogels have been
   extensively investigated for drug delivery, tissue engineering and other
   biomedical applications. Alginate fibers are usually fabricated using
   complicated techniques such as coaxial flow extrusion or
   electro-spinning. This paper discusses the fabrication of hollow and
   solid alginate fibers using a simple membrane based molding technique. A
   hollow-fiber microfiltration membrane served both as the mold as well as
   reservoir for the cross-linking agent. The pores of the membrane were
   first filled with the cross-linker (i.e. calcium chloride) solution,
   after which the lumen was filled with sodium alginate solution. The
   calcium ions diffused from the membrane pores into the lumen,
   cross-linking the alginate in a radially inward direction. Solid
   alginate fibers were obtained by cross-linking all the alginate within
   the lumen, while hollow fibers were fabricated by pushing out
   un-cross-linked alginate from the central core using calcium chloride
   solution. The alginate fibers fabricated as described above were
   expelled from the membrane mold using water under pressure. These were
   then characterized by optical, fluorescence and scanning electron
   microscopy. The most attractive features of this fabrication method are
   its simplicity and flexibility with regards to alginate concentration.
   The fibers obtained were straight with excellent definition and uniform
   thickness, and could be fabricated in a highly reproducible manner.
   Other complicated solid and hollow 3-dimensional structures suitable for
   biomedical, and indeed other applications could also potentially be
   fabricated using similar membrane-based molding techniques. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Modal synthesis representation of a neutronic kinetic model for a CANDU
   reactor core has been utilized in the analysis and synthesis for reactor
   control systems. Among all the mode shapes, the fundamental mode of the
   power distribution, which also coincides with the desired reactor power
   distribution during operation, is used in the control system design. The
   nonlinear modal models are linearized around desired operating points.
   Based on the linearized model, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control
   approach is used to synthesize a state feedback controller. The
   performance of this controller has been evaluated by using the original
   nonlinear models under load-following conditions. It has been
   demonstrated that the proposed reactor control system can produce more
   uniform power distribution than the traditional reactor regulation
   systems (RRS); in particular, it is more effective in compensating the
   Xenon induced transients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The separation of natural homologues provides a great challenge due to
   high similarities of their structures and properties. In this work, the
   use of the polymeric extractant polyethylenimine (PEI) for the
   separation of a-tocopherol from the tocopherol homologues was
   investigated. Various PEIcosolvent solutions were used to extract
   tocopherols from their hexane solutions. The effects of PEI molecular
   weight, cosolvent type, and PEIcosolvent composition were systematically
   studied. High distribution and selectivity coefficients of tocopherols
   were obtained with PEIacrylonitrile (ACN) as the extractant. A clear
   advantage of PEI extractant is its stimuli-responsive property triggered
   by CO2. PEIextracted tocopherols could be replaced and released from PEI
   chains with CO2 bubbling, with PEICO2 precipitated out from the extract
   phase, which greatly facilitates the back extraction of tocopherols and
   the recovery of PEI for reuse. With CO2 bubbling, it took only three
   back extractions to recover over 90\% tocopherols, compared with 12 in
   theory without CO2 treatment. Precipitated PEICO2 could be redissolved
   in cosolvent for reuse by N-2 bubbling and heating. The distribution
   coefficients decreased by approximately 10\% after being recycled three
   times.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this paper are to examine the use of volumetric strain
   rate and pressure enhancement strategies for low order finite elements,
   and to present a stable matrix-free algorithm for solving steady-state
   flow problems. Algorithms based on the method of successive
   approximation and low order finite elements are examined for determining
   the steady-state flow field of a boundary-valued problem consisting of
   an incompressible material. It is shown that both volumetric strain rate
   and pressure enhancement are required to mitigate pathological locking
   and nonphysical pressure variations. Care must however be taken when
   introducing pressure enhancement, which helps mitigate the pressure from
   drifting, as the stress field is perturbed from equilibrium. An
   algorithm based on dynamic relaxation and radial return stress
   calculations is presented for matrix free calculations dealing with
   stress-dependent creep. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonances in metal nanoparticles are an emerging
   technology platform for nano-optics applications from sensing to solar
   energy conversion. The electromagnetic near field associated with these
   resonances arises from modes determined by the shape, size, and
   composition of the metal nanoparticle. When coupled in the near field,
   multiple resonant modes can interact to give rise to interference
   effects offering fine control of both the spectral response and spatial
   distribution of fields near the particle. Here, we present an
   examination of experimental electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of
   silver nanorod monomer surface plasmon modes and present an explanation
   of observed spatial amplitude modulation of the Fabry-Perot resonance
   modes of these silver nanorods using electrodynamics simulations. For
   these simulations, we identify differences in spectral peak symmetry in
   light scattering and electron spectroscopies (EELS and
   cathodoluminescence) and analyze the distinct near-field responses of
   silver nanorods to plane-wave light and electron beam excitation in
   terms of a coupled oscillator model. Effects of properties of the
   material and the incident field are evaluated, and the spatially
   resolved EELS signals are shown to provide a signature for assessing
   Fano-like interference effects in silver nanorods. These findings
   outline key considerations and challenges for interpreting electron
   microscopy data on plasmonic nanoparticles for understanding nanoscale
   optics and for characterization and design of photonic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The increased adoption of martensite-containing advanced high strength
   steels, such as martensitic and dual-phase steels, into automotive
   applications has led to concerns among practitioners with respect to
   softening during rapid tempering cycles such as those experienced during
   laser welding. Past studies on rapid tempering have successfully modeled
   the rapid tempering process; however, the activation energies and
   softening rates calculated did not match the classic literature values
   associated with martensite tempering. The present study examined rapid
   tempering data for a martensitic steel and separated the softening
   process into two stages: carbide nucleation and carbide coarsening or
   growth. The activation energies calculated for each process were found
   to be consistent with classic literature values for diffusion controlled
   nucleation and growth of carbides during martensite tempering. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Conventional electrochemical dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors are expensive
   as they use platinum in their construction. In addition, these sensors
   biofoul when used in natural or waste water, which leads to reduced
   sensitivity and variable performance. Here, we solve these problems by:
   1) replacing platinum with hemin as the low-cost alternative for
   electrocatalysing the oxygen reduction reaction and 2) using silicone
   rubber {[}poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)] functionalized with
   polyethyleneglycol (PEG) as the anti-biofouling gas permeable membrane
   to provide selectivity with an increased lifetime. This DO sensor has a
   sensitivity of 20.7 (mu A/cm(2))/(mg/L) of DO in a concentration range
   of 2-7 mg/L. In addition, the common interferences, such as phosphates
   and nitrates, show minor influence in the DO detection. Furthermore, the
   PEG functionalization of PDMS membrane reduced biofouling and increased
   the lifetime of the sensor by 20 times in accelerated biofouling
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Prediction and Retrodiction Algorithms for Path-Constrained Targets}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents algorithms for prediction and retrodiction of
   targets whose motion is constrained by external conditions (e.g.,
   shipping lanes, roads). The targets are moving along paths defined by
   waypoints and segments. Measurements are obtained by sensors (e.g.,
   spaceborne) at low revisit rates. Existing tracking algorithms assume
   that the targets follow the same motion model between successive
   measurements, but in a low revisit rate scenario targets may change the
   motion model between successive measurements. The proposed prediction
   algorithm addresses this issue by considering the possible changes in
   the motion model whenever targets move to a different segment. Further,
   when a target approaches an intersection, it has the possibility to
   travel into one of the multiple segments beyond that intersection. To
   predict the probable locations, multiple hypotheses for segments are
   introduced and a probability is calculated for each segment hypothesis.
   When measurements become available later, segment hypothesis
   probabilities are updated based on a combined mode likelihood and a
   sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is carried out to reject the
   unlikely hypotheses. Retrodiction for path-constrained targets is also
   considered, because in some scenarios it is desirable to find out a
   target's location at some previous time (e.g., at the time of an
   accident) given all subsequent measurements. A retrodiction algorithm is
   also developed for path-constrained targets so as to facilitate motion
   forensic analysis. Simulation results and a performance measure for
   path-constrained target tracking are presented to validate the proposed
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A miniaturized oxygenator device that is perfused like an artificial
   placenta via the umbilical vessels may have significant potential to
   save the lives of newborns with respiratory insufficiency. Recently we
   presented the concept of an integrated modular lung assist device (LAD)
   that consists of stacked microfluidic single oxygenator units (SOUs) and
   demonstrated the technical details and operation of SOU prototypes. In
   this article, we present a LAD prototype that is designed to accommodate
   the different needs of term and preterm infants by permitting changing
   of the number of parallel-stacked microfluidic SOUs according to the
   actual body weight. The SOUs are made of polydimethylsiloxane, arranged
   in parallel, and connected though 3D-printed polymeric interconnects to
   form the LAD. The flow characteristics and the gas exchange properties
   were tested in vitro using human blood. We found that the pressure drop
   of the LAD increased linearly with flow rate. Gas exchange rates of
   2.4-3.8 mu L/min/cm(2) (0.3-0.5 mL/kg/min) and 6.4-10.1 mu L/min/cm(2)
   (0.8-1.3 mL/kg/min) for O-2 and CO2, respectively, were achieved. We
   also investigated protein adsorption to provide preliminary information
   on the need for application of anticoagulant coating of LAD materials.
   Albumin adsorption, as measured by gold staining, showed that surface
   uptake was evenly distributed and occurred at the monolayer level (>0.2
   mu g/cm(2)). Finally, we also tested the LAD under in vivo conditions
   using a newborn piglet model (body weight 1.65-2.0 kg). First, the
   effect of an arteriovenous bypass via a carotid artery-to-jugular vein
   shortcut on heart rate and blood pressure was investigated. Heart rate
   and mean arterial blood pressure remained stable for extracorporeal flow
   rates of up to 61 mL/kg/min (101 mL/min). Next, the LAD was connected to
   umbilical vessels (maximum flow rate of 24 mL/min {[}10.4 mL/kg/min]),
   and O-2 gas exchange was measured under hypoxic conditions (FiO2 = 0.15)
   and was found to be 3.0 mu L/min/cm(2). These results are encouraging
   and support the feasibility of an artificial placental design for an
   LAD.}},

Abstract = {{For a nucleus with a half integral spin and a strong quadrupole
   coupling, the central transition (from magnetic quantum number -1/2 to
   +1/2) in the spectrum shows a characteristic lineshape. By strong
   coupling, we mean an interaction strong enough so that second-order
   perturbation theory is needed, yet still sufficient. The spectrum of a
   static sample is well-known and the magic-angle-spinning (MAS spectrum)
   is different, but still can be calculated. The important features of
   both these spectra are singularities and steps in the lineshape, since
   these are the main tools in fitting the calculated spectrum to
   experimental data. A useful tool in this investigation is a plot of the
   frequency as a function of orientation over the surface of the unit
   sphere. These plots have maxima, minima and saddle points, and these
   correspond to the features of the spectrum. We used these plots to
   define both the positions and derive new formulae for the heights of the
   features and we now extend this to the magic-angle spinning case. For
   the first time, we identify the orientations corresponding to the
   features of the MAS spectra and derive formulae for the heights. We then
   compare the static and MAS cases and show the relationships between the
   features in the two spectra. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   using various energy sustainable designs. In the solar-powered case,
   cost-effective nodes must be provisioned with a combination of a solar
   panel and a battery, which is sufficient to prevent future node outage.
   During the network design phase, a bandwidth usage profile (BUP) is
   assumed, and historical solar insolation traces are used to determine
   the minimum-cost provisioning that is required for each network node. In
   practical systems, however, there are usually restrictions in the way
   that the nodes can be positioned, and this results in a time-varying and
   node-dependent attenuation of the available solar energy. Unfortunately,
   conventional resource provisioning methods cannot take this into
   account; therefore, the deployed system may be unnecessarily expensive.
   In this paper, the resource provisioning problem is considered from this
   point of view. We first review conventional resource provisioning
   mechanisms and give an example that shows the value of introducing
   positional solar insolation awareness. A provisioning algorithm is then
   introduced that takes known positional variations into consideration
   when performing the energy provisioning. A variety of results are then
   presented, which show that reductions in total network provisioning cost
   can be obtained using the proposed methodology, compared with
   conventional algorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs very well
   compared with a linear programming formulation, which gives lower bounds
   on the node resource provisioning cost assignments.}},

Abstract = {{As a substrate candidate for low-cost III-nitride thin film growth,
   3C-SiC whiskers are employed and manipulated in this work. The alignment
   of the whiskers is achieved on a patterned 3M Vikuiti Brightness

   approach is higher than the whiskers lined up by extrusion methods
   according to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The aligned whiskers are
   transferred from the 3M film and embedded into an alumina matrix by tape
   casting. A self-regulating sintering technique for SiC whiskers is used
   to protect the whiskers from being oxidized in air during sintering at
   1600 degrees C. The aligned whiskers are rigidly embedded in the alumina
   matrix as shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry energy mapping images. GaN thin

Abstract = {{The formulation of dilute, transparent ophthalmic emulsions (eye drops)
   with long shelf lives is a challenge because of the tendency of the
   emulsion droplets to aggregate, particularly in the presence of the
   water-soluble polymers typically used in eye drops. While many functions
   of eye drops, such as lubricity and residence time in the eye, are
   promoted by high concentrations of high molecular weight water-soluble
   polymers, emulsified lipids and drugs aggregate in the eye drop bottle
   if the polymer concentration is above the critical flocculation
   concentration (CFC). The purpose is to develop a simple approach to
   predict the CFC for polymers based on information readily available in
   the literature. High molecular weight guar was hydrolyzed to give a
   series of guar samples spanning a wide range of average molecular
   weights. The CFC values and critical viscosity concentrations were
   measured as functions guar properties, using electrophoresis, dynamic
   light scattering and rheology measurements. The higher the guar
   molecular weight, the lower was the CFC, the maximum concentration that
   can be tolerated in the eye drop formulation. The guar CFC values were
   approximately equal to the overlap concentrations where guar molecules
   start to overlap in solution. We propose that the CFC can be estimated
   for any water-soluble polymer using the polymer molecular weight and the
   readily available Mark Houwink parameters, thus providing a design rule
   for ophthalmic emulsions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying microstructural changes related to solvent effects in their
   early stages to prevent mechanical losses in polymers may be crucial,
   especially for applications where a leak is hazardous, as in fuel piping
   and storage tanks. Acoustic Emissions (AE) testing has proven to be a
   valuable tool for monitoring material failure, though mostly until now
   for composite systems. The present study examines the use of AE
   techniques to monitor and characterize the effects of two different
   chemical agents (i.e. an aqueous detergent and toluene) on the structure
   of a semi-crystalline polymer (high density polyethylene, HOPE) over
   different periods of exposure. Characterization of the aged polymer by
   tensile testing and X-ray diffraction was correlated with the
   signal-based and parameter-based analysis of AE information. Results
   presented reinforce the use of AE testing as a promising technique for
   understanding structural changes in polymers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The photothermal properties of vertically etched gallium arsenide
   nanowire arrays are examined using Raman spectroscopy. The nanowires are
   arranged in square lattices with a constant pitch of 400 nm and
   diameters ranging from 50 to 155 nm. The arrays were illuminated using a
   532 nm laser with an incident energy density of 10 W/mm(2). Nanowire
   temperatures were highly dependent on the nanowire diameter and were
   determined by measuring the spectral red-shift for both TO and LO
   phonons. The highest temperatures were observed for 95 nm diameter
   nanowires, whose top facets and sidewalls heated up to 600 and 440 K,
   respectively, and decreased significantly for the smaller or larger
   diameters studied. The diameter-dependent heating is explained by
   reasonant coupling of the incident laser light into optical modes off
   the nanowires, resulting in increased absorption. Photothermal activity
   in a given nanowire diameter can be optimized by proper wavelength
   selection, as confirmed using computer simulations. This demonstrates
   that the photothermal properties of GaAs nanowires can be enhanced and
   tuned by using a photonic lattice structure and that smaller nanowire
   diameters are not necessarily better to achieve efficient photothermal
   conversion. The diameter and wavelength dependence of the optical
   coupling could allow for localized temperature gradients by creating
   arrays which consist of different diameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the results from a test program focusing on the behavior
   of eleven fully grouted reinforced masonry (RM) structural walls
   containing confined boundary elements are analyzed and presented
   according to force, displacement, and performance-based seismic design
   considerations. To be consistent with current force-based seismic design
   codes, analysis is presented to predict the strength, stiffness,
   displacements, and ductility-related force modification factors using
   the eleven test specimens. A new estimate of the plastic hinge region
   for displacement calculations is also proposed which considers the
   inherent planes of weakness in masonry mortar joints as well as the
   angle of inclination of shear cracks. Finally, within the context of
   performance-based design methodologies, the occurrence of specific
   damage states is identified. A methodology is proposed to estimate crack
   width in the walls based on curvature measurements which is also
   verified using digital image correlation analysis. The paper presents
   key seismic design parameters that are expected to contribute to the

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel class of O-2/N-2 switchable polymers is reported,

   N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMA). The copolymer is random and
   contains 10 FMA units and 85 DMA units. Its aqueous solution becomes
   transparent with O-2 bubbling and turns to turbid with N-2 purging. This
   O-2/N-2-responsive switchability between the transparent and turbid
   states is reversible. The FMA-DMA copolymer is thermosensitive and has a
   lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 24.5 degrees C. O-2
   molecules interact with fluorinated groups of the copolymer and increase
   the LCST to 55 degrees C. Purging N-2 removes O-2 and returns the
   polymer thermosensitivity back to its initial state. The switchability
   occurs in the whole temperature range (24.5-55 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{To investigate whether postural change from erect to recumbent position
   affects calf muscle water diffusivity.
   Ten healthy adults (27.2 +/- A 4.9 years, 3 females) were imaged at
   baseline (following assumption of recumbent position), and after 34 min
   (session 2) and 64 min (session 3) of laying supine within a 3T MRI
   scanner. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) eigenvalues, fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were evaluated
   in five calf muscles (anterior and posterior tibialis and triceps surae)
   during each of the three imaging sessions.
   Significant decreases were observed in all of the eigenvalues and ADC in
   each of the muscles with postural change. These reductions ranged from
   3.2 to 6.7 \% and 3.4 to 7.5 \% for the various DTI metrics, following
   34 and 64 min of supine rest, respectively (P < 0.05). No significant
   differences were noted in ADC or eigenvalues between the second and
   third imaging sessions for any muscle. FA did not change significantly
   with postural manipulation in any muscle compartment.
   Diffusion tensor imaging indices were altered with postural change. As
   differences were not apparent between the latter two imaging sessions,
   we suggest that a short supine resting period (similar to 34 min) is
   sufficient for muscle diffusivity to stabilize prior to quantitative MR
   imaging in healthy young adults.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology in power
   generation has been limited, in no small part, by material degradation
   issues affecting the stack lifetime, and hence, the economic viability.
   A numeric study was conducted to determine if the life of an SOFC could
   be extended when integrated with a recuperated gas turbine system.
   Dynamic modeling tools developed at the National Energy Technology
   Laboratory (NETL) for real-time applications were applied to evaluate
   life to failure for both a standalone SOFC and a hybrid SOFC gas
   turbine. These models were modified using empirical relations to
   experimental degradation data to incorporate degradation as a function
   of current density and fuel utilization. For the control strategy of
   shifting power to the turbine as fuel cell voltage degrades, the SOFC
   life could be extended dramatically, significantly impacting the
   economic potential of the technology.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{In water-resources management problems, uncertainties exist in a number
   of impact factors and water-allocation processes, which can bring about
   enormous difficulties and challenges in generating desired decision
   alternatives under such complexities. In this study, a two-stage
   credibility-constrained programming with Hurwicz criterion (TCP-CH)
   approach is developed for water resources management and planning under
   uncertainty. TCP-CH can tackle uncertainties presented as probability
   distributions and fuzzy sets that exist in left- and right-hand sides of
   constraints and in objective function; it can also permit in-depth
   analyses of various policy scenarios based on confidence degrees that
   are associated with different levels of economic penalties when the
   promised targets are violated. The TCP-CH method is applied to a real
   case of planning water resources in Kaidu-qongque River basin, which is
   one of the widest regions of China. Support-vector-regression (SVR)
   technique is introduced into TCP-CH for predicting the water demand in
   the future, which takes advantage of uncertainty reflection and dynamic
   analysis. Results of water allocation, water shortage, system benefit,
   and economic penalty are obtained. The results discover that water
   deficit has brought negative effects on regional economic development,
   particularly for agricultural production activities. Moreover, tradeoffs
   between economic benefit and system-failure risk are also examined under
   different risk preferences of decision makers (i.e., optimistic and
   pessimistic criteria), which support generating an increased robustness
   in risk control for water resources allocation under uncertainties.
   These findings can facilitate the local decision makers in adjusting the
   current water-allocation pattern based on risk preference option
   (Hurwicz criterion) to satisfy the increasing water demand. (C) 2014

Title = {{Passive Control of Trapped Mode Resonance of Ducted Cavities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Gas flow over ducted cavities can excite strong acoustic resonances
   within the confined volumes housing the cavities. When the wavelength of
   the resonant acoustic modes is comparable with, or smaller than, the
   cavity dimensions, these modes are referred to as trapped acoustic
   modes. The flow excitation mechanism causing the resonance of these
   trapped modes in axisymmetric shallow cavities has been investigated
   experimentally in a series of papers by Aly and Ziada (2010,
   ``Flow-Excited Resonance of Trapped Modes of Ducted Shallow
   Cavities,{''} J. Fluids Struct., 26, pp. 92-120; 2011, ``Azimuthal
   Behaviour of Flow-Excited Diametral Modes of Internal Shallow
   Cavities,{''} J. Sound Vib., 330, pp. 3666-3683;2012, ``Effect of Mean
   Flow on the Trapped Modes of Internal Cavities,{''} J. Fluids Struct.,
   33, pp. 70-84). In this paper, the same experimental set-up is used to
   investigate the effect of the upstream edge geometry on the acoustic
   resonance of trapped modes. The investigated geometries include sharp
   and rounded cavity corners, chamfering the upstream edge, and spoilers
   of different types and sizes. Rounding-off the cavity edges is found to
   increase the pulsation amplitude substantially, but the resonance
   lock-on range is delayed, i.e., it is shifted to higher flow velocities.
   Similarly, chamfering the upstream corner delays the onset of resonance,
   but maintains its intensity in comparison with that of sharp edges.
   Spoilers, or vortex generators, added at the upstream edge have been
   found to be the most effective means to suppress the resonance. However,
   the minimum spoiler size which is needed to suppress the resonance
   increases as the cavity size becomes larger.}},

Abstract = {{Space-charge and injection limited currents in organic diodes have been
   analyzed using a unified model. Both currents have been modeled using
   the transport equations combined with a proper value of the free charge
   density at the metal-organic interface. The method has been applied to
   diodes with different organic materials, metal contacts and lengths of
   the organic materials. This unified model accurately reproduces
   published current-voltage curves for a variety of diode structures
   operating at different temperatures and voltages. The results of the
   method, in the injection regime, have been compared with the results of
   pure injection models developed by other authors. The reduction of the
   computational time and the number of parameters in our model are
   important advantages of our procedure. Moreover, it is an alternative
   where the injection models start to fail: at low applied voltages, close
   to the Ohmic regime, and for low heights of the energy barrier at the
   interface. The treatment is complemented with a compact model that
   relates the current density j with the free charge-carrier density at
   the interface p(f)(0): p(f)(0) = K(1)j(m) + K-2, where the parameter K-1
   depends on the barrier height at the interface, m depends on the organic
   material and K-2 controls the flat zone at low currents to include the
   dependence with thermal carriers and impurities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A method to characterize metal-organic contacts subjected to controlled
   technological treatments or unintentional degradation processes is
   proposed. The procedure is useful to characterize different fundamental
   aspects of a metal-organic structure such as the height of the interface
   energy barrier, the presence of impurities or trapping effects and the
   carrier mobility. Current-voltage curves in organic diodes are analyzed
   and the value of the free carrier density at the metal-organic interface
   is extracted and discussed. The charge carrier density is chosen for
   this analysis as this is one of the key physical parameters in the
   understanding of the physical processes involved in the device
   operation. The extracted charge, when described as a function of the
   current density, gives information about the doping and impurity
   concentration, the effective barrier seen by the carriers at the
   metal-organic interface or effective barriers seen by the carriers in
   the hopping processes across the organic material. An important
   advantage of the proposed procedure is the low computational time. Also,
   the procedure aims to provide a quick analysis for researchers on how
   the physical properties of the devices are evolving when they are
   technologically altered or degraded. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Inexpensive, easy-to-process, light-weight polymer-based materials that
   are biocompatible, mechanically flexible, and optically transparent have
   emerged as alternatives to metals and ceramics in the packaging of
   implantable sensors. These materials have been used to package
   components such as microelectrode arrays, telemetric coils and
   structural membranes. Polymers are also being used for the
   encapsulations and coatings of the implants. The devices and packages
   require fine-pitch, low-loss, and highly-conductive paths on
   mechanically and chemically reliable polymer films. In this review,
   several polymers used for implantation and related integration
   technologies are identified. We give an overview of novel applications
   of polymers in implantable sensor packages, and identify future
   directions for their application. Polymers exhibit high moisture
   absorption rate, high-frequency electrical loss, and low mechanical
   stability. These properties are aggravated when polymers are used for in
   vivo applications. Also, the integration of polymers with
   polymers/metals at high bonding temperatures and pressures may degrade
   their properties and interfaces. Furthermore, adhesive bonding and
   physical/chemical deposition methods for the integration may introduce
   non-hermetic, permeable, optically opaque, and poorly conductive
   interfaces. Thus, creating polymer-based high-density and
   small-dimension structures are critical for packaging. To address these
   issues, polymers with improved characteristics as well as integration
   techniques using low bonding temperature and pressure are indispensable.
   Liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and surface activated bonding (SAB)
   technologies meet these requirements. SAB technologies enable nanoscaled
   polymer-polymer/metal bonding to realize reliable, miniaturized, and
   high-performance packages for implantable sensors. This article is meant
   to serve as a reference for future research in the emerging field of
   implantable sensors by critically assessing the specific merits and
   drawbacks of several material-process combinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Frictional heating results in very high operating temperatures in high
   speed machining but the nanoindentation tests used to evaluate novel PVD
   coating systems for improved cutting performance are invariably
   performed at room temperature. If nanomechanical measurements are to be
   used reliably in the optimisation of coatings for high speed machining
   then it is much better that the measurements are performed at the
   relevant temperature. High temperature nanoindentation data are reviewed
   for a wide range of nitride-based hard coatings on cemented carbide and
   design rules suggested for coating optimisation for different machining
   applications. The importance of high temperature mechanical properties
   and microstructure on the adaptive and multifunctional behaviour in
   improving tool life is investigated. The coatings studied show large
   differences in how their hardness, modulus and H/E vary with increasing
   temperature which have a significant influence on their behaviour in
   high temperature mechanical contact applications which have differing
   requirements in terms of hot hardness and plasticity. In continuous
   high-speed turning operations the high temperature hardness is paramount
   and coatings with high hot hardness display longer tool life. In
   interrupted cutting conditions toughness and plasticity are at least as
   important, and in end milling of hardened steels for example, high hot
   hardness should be combined with improved plasticity for longer tool
   life. Multilayer AlTiCrSiYN/AlTiCrN coatings have shown improved
   performance compared to the state of the art monolayer coatings. The
   reasons for this improved performance are discussed. Overall, the high
   temperature nanoindentation data show excellent correlation to coating
   life in high speed machining applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Nanocatalyst degradation is a serious limiting factor for the
   commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Although the
   degradation has been extensively studied in the past through various ex
   situ electrochemical methods, employing an in situ technique can greatly
   improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved during the
   electrochemical cycling. In this work, we have employed an in situ
   liquid cell inside a TEM for a simultaneous investigation of the
   structural evolution and electrochemical response of Pt-Fe
   nanocatalysts. We demonstrate that the coarsening processes of these
   nanocatalyst particles, including the nucleation and growth, are not
   uniform, both in space and in time scale. The growth rate is found to be
   both site- and potential-dependent. Furthermore, these particles were
   found to exhibit considerably different behaviors when attached to an
   electrode as opposed to when isolated in the electrolyte. With Pt-Fe
   nanoalloy system as a candidate material, this work demonstrates that
   the in situ structural characterization of nanocatalysts under
   electrochemical bias and inside the native electrolyte environment
   provides much deeper insight into the catalyst degradation mechanisms as
   compared to the routine ex situ electrochemical studies.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented of fabricating gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanowire
   arrays of controlled diameter and period by reactive ion etching of a

   substrate is subsequently removed by selective etching, using the same
   InGaP etch stop layer, to create a substrate-free GaAs nanowire array.
   The optical absorptance of the nanowire array was then directly measured
   without absorption from a substrate. We directly observe absorptance
   spectra that can be tuned by the nanowire diameter, as explained with
   rigorous coupled wave analysis. These results illustrate strong optical
   absorption suitable for nanowire-based solar cells and multi-spectral
   absorption for wavelength discriminating photodetectors. The
   solar-weighted absorptance above the bandgap of GaAs was 94\% for a
   nanowire surface coverage of only 15\%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   barrier to the use of paper as a platform for microfluidic bioassays.
   Herein we describe a simple, scalable protocol based on adsorption and
   cross-linking of poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA)
   derivatives that reduces nonspecific adsorption of a range of proteins
   to filter paper by at least 1 order of magnitude without significantly
   changing the fiber morphology or paper macroporosity. A lateral-flow
   test strip coated with POEGMA facilitates effective protein transport
   while also confining the colorimetric reporting signal for easier
   detection, giving improved performance relative to bovine serum albumin
   (BSA)-blocked paper. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays based on
   POEGMA-coated paper also achieve lower blank values, higher
   sensitivities, and lower detection limits relative to ones based on
   paper blocked with BSA or skim milk. We anticipate that POEGMA-coated
   paper can function as a platform for the design of portable, disposable,

Abstract = {{The traditional view of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) focuses on its
   role in episodic memory. However, some of the underlying functions of
   the MTL can be ascertained from its wider role in supporting spatial
   cognition in concert with parietal and prefrontal regions. The MTL is
   strongly implicated in the formation of enduring allocentric
   representations (e.g., O'Keefe, 1976; King et al., 2002; Ekstrom et al.,
   2003). According to our BBB model (Byrne et al., 2007), these
   representations must interact with head-centered and body-centered
   representations in posterior parietal cortex via a transformation
   circuit involving retrosplenial areas. Egocentric sensory
   representations in parietal areas can then cue the recall of allocentric
   spatial representations in long-term memory and, conversely, the
   products of retrieval in MTL can generate mental imagery within a
   parietal ``window.{''} Such imagery is necessarily egocentric and forms
   part of visuospatial working memory, in which it can be manipulated for
   the purpose of planning/imagining the future. Recent fMRI evidence
   (Lambrey et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) supports the BBB model. To
   further test the model, we had participants learn the locations of
   objects in a virtual scene and tested their spatial memory under
   conditions that impose varying demands on the transformation circuit. We
   analyzed how brain activity correlated with accuracy in judging the
   direction of an object (1) from visuospatial working memory (we assume
   transient working memory due to the order of tasks and the absence of
   change in viewpoint, but long-term memory retrieval is also possible),
   (2) after a rotation of viewpoint, or (3) after a rotation and
   translation of viewpoint (judgment of relative direction). We found
   performance-related activity in both tasks requiring viewpoint rotation
   (ROT and JRD, i.e., conditions 2 and 3) in the core medial temporal to
   medial parietal circuit identified by the BBB model. These results are
   consistent with the predictions of the BBB model, and shed further light
   on the neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory, mental imagery and
   viewpoint transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Online video streaming has been experiencing great popularity in recent
   years, and an increasing number of video contents are now delivered via
   wireless networks, which brings an overwhelming burden towards mobile
   operators. Femtocells are introduced to improve the area spectral
   efficiency of wireless video delivery via short link transmission. The
   backhaul pressure in the presence of dense deployment of femtocells can
   be reduced by the technologies of femtocaching. In this paper, video
   clip selection and video clip assignment problems are considered for
   femtocaching. On one hand, since mobile users always pursue the video
   clips that are highly popular and can be played smoothly, it is
   important to ensure the satisfaction of mobile users. On the other hand,
   the assignment of multiple video clips among multiple femto-caches is
   also significant as the capacity of each cache is limited. To model the
   video selection dynamics of mobile users, an evolutionary game is
   introduced and two algorithms are proposed to result in an evolutionary
   stable strategies, which correspond to the balance of video popularity
   and video quality. For the video assignment problem, the auction-based
   algorithms are proposed with low complexity to approximate the social
   optimality with the limited caching capacities. As a consequence, all
   femtocells and mobile video users are satisfied with their utilities
   respectively. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclodextrins (CDs) are typically functionalized to increase their
   solubility or provide reactive functional groups suitable for grafting
   onto polymer supports designed for controlled release applications. In
   this work, a systematic investigation was performed on the binding
   behaviour of the model drug dexamethasone with beta CD derivatives
   functionalized with a small, negatively charged moiety (carboxyl groups,
   CM) and a large, neutral, reactive moiety (hydrazide groups, Hzd), both
   free and grafted to dextran. Solubilization capacities and thermodynamic
   parameters were examined through phase solubility analysis, the method
   of continuous variation, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Alternate
   mechanisms of solubilization were also investigated by probing
   aggregation of both free and complexed beta CD derivatives using
   nanoparticle tracking analysis. CM/beta CD and Hzd/beta CD derivatives
   exhibited similar complexation behaviours with dexamethasone: 1:1
   stoichiometry, linear phase solubility profiles, and consistent binding
   enthalpies. Increased functionalization reduced the complex stability
   constant as well as the complexation efficiency, while polymer grafting
   resulted in no significant change in binding properties. CM/beta CD
   derivatives complexed with dexamethasone formed more and larger
   aggregates, while Hzd/beta CD derivatives formed significantly fewer,
   smaller aggregates and dextran-grafted beta CD did not aggregate. Such
   characterization of pap derivatives provides a framework for designing
   beta CDs as pharmaceutical excipients or drug binding sites in drug
   delivery vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},

Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{While injectable, in situ gelling hydrogels have attracted increasing
   attention in the biomedical literature due to their minimally invasive
   administration potential, little is known about the internal morphology
   of these hydrogels and thus how to engineer precursor polymer
   compositions to achieve desired hydrogel properties. In this paper, the
   internal morphology of injectable in situ gelling hydrogels based on
   hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized poly(oligoethylene glycol
   methacrylate) precursors with varying lower critical solution
   temperatures (LCSTs) is investigated using a combination of
   spectrophotometry, small-angle neutron scattering, and light scattering.
   If two precursor polymers with similar LCSTs are used to prepare the
   hydrogel, relatively homogeneous hydrogels are produced (analogous to
   conventional step-growth polymerized hydrogels); this result is observed
   provided that gelation is sufficiently slow for diffusional mixing to
   compensate for any incomplete mechanical mixing in the double-barrel
   syringe and the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) of the
   hydrogel is sufficiently high that phase separation does not occur on
   the time scale of gelation. Hydrogels prepared from precursor polymers
   with different LCSTs (1 polymer/barrel) also retain transparency,
   although their internal morphology is significantly less homogeneous.
   However, if functionalized polymers with different LCSTs are mixed in
   each barrel (i.e., 2 polymers/barrel, such that a gelling pair of
   precursors with both low and high LCSTs is present), opaque hydrogels
   are produced that contain significant inhomogeneities that are enhanced
   as the temperature is increased; this suggests phase separation of the
   hydrogel into lower and higher LCST domains. Based on this work, the
   internal morphology of injectable hydrogels can be tuned by engineering
   the gelation time and the physical properties (i.e., miscibility) of the
   precursor polymers, insight that can be applied to improve the design of
   such hydrogels for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Supercells are often used in ab initio calculations to model compound
   alloys, surfaces, and defects. One of the main challenges of supercell
   electronic structure calculations is to recover the Bloch character of

   weight approach to unfolding the electronic structure of group III-V and
   II-VI semiconductor solid solutions. The illustrative examples include
   formation of donorlike states in dilute Ga(PN) and associated
   enhancement of its optical activity, direct observation of the valence
   band anticrossing in dilute GaAs:Bi, and a topological band crossover in
   ternary (HgCd)Te alloy accompanied by emergence of high-mobility Kane
   fermions. The analysis facilitates interpretation of optical and
   transport characteristics of alloys that are otherwise ambiguous in
   traditional first-principles supercell calculations.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the application of a rolling horizon optimization
   strategy to an integrated solid-oxide fuel cell/compressed air energy
   storage plant for load-following is investigated. A reduced-order model
   of the integrated plant is used to simulate and optimize each
   optimization interval as a mixed integer nonlinear program. Forecasting
   uncertainties are considered through the addition of measurement noise
   and use of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of rolling
   horizon optimization gives significant reductions to the
   sum-of-squared-errors between the demand and supply profiles. A
   sensitivity analysis is used to show that increasing the forecasting and
   optimization horizon improves load tracking with diminishing returns.
   Incorporating white Gaussian noise to demand forecasts has a marginal
   impact on error, even when a relatively high noise power of is used.
   Consistently over- or under-predicting demand has a greater impact on
   the plant's load-tracking error. However, even under worst-case
   forecasting scenarios, using a rolling horizon optimization scheme
   provides a more than 50\% reduction in error when compared to the
   original system. An economic objective function is formulated to improve
   gross revenue using electricity spot-prices, but results in a trade-off
   with load-following performance. The results indicate that the rolling
   horizon optimization approach could potentially be applied to future
   municipal-scale fuel cell/compressed air storage systems to achieve
   power levels which closely follow real grid power cycles using existing
   prediction models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-linked polymer particles were prepared via surfactant-free
   emulsion copolymerization of 2-(diethylamino)-ethyl methacrylate
   (DEAEMA) and sodium methacrylate (SMA) using
   N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA) as a cross-linker. Generated
   particles are zwitterionic, possessing unique isoelectric points in the
   pH range of 7.5-8.0, which is readily tunable through CO2/N-2 bubbling.
   The particles were found to be highly responsive to CO2/N-2 switching,
   dissolving in water with CO2 bubbling and precipitating with N-2
   bubbling at room temperature. Pickering emulsions of n-dodecane were
   prepared using these particles as the sole emulsifier. These emulsions
   can be rapidly demulsified with CO2 bubbling, resulting in complete
   oil/water phase separations. Nitrogen bubbling efficiently re-emulsifies
   the oil with the aid of homogenization. The rapid
   emulsification/demulsification using CO2/N-2 bubbling at room
   temperature provides these cross-linked zwitterionic particles with
   distinct advantages as functional Pickering surfactants.}},

Abstract = {{The current phase in our transportation system represents a paradigm
   shift from conventional, fossil-fuel-based vehicles into the
   second-generation electric and hybrid vehicles. Electric vehicles (EVs)
   provide numerous advantages compared with conventional vehicles because
   they are more efficient, sustainable, greener, and cleaner. The
   commercial market penetration and success of EVs depend on the
   efficiency, safety, cost, and lifetime of the traction battery pack. One
   of the current key electrification challenges is to accurately estimate
   the battery pack state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH), and
   therefore provide an estimate of the remaining driving range at various
   battery states of life. To estimate the battery SOC, a high-fidelity
   battery model along with a robust, accurate estimation strategy is
   necessary. This paper provides three main contributions: 1) introducing
   a new SOC parameterization strategy and employing it in setting up
   optimizer constraints to estimate battery parameters; 2) identification
   of the full-set of the reduced-order electrochemical battery model
   parameters by using noninvasive genetic algorithm optimization on a
   fresh battery; and 3) model validation by using real-world driving
   cycles. Extensive tests have been conducted on lithium iron
   phosphate-based cells widely used in high-power automotive applications.
   Models can be effectively used onboard of battery management system.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, extensive research has been conducted in the field of battery
   management systems due to increased interest in vehicles
   electrification. Parameters, such as battery state of charge (SOC) and
   state of health, are of critical importance to ensure safety,
   reliability, and prolong battery life. This paper includes the following
   contributions: 1) tracking reduced-order electrochemical battery model
   parameters variations as battery ages, using noninvasive genetic
   algorithm optimization technique; 2) the development of a battery aging
   model capable of capturing battery degradation by varying the effective
   electrode volume; and 3) estimation of the battery critical SOC using a
   new estimation strategy known as the smooth variable structure filter
   based on reduced-order electrochemical model. The proposed filter is
   used for SOC estimation and demonstrates strong robustness to modeling
   uncertainties, which is relatively high in case of reduced-order
   electrochemical models. Batteries used in this research are lithium-iron
   phosphate cells widely used in automotive applications. Extensive
   testing using real-world driving cycles is used for estimation strategy
   application and for conducting the aging test. Limitations of the
   proposed strategy are also highlighted.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is growing momentum across many municipal jurisdictions in North
   America to reuse public and privately held vacant and underutilized
   urban land on a temporary to potentially permanent basis for
   community-centered and community-driven projects. Some uses include
   urban agriculture, parks and open spaces, and linear bikeway or walkway
   connections. Across many jurisdictions, limited resources have been
   allocated to inventorying and determining the valuation of these urban
   assets and their potential to contribute to a city's green
   infrastructure capacity. The purpose of this research is to add an
   augmented capacity to an existing Microsoft Excel-based decision-support
   tool that captures the condition and location of vacant and
   underutilized land, calculates the relative suitability of the
   inventoried land for a suite of reuse strategies, and allows the user to
   evaluate location-allocation modeling scenarios. The additional capacity
   introduced herein provides users with the ability to produce a scaled
   design drawing for each allocated reuse strategy, and subsequently
   perform a life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) based on user-defined design
   scenarios. The application of the design and costing tool, known as
   DECO, to a portion of an underutilized hydro utility corridor in
   Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, is presented and discussed to demonstrate the
   usability and inherent benefits of a graphically based LCCA approach.
   While developed as a decision-support tool for application by community
   groups, DECO has the potential to assist municipal planning staff and
   private and public land owners in clarifying the trade-offs between
   various design alternatives, given a specified life-cycle length. DECO
   is designed to allow the user to perform a series of ``what-if{''}
   scenarios/sensitivity analyses to aid in well-informed green
   infrastructure investment decisions. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Gadolinium detection via in vivo prompt gamma neutron activation
   analysis following gadolinium-based contrast agent injection: a pilot

Abstract = {{Gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agents are routinely used as part of many
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures. The widespread use of these
   agents and concerns about Gd toxicity, motivated us to develop a
   monitoring procedure that could non-invasively measure quantitatively
   potential retention of toxic free Gd in tissues after use of the agent.
   We have been developing a method to measure Gd painlessly and
   non-invasively by prompt gamma neutron activation analysis. In this
   paper we present the results of a pilot study where we show that we can
   measure Gd, quantitatively in vivo, in the lower leg muscle of 10
   participants. A series of three neutron leg scans were performed. The
   effective radiation dose for a single neutron leg scan was very low, 0.6
   mu Sv, so multiple scans were possible. Calibration phantom and in vivo
   detection limits were determined to be identical: 0.58 ppm. Gd was not
   detectable in muscle prior to exposure to the contrast agent Gadovist
   (R). Gd was detected, at greater than 99\% confidence, in 9 participants
   within 1 h of contrast administration and in 1 participant approximately
   3.3 h post-contrast administration. The measured concentrations of Gd
   ranged from 2.0 to 17.3 ppm (6.9 to 56 uncertainties different from
   zero). No detectable Gd was measured in any participant in the third
   neutron scan (conducted 0.7 to 5.9 d post-contrast). The results of this
   study validate our new measurement technology. This technique could be
   used as a non-invasive monitoring procedure for exposure and retention
   of Gd from Gd-based chelates used in MRI.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an interval-fuzzy De Novo programming (IFDNP) method
   for planning water-resources-management systems under uncertainty. IFDNP
   is derived by incorporating the concepts of interval parameters and
   fuzzy sets within a De Novo programming framework. IFDNP has the
   advantages in constructing optimal system design through introducing the
   flexibility into the available resources in the model's constraints.
   Moreover, IFDNP allows the decision makers to achieve a metaoptimal
   system performance and improve the performance of compromise solutions,
   and it is effective for dealing with the system design problems
   involving multiple objectives and multiple uncertainties. The IFDNP is
   then applied to a case study of designing an inexact optimal system with
   budget limit for water resources management and planning. Various
   scenarios that are associated with different levels of economic
   implication consequences and water allocation patterns under uncertainty
   are analyzed. Results can help decision makers to evaluate alternatives
   of system designs and to determine which of these designs can most
   efficiently achieve the desired economic objective constrained by

Abstract = {{Water quality management is essential for preserving valuable water
   resources and facilitating sustainable socioeconomic development in
   watershed systems. However, it is challenging for decision makers to
   identify desired schemes for management of economic development and
   environmental protection due to complexities of rural systems. In this
   study, an inexact two-stage water quality management (ITWQM) model is
   developed for supporting economic and environmental management of a
   rural area in Heshui Watershed. hi the modeling formulation, pollutant
   discharge and soil loss are allowed under a range of relaxed constraints
   in association with a variety of probabilities, such that the
   reliability of satisfying (or risk of violating) system constraints can
   be analyzed; besides, penalties are imposed when policies expressed as
   allowable pollutant discharge levels are not satisfied. Solutions in
   connection with regional sustainable development such as land use, water
   quality protection, crop cultivation, livestock husbandry, forest
   expansion, fishery and industrial production, have been obtained. The
   results can be used for generating decision alternatives and helping
   local managers to identify desired policies under various environmental,
   economic, and system-reliability conditions. Decisions at a lower risk
   level would lead to an increased reliability in fulfilling environmental
   requirements but with a reduced system benefit; conversely, a desire for
   increasing system benefit could result in a raised risk of violating
   environmental constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, the access to safe drinking water is a huge problem. In fact,
   the number of persons without safe drinking water is increasing, even
   though it is an essential ingredient for human health and development.
   The enormity of the problem also makes it a critical environmental and
   public health issue. Therefore, there is a critical need for
   easy-to-use, compact and sensitive techniques for water quality
   monitoring. Raman spectroscopy has been a very powerful technique to
   characterize chemical composition and has been applied to many areas,
   including chemistry, food, material science or pharmaceuticals. The
   development of advanced Raman techniques and improvements in
   instrumentation, has significantly improved the performance of modern
   Raman spectrometers so that it can now be used for detection of low
   concentrations of chemicals such as in-line monitoring of chemical and
   pharmaceutical contaminants in water. This paper briefly introduces the
   fundamentals of Raman spectroscopy, reviews the development of Raman
   instrumentations and discusses advanced and potential Raman techniques
   for in-line water quality monitoring.}},

Title = {{Seismic Response Analysis of Lightly Reinforced Concrete Block Masonry
   Shear Walls Based on Shake Table Tests}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents detailed analyses of experimental shake table test
   results with the goal of providing a better understanding of the seismic
   performance of lightly reinforced fully grouted masonry shear walls. The
   paper first gives a brief summary of the experimental program followed
   by detailed analyses of the inelastic behavior characteristics of the
   walls. This includes quantifying the walls' displacement ductility
   levels, extent of plastic hinge zones, and equivalent plastic hinge
   lengths based on the experimental results. Separation of the various
   energy components of the system, including those of the shake table, the
   walls, and the external mass support system, based on the experimental
   results, is also carried out. Utilizing the evaluated energy components,
   the characteristics of the system, including the change of input energy
   levels with time and the contributions of the different energy
   dissipation mechanisms (e. g., hysteretic, viscous damping, and coulomb
   friction damping), are quantified. In general, the results from this
   study demonstrate that the displacement ductility capacity of the
   reinforced masonry (RM) walls and their capability to dissipate energy
   through plastic hinging are higher than what is currently recognized by
   the National Building Code of Canada. In addition, the effective dynamic
   properties of the walls including the effective secant stiffness,
   period, and equivalent viscous damping are quantified, and their
   variations at different response levels are characterized. A
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) substitute structure model, based on the
   aforementioned properties, is subsequently used to predict the
   experimental base shear demands of the walls. The study forms a part of
   the ongoing efforts to quantify the seismic performance parameters of RM
   wall systems to facilitate their adoption in the next generation of
   seismic codes in North America. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the highest bottom shear
   stress, induced by wind in an area of Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada
   known as Randle Reef. The study was conducted in support of a component
   of a contaminated sediment remediation plan utilizing a thin layer of
   sand to manage contaminated sediments. Toward this end, four acoustic
   Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) were deployed at two locations in the
   study region to measure velocity profiles for the purpose of indirectly
   measuring bottom shear stress (BSS) and model verification. There is no
   easy way to directly measure BSS in the field. As a result, the use of
   the logarithmic-profile method from the ADCP measured high resolution
   velocity profiles in the bottom layer was explored. This approach,
   according to our best knowledge, has not been published for a wind
   driven flow in a small open water body. To use the indirectly measured
   BSS to estimate the highest BSS in the study area, a three-dimensional
   hydrodynamic model was adopted to provide the spatial and temporal
   information of the bottom flow. The results showed that the modeled and
   measured flow velocity components agreed reasonably well at most of the
   water depths with the correlation coefficients being greater than 0.6.
   However, agreements between the modeled and measured bottom flow speeds
   were worse than expected due to the error contributions from both the
   modeled velocity components. Therefore, the modeled flow speed required
   rescaling based on ADCP velocity measurements before it could be deemed
   reliable. This is especially important in estimation of the BSS with a
   quadratic formula because the calculated BSS is proportional to the
   square of the speed.}},

Pages = {{8-17}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Various tibial augmentations have been employed to overcome the problem
   associated with proximal tibial bony deficiencies mainly in revision
   total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It has generally been recommended that
   stem extensions should always be applied to the tibial tray in the event
   that block augments have been used to compensate for bone loss. The
   rationale for such routine use of stems has not been clearly established
   and further this adds to implant costs and may contribute to substantial
   bone loss if a future revision is required. We investigated the
   stability of three implant configurations (Deltafit Keel tibial tray
   only (no bone loss), tray with block augment (with bone loss), and tray
   with block and extended stem) utilizing both cadaveric human bone as
   well as commercially available composite tibias. The experimental
   results revealed that comparable stability can be achieved with the
   configuration of Deltafit Keel tibial tray and a block as compared to
   the case of Deltafit Keel tray only without bone loss. Addition of a
   stem provided moderate improvement of stability but with significant
   stress shielding. For the amount of bone loss evaluated in this study, a
   Deltafit Keel tibial tray with a block provided adequate stability and
   avoided obvious stress shielding.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers blind detection for a two-way relay system in which
   two source nodes exchange information with each other via a relay node
   using an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. The channel coefficients are
   assumed to be nonreciprocal, i.e., the channel gain between two nodes is
   not identical to that in the reverse link between the same nodes. An
   effective signaling and transmitting scheme using four M-ary phase-shift
   keying (M-PSK) constellation sets is proposed to achieve a unique
   identification of the transmitted symbols and the channel coefficients
   in a noise-free transmission. Blind receivers with full diversity are
   derived for Rayleigh fading channels with Gaussian noise by the
   generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and least squares error (LSE)
   criteria. Constellation selections are investigated for the source nodes
   to transmit at a uniform bit rate in each time slot. Power-allocation
   schemes are discussed to improve further the average error probability
   of the source nodes in the blind detection. Simulation results are
   provided to validate the proposed designs.}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been made to understand
   the effect of various types of error sources in the experiments that can

   fluid and small fluctuations in temperature profile along the constant
   temperature boundaries, on the thermodiffusive separation in a ternary
   hydrocarbon mixture that is subjected to a unidirectional thermal
   gradient, have been investigated. It has been found that the emissive
   boundaries and the static micro-accelerations have a dominant negative
   influence on the thermodiffusive separation. On the other hand, harmonic
   micro-accelerations have anywhere between four to thirty times smaller
   influence on the thermodiffusive separation, than the other types of
   error sources. This is because the errors are introduced in both
   directions due to the oscillating profile of the acceleration, thereby
   canceling each other. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The ability of hyaluronic acid (HA) to act as a functional
   additive in model silicone hydrogel contact lenses to alter the uptake
   and release characteristics of timolol was investigated.
   Methods: Model contact lenses were prepared using 2 primary
   formulations: 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with
   3-methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy) silane (TRIS) in a 9:1
   (wt:wt) ratio or N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) with TRIS in a 1:1 (wt:wt)
   ratio. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was used as the
   cross-linker. Four different model lens compositions were explored:
   unmodified controls, lenses containing HA, lenses that were molecularly
   imprinted with timolol maleate, and those that were both imprinted and
   contained HA. Model lenses were then used in subsequent materials
   characterization, drug loading, and drug release studies.
   Results: Hyaluronic acid was shown to have the ability to act as a
   functional additive in these model contact lenses, significantly
   increasing the drug loading and release mass. This ability seemed to be
   independent of molecular imprinting, but its efficacy was related to the
   concentration of HA contained within model lenses and the concentration
   of drug loading solution used to facilitate uptake. Timolol release was
   sustained for a duration of approximately 2 days, and the dose of drug
   was shown to be controlled by both HA-drug interactions and molecular
   imprinting within the silicone hydrogels.
   Conclusions: Hyaluronic acid, although different than typical functional
   monomers used in molecular imprinting, can be a useful additive to
   modify the mass of drug release from model silicone hydrogel lenses.}},

Abstract = {{We present a breast tissue stabilization device that can be used in
   magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy. The device employs adjustable
   support plates with an optimized geometry to minimize the biopsy target
   displacement using smaller compression than the conventional parallel
   plates approach. It is expected that the reduced compression will cause
   less patient discomfort and improve image quality by enhancing the
   contrast intake. Precomputed optimal positions of the stabilization
   plates for a given biopsy target location are provided in a look-up
   table. The results of several experiments with a prototype of the device
   carried out on chicken breast tissue demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the new design when compared with conventional stabilization methods.
   The proposed stabilization mechanism provides excellent flexibility in
   selecting the needle insertion point and can be used in manual as well
   as robot-assisted biopsy procedures. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by

Abstract = {{Purpose: To remove the geometry dependence of phase-based susceptibility
   weighting masks in susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and to improve
   the visualization of the veins and microbleeds.
   Materials and Methods: True SWI (tSWI) was generated using
   susceptibility-based masks. Simulations were used to evaluate the
   influence of the characteristic parameters defining the mask. In vivo
   data from three healthy adult human volunteers were used to compare the
   contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNRs) of the right septal vein and the left
   internal cerebral vein as measured from both tSWI and SWI data. A
   traumatic brain injury (TBI) patient dataset was used to illustrate
   qualitatively the proper visualization of microbleeds using tSWI.
   Results: Compared with conventional SWI, tSWI improved the CNR of the
   two selected veins by a factor of greater than three for datasets with
   isotropic resolution and greater than 30\% for datasets with anisotropic
   resolution. Veins with different orientations can be properly enhanced
   in tSWI. Furthermore, the blooming artifact due to the strong dipolar
   phase of microbleeds in conventional SWI was reduced in tSWI for the TBI
   case.
   Conclusion: The use of tSWI overcomes the geometric limitations of using
   phase and provides better visualization of the venous system, especially
   for data collected with isotropic resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer in back-to-back elbows arranged in an out of plane

   technique with the elbow sections cast from gypsum. Experiments were
   performed to study the effect of increasing the water and air
   superficial velocities, and the effect of separation distance between
   the elbows. The highest mass transfer for all cases occurs on the outer
   wall of the first elbow, and the magnitude was not affected by the
   separation distance between the elbows. The maximum mass transfer in the
   second elbow was approximately 60 percent of the maximum value in the
   first elbow. The mass transfer increased with an increase in either the
   water or air superficial velocity, with the air velocity having a
   greater effect. The roughness development in the upstream pipe was
   modest, but was significant in the regions of high mass transfer on the
   first and second elbow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for optimizing dynamic systems under uncertainty using a

   potential computational performance improvement when the embedded

   parallel. We assess our parallel multiperiod and multiple-shooting-based
   dynamic optimization algorithm on two case studies involving integrated
   plant and control system design, where the objective is to
   simultaneously determine the size of the process equipment and the
   control system tuning parameters that minimize cost, subject to

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{52-64}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the compressive behavior of Modified Rectangular
   Fiber-Reinforced Elastomeric Isolators (MR-FREIs). The geometric
   modifications are introduced to reduce the horizontal stiffness and
   increase the energy dissipation of the isolation system, allowing long
   rectangular isolators that provide uniform support along walls to be
   utilized. It is of critical importance that MR-FREIs maintain adequate
   vertical stiffness to satisfy the requirements for an isolation system.
   Experimental data from vertical tests of four rectangular FREIs with and
   without geometric modifications is used to evaluate a three-dimensional
   (3D) finite element (FE) model. The 3D FE model is then used to conduct
   a parametric study on two MR-FREI configurations with varying geometry.
   The parametric study investigates the effect of the geometric
   modifications on the vertical stiffness and compression modulus in
   addition to stress and strain distributions in the elastomer and fiber
   reinforcement. The study identifies that, similar to annular isolators,
   introducing a minor geometric modification to the interior of the
   isolator results in a significant decrease in vertical stiffness and
   compression modulus. This influence is considerably less for geometric
   modifications positioned on the exterior of the isolator. (C) 2014

   human visual system, images are formed via continuous integration of the
   light field, whereas digital video acquisition is based on discrete
   sampling of light sensors. A movie frame is decomposed into multiple
   so-called shale frames such that, when these shale frames are displayed
   at a frame rate higher than 60 Hz, the human viewers will experience
   normal movie presentation without any noticeable artifacts, but the
   video frames captured by camcorders will contain severe, highly
   objectionable artifacts, depriving the pirated video contents of any

Abstract = {{The in-cylinder temperature information is critical for auto-ignition
   combustion control in diesel engines, but difficult to be directly
   accessed at low cost in production engines. Through investigating the
   thermodynamics of Tivc, cycle-by-cycle models are proposed in this paper
   for the estimation of in-cylinder temperature at the crank angle of
   intake valve closing (IVC), referred to as Tivc. An extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) based method was devised by utilizing the measurable
   temperature information from the intake and exhaust manifolds. Due to
   the fact that measured temperature signals by typical thermocouples have
   slow responses which can be modeled as first-order lags with varying
   timeconstants, temperature signals need to be reconstructed in transient
   conditions. In the proposed EKF estimation method, this issue can be
   effectively addressed by analyzing the measurement errors and properly
   selecting the noises covariance matrices. The proposed estimation method
   was validated through a high-fidelity GT-power engine model.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to study the heat transfer from a 35 mm wide
   heated foil into a confined gap over a saturated porous plate, with a
   nominal pore size of 50 mu m, using distilled water as the working
   fluid. The surface temperature distribution on the central portion of
   the heated foil was measured using a high speed thermal imaging camera.
   Experiments were performed for gap sizes of 0-1000 mu m and heat fluxes
   of 11.7-58.3 kW/m(2). The gap size was found to have a significant
   effect on the boiling dynamics beneath the heated surface, with the
   highest heat flux achieved for a gap size of 600 mu m, similar to
   previous results for a heated surface with a width of 10 mm. The results
   here indicate that the boiling dynamics within the confined gap were
   independent of the heater width. The heat transfer performance, however,
   was not with earlier dry-out for the wider heated surface considered

Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{451-461}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce G4-STORK (Geant4 STOchastic Reactor
   Kinetics), a new, time-dependent, Monte Carlo particle tracking code for
   reactor physics applications. G4-STORK was built by adapting and
   expanding on the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit. The toolkit provides the
   fundamental physics models and particle tracking algorithms that track
   each particle in space and time. It is a framework for further
   development (e.g. for projects such as G4-STORK).
   G4-STORK derives reactor physics parameters (e.g. k(eff)) from the
   continuous evolution of a population of neutrons in space and time in
   the given simulation geometry. In this paper we detail the major
   additions to the Geant4 toolkit that were necessary to create G4-STORK.
   These include a renormalization process that maintains a manageable
   number of neutrons in the simulation even in very sub- or supercritical
   systems, scoring processes (e.g. recording fission locations, total
   neutrons produced and lost, etc.) that allow G4-STORK to calculate the
   reactor physics parameters, and dynamic simulation geometries that can
   change over the course of simulation to illicit reactor kinetics
   responses (e.g. fuel temperature reactivity feedback).
   The additions are verified through simple simulations and code-to-code
   comparisons with established reactor physics codes such as DRAGON and
   MCNP. Additionally, G4-STORK was developed to run a single simulation in
   parallel over many processors using MPI (Message Passing Interface)
   pipes. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A spline filter for multidimensional nonlinear state estimation}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{282-295}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The problem of nonlinear/non-Gaussian filtering has generated
   significant interest in the literature. The effectiveness of a
   nonlinear/non-Gaussian filtering algorithm depends on the accurate
   representation of the probability density function of the system state.
   The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the Approximate Grid Based methods
   (AGBM), and particle based filters have been developed to solve
   nonlinear/non-Gaussian problems. However, the EKF may not perform well
   with high nonlinearity due to its linear approximation; the AGBM often
   incurs extremely high storage/computational cost; particle filters
   provide weighted samples at discrete points in the state space instead
   of a continuous estimate of the probability density function of the
   system state, but most of them may suffer from the well-known degeneracy
   problem. In this paper, a comprehensive solution for
   nonlinear/non-Gaussian state estimation that can provide a continuous
   estimate of the probability density function of the system state is
   developed based on B-splines. The proposed spline filter is capable of
   modeling any arbitrary probability density function of the system state,
   and it is able to provide statistically the same estimation accuracy as
   the particle filter, but with only a few knots. It is also important to
   emphasize that, unlike most of the particle based algorithms (e.g.,
   Sequential Important Sampling (SIS), Generic Particle Filter (GPF), and
   Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filter), the spline filter is free from
   degeneracy-like problems due to its continuous nature. In addition, by
   moving the knots dynamically, it ensures that the splines cover, and
   only cover, the regions where the probability of system state is
   significant so that the high efficiency of the spline filter is
   maintained. To make it applicable in common tracking applications, the
   spline filter is further extended to a multiple model one with the
   capability to handle systems with multiple maneuvering models. Besides
   theoretical derivations, simulation results are provided to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed spline filter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   nanotube}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{34}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Thermal rectification occurs when heat current through a material is
   favored in one direction but not in the opposite direction. These
   materials, often called thermal diodes, have the potential to perform
   logic calculations with phonons. Rectification obtained with existing
   material systems is either too minor or too difficult to implement
   practically. Hence, we present a scheme to enable higher rectification
   using a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) that is covalently
   functionalized near one end with polyacetylene (PA) chains. This
   composite structure allows rectification R up to 204\%, which is higher
   than the values reported for SWCNTs. Here, R=((J(+)-J(-))/J(-)) 100\%,
   where J(+) and J(-) are the heat currents for forward and reverse bias,
   respectively. The interatomic interactions in the SWCNT-PA nanocomposite
   are nonlinear, i.e., they are anharmonic, which is a requirement for
   thermal rectification. Through atomistic simulations, we identify two
   additional conditions to accomplish thermal rectification at the
   nanoscale, namely, (1) structural asymmetry, and (2) that the influence
   of this asymmetry on thermal transport is temperature dependent. The
   optimum temperature difference to achieve the highest thermal
   rectification with the structure is 40-80 K.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable, degradable hydrogels based on cross-linking between
   aldehyde-functionalized dextran, hydrazide-functionalized dextran, and
   hydrazide-functionalized beta-cyctodextrin (beta CD) were developed for
   hydrophobic drug delivery. beta CD functions as both the in situ-gelling
   agent driving hydrogel formation as well as the binding site for the
   hydrophobic model drug, dexamethasone. In hydrogel systems where beta CD
   is primarily covalently attached to the polymer network through
   cross-linking, the amount of drug release per sampling point is
   independent of the time between samples, the solubility of drug in the
   release medium, and the cross-link density of the hydrogel; instead,
   drug release is controlled primarily by partitioning of free
   (water-solubilized) drug between the hydrogel and the release medium.
   When the concentration of the hydrazide-functionalized dextran polymer
   was increased and more hydrazide groups were available to compete with
   beta CD reactive sites for cross-linking the polymers, greater than
   ten-fold more drug was released from the hydrogel during the 20 day
   sampling period. Mobile, non-cross-linked beta CD increases the
   solubility of the drug and facilitates rapid drug release by diffusion,
   as confirmed by quenching beta CD-bound hydrazide groups. In this way,
   via a very subtle change in the composition of the injectable hydrogel,
   both the kinetics of drug release as well as the mechanism of drug
   release can be tuned over a wide range. Together with the low
   cytotoxicity of the materials, these results suggest that injectable
   beta CD-based hydrogels have potential for facilitating controlled
   release of hydrophobic drugs over multiple time scales by controlling
   the Mobility of beta CD within the hydrogel network.}},

Abstract = {{A digital compensation scheme based on a perturbation theory for
   mitigation of cross-phase modulation (XPM) distortions is developed for
   dispersion-managed fiber-optic communication systems. It is a
   receiver-side scheme that uses a hard-decision unit to estimate data for
   the calculation of XPM fields using the perturbation technique. The
   intra-channel nonlinear distortions are removed by intra-channel digital
   backward propagation (DBP) based on split-step Fourier scheme before the
   hard-decision unit. The perturbation technique is shown to be effective
   in mitigating XPM distortions. However, wrong estimations in the
   hard-decision unit result in performance degradation. A hard-decision
   correction method is proposed to correct the wrong estimations.
   Numerical simulations show that the hybrid compensation scheme with DBP
   for dispersion and intra-channel nonlinear impairments compensation and
   the perturbation technique for XPM compensation brings up to 3.7 dBQ and
   1.7 dBQ improvements as compared with the schemes of linear compensation
   only and intra-channel DBP, respectively. The perturbation technique for

Abstract = {{Micro-electromagnets hold great promise for integration into portable
   and handheld lab-on-a-chip systems applicable to point-of-care disease
   management. Two major requirements must be satisfied in order for such
   devices to be applicable into practical, miniaturized, and portable
   biomedical instrumentation: low power operation and low-cost
   fabrication. In this paper, we use numerical modeling combined with a
   lithography-free fabrication process to create micro-electromagnets on a
   polymer substrate. Numerical modeling reveals that active-passive
   devices-ferromagnetic layers coupled with current-controlled planar
   coils-are essential for generating a sufficient magnetic force for
   magnetic particle manipulation at low currents (<50 mA). In addition, it
   is shown that current carrying conductors created from
   micro/nanotextured materials further enhance the generated magnetic
   force at a given current. To combine low-cost fabrication with
   low-current operation, we developed a benchtop fabrication method based
   on craft cutting, polymer induced thin film wrinkling, and
   electrodeposition to create a multilevel arrangement of multi-scale
   materials essential for low-current operation. We demonstrate that the

Abstract = {{Fabrication of polymeric micro/nanofibers with controllable size,
   density, orientation, and composition is required for their translation
   into functional devices and materials. Electrospinning (ES) is a
   frequently used fiber fabrication technique, where ES parameters such as
   the applied electric field strength, architecture of the setup, and
   solution composition are manipulated to control the fiber properties.
   Here, we present a bench-top method for fabricating miniaturized,
   integrated, and highly tunable ES setups based on shrinkable polymer
   substrates. We show that using a combination of numerical modeling and
   controlling different parameters in the ES setup, including the
   spinneret to collector distance, and spinneret and collector designs, it
   is possible to tune the density, alignment, and orientation of
   electrospun fibers. In this way, we have produced 300-600 nm wide
   poly(ethylene oxide) fibers arranged as nonwoven mats on planar
   electrodes, aligned fibers on electrode edges, and individual suspended
   fibers spanning gaps between collector electrodes. The ability to
   rapidly prototype ES setups should enable us to study the effects of
   spinneret-collector configurations on fiber morphology, distribution,
   and conformation and to aid in the development of miniaturized ES setups
   designed to serve specific applications. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is an n-type dopant for conductive silicon nanocrystals
   (Si-nc's), the electrical activation of which may be monitored through a
   non-radiative Auger recombination process that quenches the Si-nc
   luminescence. We investigated this quenching mechanism through
   electrical measurements of Si-nc's. Infrared-excited Auger electron
   emission as the non-radiative process was directly probed and the
   dynamics of the process are determined from a frequency response
   analysis. To explain the dynamics, we propose a model in which Auger
   electrons with a low kinetic energy establish a local inter-nanocrystal
   conductance and the repetition of this local conductance results in a
   constant photocurrent ({''}linkage emission{''}). This emission becomes
   significant by electron filling in the Si-nc's owing to the electrical
   activation of P, which is consistent with observed luminescence
   quenching behavior. We found that the IR photo-excited emission is
   distinct from the thermally induced hopping conduction and show that
   confined, rather than trapped, charges are the source of the Auger
   electrons. Thus, the process consumes both confined charges and the
   recombination energy for Auger emission, which explains the luminescence
   quenching mechanism of Si-nc:P. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Under the pressure of 1-1.6 GPa, hexagonal ice at 77 K collapses to a
   high density amorphous ice (HDA). The HDA recovered from the pressure
   vessel is highly strained. It is called unrelaxed HDA, or uHDA. Here,
   first we examine the merits of the ambient pressure differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) study of uHDA by P. H. Handle, M. Seidl and
   T. Loerting, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 (2012) 225901, which was used to
   determine its alpha-relaxation time and T-g at high pressures. We find
   that their procedure does not yield the alpha-relaxation time of 10(3) s
   to 10(6) s at T < T-g, nor does it yield the activation energy and T-g
   of uHDA. uHDA does not have T-g because there is no unrelaxed water.
   Second, we discuss the nature of the transformations of uHDA to eHDA
   (the expanded or relaxed form of HDA), and of eHDA to LDA (the 20\%
   bulkier amorphous ice formed on heating HDA). By using the available
   results for the uHDA -> eHDA and eHDA -> LDA transformations, which had
   been obtained by heating at 10 K/min and 10 K/h rates, we argue that the
   strain (internal stress) brings the two transformations mutually closer,
   and loss of strain on annealing separates them. The highest enthalpy
   loss on stress-release is as much as twice the enthalpy loss on
   structure-change. The analysis confirms that on annealing or heating,
   transformation of the as-made HDA to LDA occurs through a series of
   metastable states of increasing volume. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental study that was completed to
   investigate the resilient constitutive characteristics of a granular
   limestone, as well as to assess the applicability of conventional
   modelling within the framework of elasticity theory for the material
   that was studied. Test results corresponding to various stress paths are
   reported for a well-graded, sub-angular coarse sand. Noticeable
   differences are found with regard to the measured deformation responses
   when compared with those from linear elastic model predictions. On the
   basis of studying the stress-strain responses in terms of invariants,
   the authors conclude that the difference in the resilient responses of
   the material for various stress paths is largely due to the inherent
   nonlinear anisotropic nature of the material, and that stress-induced
   fabric associated with, for example, rearrangement of particles and
   particle connectivity should be taken into account for better
   interpretation of resilient behaviour of granular soil.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Evidence suggests that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
   is associated with a dysfunction in the
   cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry. Resting state
   functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) allows
   measurements of resting state networks (RSNs), brain networks that are
   present at `rest'. However, although OCD has a typical onset during
   childhood or adolescence, only two other studies have performed rs-fcMRI
   comparisons of RSNs in children and adolescents with OCD against healthy
   controls.
   Methods: In the present study, we performed resting state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging using a 3 Tesla MRI, in 11 medication-naive
   children and adolescents with OCD and 9 healthy controls. In contrast to
   previous studies that relied on a priori determination of RSNs, we
   determined resting state functional connectivity with a data-driven
   independent component analysis (ICA).
   Results: Consistent with previous reports in healthy adults, we
   identified 13 RSNs. Case-control un-adjusted statistical significance (p
   < 0.05) was found for two networks. Firstly, increased connectivity (OCD
   > control) in the right section of Brodmann area 43 of the auditory
   network; Secondly, decreased connectivity in the right section of
   Brodmann area 8 and Brodmann area 40 in the cingulate network.
   Conclusions: Our preliminary findings of case-control differences in
   RSNs lend further support to the CSTC hypothesis of OCD, as well as
   implicating other regions of the brain outside of the CSTC. (C) 2014

   Communication Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper mainly focuses on efficient schemes for simulating
   propagation in optical fibers. Various schemes based on split-step
   Fourier techniques to solve the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE),
   which describes the propagation in optical fibers, are compared. In
   general, the schemes in which the loss operator is combined with
   nonlinearity operator are found to be more computationally efficient
   than the schemes in which the loss is combined with dispersion. When the
   global error is large, the schemes with variable step size outperform
   the ones with uniform step size. The schemes based on local error and/or
   minimum area mismatch (MAM) further improve the computational
   efficiency. In this scheme, by minimizing the area mismatch between the
   exponential profile and its stepwise approximation, an optimal step size
   distribution is found. The optimization problem is solved by the
   steepest descent algorithm. The number of steps to get the desired
   accuracy is determined by the local error method. The proposed scheme is
   found to have higher computational efficiency than the other schemes
   studied in this paper. For QPSK systems, when the global error is 10(8,)
   the number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) needed for the conventional
   scheme (loss combined with dispersion and uniform step size) is 5.8
   times that of the proposed scheme. When the global error is 10(-6), the
   number of FFTs needed for the conventional scheme is 3.7 times that of
   the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorescence of Intralipid and polystyrene microspheres with sphere
   diameter of 1 mu m at a representative lipid and microsphere
   concentration for simulation of mucosal tissue scattering has not been a
   subject of extensive experimental study. In order to elucidate the
   quantitative relationship between lipid and microsphere concentration
   and the respective fluorescent intensity, the extrinsic fluorescence
   spectra between 360 nm and 650 nm (step size of 5 nm) were measured at
   different lipid concentrations (from 0.25\% to 5\%) and different
   microsphere concentrations (0.00364, 0.0073, 0.0131 spheres per cubic
   micrometer) using laser excitation at 355 nm with pulse energy of 2.8 mu
   J. Current findings indicated that Intralipid has a broadband emission
   between 360 and 650 nm with a primary peak at 500 nm and a secondary
   peak at 450 nm while polystyrene microspheres have a single peak at 500
   nm. In addition, for similar scattering properties the fluorescence of
   Intralipid solutions is approximately three-fold stronger than that of
   the microsphere solutions. Furthermore, Intralipid phantoms with lipid
   concentrations similar to 2\% (simulating the bottom layer of mucosa)
   produce up to seven times stronger fluorescent emission than phantoms
   with lipid concentration similar to 0.25\% (simulating the top layer of
   mucosa). The fluoresence decays of Intralipid and microsphere solutions
   were also recorded for estimation of fluorescence lifetime. (C)2014

Abstract = {{This work explores the influence of rheological properties on polymer
   foam development in nonpressurized systems. To understand the complex
   contributions of rheology on the mechanism of bubble growth during
   different stages of foam processing, visualization studies were
   conducted by using a polymer-foaming microscopy setup. The evolving
   cellular structure during foaming was analyzed for its bubble surface
   density, bubble size, total bubble projected area, and bubble size
   distribution. Morphological analysis was used to determine the
   rheological processing window in terms of shear viscosity, elastic
   modulus, melt strength and strain-hardening, intended for the production
   of foams with greater foam expansion, increased bubble density and
   reduced bubble size. A bubble growth model and simulation scheme was
   also developed to describe the bubble growth phenomena that occurred in
   nonpressurized foaming systems. Using thermophysical and rheological
   properties of polymer/gas mixtures, the growth profiles for bubbles were
   predicted and compared to experimentally observed data. It was verified
   that the viscous bubble growth model was capable of depicting the growth
   behaviors of bubbles under various processing conditions. Furthermore,
   the effects of thermophysical and rheological parameters on the bubble
   growth dynamics were demonstrated by a series of sensitivity studies.

Journal = {{IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{An implementation of the compressive sensing (CS) method with a CMOS
   image sensor is presented. The conventional three-transistor active
   pixel sensor (APS) structure and switched capacitor circuits are
   exploited to develop an analog implementation of the CS encoding in a
   CMOS sensor. With the analog implementation, the sensing and encoding
   are performed in the same time interval and making a real-time encoding
   process to optimize the frame rate of the imager. A block readout
   strategy is proposed to capture the required CS measurements for
   different blocks of the image, rather than the common column-row readout
   method. All measurement circuits are placed outside the array by this
   readout strategy, and the imager becomes scalable for larger array
   sizes. Because there is no extra in-pixel element for the CS measurement
   process, the fill factor of the imager is the same as its corresponding
   APS imager without CS. The proposed structure is designed and fabricated
   in 0.13-m CMOS technology for a 2 x 2 array. The experimental results
   confirm the validity of the design in making monotonic and appropriate
   CS measurements. The functionality of the block readout method and the
   scalability of the imager are confirmed by fabrication of a 4x4 block
   and a 16x16 array.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the delivery of dexamethasone and the

   to synthesize silicone hydrogels of variable composition. The materials
   properties, such as surface wettability and equilibrium water content,
   were highly dependent on polymer composition. All dexamethasone-loaded
   hydrogels showed uptake that was driven primarily by sorption to the
   polymer phase. Furthermore, a positive correlation between loading mass
   and equilibrium water content was established. The duration of drug
   release from the hydrogels ranged from one to greater than two weeks
   depending on the monomer composition and relative contribution of
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers. Higuchi model rate constants for
   the release showed strong correlation with the equilibrium water

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic extremes such as severe storms, floods, and droughts are
   inherently seasonal in nature and remain the main concern in designing
   hydrometric networks. In general, hydrometric networks have been
   designed without paying particular attention to the effect of seasonal
   streamflow information (SSI) at gauging stations on the efficiency of
   the hydrometric networks. This paper evaluates the effect of SSI on
   streamflow networks based on nonparametric implementation of entropy
   theory using the kernel density approach for estimating the mutual
   information between gauging stations on a seasonal basis. Overall, it is
   shown that the SSI of individual stations is season dependent and the
   efficiency of the streamflow network is also season dependent, therefore
   the effect of seasonality should be incorporated in future hydrometric
   network design. This methodology was applied at five river basins in
   Canada and its role for network design is discussed. (C) 2014 American

Title = {{Sympathetic Detonation Wave Attenuation Using Polyurethane Foam}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The unintentional initiation of munitions during production, storage,
   transportation, and handling is among the main sources of explosive
   hazard. Such unintentional initiation of explosives is termed
   sympathetic detonation, in which the detonation of a single explosive
   unit (or warhead) triggers the detonation of another, and subsequently
   starts a chain reaction. Because of this, the demand for resilient
   lightweight ammunition-separation systems within shipping or storage
   containers is increasing. This paper presents the development and
   testing of a cost-effective lightweight rigid polyurethane foam (RPF)
   separation system. The scaled gap test approach discussed is used as a
   practical tool to investigate the initiability of acceptor explosive
   charges by a blast wave generated from donor charges through the RPF as
   a blast wave attenuation medium. Different RPF specimens were prepared
   with different densities and silt particle mix ratios ranging from 0\%
   (no silt) to 30\%. The study results demonstrate the capability of the
   RPF as a lightweight cost-effective technique to attenuate the blast
   wave effects on acceptor explosives to safe levels. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the coupled effects of capillary suction and fabric
   on the behavior of partially saturated granular materials at pendular

   Experimental results show that the soil-water characteristic curves of
   granular materials are affected by the internal structure formed during
   reconstitution of the specimen. The effect of capillary suction on the
   shear strength of moist sand varies with the direction of shearing
   relative to the bedding plane which is generally perpendicular to the
   major principal direction of the fabric tensor. When treating capillary
   attraction as interparticle forces at particle contacts, a
   micromechanics analysis shows that the coupling between
   capillary-attracting forces and fabric results in an additional stress
   tensor, which describes the anisotropic effect of capillary suction on
   the behavior of moist sand.}},

Abstract = {{To study the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on the functional
   connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and temporal fractal
   properties of the healthy adult brain.
   Eleven healthy male volunteers were asked to drink 0.59 g/kg of ethanol.
   Resting state blood oxygen level dependent (rsBOLD) MRI scans were
   obtained before consumption, 60 min post-consumption and 90 min
   post-consumption. Before each rsBOLD scan, pointed-resolved spectroscopy
   (PRESS) H-1-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) scans were acquired to
   measure ethanol levels in the right basal ganglia.
   Significant changes in DMN connectivity were found following alcohol
   consumption (p < 0.01). Both increased and decreased regional
   connectivity were found after 60 min, whereas mostly decreased
   connectivity was found after 90 min. The fractal behaviour of the rsBOLD
   signal, which is believed to help reveal complexity of small-scale
   neuronal circuitry, became more ordered after both 60 and 90 min of
   alcohol consumption (p < 0.01).
   The DMN has been linked to personal identity and social behavior. As
   such, our preliminary findings may provide insight into the
   neuro-functional underpinnings of the cognitive and behavioral changes
   observed during acute alcohol intoxication. The reduced fractal
   dimension implies a change in function of small-scale neural networks
   towards less complex signaling.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the chemical structures of the surfactants
   associated with organically modified montmorillonites in order to
   understand how differences in the structure may influence the final
   properties of the nano-composite materials. Five organically modified
   montmorillonites with different surfactants were examined in materials
   prepared using a novel technique for thermoplastic polyolefin
   nanocomposites, using supercritical CO2 as a processing aid. The chain
   length and the number of alkyl chains attached to the quaternary
   ammonium surfactant were the main variables of study aimed at changing
   the interactions of an organoclay with compatibilizer and/or polymer
   matrix due to the CO2 treatment. The goal of this work was to improve
   the exfoliation of the dispersed organoclay. The intermediate
   masterbatch containing organoclay and compatibilizer as well as the
   final TPO nanocomposites were characterized using Xray diffraction
   (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and rheological analysis.
   The results showed that of the systems tested, significant changes in
   the state of exfoliation after processing with the supercritical fluid
   occurred only for surfactants possessing dialkyl tails and exhibiting a
   paraffin type arrangement within the montmorillonite. (C) 2013 Society

Abstract = {{We report fabrication methods, including metal masks and dry etching,

   nanowires with insignificant undercutting from the mask, allowing us to
   vary the diameter from 30 nm to 400 nm with a pitch from 250 nm to 1100
   nm and length up to 2.2 mu m. A diameter to pitch ratio of similar to
   68\% was achieved. We also measured the reflectance from the nanowire
   arrays and show experimentally diameter-dependent strong absorption
   peaks resulting from resonant optical mode excitations within these
   nanowires. The reflectance curves match very well with simulations. The
   work done here paves the way towards achieving high efficiency solar

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been utilized to determine the
   low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) mobility of {[}1 1 2] tilt boundaries in
   pure aluminum. The mobility data were extracted from two different MD
   techniques as a function of temperature and misorientation. The
   artificial driving force method (ADF) and the random walk method were
   analyzed critically and a detailed comparison of the two techniques was
   conducted. Within numerical uncertainties, both techniques provide the
   same magnitude of mobility at 300 K for a grain boundary with low
   misorientation in Al and the two techniques also agree at 700 K for the
   highest misorientation studied. For other misorientations, however,
   there are considerable discrepancies between the two techniques and
   reasons for the differing results are presented. The results indicate
   that considerable care must be taken in applying the ADF method to the
   case of low-angle boundaries. The temperature dependence of LAGB
   mobility is studied and, consistent with previous MD studies, the
   activation energy is found to be approximately 10 times lower than the
   experimental observations. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{161-175}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the flexural behavior of connections associated
   with the cold-formed steel storage pallet racks. This experimental study
   considered seventeen groups of beam-to-upright connections with
   different constructional details. Various influencing parameters, such
   as upright profile and thickness, pallet beam profile and the number of
   tabs in the beam-end-connector were investigated. Each group considered
   three identical specimens subjected to monotonic, static, hogging
   loading in a single cantilever test setup. The displacements and
   strains, including rosette stains, were measured at strategic locations.
   The results show that the deformation modes of the connections were
   similar prior to failure, while the failure modes depend on the relative
   thickness between upright and the beam-end-connector. Based on
   moment-rotation curves, the initial stiffness, the moment capacity, and
   the associated connection rotations were established. These values have
   been compared with corresponding international design specifications.
   Ensuing discussions shed light on the impact of parameters, such as
   thickness of upright profile, depth of pallet beam profile, construction
   details of beam-end-connector on the stiffness and moment capacity of
   such connections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of particle shape and orientation on the thermal
   conductivity of low volume, particulate composites was examined through
   two-dimensional numerical simulations using the finite element method,
   FEM. The simulations demonstrate that the conductivity of such
   composites is influenced by not only the relative volume and
   conductivity of the embedded particles, but also their general shape,
   elongation, and orientation relative to the direction of global heat
   flow. The functional form of the Halpin-Tsai equation was utilized to
   characterize the composite thermal conductivity through a derived
   expression of the geometric distribution factor, zeta. The proposed
   expression of zeta differs from commonly assumed values and is shown to
   be highly dependent on the shape of the embedded particles. This
   approach was further extended to examine and explicitly characterize the
   anisotropic behavior of composites containing multiple, randomly
   distributed particles of a uniform size and shape based on their
   relative orientation. This work demonstrates the viability of using
   numerical tools to examine composites with complex geometries.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model incorporating the material texture has been
   developed to simulate the magnetic properties of nanocrystalline
   materials at low temperatures where the effect of thermal energy on
   magnetization is neglected. The method is based on
   Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) theory and it describes the magnetization
   dynamics of individual grains in the effective field. The modified LLG
   equation incorporates the intrinsic fields from the intragrain
   magnetocrystalline and grain boundary anisotropies and the interacting
   fields from intergrain dipolar and exchange couplings between the
   neighbouring grains. The model is applied to study magnetic properties
   of textured nanocrystalline Ni samples at 2K and is capable to reproduce
   closely the hysteresis loop behaviour at different orientations of
   applied magnetic field. Nanocrystalline Ni shows the grain boundary
   anisotropy constant K-1(s) = -6.0 x 10(4) J/m(3) and the intergrain
   exchange coupling denoted by the effective exchange constant A(p) = 2.16

Abstract = {{A new development of the shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP)
   technique for microwave design optimisation is presented here. The
   original SPRP method is enhanced by employing low-cost derivative
   information obtained through adjoint sensitivities. The authors propose
   using operator notation to simplify the SPRP surrogate description. The
   enhancement through sensitivity data is twofold: to ensure first-order
   consistency between the SPRP surrogate and the high-fidelity
   electromagnetic (EM) model under optimisation and to speed up the
   surrogate optimisation process. Fast surrogate optimisation allows us to
   use coarse-discretisation EM simulations as an underlying low-fidelity
   model and, therefore, efficiently apply SPRP to cases where reliable
   circuit models are not available (e. g. design of antenna structures).
   The proposed approach is demonstrated using a dielectric resonator
   filter and an ultra-wideband monopole antenna. Comparison with three
   benchmark techniques, including the original SPRP methods, space mapping
   with sensitivity and direct optimisation of the high-fidelity model, is
   also provided.}},

Abstract = {{The auditory environment typically contains several sound sources that
   overlap in time, and the auditory system parses the complex sound wave
   into streams or voices that represent the various sound sources. Music
   is also often polyphonic. Interestingly, the main melody (spectral/pitch
   information) is most often carried by the highest-pitched voice, and the
   rhythm (temporal foundation) is most often laid down by the
   lowest-pitched voice. Previous work using electroencephalography (EEG)
   demonstrated that the auditory cortex encodes pitch more robustly in the
   higher of two simultaneous tones or melodies, and modeling work
   indicated that this high-voice superiority for pitch originates in the
   sensory periphery. Here, we investigated the neural basis of carrying
   rhythmic timing information in lower-pitched voices. We presented
   simultaneous high-pitched and low-pitched tones in an isochronous stream
   and occasionally presented either the higher or the lower tone 50 ms
   earlier than expected, while leaving the other tone at the expected
   time. EEG recordings revealed that mismatch negativity responses were
   larger for timing deviants of the lower tones, indicating better timing
   encoding for lower-pitched compared with higher-pitch tones at the level
   of auditory cortex. A behavioral motor task revealed that tapping
   synchronization was more influenced by the lower-pitched stream. Results
   from a biologically plausible model of the auditory periphery suggest
   that nonlinear cochlear dynamics contribute to the observed effect. The
   low-voice superiority effect for encoding timing explains the widespread
   musical practice of carrying rhythm in bass-ranged instruments and
   complements previously established high-voice superiority effects for
   pitch and melody.}},

Title = {{Investigation of biofilm formation on polyethylene in a diesel/biodiesel
   fuel storage environment}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{240-247}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Biodiesel usage as in the environment as an alternative to fossil fuels
   or in biodiesel/diesel blends requires an understanding of the potential
   effects of its addition on the integrity of the infrastructure used for
   fuel storage. Polyethylene is one of the most common materials for the
   manufacturing of fuel storage tanks. Due to the insoluble nature of
   polyethylene, biofilm formation on its surface boosted by the presence
   of biodiesel could potentially contribute to its degradation. In this
   study, the effect of biodiesel concentration on biofilm development on
   linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), cross-linked polyethylene
   (XLPE) and a bilayer construction of linear-low density polyethylene and
   polyamide-11 (LLDPE/PA) was studied. Polymers were exposed to
   biodeterioration conditions during a 200 days in a simulated fuel
   storage tank. Excess of water and blends of diesel/biodiesel (0\%, 25\%,
   50\%, 75\% and 100\%) as a carbon source were employed to simulate the
   conditions found in the bottom of fuel storage tanks, where the presence
   of water is common as result of condensation. Microorganisms obtained
   from a diesel storage facility were used as inoculum. Biofilm growth and
   viability were quantified by a crystal violet assay and hydrolysis of
   fluorescein diacetate, respectively. Results show that although there is
   greater accumulation of biofilm material in pure biodiesel samples
   metabolic activity is higher in pure diesel ones. Microbial community
   structure and composition were studied by community level physiological
   profiling (CLPP) and 16s rDNA sequencing. Principal component analysis
   of CLPP revealed that both biodiesel concentration and polymer type
   affect the structure and metabolic capabilities of biofilm communities.
   These results were confirmed by comparison of libraries of 16s rDNA for
   different polymers growing at different biodiesel concentrations. Genera
   isolated in the biofilm were characterized either by their ability to
   degrade hydrocarbons, produce surfactants or degrade polyethylene or
   polyamide-11. The results of this study may lead to a better
   understanding of microbial effects on storage materials for
   diesel/biodiesel blends. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Understanding wet granulation in the kneading block of twin screw
   extruders}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{The adoption of twin screw granulation to pharmaceutical manufacturing
   requires detailed understanding of the process, with one notable area of
   influence being screw design. A kneading block is a common screw element
   that is used to compress the wet granular mass, seemingly controlling
   the particle size and fracture strength of an end product. The present
   study provides a detailed examination of how this screw element
   functions for the wet granulation process, looking at the influences of
   feed rate (10-30 kg/h) and formulation on its operation. Trials were
   done in a 27 mm twin screw extruder with different powder formulations
   consisting of lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose which were wetted with a foamed binder.
   The process was characterized by its pressure profile and residence time
   distribution. A visualization technique known as `screw pullouts' was
   used to directly observe the state of granulation along the screw length
   and samples were collected from each screw segment for particle size and
   porosity analysis. The kneading block was found to provide a unique
   compaction-fragmentation step that increases the consistency and
   strength of a granular product. However, its effectiveness in doing so
   is strongly influenced by the granular state of powders entering this
   non-conveying element, which is formulation dependent. The compressive
   stress developed in the kneading block appeared generally low and
   allowed for deagglomeration or fragmentation of the agglomerated mass in
   downstream conveying zones depending upon the fracture strength of the
   powder. For the formulation containing microcrystalline cellulose, the
   kneading block served no function whereas for other tested powders, it
   was highly influential to granule size and porosity. The most notable
   benefit of the kneading block to all tested materials appeared to be
   distributing the interstitial binding liquid rather than to compact the
   powders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, 13 typical wide-flange steel columns, each carrying an
   axial load equal to 25\% of its axial capacity, are field tested using
   live explosives, involving charge size of 50 to 250 kg of ammonium
   nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) and ground stand-off distance of 7.0 to 10.3 m.
   The reflected pressure time histories, time-dependent displacements,
   accelerations, and strains of the columns are measured, and their
   postblast damages and failure modes are reported. Maximum deformations,
   vibration periods, strain-rate, and contributing modes in the dynamic
   response of the columns are compared to those of companion steel beams
   (without axial load) tested in the same setup. Results show that columns
   that exhibit elastic response, due to the elongation of the column
   vibration period caused by the axial load, the lateral deformation
   caused by blast load is reduced rather than magnified by the axial load.
   The axial-bending interaction, or P-delta effect, may be neglected for
   steel columns with axial load up to 25\% of their axial capacity,
   provided the column response remains within the elastic range-but if it
   crosses into the plastic range, the interaction cannot be ignored. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the operating and capital expenditure (CAPEX)
   costs of solar-powered additions to infrastructure that is operated from
   the power grid. The CAPEX costs are those associated with provisioning
   the solar power components, and are selected using an offline design
   optimization. Once the solar add-on is designed and deployed, the node
   incurs ongoing operating expenditure (OPEX) costs associated with the
   purchase of power grid energy. Lower bounds on cost are derived using a
   linear programming formulation, where the solar power components are
   sized using historical solar insolation traces and projected loading
   data. Different node add-on arrangements are considered, which result in
   various solar/battery and grid configurations. Three energy scheduling
   algorithms are then introduced to optimize online OPEX costs. A variety
   of results are presented that show the extent to which a solar-powered
   add-on can reduce the total cost. These results also show that the
   proposed algorithms give performance that is close to the lower bounds
   in many situations.}},

Abstract = {{The high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+delta consists of two main
   structural units-a bilayer of CuO2 planes that are central to
   superconductivity and a CuO2+delta chain layer. Although the functional
   role of the planes and chains has long been established, most probes
   integrate over both, which makes it difficult to distinguish the
   contribution of each. Here we use electron energy loss spectroscopy to
   directly resolve the plane and chain contributions to the electronic
   structure in YBa2Cu3O6 and YBa2Cu3O7. We directly probe the charge
   transfer of holes from the chains to the planes as a function of oxygen
   content, and show that the change in orbital occupation of Cu is large
   in the chain layer but modest in CuO2 planes, with holes in the planes
   doped primarily into the O 2p states. These results provide direct
   insight into the local electronic structure and charge transfers in this
   important high-temperature superconductor.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of chopped carbon fibers to enhance the thermal

   150 m in length were added to sodium bentonite and silica sand mixtures
   at different volumetric concentrations. The thermal conductivity of the
   resulting composite material was then measured using a non-steady-state
   needle probe technique. The conductivities of the fibrous materials were
   compared to bentonite and sand mixtures containing natural flake
   graphite and milled, compressed exfoliated graphite at corresponding
   volumetric concentrations. The resulting conductivities for all tested
   materials increased with the volumetric fraction of additive. However,
   the 3-mm carbon fibers were more effective as compared to either
   granular graphite; at a volume fraction of 0.68\% the 3-mm fibers were
   approximately twice as effective as either form of graphite. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The effects of the foreseen change in precipitation and temperature on
   dynamic grazing systems that are managed under the hypothesis of the
   maximum sustainable yield (MSY) are assessed. The standard Gordon
   Schaefer approach that relates the rate of above-ground vegetation
   production to biomass consumption by herbivores is adopted to simulate
   the grazing system. In order to account for future climate variability,
   the model is modified using principles from water balance hydrology,
   thus introducing vegetation growth limitations due to climatic aridity.
   The model is applied for an equilibrium established under the much
   criticized MSY hypothesis that assumes the optimum herbivore density for
   maximum biomass removal. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that as
   climate changes towards a warmer and drier future, the probability of a
   low ecological stability grazing system to collapse increases,
   especially in arid environments where water is a limited resource. Such
   sudden shifts that lead to undesirable stable states of arid ecosystems
   are investigated by the CASCADE EU project.}},

Journal = {{METALS AND MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{659-668}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A Gleeble simulation was performed on low carbon steels to investigate
   the effect of Ni addition on toughness and microstructure evolution in
   coarse grain heat affected zone from low heat input welding. Ni addition
   increased the impact toughness at -20 A degrees C and the prior
   austenite grain size.Microstructures of the low Ni and high Ni steel
   show noticeable differences in crystallography. Lath-structures in the
   two can be defined as crystallographic packet. In low Ni steel the
   packet consisting of acicular ferrite and lower bainite has all the
   three Bain groups uniformly distributed; in high Ni steel the packet
   consisting of only lower bainite has a dominant Bain group within it,
   making the other two groups subsidiary. The closely linked M/A particles
   were found only in low Ni steel by tracking the orientation information.
   It is able to facilitate the fracture through the link-up of the
   micro-cracks initiated by each M/A particle. In the going direction of
   the link-up there is no high angle boundary which can deflect the
   propagation of crack, thereby in this case the high angle boundary in
   low Ni steel is relatively ineffective. The mechanism of the toughness
   improvement brought by Ni addition should be ascribed to the relatively
   uniform transformation to final microstructure, which reduces the
   appearance of closely linked M/A.}},

Abstract = {{We present a scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy
   loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) investigation of gold nanosphere chains

   signals from the chains and identify energy-loss peaks arising due to l
   = 1, 2, 3, 4, and S plasmon modes through the use of EELS mapping. We
   also show the evolution of the energy of these modes as the length of a
   given chain increases, and we find that a chain containing N particles
   can accommodate at least N experimentally observable modes, in addition
   to the transverse mode. As the chain length is increased by the addition
   of one more gold particle to the chain, the new N + 1 mode becomes the
   highest energy mode, while the existing modes lower their energy and
   eventually asymptote as they delocalize along the chain. We also show
   that modes become increasingly difficult to detect with the EELS
   technique as l approaches N. The data are compared to numerical

Title = {{Singularities in the lineshape of a second-order perturbed quadrupolar
   nucleus and their use in data fitting}},
Journal = {{SOLID STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},

Abstract = {{Even for large quadrupolar interactions, the powder spectrum of the
   central transition for a half-integral spin is relatively narrow,
   because it is unperturbed to first order. However, the second-order
   perturbation is still orientation dependent, so it generates a
   characteristic lineshape. This lineshape has both finite step
   discontinuities and singularities where the spectrum is infinite, in
   theory. The relative positions of these features are well-known and they
   play an important role in fitting experimental data. However, there has
   been relatively little discussion of how high the steps are, so we
   present explicit formulae for these heights. This gives a full
   characterization of the features in this lineshape which can lead to an
   analysis of the spectrum without the usual laborious powder average.
   The transition frequency, as a function of the orientation angles, shows
   critical points: maxima, minima and saddle points. The maxima and minima
   correspond to the step discontinuities and the saddle points generate
   the singularities. Near a maximum, the contours are ellipses, whose
   dimensions are determined by the second derivatives of the frequency
   with respect to the polar and azimuthal angles. The density of points is
   smooth as the contour levels move up and down, but then drops to zero
   when a maximum is passed, giving a step. The height of the step is
   determined by the Hessian matrix the matrix of all partial second
   derivatives. The points near the poles and the saddle points require a
   more detailed analysis, but this can still be done analytically. The
   resulting formulae are then compared to numerical simulations of the
   lineshape.
   We expand this calculation to include a relatively simple case where
   there is chemical shielding anisotropy and use this to fit experimental
   La-139 spectra of La2O3. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Only high levels of dabigatran attenuate catheter thrombosis in vitro

Journal = {{THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In patients with mechanical heart valves, thromboembolic events were
   more frequent with dabigatran, an oral thrombin inhibitor, than with
   warfarin. This observation raises the possibility that dabigatran may be
   less effective than conventional anticoagulants in patients with other
   blood-contacting devices, such as catheters. To address this, we
   compared the capacity of dabigatran and/or heparin to inhibit
   catheter-induced thrombin generation in vitro and to attenuate catheter
   occlusion in rabbits. Using a catheter-induced thrombin generation
   assay, concentrations of dabigatran over 100 ng/ml prolonged the lag
   time and time to peak thrombin, and reduced the peak thrombin
   concentration and endogenous thrombin potential in a
   concentration-dependent fashion. Compared with saline in a rabbit model
   of catheter thrombosis, dabigatran prolonged the mean time to catheter
   occlusion by 2.9 and 1.9-fold when plasma levels were 173 and 140 ng/ml,
   respectively; values comparable to median peak levels in humans given
   dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. In contrast, low-dose dabigatran, which
   produced a level of 60 ng/ml; a value comparable to the trough level of
   dabigatran in humans, did not prolong the time to occlusion. Whereas a
   70 U/kg bolus of heparin prolonged the mean time to occlusion by
   3.4-fold, a 15 U/kg bolus had no effect. When low-dose dabigatran was
   given in combination with 15 U/kg heparin, the mean time to occlusion
   was prolonged by 2.7-fold. These findings suggest that only peak levels
   of dabigatran are sufficient to prevent catheter-induced clotting unless
   supplemented heparin is given.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an online optimal energy/power control method for

   Performance objectives include electricity usage cost, battery operation
   costs, and utility oriented goals related to the peak demand and load
   smoothing. A robust counterpart formulation of the optimization problem
   is also proposed to handle uncertainty in energy demand/generation
   prediction in a computationally efficient way. Further reduction in the
   computations is achieved by employing variable time steps and relaxing
   binary constraints. A series of simulations demonstrate the
   effectiveness of various features of the proposed energy/power
   management methodology in different scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In situ neutron diffraction and elastic-viscoplastic self-consistent
   (EVPSC) modeling have been employed to understand the deformation
   mechanisms of the loading-unloading process under uniaxial tension in a
   solid-solution-strengthened extruded Mg-9 wt.\% Al alloy. The initial
   texture measured by neutron diffraction shows that the \{00.2\} basal
   planes in most grains are tilted around 20-30 from the extrusion axis,
   indicating that basal slip should be easily activated in a majority of
   grains under tension. Non-linear stress strain responses are observed
   during unloading and reloading after the material is fully plastically
   deformed under tension. In situ neutron diffraction measurements have
   also demonstrated the non-linear behavior of lattice strains during
   unloading and reloading, revealing that load redistribution continuously
   occurs between soft and hard grain orientations. The predicted
   macroscopic stress-strain curve and the lattice strain evolution by the
   EVPSC model are in good agreement with the experimental data. The EVPSC
   model provides the relative activities of the available slip and
   twinning modes, as well as the elastic and plastic strains of the
   various grain families. It is suggested that the non-linear phenomena in
   the macroscopic stress-strain responses and microscopic lattice strains
   during unloading and reloading are due to plastic deformation by the
   operation of basal (a) slip in the soft grain orientations (e.g.
   \{10.1\}, \{11.2\} and \{10.2\} grain families). (C) 2014 Acta

Abstract = {{Integration of planning and scheduling optimizes simultaneous decisions

   three-level discrete-time algorithm which uses nonlinear models and
   integrates planning and detailed scheduling is introduced: first level
   optimizes nonlinear blend models via multiperiod nonlinear programming
   (NLP), where period boundaries are initially determined by the inventory
   pinch points; second level uses fixed recipes (from the first level) in
   a multiperiod mixed-integer linear program to determine first an optimal
   production plan and then to optimize an approximate schedule which
   minimizes the total number of switches in blenders and swing tanks;
   third level computes detailed schedules that adhere to inventory
   constraints computed in the approximate schedule. If inventory

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The current challenges associated with the design and operation of
   net-energy positive wastewater treatment plants demand sophisticated
   approaches for the monitoring of polymer-induced flocculation. In
   anaerobic digestion (AD) processes, the dewaterability of the sludge is
   typically assessed from off-line lab-bench tests - the capillary suction
   time (CST) test is one of the most common. Focused beam reflectance
   measurement (FBRM) is a promising technique for real-time monitoring of
   critical performance attributes in large scale processes and is ideally
   suited for dewatering applications. The flocculation performance of
   twenty-four cationic polymers, that spanned a range of polymer size and
   charge properties, was measured using both the FBRM and CST tests.
   Analysis of the data revealed a decreasing monotonic trend; the samples
   that had the highest percent removal of particles less than 50 microns
   in size as determined by FBRM had the lowest CST values. A subset of the
   best performing polymers was used to evaluate the effects of dosage
   amount and digestate sources on dewatering performance. The results from
   this work show that FBRM is a powerful tool that can be used for
   optimization and on-line monitoring of dewatering processes. (C) 2014

Title = {{Finite element analysis of unbonded square fiber-reinforced elastomeric
   isolators (FREIs) under lateral loading in different directions}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{164-173}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Compared to conventional elastomeric bearings, fiber-reinforced
   elastomeric isolators (FREIs) are expected to cost much less and be
   easier to install, particularly when unbonded isolators are utilized.
   Due to the complex lateral response of unbonded FREIs, only a limited
   number of analytical studies are available in the literature. In
   addition, most of these analytical studies are based on a number of
   simplifying assumptions, applicable only to a few basic geometries. In
   this paper, three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) is carried
   out to investigate the lateral response of square FREIs, having aspect
   ratios of 1.9, 2.6 and 2.9, when loaded in different directions. Since
   square isolators are not axisymmetric, variations in lateral response
   can be expected to occur when subjected to different loading directions.
   The finite element (FE) models are validated using experimental test
   results for bearings loaded at 0 degrees and are subsequently employed
   to analyze the lateral response characteristics of the bearings when
   loaded at 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees. The results show that
   in general, the effective lateral stiffness of the bearings increases as
   the loading direction changes from 0 degrees to 45 degrees. In addition,
   as the aspect ratio decreases, the sensitivity of the lateral response
   to the loading direction increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pneumatic muscle actuators offer a higher force-to-weight ratio compared
   to traditional cylinder actuators, and introduce stick-slip-free
   operation that offers an interesting option for positioning systems.
   Despite several advantages, pneumatic muscle actuators are commonly
   avoided in industrial applications, mainly due to rather different
   working principles. Due to the highly nonlinear characteristics of the
   muscle actuator and pneumatic system, a reliable control strategy is
   required. Although muscle actuators are widely studied, the literature
   lacks detailed studies where the performance for servo systems is
   compared with traditional pneumatic cylinders. In this paper, a
   pneumatic servo actuation system is compared with a traditional cylinder
   actuator. As the overall system dynamics are highly nonlinear and not
   well defined, a sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is chosen for the
   control action. In order to improve the tracking performance, an SMC
   strategy with an integral action (SMCI) is also implemented. The control
   algorithms are experimentally applied on the pneumatic muscle and the
   cylinder actuator, for the purposes of position tracking. The robustness
   of the systems are verified and compared by varying the applied loads.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new hierarchical approach for object detection is
   proposed. Object detection methods based on Implicit Shape Model (ISM)
   efficiently handle deformable objects, occlusions and clutters. The
   structure of each object in ISM is defined by a spring like graph. We
   introduce hierarchical ISM in which structure of each object is defined
   by a hierarchical star graph. Hierarchical ISM has two layers. In the
   first layer, a set of local ISMs are used to model object parts. In the
   second layer, structure of parts with respect to the object center is
   modeled by global ISM. In the proposed approach, the obtained parts for
   each object category have high discriminative ability. Therefore, our
   approach does not require a verification stage. We applied the proposed
   approach to some datasets and compared the performance of our algorithm
   to comparable methods. The results show that our method has a superior
   performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between microstructure and plastic flow properties of
   copper single crystals deformed at low temperatures are reviewed based
   on the analysis of experimental results of mechanical, structural and
   electrical resistivity characterisation. Electrical resistivity
   measurements suggest that the flow stress correlates with the average
   density of defects accumulated in the microstructure. The characteristic
   microstructural length scale that determines the flow stress corresponds
   closely to the size of dislocation free channels and/or cells produced
   during plastic flow. The correspondence between micro- and macroscopic
   approaches to the plastic flow has been analysed based on the behaviour
   of dislocation mean free path and mean slip distance and their
   relationship to the microstructure. Production and annihilation of
   nanoscale debris and point defects and their role in plastic flow and
   questions pertinent to the influence of microstructural instabilities on
   the flow stress, workhardening, storage and annihilation of lattice
   defects have been discussed.}},

   dynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Material properties controlled by evolving defect structures, such as
   mechanical response, often involve processes spanning many length and
   time scales which can not be modeled using a single approach. We present
   a variety of results that demonstrate the ability of phase field crystal
   (PFC) models to describe complex defect evolution phenomena on atomistic
   length scales and over long, diffusive time scales. Primary emphasis is
   given to the unification of conservative and nonconservative dislocation
   creation mechanisms in three-dimensional fcc and bcc materials. These
   include Frank-Read-type glide mechanisms involving closed dislocation
   loops or grain boundaries as well as Bardeen-Herring-type climb
   mechanisms involving precipitates, inclusions, and/or voids. Both source
   classes are naturally and simultaneously captured at the atomistic level
   by PFC descriptions, with arbitrarily complex defect configurations,
   types, and environments. An unexpected dipole-to-quadrupole source
   transformation is identified, as well as various complex geometrical
   features of loop nucleation via climb from spherical particles. Results
   for the strain required to nucleate a dislocation loop from such a
   particle are in agreement with analytic continuum theories. Other basic
   features of fcc and bcc dislocation structure and dynamics are also
   outlined, and initial results for dislocation-stacking fault tetrahedron
   interactions are presented. These findings together highlight various
   capabilities of the PFC approach as a coarse-grained atomistic tool for
   the study of three-dimensional crystal plasticity.}},

   a negligible contribution of misfit dislocations in the charge transport
   properties of the NWs. Low temperature micro-photoluminescence (mu-PL)
   measurements were also carried out for both uncapped and passivated GaAs

Abstract = {{The dielectric response of two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 stacked sheets was
   investigated by high-resolution transmission electron energy-loss
   spectroscopy and ab initio calculations in the 0.2-30-eV energy range.
   Intense surface plasmons (SPs), evidenced at the nanometer scale at
   energies as low as 0.3 eV, are shown to be the dominant screening
   process up to at least 45-nm-thick stacks. This domination results from
   a combination of efficient free-electron dynamics, begrenzungs effect,
   and reduced interband damping. It is shown that, in principle, the SPs
   energies can be tuned in the mid-infrared, from 0.2 to 0.7 eV, by
   controlling the sheets' functionalization and/or thickness. This point
   evidences a new attribute of this new class of 2D materials.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoresponsive microgels bearing primary amine groups were prepared by
   the Hofmann rearrangement of methacrylamide groups present in
   cross-linked NIPMAM (N-isopropylmethacrylamide) microgels. Most

   By substituting NIPMAM for NIPAM, and methacrylamide for acrylamide,
   side reactions and the generation of carboxyl groups were prevented
   during the Hofmann reaction. The Hofmann rearrangement is sufficiently
   slow under our conditions (1 h for a 51\% conversion) to permit fine
   control of the primary amine contents in the microgels. When starting
   with PNIPMAM microgels containing both methacrylamide and acrylic acid
   residues, we prepared a series of amphoteric microgels spanning a range
   of amine contents, all from a common parent microgel. Therefore, every
   microgel in the series had the same microstructure, cross-link density,
   and molecular weight.}},

Abstract = {{An important attribute of a supply chain in a competitive and volatile
   market environment is the ability to respond rapidly to demand
   variation. A particularly relevant application is the forest products
   industry, where a promising strategy to improve the struggling business
   model entails the shift from commodity products toward high-value
   specialty products. A key implication is that new process and supply
   chain designs have sufficient capability to respond quickly to market
   changes, such that product availability is high. In this study, we
   develop a computational framework for dynamic operability analysis of
   process supply chains. A dynamic model of a multiproduct, multiechelon
   system supply chain system is developed, and incorporated within an
   optimization framework. A two-stage stochastic programming approach is
   applied for the treatment of demand uncertainty. A bicriterion
   optimization problem is formulated for generating the Pareto frontier
   between an economic and responsiveness criterion. Two case studies are
   presented to demonstrate the applicability of this framework.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interface between dental materials and tooth is
   critical in the prevention of secondary caries. Assessing this interface
   with high-resolution clarity has traditionally been challenging. This
   work highlights electron tomography, carried out in the transmission
   electron microscope, as a novel technique to obtain both
   three-dimensional and nanometer scaled information on dental materials
   in contact with dentin. In this study, commercial calcium aluminate and
   glass ionomer based luting agents in contact with human dentin were
   prepared for electron microscopy via focused ion beam milling. Imaging
   with high-angle annular dark field provided compositional contrast, and
   combined with tilting over large angular ranges, enabled the
   reconstruction of the three-dimensional interface between tissue and
   cement. The characteristics of the interface were observed with this
   extra dimensionality and superior resolution, providing evidence for the
   viability of this technique in interfacial studies of dental materials.

Abstract = {{An experimental study investigated the California bearing ratio (CBR),
   shear strength, stiffness, and cyclic creep properties of crushed,
   reclaimed asphalt concrete pavement (RAP) natural aggregate blends for
   granular base and subbase. The CBR was found to depend on the properties
   of the constituent materials and the compactive effort used to prepare
   the specimens. It was concluded that the CBR test may not be appropriate
   for evaluating the suitability of blended material for granular base
   construction. Based on the triaxial tests, it was observed that the
   addition of RAP to natural aggregate (Ontario Granular A) reduces the
   shear strength slightly and tends to increase the accumulated strain
   (deformation) that develops due to repetitive loading. The influence of
   RAP on the mechanical properties, including `elastic' modulus, was
   sensitive to specimen preparation and preconditioning. For certain
   combinations of RAP and Granular A, the mechanical properties were
   similar to those of Granular A The key to a stable blend was found to be
   compactive effort.}},

Abstract = {{Energy resolution is one of the most important parameters in electron
   energy-loss spectroscopy. This is especially true for measurement of
   surface plasmon resonances, where high-energy resolution is crucial for
   resolving individual resonance peaks, in particular close to the
   zero-loss peak. In this work, we improve the energy resolution of
   electron energy-loss spectra of surface plasmon resonances, acquired
   with a monochromated beam in a scanning transmission electron
   microscope, by the use of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm.
   We test the performance of the algorithm in a simulated spectrum and
   then apply it to experimental energy-loss spectra of a lithographically
   patterned silver nanorod. By reduction of the point spread function of
   the spectrum, we are able to identify low-energy surface plasmon peaks
   in spectra, more localized features, and higher contrast in surface
   plasmon energy-filtered maps. Thanks to the combination of a
   monochromated beam and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, we improve the
   effective resolution down to 30 meV, and evidence of success up to 10
   meV resolution for losses below 1 eV. We also propose, implement, and
   test two methods to limit the number of iterations in the algorithm. The
   first method is based on noise measurement and analysis, while in the
   second we monitor the change of slope in the deconvolved spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency noise is a significant limitation on the performance of
   nanoscale electronic devices. This limitation is especially important
   for devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and
   transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which have atomically thin
   bodies and, hence, are severely affected by surface contaminants. Here,
   we investigate the low-frequency noise of transistors based on
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which is a typical example of TMD. The
   noise measurements performed on bilayer MoS2 channel transistors show a
   noise peak in the gate-voltage dependence data, which has also been
   reported for graphene. To understand the peak, a trap decay-time based
   model is developed by revisiting the carrier number fluctuation model.
   Our analysis reveals that the peak originates from the fact that the
   decay time of the traps for a 2D device channel is governed by the van
   der Waals bonds between the 2D material and the surroundings. Our model
   is generic to all 2D materials and can be applied to explain the V, M
   and A shaped dependence of noise on the gate voltage in graphene
   transistors, as well as the noise shape dependency on the number of
   atomic layers of other 2D materials. Since the van der Waals bonding
   between the surface traps and 2D materials is weak, in accordance with
   the developed physical model, an annealing process is shown to
   significantly reduce the trap density, thereby reducing the
   low-frequency noise.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and inexpensive method is reported for the long-term
   stabilization of enzymes and other unstable reagents in premeasured
   quantities in water-soluble tablets (cast, not compressed) made with
   pullulan, a nonionic polysaccharide that forms an oxygen impermeable

   seconds, thereby facilitating the easy execution of bioassays at remote
   sites with no need for special reagent handling and liquid pipetting.
   This approach is modular in nature, thus allowing the creation of
   individual tablets for enzymes and their substrates. Proof-of-principle
   demonstrations include a Taq polymerase tablet for DNA amplification
   through PCR and a pesticide assay kit consisting of separate tablets for
   acetylcholinesterase and its chromogenic substrate, indoxyl acetate,
   both of which are highly unstable. The encapsulated reagents remain
   stable at room temperature for months, thus enabling the

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) serves as a reservoir of
   approximately 4000 to 5500 km(3) of water and is a significant source of
   water to the Great Lakes. Indirect groundwater inflow from tributaries
   of the Great Lakes may account for 5-25\% of the total water inflow to
   the Great Lakes and in Lake Michigan it is estimated that groundwater
   directly contributes 2-2.5\% of the total water inflow. Despite these
   estimates, there is great uncertainty with respect to the impact of
   groundwater on surface water in the GLB. In terms of water quantity,
   groundwater discharge is spatially and temporally variable from the
   reach to the basin scale. Reach scale preferential flow pathways in the
   sub-surface play an important role in delivering groundwater to surface
   water bodies, however their identification is difficult a priori with
   existing data and their impact at watershed to basin scale is unknown.
   This variability also results in difficulty determining the location and
   contribution of groundwater to both point and non-point source surface
   water contamination. With increasing human population in the GLB and the
   hydrological changes brought on by continued human development and
   climate change, sound management of water resources will require a
   better understanding of groundwater surface-water interactions as
   heterogeneous phenomena both spatially and temporally. This review
   provides a summary of the scientific knowledge and gaps on
   groundwater-surface water interactions in the GLB, along with a
   discussion on future research directions. (C) 2014 International

   and cracks were found with depths in excess of 300 pm after 60 h.
   Preparation of a TEM sample containing crack tips is challenging, but
   the ability to perform high-resolution microscopy at the crack tip would
   lend insight to the mechanism of acid sulfate stress corrosion cracking
   (AcSCC). The lift-out technique combined with a focused ion beam sample
   preparation was used to extract a crack tip along the cross-section of
   an acid sulfate crack in an Alloy 800 C-ring. TEM elemental analysis was
   done using EDS and EELS which identified a duplex oxide within the
   crack; an inner oxide consisting of a thin 3-4 nm Cr-rich oxide and an
   outer oxide enriched in Fe and Cr. Preliminary conclusions and
   hypotheses resulted with respect to the mechanism of AcSCC in Alloy 800.

Abstract = {{Heavy chain monoclonal antibodies are being considered as alternative to
   whole-IgG monoclonal antibodies for certain niche applications.
   Protein-A chromatography which is widely used for purifying IgG
   monoclonal antibodies is also used for purifying heavy chain monoclonal
   antibodies as these molecules possess fully functional Fc regions.
   However, the acidic conditions used to elute bound antibody may
   sometimes also leach protein-A, which is immunotoxic. Low pH conditions
   also tend to make the mAb molecules unstable and prone to aggregation.
   Moreover, protein-A affinity chromatography does not remove aggregates
   already present in the feed. Hydrophobic interaction membrane
   chromatography (or HIMC) has already been studied as an alternative to
   protein-A chromatography for purifying whole-IgG monoclonal antibodies.
   This paper describes the use of HIMC for capturing a humanized chimeric
   heavy chain monoclonal antibody (EG2-hFC). Binding and eluting
   conditions were suitably optimized using pure EG2-hFC. Based on this, an
   HIMC method was developed for capture of EG2-hFC directly from cell
   culture supernatant. The EG2-hFc purity obtained in this single-step
   process was high. The glycan profiles of protein-A and HIMC purified
   monoclonal antibody samples were similar, clearly demonstrating that
   both techniques captured similarly glycosylated population of EG2-hFc.
   Moreover, this technique was able to resolve aggregates from monomeric
   form of the EG2-hFc. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 1139-1149. (c) 2014

Title = {{Numerical Study of Slat Screen Pattern Effect on Design Parameters of
   Tuned Liquid Dampers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) are considered economical and effective
   dynamic vibration absorbers. They are increasingly being used to
   mitigate the dynamic resonant response of tall buildings and it is often
   designed to reduce the structure's acceleration at a serviceability
   limit state. Slat screens can increase the inherent damping factor of
   TLDs. They have been used as a common flow damping device in TLDs
   because of the simplicity of using them and also the ability to control
   their effects on the performance of a TLD. Two slat screens with the
   same solidity ratio and different patterns could have different effects
   on the TLD's performance. Many former numerical researches used the
   potential and linear theory as a base to describe the fluid flow
   behavior inside the TLD. The applicability of the linearized flow models
   was for the condition of the low amplitude of excitations. Under large
   excitation events such as high return period wind storms or earthquakes,
   the assumptions of linear theory are no longer valid. Moreover, in the
   linearized model, screens were modeled as a hydraulic resistance point
   as a function of the screen solidity ratio without the ability to
   consider the effect of screen pattern. In the present study, a numerical
   algorithm has been developed which can handle both the small and large
   amplitude of excitations. In this algorithm, the fluid flow through the
   screen is fully resolved and it can take into account the effect of the
   screen pattern on the TLD's performance. The major focus of this paper
   is to use this developed algorithm and conduct a numerical investigation
   to study the effects of the slat screen pattern on the inherent damping
   and natural frequency of the TLD, as the design parameters of the TLD.
   In this numerical investigation a selected TLD outfitted by different
   slat screens and interacted with the structure is exposed by both
   harmonic and random external excitations. The numerical results have
   been validated against experimental work. The effect of slat screen
   pattern on the damping effect and natural frequency of a TLD has been
   presented. Also in this study, two new parameters termed as slat ratio
   (SR) and effective solidity ratio (Seff) are presented to imply the
   physical significance of screen pattern.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a green and efficient strategy using CO2 to trigger
   fast micellization of a liposoluble star copolymer in water. The star
   copolymers consisting of a hyperbranched polyethylene (HBPE) core and
   multiple poly(2( dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms were
   synthesized through a sequential Pd-catalyzed chain walking
   copolymerization of ethylene and 2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy) ethyl acrylate
   followed by an atom-transfer radical polymerization of DMAEMA. The star
   copolymers with large HBPE cores and low PDMAEMA arm numbers or short
   arms can be easily dissolved in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents. The
   copolymers could be quickly dispersed in water and form micelles after
   CO2 bubbling. A N-2-mediated switching process following the CO2
   treatment is shown to reverse the micelles back to their neutral state
   without causing additional micelle aggregation. The CO2 switchability of
   PDMAEMA prompted fast micellization of such liposoluble star copolymers.

Abstract = {{A two-level algorithm to compute blend plans that have much smaller
   number of different recipes, much shorter execution times, and the same
   cost as the corresponding multiperiod mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming is introduced. These plans become a starting point for
   computation of approximate schedules, which minimize total number of
   switches in blenders and swing tanks. The algorithm uses inventory pinch
   points to delineate time periods where optimal blend recipes are likely
   constant. At the first level, nonlinear blend models are optimized via
   nonlinear programming. The second level uses fixed recipes (from the
   first level) in a multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming to
   determine optimal production plan followed by an approximate schedule.
   Approximate schedules computed by the multiperiod inventory pinch
   algorithm in most of the case studies are slightly better than those
   computed by global optimizers (ANTIGONE, GloMIQO) while requiring
   significantly shorter execution times. Such schedules provide

Title = {{A new fast approach to nonparametric scene parsing}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Scene parsing is a challenging research area in computer vision. It
   provides a semantic label for each pixel in image. Most scene parsing
   approaches are parametric based which need a model that is acquired
   through a learning stage. In this paper, a new nonparametric approach to
   scene parsing is proposed which does not require a learning stage. All
   introduced nonparametric approaches are based on patch correspondence.
   Our proposed method does not require explicit patch matching which makes
   it fast and effective. The proposed approach has two parts. In the first
   part, a new generative approach to transfer semantic labels from a
   training image to an unlabelled test image is proposed. To do this, a
   graphical model is constructed over regions of both the training and
   test images. Then, based on the proposed graphical model, a quadratic
   convex function is defined on likelihood probability of each region.
   Cost function is defined such that contextual information and
   object-level information are both considered. In the second part of our
   approach, by using the proposed method of transfer knowledge, a new
   nonparametric scene parsing approach is given. To evaluate the proposed
   approach, it is applied on the MSRC-21, Stanford background, LMO, and
   SUN datasets. The obtained results show that our approach outperforms
   comparable state-of-the-art nonparametric approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the efficiency of the Fourier-Bessel transform
   (FBT) and time-frequency (TF)-based method in conjunction with the
   fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), for extracting micro-Doppler (m-D)
   radar signatures from the rotating targets. This approach comprises
   mainly of two processes, with the first being the decomposition of the
   radar return, in order to extract m-D features, and the second being the
   TF analysis to estimate motion parameters of the target. In order to
   extract m-D features from the radar signal returns, the time domain
   radar signal is decomposed into stationary and nonstationary components
   using the FBT in conjunction with the FrFT. The components are then
   reconstructed by applying the inverse Fourier-Bessel transform (IFBT).
   After the extraction of the m-D features from the target's original
   radar return, TF analysis is used to estimate the target's motion
   parameters. This proposed method is also an effective tool for detecting
   maneuvering air targets in strong sea clutter and is also applied to

Abstract = {{Solution-processed lithium fluoride (sol-LiF) nanoparticles synthesized
   in polymeric micelle nanoreactors enabled tuning of the surface work
   function of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) films. The micelle reactors
   provided the means for controlling surface coverage by progressively
   building up the interlayer through alternating deposition and plasma
   etch removal of the polymer. In order to determine the surface coverage
   and average interparticle distance, spatial point pattern analysis was
   applied to scanning electron microscope images of the nanoparticle
   dispersions. The work function of the sol-LiF modified ITO, obtained
   from photoelectron emission yield spectroscopy analysis, was shown to
   increase with surface coverage of the sol-LiF particles, suggesting a
   lateral depolarization effect. Analysis of the photoelectron emission
   energy distribution in the near threshold region revealed the
   contribution of surface states for surface coverage in excess of 14.1\%.
   Optimization of the interfacial barrier was achieved through
   contributions from both work function modification and surface states.

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{We have used molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that
   significant rectification is possible in nano-devices by manipulating
   solid-fluid interfaces between a thin solid wall and a soft material. In
   addition, the nature of the rectification is opposite to that for a
   solid wall and a simpler polar fluid (e. g., water). This thus opens the
   possibilities of reversing the direction of rectification in a
   nano-device which could lead to more precise control of heat transfer
   rates. Our simulations also show that surface modifications of the type
   introduced here can lead to over six fold increase in heat transfer
   rates in nano-devices. Dissipating heat from increasingly miniaturized
   semi-conductors of the future will become increasingly important since
   size limitations are often dictated by heat dissipation rates. These
   results also point to some other exciting practical applications. If the
   outside wall of a house were made hydrophilic, during hot summer days
   when the intent is to reduce heat transfer from the ambient (T-a>T-in),
   a small polar fluid like water could be introduced between the two
   walls. During nights, in order to cool the house (when T-in>T-a) water
   could be replaced by a less volatile soft material to enhance heat
   transfer. Thus, the same wall would demonstrate significant
   rectification in both cases but with different fluids. (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{513}},
Pages = {{127-141}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Data assimilation (DA) has been widely used in hydrological models to
   improve model state and subsequent streamflow estimates. However, for
   poor or non-existent state observations, the state estimation in
   hydrological DA can be problematic, leading to inaccurate streamflow
   updates. This study evaluates the soil moisture and flow variations and
   forecasts by assimilating streamflow and soil moisture. Three approaches
   of Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with dual state-parameter estimation
   are applied: (1) streamflow assimilation, (2) soil moistue assimilation,
   and (3) combined assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow. The
   assimilation approaches are evaluated using the Sacramento Soil Moisture
   Accounting (SAC-SMA) model in the Spencer Creek catchment in southern
   Ontario, Canada. The results show that there are significant differences
   in soil moisture variations and streamflow estimates when the three
   assimilation approaches were applied. In the streamflow assimilation,
   soil moisture states were markedly distorted, particularly soil moisture
   of lower soil layer; whereas, in the soil moisture assimilation,
   streamflow estimates are inaccurate. The combined assimilation of
   streamflow and soil moisture provides more accurate forecasts of both
   soil moisture and streamflow, particularly for shorter lead times. The
   combined approach has the flexibility to account for model adjustment
   through the time variation of parameters together with state variables
   when soil moisture and streamflow observations are integrated into the
   assimilation procedure. This evaluation is important for the application
   of DA methods to simultaneously estimate soil moisture states and
   watershed response and forecasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Color-shift keying (CSK) is a visible light communication intensity
   modulation scheme, outlined in IEEE 802.15.7, that transmits data
   imperceptibly through the variation of the color emitted by red, green,

   envelope of the transmitted signal is fixed; therefore, CSK reduces the
   potential for human health complications related to fluctuations in
   light intensity. In this work, a rigorous design framework for high
   order CSK constellations is presented. A key benefit of the frame work
   is that it optimizes constellations while accounting for crosstalk
   between the color communication channels. In addition, and unlike
   previous approaches, the method is capable of optimizing 3-D
   constellations. Furthermore, a prototype CSK communication system is
   presented to validate the performance of the optimized constellations,

Abstract = {{This work considers the problem of handling the failure of purification
   equipment in a hydrogen production process. In this process, natural gas
   and superheated steam are fed to a heated chemical reactor termed a
   reformer to produce hydrogen. The effluent gas is further processed and
   finally purified in a pressure swing adsorber (PSA). The off-gas out of
   the PSA is used to provide heat to the reformer. The failure of the PSA
   results in the loss of the off-gas, precluding the possibility of the
   continuation of nominal operation. If not properly handled, this fault
   can lead to a shutdown of the entire plant. To achieve stable operation
   while meeting operating requirements, a model predictive control (MPC)
   based safe-parking framework is designed for the handling of the fault.
   The key idea is to drive the process to a feasible operating point that
   enables stable operation in the faulty mode. MPC is used to handle the
   multivariable nature of the process and operating constraints. It also
   guides the process to a different operating region while meeting
   operating requirements. The effectiveness of the safe-parking design is
   demonstrated through simulations using a first-principles model of the
   hydrogen production unit.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate measurement and prediction of pellet size distributions are
   critically important for material processing because they are essential
   for model predictive control, real-time optimization, planning,
   scheduling and decision support of material production. Mechanical
   sieving is one of the traditional methods for pellet size measurement in
   industrial practice but cannot be applied in real-time fashion.
   Alternately, multivariate image analysis based pellet sizing methods may
   acquire the size information non-intrusively and thus can be implemented
   for on-line measurement in industrial applications. Nevertheless, the
   conventional multivariate image analysis based pellet sizing methods
   cannot effectively deal with the pellet overlapping effects in the still
   images, which may lead to inaccurate and unreliable measurements of size
   distributions. In our study, two novel video analysis based pellet
   sizing methods are proposed for measuring the pellet size distributions
   without any off-line and intrusive tests. The videos of free-falling
   pellets are first taken and then the free-falling tracks of pellets in
   video frames are analyzed through the two video analysis based pellet
   sizing approaches. In the first video analysis method, the Sobel edge
   detection strategy is adopted to identify and isolate the free-falling
   tracks in order to estimate the diameters of the corresponding pellets.
   For the second video analysis approach, the filtered gray-scale video
   frames are scanned row by row and then the particle diameters are
   estimated and predicted through the built Gaussian process regression
   (GPR) models and a fine designed counting rule so as to eliminate the
   overlapping effects of nickel pellets along the horizontal and vertical
   directions. The utility of these two video analysis based pellet sizing
   methods is demonstrated through the measurement and estimation of
   free-falling nickel pellets in two test videos. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{An analytical model for the cross-phase modulation ( XPM) variance in
   dispersion-managed coherent fiber-optic systems is developed based on
   the first order perturbation theory. The XPM variance is analytically
   calculated for arbitrary pulse shapes. For a non-Gaussian pulse, the
   summation of time-shifted Gaussian pulses is used to fit the target
   pulse shape, which not only provides a good approximation of the
   non-Gaussian pulse but also allows explicit derivation of the XPM
   variance. The analytically estimated XPM variance is found to be in good
   agreement with numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

   Unlike linear problems, the system matrices of this adjoint simulation
   are time varying. Their values are determined during the original

   sensitivity analysis of general time domain objective functions. The

Abstract = {{Background Hemophilia B patients are subject to frequent and spontaneous
   bleeding caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX (FIX). Mesenchymal
   stromal cells (MSCs) have been used in cellular therapies as a result of
   their immunomodulatory properties, the ability to home to sites of
   injury and their amenability to various ex vivo modifications, including
   lentiviral-mediated gene transfer.
   Methods MSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and
   differentiated into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. A
   lentiviral DNA vector containing the human FIX gene was generated using
   traditional restriction enzyme digest and ligation techniques to
   generate viable replication-incompetent lentiviral particles that were
   used to transduce MSCs. Quantitative measurement of FIX expression was
   conducted using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results The over-expression of FIX was sustained in vitro at levels >4
   mu g/10(6) cells/24 h and FIX coagulant activity was >2.5 mIU/10(6)
   cells/24 h for the 6-week duration of study. Lentiviral modification of
   cells with a multiplicity of infection of 10 did not adversely affect
   the potential of cord blood (CB) MSCs to differentiate to adipocytes,
   chondrocytes and osteoblastic cells, and the expression of functional
   FIX was sustained after differentiation and was similar to that in
   nondifferentiated cells.
   Conclusions Modification of human CB MSCs with a lentiviral vector
   resulted in sustained high FIX expression in vitro after differentiation
   to adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteoblastic cells. These modified MSCs
   could have applications in cellular therapies for hemophilia B.

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to establish normative
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) eigenvalues
   (lambda(1),lambda(2),lambda(3)), apparent diffusion coefficient, and
   fractional anisotropy in asymptomatic foot muscles.
   Methods: Ten healthy adults (mean {[}SD], 25.9 {[}4.3] years) were
   examined using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Diffusion
   tensor imaging indices were evaluated in 5 muscles in the foot:
   quadratus plantae, abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis, flexor
   digitorum brevis, and abductor digiti minimi. Signal-to-noise ratio was
   also measured for each muscle.
   Results: In the various foot muscles, lambda(1) ranged from 1.88 x
   10(-3)to 2.14 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, lambda(2) ranged from 1.39 x 10(-3) to
   1.48 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, and lambda(3) ranged from 0.91 x 10(-3) to 1.27 x
   10(-3) mm(2)/s; apparent diffusion coefficient ranged from 1.48 x 10(-3)
   to 1.55 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; and fractional anisotropy ranged from 0.21 to
   0.40. Statistical differences were seen in some eigenvalues between
   muscle pairs. Mean signal-to-noise ranged from 47.5 to 69.1 in the
   various muscles examined.
   Conclusions: Assessment of anisotropy of water diffusion in foot muscles
   was feasible using DTI. The measured DTI metrics in the foot were
   similar to those in calf and thigh skeletal muscles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effect of respiratory and cardiac motion on
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics in healthy human liver.
   Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects, participating in either part of this
   study, were scanned using a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   device. Coronal liver DTI (6 diffusion-encoding directions; b, 300
   mm(2)/s) during breath holding was compared to free breathing. Cardiac
   motion effects were evaluated by comparing breath-held DTI scans
   acquired during both diastole and systole.
   Results: Free breathing resulted in a significantly increased mean
   diffusivity (P < 0.05), lambda(1) (P < 0.01), lambda(2) (P < 0.05), and
   lambda(3) (P < 0.01) compared to breath holding. During systole
   significant increases in fractional anisotropy (P < 0.05), mean
   diffusivity (P < 0.05), and lambda(1) (P < 0.05), compared to systole,
   were found in the left lobe. The right lobe, which is less affected by
   cardiac motion, showed no significant change in DTI metrics over the
   cardiac cycle.
   Conclusions: Respiratory and cardiac motion tends to increase liver DTI
   metrics.}},

   the surfaces of the objects of interest. This solution is already
   available from the simulation computing the S-parameters. Therefore, it
   features negligible computational overhead compared with the full-wave
   simulation. At the same time, it provides the best accuracy for the
   given numerical field solution. It is validated through the sensitivity
   analysis of microwave structures simulated by a commercial

Title = {{Seismic Performance Quantification of Reinforced Masonry Structural
   Walls with Boundary Elements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The design of reinforced masonry (RM) structural walls subject to high
   inelastic curvature demands can often be hindered by prescriptive
   requirements in design codes regarding the ratio between compression
   zone depth (c) and wall length (l(w)). A possible solution to this would
   be the detailing of a confined boundary element at the critical wall
   toes to increase the curvature ductility capacity of the plastic hinge
   region. The Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) code currently
   prescribes the possible use of such boundary elements for the special
   reinforced masonry shear walls category. However, the MSJC provides no
   relevant prescriptive detailing guidance, leaving the onus on the
   designer to specify appropriate detailing to ensure the desired
   performance. The results of an experimental program designed to develop
   a confinement scheme based on conventional masonry construction
   practices are reported in this paper. Five half-scale RM walls, detailed
   with confined boundary elements containing a double layer of vertical
   reinforcement enclosed by stirrups, were tested under reversed cycles of
   quasi-static loading. The walls, detailed to represent typical low-to
   medium-rise construction, varied by their height, length, and aspect and
   vertical reinforcement ratios. Test results are reported in terms of
   force-based seismic design parameters, such as the wall strength,
   stiffness and ductility characteristics, as well as displacement and
   performance-based seismic design parameters for the next-generation of
   seismic codes in North America. Overall, the performance of the walls
   indicates that the selected boundary element detailing is a
   designerfriendly means of addressing the need for lower c/l(w) ratios
   and higher curvature levels as indicated by the MSJC. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Indium tin oxide (ITO) was deposited by RF sputtering on n-GaAs

   a reduction of specific contact resistance to <0.13 Omega cm(2) after
   annealing at 400 degrees C for 30 s. The In/ITO film had an average

Abstract = {{A series of ethylene/l-octene random and block copolymer samples were
   synthesized via a living coordination polymerization catalyzed by
   bis{[}N-(3-methylsalicylidene) -2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroanilinato]
   titanium(IV) dichloride/dMAO. The chain microstructures of the
   copolymers were elucidated by analytic TREF and DSC thermal
   fractionation techniques in this work. It was found that the living
   random copolymers possessed narrower intra-chain composition
   distributions than those prepared from conventional metallocene
   catalysts. With the same short chain branching content, the melting
   temperature of living random copolymer was about 16 C lower than
   metallocene-catalyzed random copolymer. The living block copolymers were
   also studied in comparison with the olefin multiblock copolymer (OBC)
   produced from chain shuttling polymerization. The interchain composition
   distribution of OBC was found broader than living block copolymers.
   However, the crystal thickness distribution of OBC was narrower. The
   diblock copolymer had a bimodal distribution in the crystal thickness
   and the step triblock copolymer showed a trimodal distribution, in
   contrast to OBC's single modal distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Polypyrrole-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PPy-MWCNT) were used
   for the fabrication of activated carbon-coated MWCNT doped with nitrogen
   (N-AC-MWCNT). The conceptually new method for the fabrication of
   non-agglomerated PPy-MWCNT with good coating uniformity allowed the
   fabrication of uniform and well-dispersed N-AC-MWCNT with high surface
   area. The use of N-AC-MWCNT allowed the fabrication of supercapacitor
   electrodes with high mass loading in the range of 15-35 mg cm(-2) and
   with a high active material to current collector mass ratio of
   0.21-0.50. The N-AC-MWCNT electrodes showed excellent electrochemical
   performance in aqueous 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The maximum specific
   capacitance of 3.6 F cm(-2) (103.1 F g(-1)) was achieved for mass
   loading of 35 mg cm(-2) at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1). The aqueous
   supercapacitor cells, based on N-AC-MWCNT electrodes, exhibited
   excellent performance with energy density of 16.1 mWh g(-1), power
   density of 14.4 W g(-1), and enlarged voltage window of 1.8 V. The
   individual electrodes and cells showed good capacitance retention at
   high charge-discharge rates and good cycling stability. Moreover, the
   N-AC-MWCNT electrodes showed promising performance for capacitive
   deionization of water. The feasibility of capacitive removal of organic
   dyes from aqueous solutions has been demonstrated. A quartz crystal
   microbalance method was used as a tool for the analysis of
   electrosorption and electrodesorption of ions and charged dyes during
   charge and discharge.}},

Abstract = {{A fully integrated 54-channel wireless fast-scan cyclic voltammetry DNA
   analysis SoC is presented. The microsystem includes 546 3D
   nanostructured and 54 2D gold DNA sensing microelectrodes as well as 54
   pH sensors. Each channel consists of a chopper-stabilized current
   conveyer with dynamic element matching. It is utilized as the
   amperometric readout circuit with a linear resolution from 8.6 pA to 350
   nA. The on-chip programmable waveform generator provides a wide range of
   user-controlled rate and amplitude parameters with a maximum scan range
   of 1.2 V, and scan rate ranging between 0.1 mV/sec to 300 V/sec. A
   digital ultra-wideband transmitter based on a delay line architecture
   provides wireless data communication with data rates of up to 50 Mb/sec
   while consuming 400 mu W. The 3 mm x 3 mm prototype fabricated in a 0.13
   mu m standard CMOS technology has been validated in prostate cancer
   synthetic DNA detection with 10 aM label-free PCR-free detection limit.
   Each channel occupies an area of only 0.06 mm(2)and consumes 42 mu W of
   power from a 1.2 V supply.}},

Abstract = {{After more than 80 years of practical experience and despite many noted
   research efforts, theories that rigorously explained the formation of
   the silicon eutectic phases and the modification of the morphology of
   those phases by specific chemical additives remained elusive. Almost all
   papers related to the growth and modification of silicon in casting
   Al-Si alloys refer to the importance of twinning and a mechanism called
   a twin-plane reentrant edge. However, a review paper containing detailed
   information on how the parallel twins are formed in a crystal during
   melt growth, why the twins are generated parallel to each other, what is
   the prerequisite for growing a facetted dendrite, and how effective are
   various rare earth elements is missing in the literature. A
   comprehensive review is conducted on the models proposed for the flaky
   silicon growth including twin-plane reentrant edge and the models
   proposed for eutectic modification: impurity induced twinning and
   restricted growth theory. Furthermore, the papers with focus on
   modifying efficiency of the rare-earth metals have been reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale modeling tools have great potential to aid the development of
   new steels and processing routes. Currently, industrial process models
   are at least in part based on empirical material parameters to describe
   microstructure evolution and the resulting material properties. Modeling
   across different length and time scales is a promising approach to
   develop next-generation process models with enhanced predictive
   capabilities for the role of alloying elements. The status and
   challenges of this multiscale modeling approach are discussed for
   microstructure evolution in advanced low-carbon steels. First-principle
   simulations of solute segregation to a grain boundary and an
   austenite-ferrite interface in iron confirm trends of important alloying
   elements (e.g., Nb, Mo, and Mn) on grain growth, recrystallization, and
   phase transformation in steels. In particular, the linkage among
   atomistic simulations, phase-field modeling, and classic diffusion
   models is illustrated for the effects of solute drag on the
   austenite-to-ferrite transformation as observed in dedicated
   experimental studies for iron model alloys and commercial steels.}},

Title = {{Primary Oxide Latent Storage and Spillover Enabling Electrocatalysts
   with Reversible Oxygen Electrode Properties and the Alterpolar
   Revertible (PEMFC versus WE) Cell}},

Abstract = {{Surface in and ex situ analysis have shown that in the course of
   cathodic oxygen reduction (ORR), all along the reversible potential
   range (the low slope Tafel plots, about 30 mVs/dec), nanostructured Pt
   electrocatalyst is covered by the interfering primary (Pt-OH) and
   surface (Pt=O) oxide mixture, while the higher polarization (120
   mVs/dec) characterizes electrocatalytic surface deprived from these
   oxides and, consequently, the reaction mechanism of direct electron
   exchange on clean electrode surface. The substantial difference between
   the standard RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and ROE (reversible
   oxygen electrode), is that the former implies spontaneous hydrogen
   adsorption, fast H-adatoms (Pt-H) effusion and reversible electrode
   behavior (Pt(H-2)/Pt-H/H3O+), while the latter features the strong
   irreversible Pt=O adsorptive strength, and which is more significant,
   missing the Pt-OH spillover within the critical potential range between
   the primary oxide adsorption/desorption peaks position and oxygen
   evolving limits in both potentiodynamic scan directions (or the imposed
   polarization energy barrier of about 600 mVs). Since the Pt-OH presence
   and spillover are unavoidable decisive and indispensable for
   establishing the ROE properties, and thermodynamic electrode equilibrium
   (Pt(O-2)/Pt-OH/Pt=O/OH-), within the pronounced high polarization broad
   potential range, such spillover species has the same meaning and
   significance for the ROE as Pt-H plays for the RHE. Thence, to fill such
   a high polarization gap, the guiding concept implies homogeneous
   nanostructured distribution and selective grafting while interactive
   hypo-hyper-d-d-interelectronic bonding of Pt nanoclusters upon various
   mixed valence hypo-d-oxide supports, primarily Nb2O5,TiO2 (or
   Ta2O5,TiO2), because of their much thermally advanced electronic
   conductivity and extra high stability. In such a constellation,
   nanoparticles of Pt and solid oxides establish the so-called SMSIs
   (strong metal-support interactions), the strongest-ones in all of
   chemistry, together with advanced electron conductive transfer, while
   the exposed surface of the latter undergoes spontaneous dissociative
   adsorption of water molecules (Nb2O5 -> 2 Nb(OH)(5)), and thereby
   becomes, along with continuous further water vapor supply, the
   undisturbed and almost unlimited, (alike electrons in metals) renewable
   latent storage and spillover source of the Pt-OH all along the potential
   axis between oxygen and hydrogen evolving limits, with inexhaustible
   abilities of further optimizations. The reversible alterpolar changes
   instantaneously result by the spillover of H-adatoms with corresponding
   bronze type (Pt/HxNbO5, x approximate to 0.3) electrocatalysts under
   cathodic, and/or its hydrated state (Pt/Nb(OH)(5)), responsible for
   Pt-OH effusion, under anodic polarization. This way there establishes
   the reversibly revertible alterpolar bronze features (Pt/HxNbO5 <->
   Pt/Nb(OH)(5)), as the thermodynamic equilibrium, and thereby
   substantially advanced electrocatalytic properties of these composite
   interactive electrocatalysts for both oxygen and hydrogen electrode
   reactions, in particular unique and superior for the revertible (proton
   exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) versus water electrolysis (WE))
   cells.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The mass transfer in S-shape dual in-plane short radius bends is
   investigated under annular air-water flow conditions. Experiments were
   performed for a Schmidt number (Sc) of 1280 for different lengths of
   straight pipe (LID) between the bends. Standard 90 bends with radius of
   curvature (r/D) of 1.5 were tested for LID from 0 to 40 for water (J(L))
   and air (J(v)) superficial velocities of 0.28 and 29 m/s, respectively.
   The maximum mass transfer was found to occur on the outer wall of the
   first bend in all cases. The region of high mass transfer in the second
   bend is located near the outlet of the bend outer wall and was
   approximately 60\% of that in the first bend for the L/D = 0 case. This
   value increased and the location moved upstream as the separation
   distance was increased, with a magnitude of approximately 85\% of that
   in the first bend at LID of 40. The effect of J(v) and h. on the mass
   transfer for LID = 0 was determined for J(v) and J(L) in the range
   0.17-0.4 m/s and 22-30 m/s, respectively. The local mass transfer
   distribution was similar in all cases, with J(v) having a more
   significant effect on the mass transfer enhancement. The phase
   redistribution within the dual bend for LID = 0 was visualized using
   laser induced fluorescence. The high mass transfer locations were found
   to correlate well with the locations of liquid impingement. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The accelerated expansion of the Universe was proposed through the use
   of Type-Ia supernovae (SNe) as standard candles. The standardization
   depends on an empirical correlation between the stretch/color and peak
   luminosity of the light curves. The use of Type-Ia SNe as standard
   candles rests on the assumption that their properties (and this
   correlation) do not vary with redshift. We consider the possibility that
   the majority of Type-Ia SNe are in fact caused by a Quark-Nova
   detonation in a tight neutron-star-CO-white-dwarf binary system, which
   forms a Quark-Nova Ia (QN-Ia). The spin-down energy injected by the
   Quark-Nova remnant (the quark star) contributes to the post-peak light
   curve and neatly explains the observed correlation between peak
   luminosity and light curve shape. We demonstrate that the parameters
   describing QN-Ia are NOT constant in redshift. Simulated QN-Ia light
   curves provide a test of the stretch/color correlation by comparing the
   true distance modulus with that determined using SN light curve fitters.
   We determine a correction between the true and fitted distance moduli,
   which when applied to Type-Ia SNe in the Hubble diagram recovers the
   Omega(M) = 1 cosmology. We conclude that Type-Ia SNe observations do not
   necessitate the need for an accelerating expansion of the Universe (if
   the observed SNe Ia are dominated by QNe Ia) and by association the need
   for dark energy.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of bubble nucleation in the foaming process under
   atmospheric pressure is investigated in the present study. The
   experimental observations using a plastic-foaming visualization setup
   revealed two stages of nucleation, primary nucleation in interstitial
   regions and secondary nucleation in the polymer melt, which followed the
   sintering and densification of the polymer matrix. Statistical analysis
   of the evolving cellular structure during the nucleation stage was used
   to study the significance of rheology on the behavior of polymer
   materials during the nucleation. The role of viscosity on the nucleation
   rate was also investigated theoretically by using a modified form of the
   classical nucleation theory and it was verified with the experimentally

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the delay performance in a wireless sensor
   network (WSN) with a cluster-tree topology. The end-to-end delay in such
   a network can be strongly dependent on the relative location between the
   sensors and the sink and the resource allocations of the cluster heads
   (CHs). For real-time traffic, packets transmitted with excessive delay
   are dropped. Given the timeline allocations of each CH for local and
   inter-cluster traffic transmissions, an analytical model is developed to
   find the distribution of the end-to-end transmission delay for packets
   originated from different clusters. Based on this result, the packet
   drop rate is derived. A heuristic scheme is then proposed to jointly
   find the timeline allocations of all the CHs in a WSN in order to
   achieve the minimum and balanced packet drop rate for traffic originated
   from different levels of the cluster tree. Simulation results are shown
   to verify the analysis and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed CH timeline allocation scheme. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has a typical onset during childhood
   or adolescence. Although recent in-vivo proton magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) studies report gray matter metabolite
   abnormalities in children and adolescents with OCD, there are no
   existing H-1-MRS studies that measure white matter (WM) metabolite
   levels in this population. In the present study, we measured metabolite
   levels in the left and right prefrontal WM (LPFWM and RPFWM,
   respectively) of psychotropic-naive children and adolescents with OCD
   (LPFWM: N = 15, mean age 13.3 +/- 2.4 years; right RPFWM: N = 14, mean
   age 13.0 +/- 2.3 years) and healthy controls (LPFWM: N = 17, mean age
   11.8 +/- 2.7 years; RPFWM: N = 18, mean age 12.2 perpendicular to 2.8
   years). Spectra were acquired using a 3T single voxel PRESS sequence
   (1.5 Chi 2.0 Chi 2.0 cm(3)). When age and sex effects were controlled,
   OCD patients had higher levels of RPFWM choline and N-acetyl-aspartate
   (NAA). In addition, RPFWM levels of NAA, creatine and myoinositol were
   positively and significantly correlated with severity of OCD symptoms.
   In summary, this is the first published study of WM metabolite levels in
   children and adolescents with OCD. Our preliminary findings lend further
   support to the previous findings of WM abnormalities in OCD. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Herein, we report the successful electrochemical detection and

   variation in H-2 fluxes was imaged revealing the time-dependent
   corrosion reaction. Our results demonstrate that through careful control
   of the corroding media and immersion time, quantitative SECM approach
   curves, devoid of convective effects, were acquired. Comparison to an
   idealized numerical model enabled the quantification of the local H-2
   flux for a given corroding area. These data demonstrated that the active
   site size increases throughout the reaction, whereas the flux of H-2
   generated at an active site increased for the first hour of immersion
   followed by decrease in the flux of H-2 for times greater than 1 h. (C)

Abstract = {{The hybrid Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)/Large Eddy
   Simulation (LES) methodology was used to investigate the flow dynamics
   and associated gap vortex structure in compound rectangular channels for
   isothermal flows. The specific form of the hybrid URANS/LES approach
   that was used is the Strelets (2001) version of the Shear Stress
   Transport (SST) based Detached Eddy Simulation (DES). The DES-SST model
   was used to study quasi-periodic flow across a gap connecting two
   rectangular sub-channels on which extensive experiments were conducted
   by Meyer and Rehme (1994). It was found that the DES-SST model was
   successful in predicting the characteristics of the flow field in the
   vicinity of the gap region. The span-wise velocity contours, velocity
   vector plots, and time traces of the velocity components showed the
   expected cross flow mixing between the sub-channels through the gap. The
   dynamics of the flow field were quantitatively described through
   temporal auto-correlations, spatial cross-correlations and power
   spectral functions. The numerical predictions were in general agreement
   with the experiments. Predictions from the model were used to identify
   different flow mixing patterns. As expected, the simulation predicted
   the formation of a gap vortex street which results in a quasi-periodic
   flow through the gap. Coherent structures were identified in the flow
   field to be comprised of eddies, shear zones and streams. Eddy
   structures with high vorticity and low pressure cores were found to
   exist near the vicinity of the gap edge region. A three dimensional
   vorticity field was identified and found to exist near the gap edge
   region. The instability mechanism and the probable cause behind the
   quasi-periodic fluid flow across the gap was identified and related to

Abstract = {{Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) is a major degradation mechanism
   affecting carbon steel piping systems in nuclear power plants (NPPs).
   Flow and mass transfer conditions determine the local distribution of
   wall thinning, even though chemistry and materials determine the overall
   potential for FAC. Different localized thinning rates in back-to-back
   elbow configurations between the first and second elbows have been noted
   at NPPs, and this difference depends on the distance between elbows,
   flow conditions, and the configuration of the back-to-back elbows (S-,
   C-, or out of plane). This paper will focus on mass transfer
   measurements for back-to-back elbows arranged in an out of plane
   configuration for different elbow separation distances under
   single-phase flow conditions. The mass transfer measurements were
   performed using a mass dissolution technique of gypsum test sections in
   water. The experiments were performed at a Reynolds number of 70,000 and
   a resulting Schmidt number of 1280, which is similar to that for the
   diffusion of the iron magnetite layer of carbon steel piping in water,
   providing a mass transfer environment analogous to that in NPPs.
   Experiments were performed with 0, 1,2 and 5 pipe diameters in length
   between the elbows. The mass transfer results show regions of higher
   mass transfer in the second elbow in comparison to the first elbow. The
   maximum mass transfer enhancement factor decreased from 2.7 to 2.1 as
   the separation distance increased from 0 to 5 pipe diameters. Flow
   streaks on the second elbow surface indicated swirling flow and its
   strength decreased with increasing separation distances. The relative
   roughness in the upstream pipe was found to be 0.003-0.004. The
   roughness level in the second elbow is 1.5 times higher than the
   upstream pipe and decreases with increasing bend separation distance.

Abstract = {{We propose an atomistic model to describe extended \{311\} defects in

   chains. The model is able to accurately reproduce not only planar
   \{311\} defects but also defect structures that show steps, bends, or
   both. We use molecular dynamics techniques to show that these
   interstitial and bond defect chains spontaneously transform into
   extended \{311\} defects. Simulations are validated by comparing with
   precise experimental measurements on actual \{311\} defects. The
   excellent agreement between the simulated and experimentally derived
   structures, regarding individual atomic positions and shape of the
   distinct structural \{311\} defect units, provides strong evidence for
   the robustness of the proposed model. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Calorimetric features of release of plastic deformation induced internal
   stresses, and approach to equilibrium state on annealing of crystals and
   glasses}},
Journal = {{THERMOCHIMICA ACTA}},

Abstract = {{Plastic deformation of crystals and glasses produces internal strains
   (stresses), which change their energy and other thermodynamic
   properties. On annealing, these stresses decrease at a rate faster than
   the structure relaxes toward the equilibrium state. Mechanism of such
   relaxations in crystals differs from that in glasses and it also differs
   for glasses of different types. In all cases, the energy related
   properties decrease with time isothermally and on heating, resembling
   the structure relaxation of a stress-free glass. We consider these
   features and argue that kinetics of enthalpy loss with time yields the
   rate constants of the stress release and of the structure change, and
   not the viscosity determining a-relaxation time. Since thermal cycling
   does not recover the enthalpy from internal stresses, a glass with
   stresses has neither a glass-softening temperature, T-g, nor a fictive
   temperature, T-f. Plastic deformation would not rejuvenate a physically
   aged glass to the properties of its un-aged state. The Prigogine-Defay
   ratio can be extended to all T(f)s, and used to investigate the effect
   of distribution of relaxation times on its value, but it can not be
   defined for an internally stressed glass. After discussing the effects
   of annealing on the heat capacity and DSC scans, we conclude that on
   slow heating, glass with deformation-induced stresses would show two
   exothermic minima, and normal glass would show only one such minimum.
   Temperature-modulated scanning calorimetry would also distinguish an
   internally stressed glass from an equally high-enthalpy, stress-free
   glass. Enthalpy matching procedure would yield inaccurate Tf value of a
   plastically deformed glass, but not of a hyperquenched glass.
   Phenomenological analysis given here has consequences for interpretation
   of the calorimetric changes observed on heating the shear-amorphized, as
   well as pressure-collapsed states of crystals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The effect of pH, inlet ozone injection rate, initial bromide
   concentration, membrane coating, hydroxyl radical scavenger, and
   membrane molecular weight cut off (MWCO) on the formation of bromate in
   a hybrid membrane filtration-ozonation reactor treating water containing
   bromide and natural organic matter (NOM) was studied. Variations in the
   TOC, UV254, SUVA (specific UV absorbance), color and turbidity of water
   as a function of these parameters were investigated. Bromate formation
   increased with increasing inlet gaseous ozone injection rate, and
   initial bromide concentration. The extent of bromate formation decreased
   with decreasing pH, with increasing TOC concentration, and in the
   presence of tertiary butyl alcohol (t-BuOH), an OH radical scavenger.
   The bromate concentrations that were observed with the Mn oxide coated
   membrane were less than that formed with the TiO2 membrane. An increase
   in the bromate concentration was observed with decreasing MWCO of the
   filtration membrane. Consistent with earlier work, experimental results
   indicated that ozonation can be used to mitigate membrane fouling. If
   dissolved ozone is present in the system, continuous operation of the
   hybrid ozonation-membrane filtration system at a permeate flux
   comparable to the clean water permeate flux can be achieved. An
   empirical model was developed using multiple linear regression method to
   estimate bromate formation in the system as a function of bromide
   concentration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, inlet ozone
   injection rate, pH, and reaction time. Good correlation was achieved
   between the model predictions and the experimental data. According to
   the model, bromate formation was favored as bromide concentration, ozone
   injection rate, and pH increased. However, an increase in DOC
   concentration reduced bromate formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All
