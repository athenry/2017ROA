Abstract = {{Key points Arterial CO2 serves as a mediator of cerebral blood flow, and
   its relative influence on the regulation of cerebral blood flow is
   defined as cerebral CO2 reactivity. Because of methodological
   limitations, almost all previous studies have evaluated the response of
   blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery to changes in CO2 as a
   measure of CO2 reactivity across the whole brain. We found that the
   vertebral artery has lower CO2 reactivity than the internal carotid
   artery. Moreover, CO2 reactivity in the external carotid artery was
   markedly lower than in the cerebral circulation. These results
   demonstrate regional differences in CO2 regulation of blood flow between
   the internal carotid, external carotid, and vertebro-basilar
   circulation. Abstract Arterial CO2 serves as a mediator of cerebral
   blood flow (CBF), and its relative influence on the regulation of CBF is
   defined as cerebral CO2 reactivity. Our previous studies have
   demonstrated that there are differences in CBF responses to
   physiological stimuli (i.e. dynamic exercise and orthostatic stress)
   between arteries in humans. These findings suggest that dynamic CBF
   regulation and cerebral CO2 reactivity may be different in the anterior
   and posterior cerebral circulation. The aim of this study was to
   identify cerebral CO2 reactivity by measuring blood flow and examine
   potential differences in CO2 reactivity between the internal carotid
   artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA) and vertebral artery (VA).
   In 10 healthy young subjects, we evaluated the ICA, ECA, and VA blood
   flow responses by duplex ultrasonography (Vivid-e, GE Healthcare), and
   mean blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery (MCA) and basilar
   artery (BA) by transcranial Doppler (Vivid-7, GE healthcare) during two
   levels of hypercapnia (3\% and 6\% CO2), normocapnia and hypocapnia to
   estimate CO2 reactivity. To characterize cerebrovascular reactivity to
   CO2, we used both exponential and linear regression analysis between CBF
   and estimated partial pressure of arterial CO2, calculated by end-tidal
   partial pressure of CO2. CO2 reactivity in VA was significantly lower
   than in ICA (coefficient of exponential regression 0.021 +/- 0.008 vs.
   0.030 +/- 0.008; slope of linear regression 2.11 +/- 0.84 vs. 3.18 +/-
   1.09\% mmHg-1: VA vs. ICA, P < 0.01). Lower CO2 reactivity in the
   posterior cerebral circulation was persistent in distal intracranial
   arteries (exponent 0.023 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.037 +/- 0.009; linear 2.29 +/-
   0.56 vs. 3.31 +/- 0.87\% mmHg-1: BA vs. MCA). In contrast, CO2
   reactivity in ECA was markedly lower than in the intra-cerebral
   circulation (exponent 0.006 +/- 0.007; linear 0.63 +/- 0.64\% mmHg-1, P
   < 0.01). These findings indicate that vertebro-basilar circulation has
   lower CO2 reactivity than internal carotid circulation, and that CO2
   reactivity of the external carotid circulation is markedly diminished
   compared to that of the cerebral circulation, which may explain
   different CBF responses to physiological stress.}},

Abstract = {{The scalable execution of parallel adaptive analyses requires the
   application of dynamic load balancing to repartition the mesh into a set
   of parts with balanced work load and minimal communication. As the
   adaptive meshes being generated reach billions of elements and the
   analyses are performed on massively parallel computers with 100,000's of
   computing cores, a number of complexities arise that need to be
   addressed. This paper presents procedures developed to deal with two of
   them. The first is a procedure to support multiple parts per processor
   which is used as the mesh increases in size and it is desirable to
   partition the mesh to a larger number of computing cores than are
   currently being used. The second is a predictive load balancing method
   that sets entity weights before dynamic load balancing steps so that the
   mesh is well balanced after the mesh adaptation step thus avoiding
   excessive memory spikes that would otherwise occur during mesh
   adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an analytical instantaneous power-optimal attitude
   control for a spacecraft using an integrated reaction wheel flywheel
   system allowing for energy storage and return. The control is formulated
   in a general manner to use an arbitrarily large number of reaction
   wheels. It is applicable to systems with redundant wheels spanning
   three-dimensional space, which are controlled by a general attitude
   control law. The instantaneous power usage is minimized by modifying the
   wheel control torques using the wheel torque null motion. In this study,
   reducing the wheel speed results in negative power usage with perfect
   energy recuperation. Applying the maximum available wheel torque
   constraints, the null torque solution space is reduced to a
   hyperdimensional vector geometry problem, and the power-optimal wheel
   control torques are uniquely determined. The control modifications are
   applied to both attitude regulation and tracking control laws,
   demonstrating its performance for a variety of initial spacecraft
   states. Not only does the new control maximize the energy extraction
   from the reaction wheels, it also maintains the smallest flywheel spin
   rates, which helps reduce the maneuver-wide power usage.}},

Abstract = {{Force drift is a significant, yet unresolved, problem in atomic force 1
   microscopy (AFM). We show that the primary source of force drift for a
   popular class of cantilevers is their gold coating, even though they are
   coated on both sides to minimize drift. Drift of the zero-force position
   of the cantilever was reduced from 900 nm for gold-coated cantilevers to
   70 nm (N = 10; rms) for uncoated cantilevers over the first 2 h after
   wetting the tip; a majority of these uncoated cantilevers (60\%) showed
   significantly less drift (12 nm, rms). Removing the gold also led to
   similar to 10-fold reduction in reflected light, yet short-term (0.1-10
   s) force precision improved. Moreover, improved force precision did not
   require extended settling; most of the cantilevers tested (9 out of 15)
   achieved sub-pN force precision (0.54 +/- 0.02 pN) over a broad
   bandwidth (0.01-10 Hz) just 30 min after loading. Finally, this
   precision was maintained while stretching DNA. Hence, removing gold
   enables both routine and timely access to sub-pN force precision in
   liquid over extended periods (100 s). We expect that many current and
   future applications of AFM can immediately benefit from these
   improvements in force stability and precision.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method is presented to create and characterize
   mechanically robust, free-standing, ultrathin, oxide films with
   controlled, nanometer-scale thickness using atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) on graphene. Aluminum oxide films were deposited onto suspended
   graphene membranes using ALD. Subsequent etching of the graphene left
   pure aluminum oxide films only a few atoms in thickness. A pressurized
   blister test was used to determine that these ultrathin films have a
   Young's modulus of 154 +/- 13 GPa. This Young's modulus is comparable to
   much thicker alumina ALD films. This behavior indicates that these
   ultrathin two-dimensional films have excellent mechanical integrity. The
   films are also impermeable to standard gases suggesting they are
   pinhole-free. These continuous ultrathin films are expected to enable
   new applications in fields such as thin film coatings, membranes, and
   flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The Ross Ice Shelf airstream (RAS) is a barrier parallel flow along the
   base of the Transantarctic Mountains. Previous research has hypothesized
   that a combination of katabatic flow, barrier winds, and mesoscale and
   synoptic-scale cyclones drive the RAS. Within the RAS, an area of
   maximum wind speed is located to the northwest of the protruding Prince
   Olav Mountains. In this region. the Sabrina automatic weather station
   (AWS) observed a September 2009 high wind event with wind speeds in
   excess of 20 m s(-1) for nearly 35 h. The following case study uses in
   situ AWS observations and output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction
   System to demonstrate that the strong wind speeds during this event were
   caused by a combination of various forcing mechanisms, including
   katabatic winds, barrier winds, a surface mesocyclone over the Ross Ice
   Shelf, an upper-level ridge over the southern tip of the Ross Ice Shelf,
   and topographic influences from the Prince Olav Mountains. These forcing
   mechanisms induced a barrier wind corner jet to the northwest of the
   Prince Olav Mountains, explaining the maximum wind speeds observed in
   this region. The RAS wind speeds were strong enough to induce two
   additional barrier wind corner jets to the northwest of the Prince Olav
   Mountains, resulting in a triple barrier wind corner jet along the base
   of the Transantarctic Mountains.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The effect of recent experience on current behavior has been studied
   extensively in simple laboratory tasks. We explore the nature of
   sequential effects in the more naturalistic setting of automobile
   driving. Driving is a safety-critical task in which delayed response
   times may have severe consequences. Using a realistic driving simulator,
   we find significant sequential effects in pedal-press response times
   that depend on the history of recent stimuli and responses. Response
   times are slowed up to 100 ms in particular cases, a delay that has
   dangerous practical consequences. Further, we observe a significant
   number of history-related pedal misapplications, which have recently
   been noted as a cause for concern in the automotive safety community. By
   anticipating these consequences of sequential context, driver assistance
   systems could mitigate the effects of performance degradations and thus
   critically improve driver safety.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses design and implementation of integrated

   measurement of the rectifying devices is compared to harmonic-balance
   simulations. Optimal diode RF and dc impedances for most efficient
   rectification, as a function of input power, are obtained. This allows
   optimized antenna design, which can eliminate or simplify matching
   networks and improve overall efficiency. As an example of the design
   methodology, Schottky diodes were characterized at 1.96 GHz and an
   antenna is matched to the optimal complex impedance for the most
   efficient rectifier. For incident power density range of interest, the
   optimal impedance is 137 + j149 Omega, with an RF to dc conversion
   efficiency of the rectifying circuit alone of 63\% and total rectenna
   efficiency of 54\%.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated degradation studies are frequently used to screen for
   formulation conditions that confer adequate shelf life for therapeutic
   proteins. To speed development cycles, degradation is often accelerated
   by application of conditions that expose proteins to elevated
   temperatures, dynamic air-water interfaces created by agitation, or
   stresses induced by freeze-thaw cycling. The purpose of this case study
   was to compare freeze-thaw-and agitation-induced aggregations with
   aggregation previously studied at elevated temperatures (Fast J, Cordes
   AA, Carpenter JF, Randolph TW. 2009. Biochemistry 48: 11724-11736) using
   the therapeutic fusion protein abatacept as a model. The stability of
   abatacept against aggregation induced by the freeze-thaw and agitation
   degradation methods was assessed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)
   and microflow imaging (MFI) analysis. pH conditions that were previously
   found to increase conformational stability of abatacept and reduce
   aggregation during incubation at elevated temperature (Fast J, Cordes
   AA, Carpenter JF, Randolph TW. 2009. Biochemistry 48: 11724-11736) also
   reduced aggregation induced by freeze-thaw cycling and by agitation in
   this study. Especially in the case of the freeze-thaw cycling, wherein
   the formation of aggregates was not readily detectable by SEC, MFI
   proved to be a useful method to characterize the stability of the
   formulations against aggregation. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and

Abstract = {{Symbiotic bacteria often help their hosts acquire nutrients from their
   diet, showing trends of co-evolution and independent acquisition by
   hosts from the same trophic levels. While these trends hint at important
   roles for biotic factors, the effects of the abiotic environment on
   symbiotic community composition remain comparably understudied. In this
   investigation, we examined the influence of abiotic and biotic factors
   on the gut bacterial communities of fish from different taxa, trophic
   levels and habitats. Phylogenetic and statistical analyses of 25 16S
   rRNA libraries revealed that salinity, trophic level and possibly host
   phylogeny shape the composition of fish gut bacteria. When analysed
   alongside bacterial communities from other environments, fish gut
   communities typically clustered with gut communities from mammals and
   insects. Similar consideration of individual phylotypes (vs.
   communities) revealed evolutionary ties between fish gut microbes and
   symbionts of animals, as many of the bacteria from the guts of
   herbivorous fish were closely related to those from mammals. Our results
   indicate that fish harbour more specialized gut communities than
   previously recognized. They also highlight a trend of convergent
   acquisition of similar bacterial communities by fish and mammals,
   raising the possibility that fish were the first to evolve symbioses
   resembling those found among extant gut fermenting mammals.}},

   understand the mechanical behavior of the proximal PAs under
   physiological conditions, this study computed the residual stretch and
   the in vivo circumferential stretch state in the main pulmonary arteries
   in both control and hypertensive calves by using in vitro and in vivo
   artery geometry data, and modeled the impact of residual stretch and
   arterial remodeling on the in vivo circumferential stretch distribution
   and collagen engagement in the main pulmonary artery. We found that the
   in vivo circumferential stretch distribution in both groups was
   nonuniform across the vessel wall with the largest stretch at the outer
   wall, suggesting that collagen at the outer wall would engage first. It
   was also found that the circumferential stretch was more uniform in the
   hypertensive group, partially due to arterial remodeling that occurred
   during their hypoxic treatment, and that their onset of collagen
   engagement occurred at a higher pressure. It is concluded that the
   residual stretch and arterial remodeling have strong impact on the in
   vivo stretch state and the collagen engagement and thus the mechanical
   behavior of the main pulmonary artery in calves.}},

Abstract = {{A new soil moisture content sensor coupled with a new matric potential
   sensor that can operate in the subfreezing environment was used to
   measure the moisture content and soil matric potential dynamics of
   Qinghai-Tibetan silty clay. Combined with nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) technique and thermal resistor temperature probe, the
   characteristics of unfrozen water content and soil matric potential, and
   their relationships with temperature were analyzed. The results show
   that initial water content has an impact on the freezing point and
   unfrozen water content. The decrease in the initial water content
   results in a depression in the freezing point. The Qinghai-Tibetan silty
   clay has more similar unfrozen water content characteristic to clay than
   to silt. There is approximately 3\% of unfrozen water content retained
   when the soil temperature drops to -15A degrees C. The change of soil
   matric potential with temperature is similar to that of the unfrozen
   water content. The matric potential value of the saturated silty clay is
   approximately -200 kPa when the soil temperature drops to -20A degrees
   C. The measured matric potentials are significantly lower than the
   calculated theoretical values based on the freezing point depression.
   Moisture migration experiment indicates that soil matric potential
   controls the direction of moisture movement and moisture redistribution
   (including ice and liquid water) during the soil freezing.}},

Title = {{The Degrees of Freedom Region and Interference Alignment for the MIMO
   Interference Channel With Delayed CSIT}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The degrees of freedom (DoF) region of the two-user multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel (IC) is studied under the
   assumptions of fast fading and delayed channel state information (CSI)
   at the transmitters (CSIT). Under our fast fading assumption, the
   channel matrices vary independently across time, so that delayed CSIT is
   equivalent to outdated CSIT. In particular, the DoF region under delayed
   CSIT is established for the general MIMO IC with an arbitrary numbers of
   antennas at each of the four terminals. Toward this end, a set of outer
   bounds to the DoF region of the general MIMO IC is derived. These bounds
   are then shown to be tight by developing DoF-region-optimal interference
   alignment schemes. A comparison of the DoF region of the MIMO IC under
   the delayed CSIT assumption with those under the two extremes of
   instantaneous CSIT and no CSIT assumptions is made. This comparison
   reveals that there are nonempty classes of MIMO ICs, defined by certain
   relationships between the numbers of antennas at the four terminals,
   that correspond to each of the following four scenarios: the no CSIT DoF
   region is strictly contained by, or is equal to, the delayed CSIT DoF
   region, which in turn is strictly contained by, or is equal to, the
   instantaneous CSIT DoF region. It is notable that within the class of
   MIMO ICs for which the delayed CSIT DoF region is strictly larger than
   the no CSIT DoF region, there is a subclass for which the interference
   alignment scheme which uses just delayed CSIT achieves the entire DoF
   region previously known to be achievable only with instantaneous CSIT.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the near-surface soil freeze-thaw cycle on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) were detected using daily soil freeze/thaw
   states derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data from 1988 to
   2007. Linear trends in freeze and thaw dates, the number of total frozen
   days of each pixel, and the numbers of monthly and yearly frozen days
   averaged over the whole QTP were analyzed. Principal component analysis
   was used to investigate the spatial variation in the freeze-thaw cycle.
   The results show that on the QTP there was a trend toward earlier onset
   date of soil thaw by approximately 14 days, and later onset date of soil
   freeze by approximately 10 days over the period 1988-2007. The number of
   frozen days has decreased over the QTP by 16.8 days per decade. This
   decrease in the number of frozen days has occurred mainly from April to
   September, with a more pronounced trend in warmer months. The most
   significant changes were in the northeastern and southwestern QTP, where
   discontinuous permafrost, island permafrost, and seasonally frozen
   ground are presented. The northwestern QTP had almost no change, where
   permafrost is cold and stable. The trend in the near-surface soil
   freeze-thaw cycle is positively related with climate warming on the QTP.
   Much warmer winters may account for significantly earlier thawing, later
   freezing, and a substantial reduction in the number of frozen days on
   the QTP. These changes in the near-surface soil freeze-thaw cycle can be
   used both as an effective indicator of the permafrost change and for
   mapping of permafrost stability. Changes in near-surface soil
   freeze-thaw cycle and consequently permafrost conditions would have
   dramatic influence on hydrologic processes, ecosystem, and engineering
   operations over the QTP. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the thickness of cowpea leaves was measured with high
   data- and time-resolution, and the dynamics of leaf thickness was
   subsequently used as an input parameter for automated irrigation control
   at the greenhouse level. Under non-stressful environmental conditions,
   leaf thickness showed only minor diurnal and almost no nocturnal
   fluctuations. In an extreme water deficit stress scenario, leaf
   thickness decreased dramatically by as much as 45\% within a short
   period of time. In a more realistic situation, leaf thickness was kept
   fairly constant for several days, but decreased substantially when water
   deficit stress became too severe for the plants to cope with any longer.
   This characteristic collapse of leaf thickness was used as an input
   parameter for the automated initiation of irrigation. Upon automated
   irrigation, plants re-established their nominal leaf thickness quickly
   and kept this leaf thickness constant for several days, until signaling
   the need for the next irrigation by a subsequent decrease of leaf
   thickness. By using the measurement of leaf thickness for irrigation
   control, between 25 and 45\% of irrigation water could be conserved
   compared with a typical timed irrigation schedule.}},

Abstract = {{The mesothermal outflow zones (50-65A degrees C) of geothermal springs
   often support an extensive zone of green and orange laminated microbial
   mats. In order to identify and compare the microbial inhabitants of
   morphologically similar green-orange mats from chemically and
   geographically distinct springs, we generated and analyzed small-subunit
   ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons from six mesothermal mats (four
   previously unexamined) in Yellowstone National Park. Between three and
   six bacterial phyla dominated each mat. While many sequences bear the
   highest identity to previously isolated phototrophic genera belonging to
   the Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Chlorobi phyla, there is also
   frequent representation of uncultured, unclassified members of these
   groups. Some genus-level representatives of these dominant phyla were
   found in all mats, while others were unique to a single mat. Other
   groups detected at high frequencies include candidate divisions (such as
   the OP candidate clades) with no cultured representatives or complete
   genomes available. In addition, rRNA genes related to the recently
   isolated and characterized photosynthetic acidobacterium ``Candidatus
   Chloracidobacterium thermophilum{''} were detected in most mats. In
   contrast to microbial mats from well-studied hypersaline environments,
   the mesothermal mats in this study accrue less biomass and are
   substantially less diverse, but have a higher proportion of known
   phototrophic organisms. This study provides sequences appropriate for
   accurate phylogenetic classification and expands the molecular
   phylogenetic survey of Yellowstone microbial mats.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of interfaces in fluid/solid biphasic media is known to
   strongly influence their behavior both in terms of solid deformation and
   fluids flow. Mathematical models have traditionally represented these
   interfaces as lines of no-thickness and whose behavior is given in terms
   of effective permeabilities whose physical meaning is often disconnected
   to the microscopic nature of the interface. This article aims to
   reconcile macroscopic and microscopic interface representations by
   investigating how the nature of microscopic flows and pressures in the
   interface can be used to explain its macroscopic behavior. By invoking a
   proper thickness average operation, we derive an closed form expression
   that relates the effective interfaces permeabilities to its microscopic
   properties. In particular, we find that the effective interface
   permeabilities are strongly influenced by three factors: the ratio of
   bulk and interface permeabilities, the fluid viscosity, and the physical
   thickness of the interface.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing subsensory
   stochastic-resonance mechanical vibration to the foot soles of elderly
   walkers could decrease gait variability. In a randomized double-blind
   controlled trial, 29 subjects engaged in treadmill walking while wearing
   sandals customized with three actuators capable of producing
   stochastic-resonance mechanical vibration embedded in each sole. For
   each subject, we determined a subsensory level of vibration stimulation.
   After a 5-min acclimation period of walking with the footwear, subjects
   were asked to walk on the treadmill for six trials, each 30 s long.
   Trials were pair-wise random: in three trials, actuators provided
   subsensory vibration; in the other trials, they did not. Subjects wore
   reflective markers to track body motion. Stochastic-resonance mechanical
   stimulation exhibited baseline-dependent effects on spatial
   stride-to-stride variability in gait, slightly increasing variability in
   subjects with least baseline variability and providing greater
   reductions in variability for subjects with greater baseline variability
   (p < .001). Thus, applying stochastic-resonance mechanical vibrations on
   the plantar surface of the foot reduces gait variability for subjects
   with more variable gait. Stochastic-resonance mechanical vibrations may
   provide an effective intervention for preventing falls in healthy
   elderly walkers. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the development and testing of poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG) hydrogels with independently controlled dimensions of wide and
   deep macrochannels for their ability to promote alignment of skeletal
   myoblasts and myoblast differentiation. A UV-photopatterned thiol-ene
   mold was employed to produce long channels, which ranged from similar to
   40 to 200 mu m in width and from similar to 100 to 200 mu m in depth,
   within a PEG-RGD hydrogel. Skeletal myoblasts (C2C12) were successfully
   cultured multiple cell layers deep within the channels. Decreasing
   channel width, increasing channel depth and, interestingly, increasing
   cell layer away from the channel base all contributed to a decreased
   interquartile range of cell angle relative to the long axis of the
   channel wall, indicating improved cell alignment. Differentiation of
   skeletal myoblasts into myotubes was confirmed by gene expression fcr
   myoD, myogenin and MCH Ilb, and myotube formation for all channel
   geometries, but was not dependent on channel size. Qualitatively,
   myotubes were characteristically different, as myotubes were larger and
   had more nuclei in larger channels. Overall, our findings demonstrate
   that relatively large features, which do not readily facilitate cell
   alignment in two dimensions, promote cell alignment when presented in
   three dimensions, suggesting an important role for three-dimensional
   spatial cues. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors present a photodegradable microparticle
   system that can be used to entrap and deliver bioactive proteins to
   cells during culture. By using a photosensitive delivery system,
   experimenters can achieve a wide variety of spatiotemporally regulated
   release profiles with a single microparticle formulation, thereby,
   enabling one to probe many questions as to how protein presentation can
   be manipulated to regulate cell function. Photodegradable microparticles
   were synthesized via inverse suspension polymerization with a mean
   diameter of 22 mu m, and degradation was demonstrated upon exposure to
   several irradiation conditions. The protein-loaded depots were
   incorporated into cell cultures and release of bioactive protein was
   quantified during the photodegradation process. This phototriggered
   release allowed for the delivery of TGF-beta 1 to stimulate PE25 cells
   and for the delivery of fluorescently labeled Annexin V to assay
   apoptotic 3T3 fibroblasts during culture. By incorporating these
   photoresponsive protein delivery depots into cell culture, new types of
   experiments are now possible to test hypotheses about how individual or
   multiple soluble factors might affect cell function when presented in a
   uniform, temporally varying, or gradient manner. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the steady-state operation of phase-shift modulated
   dual-bridge series resonant converter (DBSRC) intended for dc/dc power
   bidirectional control over a wide range of input and output voltages.
   The analysis, developed here for the most general case of three
   independent phase-shift control angles, demonstrates the existence of
   minimum current trajectories in the 3-D control space along which the
   DBSRC cell can deliver any admissible power level with minimum tank
   circulating current. At nonunity conversion ratios, minimum current
   operation prevents the DBSRC output bridge from experiencing severe
   hard-switching losses, substantially reducing the effort normally
   required by auxiliary zero-voltage switching assistance circuitry, and
   outperforming the efficiency of conventional one-angle modulation
   approaches especially at light load. The developed approach is validated
   via computer simulations and experimental tests on a 1-kW DBSRC
   prototype. Tests performed at a nonunity voltage conversion ratio
   indicate a marked light-load efficiency improvement with respect to the
   conventional one-angle modulation, confirming the importance of the
   minimum current operation when the converter is expected to operate with
   programmable output voltages or under wide input voltage variations.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a great deal of focus on the development
   of fast and efficient dc/dc converters in an effort to follow the
   envelope of communication signals for increasing the efficiency of RF
   power amplifiers by using techniques such as envelope tracking and
   envelope elimination and restoration. However, the bandwidth and slew
   rate required by modern communication signals are higher than the
   maximum ones achievable by switching dc/dc converters made for this
   purpose. The slew rate of these switching dc/dc converters can be
   improved by combining it with the use of a linear stage, thus
   establishing a trade-off between slew rate and overall efficiency. This
   paper presents a simple way of combining the use of both a switching
   dc/dc converter, the multiple input buck converter, and a linear stage
   to obtain slew rates above 100 V/mu s, with a moderate decrease in the
   overall efficiency {[}81\% efficiency tracking the envelope of an
   enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE) standard signal]. Finally,
   a prototype of the complete system (including the digital control for
   both stages) is presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the existing approaches for combining models representing a
   single real-world phenomenon into a multi-model ensemble combine the
   models a posteriori. Alternatively, in our method the models are coupled
   into a supermodel and continuously communicate during learning and
   prediction. The method learns a set of coupling coefficients from short
   past data in order to unite the different strengths of the models into a
   better representation of the observed phenomenon. The method is examined
   using the Lorenz oscillator, which is altered by introducing parameter
   and structural differences for creating imperfect models. The short past
   data is obtained by the standard oscillator, and different weight is
   assigned to each sample of the past data. The coupling coefficients are
   learned by using a quasi-Newton method and an evolutionary algorithm. We
   also introduce a way for reducing the supermodel, which is particularly
   useful for models of high complexity. The results reveal that the
   proposed supermodel gives a very good representation of the truth even
   for substantially imperfect models and short past data, which suggests
   that the super-modeling is promising in modeling real-world phenomena.

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Providing top-down constraints on emissions is an important application
   of model-based analysis of remote-sensing observations of chemically
   reactive species, yet the degree to which column concentrations are
   governed by local vs distant sources within models themselves has yet to
   be fully characterized. We use a chemical transport model and its
   adjoint to quantify source contributions to weekly column concentrations
   of ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and formaldehyde. This
   efficient approach for quantifying the spatial extent of source
   influences is validated and then applied to an array of sites and
   seasons. Overall, we find instances for each species where emissions
   from at least 500 km away must be taken into account to retrieve 90\% of
   the total column influence. This demonstrates that the common practice
   of assuming a local relationship between satellite observations and
   emissions in top-down constraints could lead to considerable biases, an
   issue that will be exacerbated as the resolution of models and
   observations are refined in coming years. Citation: Turner, A. J., D. K.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate how observations from Sun-synchronous and
   quasi-Sun-synchronous satellites can be analyzed to reveal the
   signatures of nonlinear interactions between tides and planetary waves
   in Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This is done by ordering
   data in longitude space, and demonstrating how peaks in the spectra of
   such data series can be identified with specific waves or combinations
   of waves. We use as an example the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW)
   oscillations in temperature observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)
   instrument on the Aura satellite and the Sounding of the Atmosphere
   using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) on the TIMED satellite. We
   show that the QTDW not only produces secondary waves due to nonlinear
   interactions with the migrating (Sun-synchronous) diurnal and
   semidiurnal tides, but that secondary waves are also produced by
   nonmigrating tide-QTDW interactions. Moreover, these latter secondary
   waves are of similar amplitude to the resident tides and the QTDW, and
   serve an important role in defining longitude structures due to the
   presence of these waves.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron
   energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) experiments were performed to

   lying structure where both the alcohol and phenyl ring are close to the
   surface. This structure decomposes through a benzaldehyde intermediate
   and undergoes decarbonylation to produce benzene and carbon monoxide. At
   high coverage, benzyl alcohol adopts an upright structure where only the
   alcohol function is bound to the surface and the phenyl ring extends
   into vacuum. The orientation of this structure is correlated with
   deoxygenation to produce toluene and water. These results have important

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6, 2}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{We characterize the distributions of size and duration of avalanches
   propagating in complex networks. By an avalanche we mean the sequence of
   events initiated by the externally stimulated excitation of a network
   node, which may, with some probability, then stimulate subsequent
   excitations of the nodes to which it is connected, resulting in a
   cascade of excitations. This type of process is relevant to a wide
   variety of situations, including neuroscience, cascading failures on
   electrical power grids, and epidemiology. We find that the statistics of
   avalanches can be characterized in terms of the largest eigenvalue and
   corresponding eigenvector of an appropriate adjacency matrix that
   encodes the structure of the network. By using mean-field analyses,
   previous studies of avalanches in networks have not considered the
   effect of network structure on the distribution of size and duration of
   avalanches. Our results apply to individual networks (rather than
   network ensembles) and provide expressions for the distributions of size
   and duration of avalanches starting at particular nodes in the network.
   These findings might find application in the analysis of branching
   processes in networks, such as cascading power grid failures and
   critical brain dynamics. In particular, our results show that some
   experimental signatures of critical brain dynamics (i.e., power-law
   distributions of size and duration of neuronal avalanches) are robust to
   complex underlying network topologies.}},

Title = {{Simulations of the equatorial thermosphere anomaly: Physical mechanisms
   for crest formation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Several mechanisms including heat transport due to zonal winds, chemical
   heating and field-aligned ion drag have been proposed to explain the
   formation of the Equatorial Thermosphere Anomaly (ETA), but the cause of
   the ETA crests in thermosphere temperature is still a mystery. Our
   companion study (Lei et al., 2012) has revealed that the field-aligned
   ion drag mainly contributes to the ETA trough, but has little effect on
   the ETA crests. In this study, the mechanisms of heat transport
   associated with zonal winds and chemical heating due to recombination
   are examined to assess their contributions to the production of the ETA
   crests on the basis of National Center for Atmospheric Research
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model
   (NCAR-TIEGCM) simulations. Our sensitivity simulations demonstrate that
   neither heat transport due to zonal winds nor chemical heating is able
   to explain the formation of the ETA crests. Instead, we found that the
   formation of the ETA crests is attributed to plasma-neutral heating
   which has two peaks in the topside ionosphere aside the magnetic
   equator. These two peaks, which are largely controlled by the magnetic
   field, are the results of energy transfer from thermal electrons and
   ions to the neutrals through collisions due to their temperature
   differences, albeit the ultimate source of this heating is solar
   radiation which produces photoelectrons that mainly depend on solar
   zenith angle. The TIEGCM simulations show that the crests of the ETA
   always locate poleward by 10 degrees-15 degrees with respect to those of
   the Equatorial Ionosphere Anomaly (EIA), although the trough location of
   the ETA resembles that of the EIA. The location of the ETA crests is
   associated with the two-hump structure in plasma-neutral collision
   heating which is small inside the EIA region and larger at the poleward
   edge of this region.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an injectable foam suspension containing
   self-assembling, lipid-based microparticles encapsulating a core of pure
   oxygen gas for intravenous injection. Prototype suspensions were
   manufactured to contain between 50 and 90 ml of oxygen gas per deciliter
   of suspension. Particle size was polydisperse, with a mean particle
   diameter between 2 and 4 mu m. When mixed with human blood ex vivo,
   oxygen transfer from 70 volume \% microparticles was complete within 4
   s. When the microparticles were infused by intravenous injection into
   hypoxemic rabbits, arterial saturations increased within seconds to
   near-normal levels; this was followed by a decrease in oxygen tensions
   after stopping the infusions. The particles were also infused into
   rabbits undergoing 15 min of complete tracheal occlusion. Oxygen
   microparticles significantly decreased the degree of hypoxemia in these
   rabbits, and the incidence of cardiac arrest and organ injury was
   reduced compared to controls. The ability to administer oxygen and other
   gases directly to the bloodstream may represent a technique for
   short-term rescue of profoundly hypoxemic patients, to selectively
   augment oxygen delivery to at-risk organs, or for novel diagnostic
   techniques. Furthermore, the ability to titrate gas infusions rapidly
   may minimize oxygen-related toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a directed genome-engineering approach that combines
   genome-wide methods for mapping genes to traits {[}Warner JR, Reeder PJ,
   Karimpour-Fard A, Woodruff LBA, Gill RT (2010) Nat Biotechnol 28:
   856-862] with strategies for rapidly creating combinatorial ribosomal
   binding site (RBS) mutation libraries containing billions of targeted
   modifications {[}Wang HH, et al. (2009) Nature 460: 894-898]. This
   approach should prove broadly applicable to various efforts focused on
   improving production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, among
   other products. We used barcoded promoter mutation libraries to map the
   effect of increased or decreased expression of nearly every gene in
   Escherichia coli onto growth in several model environments (cellulosic
   hydrolysate, low pH, and high acetate). Based on these data, we created
   and evaluated RBS mutant libraries (containing greater than 100,000,000
   targeted mutations), targeting the genes identified to most affect
   growth. On laboratory timescales, we successfully identified a broad
   range of mutations (>25 growth-enhancing mutations confirmed), which
   improved growth rate 10-200\% for several different conditions. Although
   successful, our efforts to identify superior combinations of
   growth-enhancing genes emphasized the importance of epistatic
   interactions among the targeted genes (synergistic, antagonistic) for
   taking full advantage of this approach to directed genome engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the anisotropy parameter v(2) of identified hadrons
   (pions, kaons, and protons) as a function of centrality, transverse
   momentum p(T), and transverse kinetic energy KET at midrapidity
   (vertical bar eta vertical bar < 0.35) in Au + Au collisions at root s(N
   N) = 200 GeV are presented. Pions and protons are identified up to p(T)
   = 6 GeV/c, and kaons up to p(T) = 4 GeV/c, by combining information from
   time-of-flight and aerogel Cerenkov detectors in the PHENIX Experiment.
   The scaling of v(2) with the number of valence quarks (n(q)) has been
   studied in different centrality bins as a function of transverse
   momentum and transverse kinetic energy. A deviation from previously
   observed quark-number scaling is observed at large values of KET/n(q) in
   noncentral Au + Au collisions (20-60\%), but this scaling remains valid
   in central collisions (0-10\%).}},

   energy dissipation rate are examined in turbulent channel flow using
   very high-resolution direct numerical simulations at Reynolds numbers
   Re-tau = 180, 381 and 590. For sufficiently large Re-tau, the
   dissipation-scale distributions and energy dissipation moments in the
   channel bulk flow agree with those in homogeneous isotropic turbulence,
   including only a weak Reynolds-number dependence of both the finest and
   largest scales. Systematic, but Re-tau-independent, variations in the
   distributions and moments arise as the wall is approached for y(+) less
   than or similar to 100. In the range 100 < y(+) < 200, there are
   substantial differences in the moments between the lowest and the two
   larger values of Re-tau. This is most likely caused by coherent vortices
   from the near-wall region, which fill the whole channel for low Re-tau.}},

Title = {{Distribution, variability and sources of tropospheric ozone over south
   China in spring: Intensive ozonesonde measurements at five locations and
   modeling analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{We examine the characteristics of the spatial distribution and
   variability of tropospheric ozone (O-3) by analysis of 93 ozonesonde
   profiles obtained at five stations over south China (18-30 degrees N)
   during a field campaign in April-May 2004. We use a global 3-D chemical
   transport model (GEOS-Chem) to interpret these characteristics and to
   quantify the sources of tropospheric O-3 over south China during this
   period. The observed tropospheric O-3 mixing ratios showed strong
   spatiotemporal variability due to a complex interplay of various
   dynamical and chemical processes. A prominent feature in the upper and
   middle troposphere (UT/MT) was the frequent occurrence of high O-3
   mixing ratios shown as tongues extending down from the lower
   stratosphere or as isolated layers at all stations. The model largely
   captured the observed pattern of day-to-day variability in tropospheric
   O-3 mixing ratios at all stations, but often underestimated those
   tongues or isolated layers of O-3 enhancements observed in the UT/MT,
   especially at low-latitude stations. We found that tropospheric O-3
   along the southeast China coast was mainly produced within Asia.
   Lightning NOx emissions (over South Asia and equatorial Africa) and/or
   stratospheric influences were responsible for major events of high O-3
   observed in the UT/MT at all stations. Underestimated contributions of
   these sources likely led to the model's underestimate in the
   low-latitude UT/MT O-3. This study emphasizes the need for improved
   understanding of lightning NOx emissions and stratospheric influences
   over the Eurasian and African continents and for better representation
   of these processes in current global models.}},

   dielectrophoretic assembly yield of individual GaN nanowires on
   microfabricated structures by as much as 67\%. With a titanium dioxide
   coating, individual nanowires were placed across suspended electrode
   pairs in 46\% of tests (147 out of 320 total), versus 28\% of tests (88
   out of 320 total tests) that used uncoated GaN NWs. An additional result
   from these tests was that suspending the electrodes 2: 75 mu m above the
   substrate corresponded with up to 15.8\% improvement in overall assembly
   yield over that of electrodes fabricated directly on the substrate.}},

Title = {{Superposed epoch analyses of thermospheric response to CIRs: Solar cycle
   and seasonal dependencies}},

Abstract = {{Thermospheric response to Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) has been
   studied previously; however, its solar cycle and seasonal effects have
   not been fully investigated. Thermospheric mass density at 400 km
   measured by the CHAMP satellite during 2001-2008 and Sigma O/N2 from the
   TIMED/GUVI instrument covering a period from 2002 to 2008 are used to
   investigate the solar cycle and seasonal dependencies of the
   thermospheric response to CIRs. Our results reveal: (1) solar minimum
   CIRs compared to solar maximum counterparts have larger solar wind
   speeds before and after the stream interface. However, solar wind
   dynamic pressure and merging electric field are slightly larger at solar
   maximum than solar minimum. (2) CIR-induced variations of Sigma O/N2 are
   characterized by high latitude depression and low latitude enhancement,
   a distinction from global enhancement of neutral density at a fixed
   altitude. These relative thermospheric changes are dependent on solar
   cycle, with a more pronounced increase in neutral density at all
   latitudes and a stronger decrease in Sigma O/N2 at high latitude at
   solar minimum than at solar maximum. (3) A seasonal asymmetry is
   presented in the relative deviations of thermospheric mass density and
   composition. On the dayside, the peak increases of neutral density at
   high latitudes on average are similar to 40\% in the summer hemisphere
   and similar to 26\% in the winter hemisphere. Nighttime neutral density
   changes are more remarkable than that in the same latitudinal bands of
   daytime and have the same seasonal preference of enhancement as the
   dayside. At the daytime, Sigma O/N2 at high latitudes suffers more
   reduction in the summer hemisphere than in the winter hemisphere. At
   middle latitudes, Sigma O/N2 reduces in the winter hemisphere;
   nevertheless, it increases slightly in the summer hemisphere.}},

Abstract = {{Using fibrinogen (Fg) protein as a probe molecule, mapping using
   accumulated probe trajectories (MAPT) is performed on nanostructured
   melt-drawn high-density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) films composed of
   well-oriented crystalline patches separated by amorphous regions. The
   spatially grouped molecular trajectories allow for identification of
   regions with distinct surface properties (i.e., crystalline vs.
   amorphous) while simultaneously determining the characteristic dynamic
   protein behavior within those regions. In the presence of solution with
   a sufficiently high Fg concentration, discrete patches of a dense,
   ordered protein layer form (presumably on crystalline HDPE regions),
   leading to a dramatic rise in the surface residence time (by more than
   two orders of magnitude) of molecules incorporated into the film. Within
   this ordered Fg layer, individual molecules exhibit slow anisotropic
   lateral diffusion; the mobility is restricted by the nanostructure
   boundaries of the underlying HDPE. On HDPE films at low Fg surface
   coverage, or on films that have been rendered hydrophilic with Ar
   plasma, short surface residence times and fast, isotropic diffusion are
   observed. These results demonstrate the ability of spatially resolved
   single-molecule tracking to provide mechanistic information about
   biomolecule-surface interactions in a highly heterogeneous environment.}},

Abstract = {{Using the data from the Analyzer of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms
   (ASPERA-3) experiment on board Mars Express and hybrid simulations, we
   have investigated the entry of protons into the Martian induced
   magnetosphere. We discuss one orbit on the dayside with observations of
   significant proton fluxes at altitudes down to 260 km on 27 February
   2004. The protons observed below the induced magnetosphere boundary at
   an altitude of less than 700 km have energies of a few keV, travel
   downward, and precipitate onto the atmosphere. The measured energy flux
   and particle flux are 10(8)-10(9) eV cm(-2) s(-1) and 10(5)-10(6) H+
   cm(-2) s(-1), respectively. The proton precipitation occurs because the
   Martian magnetosheath is small with respect to the heated proton
   gyroradius in the subsolar region. The data suggest that the
   precipitation is not permanent but may occur when there are transient
   increases in the magnetosheath proton temperature. The higher-energy
   protons penetrate deeper because of their larger gyroradii. The proton
   entry into the induced magnetosphere is simulated using a hybrid code. A
   simulation using a fast solar wind as input can reproduce the high
   energies of the observed precipitating protons. The model shows that the
   precipitating protons originate from both the solar wind and the
   planetary exosphere. The precipitation extends over a few thousand
   kilometers along the orbit of the spacecraft. The proton precipitation
   does not necessarily correlate with the crustal magnetic anomalies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4389-4403}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{An analysis of annual hydroclimatic variability in the Upper Colorado
   River basin (UCRB) for the period of 1906-2006 was performed to
   understand the dominant modes of multidecadal variability. First,
   wavelet-based spectral analysis was employed for streamflow at Lees
   Ferry, Arizona (aggregate location for UCRB flow), which identified two
   significant modes: a ``low frequency{''} (similar to 64-yr period) mode
   and a strong ``decadal{''} (similar to 15-yr period) component active
   only in recent decades. Subsequent investigation of temperature and
   precipitation data for the UCRB indicated that the low-frequency
   variability is associated with temperature via modulation of runoff
   efficiency while the decadal is strongly tied to moisture delivery.
   Simple hydrology and climate model experiments are also provided to
   support the aforementioned findings.
   Correlation of UCRB precipitation with global sea surface temperature
   (SST) anomalies showed a strong link with the equatorial and northern
   Pacific during periods of heightened variability of the decadal mode.
   The correlation of UCRB temperature with global SST anomalies showed
   strongest values in the Atlantic consistent with the Atlantic
   rnultidecadal oscillation mode. Wavelet spectral analysis of
   paleo-reconstructed streamflow at Lees Ferry shows both the
   low-frequency and decadal flow variability features. Furthermore, the
   strength of the decadal mode is modulated at an similar to 75-yr time
   scale, and these are consistent with epochal variations of overall
   streamflow variance.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments measured the effects of five alkylphenol
   polyethoxylate nonionic surfactants on the microbial degradation of
   glucose and pentachlorophenol (PCP) by a pure culture of Sphingomonas
   chlorophenolicum RA2 (RA2) that was unable to biodegrade the
   surfactants. The surfactants with mid-range hydrophile-lipophile balance
   (HLB) values of 13.5-15 were the most biocompatible with substrate
   degradation. Monomers of the surfactant with the lowest HLB value of
   12.3 inhibited RA2 growth on both glucose and PCP. The surfactant with
   the highest HLB of 17.9 was only inhibitory to glucose biodegradation at
   3000 mg/L, a concentration well above its CMC. The surfactants were more
   inhibitory of RA2 biodegradation of PCP compared to glucose, which is
   likely due to interactions with membrane-associated PCP-degrading
   enzymes rather than bioavailability limitations. These results may prove
   helpful in selecting surfactants for use enhancing surfactant-amended
   remedial applications involving biodegradation or oil dispersion. (C)

Abstract = {{Access to safe drinking water is one of the first priorities following a
   disaster. However, providing drinking water to the affected population
   (AP) is challenging due to severe contamination and lack of access to
   infrastructure. An onsite treatment system for the AP is a more
   sustainable solution than transporting bottled water. Emergency water
   technologies (WTs) that are modular, mobile or portable are suitable for
   emergency relief. This paper reviews WTs including membrane technologies
   that are suitable for use in emergencies. Physical, chemical, thermal-
   and light-based treatment methods, and membrane technologies driven by
   different driving forces such as pressure, temperature and osmotic
   gradients are reviewed. Each WT is evaluated by ten mutually independent
   criteria: costs, ease of deployrnent, ease of use, maintenance,
   performance, potential acceptance, energy requirements, supply chain
   requirements, throughput and environmental impact. A scoring system
   based on these criteria is presented. A methodology for emergency WT
   selection based on compensatory multi-criteria analysis is developed and
   discussed. Finally, critical research needs are identified. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy
   individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such
   as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained,
   although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure
   have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of
   human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has
   analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant
   body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each
   habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects,
   with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The
   project encountered an estimated 81-99\% of the genera, enzyme families
   and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome.
   Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals
   despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background
   proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and
   microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range
   of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial
   communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of
   the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human
   microbiome.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome)
   exist throughout the human body, with fundamental roles in human health
   and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Human
   Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale
   framework to develop metagenomic protocols, resulting in a broad range
   of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods
   for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of
   high-throughput metagenomic data available to the scientific community.
   Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults
   sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have generated
   5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal RNA genes and over
   3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far. In parallel, approximately
   800 reference strains isolated from the human body have been sequenced.
   Collectively, these data represent the largest resource describing the
   abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a
   framework for current and future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The strong magnetic field B-y component (in GSM coordinates) has been
   increasingly noticed to play an important role in the dynamics of tail
   current sheet (CS). The distribution profile of strong B-y components in
   the tail CS (i.e., those with guide field), however, is not well known.
   In the present work, by using the simultaneous multipoint observations
   of Cluster satellites, the profile of a strong B-y component in tail
   current sheets is explored, through detailed case studies, as well as in
   a statistical study. It is discovered that around the midnight meridian,
   the strength of the strong B-y component, i.e., |B-y|, is basically
   enhanced at the center of the CS relative to that in the CS boundaries
   and lobes and forms a north-south symmetric distribution about the
   center of CS. Generally, however, for strong guide field cases in the
   non-midnight meridian, the profile of B-y strength basically becomes
   north-south asymmetric, the strength of the B-y component in the
   northern side of the CS is found to be either stronger or weaker than
   that in the counterpart southern side. By considering the modulation of
   the tail flaring magnetic field with magnetic local time, we propose an
   interpretation to account for the variation of the B-y-profile, which is
   supported by the statistical survey. These results offer an observation
   basis for further studies.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate facile optical manipulation of shape of birefringent
   colloidal microparticles made from liquid crystal elastomers. Using soft
   lithography and polymerization, we fabricate elastomeric microcylinders
   with weakly undulating director oriented on average along their long
   axes. These particles are infiltrated with gold nanospheres acting as
   heat transducers that allow for an efficient localized transfer of heat
   from a focused infrared laser beam to a submicrometer region within a
   microparticle. Photothermal control of ordering in the liquid crystal
   elastomer using scanned beams allows for a robust control of colloidal
   particles, enabling both reversible and irreversible changes of shape.
   Possible applications include optomechanics, microfluidics, and
   reconfigurable colloidal composites with shape-dependent self-assembly.

Abstract = {{The benthic, mat-forming diatom Didymosphenia geminata has the unique
   ability to produce large amounts of algal biomass under oligotrophic
   conditions in cold, fast flowing streams and rivers. This presents an
   ecological paradox that challenges our current understanding of stream
   ecosystem dynamics. Our understanding of the drivers of D. geminata
   ecology is still limited. Here we present a conceptual model for the
   blooming behavior and persistence of this species to advance scientific
   understanding of strategies for life in fast flowing oligotrophic waters
   and support the design of future research and mitigation measures for
   nuisance algal blooms. The conceptual model is based on a synthesis of
   data and ideas from a range of disciplines including hydrology,
   geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. The conceptual model
   highlights the role of water chemistry, river morphology, and flow
   thresholds in defining the habitat window for D. geminata. We propose
   that bed disturbance is a primary control on accumulation and
   persistence of D. geminata and that the removal threshold can be
   determined by synthesizing site-specific information on hydrology and
   geomorphology. Further, we propose that a key to understanding the
   didymo paradox is the separation of cellular reproduction and mat
   morphology with specific controls acting in respect of the different
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{High-harmonic generation (HHG) traditionally combines similar to 100
   near-infrared laser photons to generate bright, phase-matched, extreme
   ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms adds constructively.
   Here, we show that by guiding a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a
   high-pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can be generated, up to orders
   greater than 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that spans the
   entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to more than 1.6
   kilo-electron volts, allowing, in principle, the generation of pulses as
   short as 2.5 attoseconds. The multiatmosphere gas pressures required for
   bright, phase-matched emission also support laser beam self-confinement,
   further enhancing the x-ray yield. Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high
   spatial coherence, even though at high gas density the recolliding
   electrons responsible for HHG encounter other atoms during the emission
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Topological defect lines are ubiquitous and important in a wide variety
   of fascinating phenomena and theories in many fields ranging from
   materials science to early-universe cosmology, and to engineering of
   laser beams. However, they are typically hard to control in a reliable
   manner. Here we describe facile erasable ``optical drawing'' of
   self-assembled defect clusters in liquid crystals. These quadrupolar
   defect clusters, stabilized by the medium's chirality and the tendency
   to form twisted configurations, are shaped into arbitrary
   two-dimensional patterns, including reconfigurable phase gratings
   capable of generating and controlling optical phase singularities in
   laser beams. Our findings bridge the studies of defects in condensed
   matter physics and optics and may enable applications in data storage,
   singular optics, displays, electro-optic devices, diffraction gratings,
   as well as in both optically- and electrically-addressed pixel-free
   spatial light modulators.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of Pt-n (n <= 37) clusters on the defect-free TiO2 anatase (101)
   surface has been studied using ab initio pseudopotential calculations
   based on density functional theory. Several initial configurations for
   clusters of 1, 2, 7, 10, and 37 atoms were relaxed to determine the most
   stable structures. All final optimized structures are three dimensional,
   suggesting that formation of island-like particles is favored over
   planar monolayers, as verified experimentally using Pt atomic layer
   deposition and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.
   Diffusion barriers of a single Pt adatom on TiO2 were calculated to
   understand the mobility of Pt atoms on the TiO2 surface. Activation
   barriers of 0.86 and 1.41 eV were calculated for diffusion along the
   {[}010] and {[}10 (1) over bar] directions, respectively, indicating
   that Pt atoms are relatively mobile along the {[}010] direction at
   moderate temperatures. The energy barriers for a Pt atom to escape from
   an 11- and a 37-atom Pt cluster on (101) anatase are predicted to be
   1.38 and 2.12 eV, suggesting that particle coarsening occurs by Ostwald
   ripening and that Ostwald ripening of deposited Pt particles is limited
   by atom detachment from particles as small as several tens of atoms.}},

Abstract = {{With the use of single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence
   microscopy (TIRFM), the dynamics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human
   fibrinogen (Fg) at low concentrations were observed at the solid-aqueous
   interface as a function of temperature on hydrophobic trimethylsilane
   (TMS) and hydrophilic fused silica (FS) surfaces. Multiple dynamic modes
   and populations were observed and characterized by their surface
   residence times and squared-displacement distributions (surface
   diffusion). Characteristic desorption and diffusion rates for each
   population/mode were generally found to increase with temperature, and
   apparent activation energies were determined from Arrhenius analyses.
   The apparent activation energies of desorption and diffusion were
   typically higher on FS than on TMS surfaces, suggesting that protein
   desorption and mobility were hindered on hydrophilic surfaces due to
   favorable protein-surface and solvent-surface interactions. The
   diffusion of BSA on TMS appeared to be activationless for several
   populations, whereas diffusion on FS always exhibited an apparent
   activation energy. All activation energies were small in absolute terms
   (generally only a few k(B)T), suggesting that most adsorbed protein
   molecules are weakly bound and move and desorb readily under ambient
   conditions.}},

   Oxidation}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6222-6227}},

Abstract = {{Carbamazepine is one of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds in
   wastewater effluents due to its resistance to biodegradation-based
   conventional treatment. Advanced oxidation can efficiently degrade
   carbamazepine, but the toxicity and persistence of the oxidation
   products may be more relevant than the parent. This study sets out to
   determine whether the products of advanced oxidation of carbamazepine
   can be biotransformed and ultimately mineralized by developing a novel
   methodology to assess these sequential treatment processes. The
   methodology traces the transformation products of the C-14-labeled
   carbamazepine during UV/hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation and
   subsequent biotransformation by mixed, undefined cultures using liquid
   scintillation counting and liquid chromatography with radioactivity,
   mass spectrometry, and UV detectors. The results show that the oxidation
   byproducts of carbamazepine containing a hydroxyl or carbonyl group can
   be fully mineralized by a mixed bacterial inoculum. A tertiary treatment
   approach that includes oxidation and biotransformation has the potential
   to synergistically mineralize persistent pharmaceutical compounds in
   wastewater treatment plant effluents. The methodology developed for this
   study can be applied to assess the mineralization potential of other
   persistent organic contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Solder self-alignment is an important phenomenon enabling cost-effective
   optoelectronics assembly. In this study, the wetting of Sn-rich solder
   to under bump metallization (UBM) pads is identified as a critical
   factor affecting self-alignment accuracy. Incomplete wetting of solder
   to the metallization pads is responsible for chip-to-substrate
   misalignment larger than 1 mu m, while fabrication tolerances, such as
   solder volume variation and pad diameter deviation, only account for
   misalignments in the submicron range. To quantitatively investigate the
   effect of incomplete wetting on self-alignment accuracy, a
   three-dimensional (3D) model based on a force optimization method was
   developed. With the input parameters of incomplete solder metallurgical
   wetting area, position and diameter of metallization pad, volume of
   individual solder bumps, coefficient of solder surface tension, mass of
   the chip, external forces acting on the chip, and initial pick-and-place
   position of the chip before assembly, the model predicts the assembled
   position of the chip in terms of the misalignments in the X-Y plane and
   the rotation angle along the Z axis. The model further confirmed that
   incomplete wetting of solder is the most critical modulator among the
   undesirable factors affecting solder self-alignment accuracy. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The differential Young-Laplace equations are solved numerically with an
   iterative solution using the method of steepest descent to determine the
   shape of a drop trapped under gravity in an axisymmetric ring
   constriction. Prior work for non-wetting drops with a contact angle of
   pi is extended to arbitrary values of the contact angle at the
   three-phase contact lines. The critical Bond number, representing a
   dimensionless ratio of gravitational and interfacial forces, and
   separating static trapping at lower Bond numbers from dynamic squeezing
   at higher Bond numbers, decreases with decreasing contact angle,
   indicating that drop squeezing occurs more easily at smaller contact
   angle. Indeed, a critical contact angle, which depends only on the
   drop-to-hole and ring-cross-section-to-hole size ratios, is found, below
   which all drops squeeze through the hole. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Pages = {{99-108}},

Abstract = {{This research study examines the peak energy reduction potential and
   avoided cost from using an automatic thermostat set point control
   strategy in a residential home which responds to the price variation in
   a time-of-use tariff. Twelve benchmark homes, composed of three
   different home sizes in four different geographical locations, are each
   evaluated under twelve unique control scenarios with systematically
   varied peak period length, rate ratio, and set point offset. All
   time-of-use tariffs are designed to be cost neutral with the existing
   flat rate tariff assuming the same base case operating scenario.
   Historical real time prices for 2008 and regional specific construction
   features were used. The total savings potential as well as the
   additional benefit from increased set point offsets were found to be
   highly dependent on the climate. For a particular location, savings on a
   percentage basis were very consistent across home sizes for similar
   control strategies, meaning the same tariff may be applied to all
   residential customers without disadvantaging customers in smaller homes.
   Finally, the utility cost savings varied from \$225 to \$9 per home with
   many time-of-use tariffs resulting in more money given to the homeowner
   than actually saved by the utility. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to produce Pd/Al2O3 catalysts
   using sequential exposures of Pd(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate and
   formalin at 200 degrees C in a fluidized bed reactor. The ALD-prepared
   Pd/alumina catalysts were characterized by various methods including
   hydrogen chemisorption, XPS, and TEM, and compared with a commercially
   available 1 wt\% Pd/alumina catalyst, which was also characterized. The
   content of Pd on alumina support and the size of Pd nanoparticles can be
   controlled by the number of ALD-coating cycles and the dose time of the
   Pd precursor. One layer of organic component from the Pd precursor
   remained on the Pd particle surface. The ALD 0.9 wt\% Pd/alumina had
   greater active metal surface area and percent metal dispersion than the
   commercial 1 wt\% Pd/alumina catalyst. The ALD and commercial catalysts
   were subjected to catalytic testing to determine their relative
   activities for glucose oxidation to gluconic acid in aqueous solution.
   The ALD 0.9 wt\% Pd/alumina catalyst had comparable activity as compared

   published March 14, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00938.2011.-Motoneurons receive
   synaptic inputs from tens of thousands of connections that cause
   membrane potential to fluctuate continuously (synaptic noise), which
   introduces variability in discharge times of action potentials. We
   hypothesized that the influence of synaptic noise on force steadiness
   during voluntary contractions is limited to low muscle forces. The
   hypothesis was examined with an analytical description of transduction
   of motor unit spike trains into muscle force, a computational model of
   motor unit recruitment and rate coding, and experimental analysis of
   interspike interval variability during steady contractions with the
   abductor digiti minimi muscle. Simulations varied contraction force,
   level of synaptic noise, size of motor unit population, recruitment
   range, twitch contraction times, and level of motor unit short-term
   synchronization. Consistent with the analytical derivations, simulations
   and experimental data showed that force variability at target forces
   above a threshold was primarily due to low-frequency oscillations in
   neural drive, whereas the influence of synaptic noise was almost
   completely attenuated by two low-pass filters, one related to
   convolution of motoneuron spike trains with motor unit twitches
   (temporal summation) and the other attributable to summation of single
   motor unit forces (spatial summation). The threshold force above which
   synaptic noise ceased to influence force steadiness depended on
   recruitment range, size of motor unit population, and muscle contractile
   properties. This threshold was low (<10\% of maximal force) for typical
   values of these parameters. Results indicate that motor unit recruitment
   and muscle properties of a typical muscle are tuned to limit the
   influence of synaptic noise on force steadiness to low forces and that
   the inability to produce a constant force during stronger contractions
   is mainly attributable to the common low-frequency oscillations in
   motoneuron discharge rates.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical stimulation is essential for chondrocyte metabolism and
   cartilage matrix deposition. Traditional methods for evaluating
   developing tissue in vitro are destructive, time consuming, and
   expensive. Nondestructive evaluation of engineered tissue is promising
   for the development of replacement tissues. Here we present a novel
   instrumented bioreactor for dynamic mechanical stimulation and
   nondestructive evaluation of tissue mechanical properties and
   extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The bioreactor is instrumented with
   a video microscope and load cells in each well to measure tissue
   stiffness and an ultrasonic transducer for evaluating ECM content.
   Chondrocyte-laden hydrogel constructs were placed in the bioreactor and
   subjected to dynamic intermittent compression at 1 Hz and 10\% strain
   for 1 h, twice per day for 7 days. Compressive modulus of the
   constructs, measured online in the bioreactor and offline on a
   mechanical testing machine, did not significantly change over time.
   Deposition of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) increased significantly
   after 7 days, independent of loading. Furthermore, the relative
   reflection amplitude of the loaded constructs decreased significantly
   after 7 days, consistent with an increase in sGAG content. This
   preliminary work with our novel bioreactor demonstrates its capabilities
   for dynamic culture and nondestructive evaluation. {[}DOI:

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal distribution of snow and its response to
   changes in climate were investigated from 1979 to 2005 in eastern Tibet.
   The Lhasa River basin, Niyang River basin and Changdu region cover an
   area of approximately 15 x 10(4) km(2) and ranges in elevation from 2000
   to more than 7000 m. This large area necessitates innovative procedures
   for estimating potential spatial and temporal changes in snow cover. For
   this analysis we used the microwave long-term snow cover dataset of
   China with a spatial resolution of 25 km and temporal resolution of 1
   day. After data validation between the microwave dataset and MODIS snow
   product, we defined two parameters for each pixel: (1) median date of
   the snow-free period (T-m) and (2) duration of the snow-free period
   (Delta T). After removing transient-snow dominated areas, we find that
   the duration of the snow-free period was inversely correlated with
   elevation (R = -0.651, p<0.001). TFPW-MK Trend-free pre-whitening
   Mann-Kendall) was then used to examine and highlight the trend of Delta
   T with time. At lower-elevation sites, the length of the snow-free
   season increased. In contrast, at higher-elevations, it decreased.
   Mann-Kendall tests on monthly air temperature and annual precipitation
   for the period 1979 to 2005 from seven climate stations in the region
   operated by the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System show a
   significant increase in annual precipitation and an increase in monthly
   air temperatures for the fall through spring months. Thus, the length of
   the snow covered season appears to be decreasing at lower elevation
   because of the increase in air temperatures. However, at higher
   elevations the increase in precipitation appears to compensate for the
   increase in air temperature such that the snow-free period has
   decreased. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of simply-fed four-arm Archimedean and equiangular
   spiral antennas operating in mode-2 (conical beam) and their suitability
   for pulsed communication applications are investigated. The
   frequency-domain transfer function of spiral antennas-based
   ultra-wideband (UWB) link is synthesized using complex far field
   information measured in a spherical near-field chamber from 2 to 12 GHz.
   The time-domain performance is obtained by post-processing
   frequency-domain data using the inverse fast Fourier transform. The
   synthesized approach is validated computationally and using direct link
   measurements. The quality of radiated pulses is evaluated in terms of
   the fidelity factor over the full field of view. The study demonstrates
   that the mode-2 spirals exhibit good time-and frequency-domain
   performance over a multioctave bandwidth which allows multiple
   communication services including UWB and time-frequency RF surveillance
   applications to be integrated into a single aperture system.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate electromagnetic and thermal analysis is essential for designing
   wideband radiometer calibration targets as well as for understanding the
   electromagnetic wave interaction with these highly absorbing structures.
   To serve this purpose, a three dimensional dispersive finite difference
   time domain (FDTD) engine has been developed. We present the various
   aspects associated with this FDTD formulation, including modeling of
   dispersive lossy media using piecewise linear recursive convolution
   (PLRC) and application of uniaxial perfectly matched layer (UPML)
   absorbing boundary condition and symmetry/periodic boundary conditions
   to provide high accuracy using moderate computational resources. Time
   domain modeling of the dispersive radar absorbent material is performed
   by fitting the measured complex permittivity and permeability data to a
   series of Debye like terms using genetic algorithm (GA) optimization.
   The broadband reflectivity spectrum of the calibration target is
   obtained by transient plane wave excitation. The reflectivity spectra of
   pyramidal calibration targets in the frequency range {[}6, 200] GHz is
   obtained and compared to the geometrical optics limit and a finite
   element solution. The spectrum depends significantly on the height to
   base ratio and coating thicknesses of the absorbent material.}},

   linearization procedure is demonstrated with reduced complexity compared
   to standard digital predistortion. Experimental results on a 2.14-GHz
   81\% efficient 40-W peak power GaN PA illustrate the codesign method by
   achieving 52.5\% composite power-added efficiency with high linearity
   for a W-CDMA signal with a 23-MHz supply modulator bandwidth.}},

   purpose of this study was to record the discharge characteristics of
   tibialis anterior motor units over a range of target forces and to
   import these data, along with previously reported observations, into a
   computational model to compare experimental and simulated measures of
   torque variability during isometric contractions with the dorsiflexor
   muscles. The discharge characteristics of 44 motor units were quantified
   during brief isometric contractions at torques that ranged from
   recruitment threshold to an average of 22 +/- 14.4\% maximal voluntary
   contraction (MVC) torque above recruitment threshold. The minimal
   {[}range: 5.8-19.8 pulses per second ((p) under bar(p) under bars)] and
   peak (range: 8.6-37.5 pps) discharge rates of motor units were
   positively related to the recruitment threshold torque (R-2 >= 0.266; P
   < 0.001). The coefficient of variation for interspike interval at
   recruitment was positively associated with recruitment threshold torque
   (R-2 = 0.443; P < 0.001) and either decreased exponentially or remained
   constant as target torque increased above recruitment threshold torque.
   The variability in the simulated torque did not differ from the
   experimental values once the recruitment range was set to similar to
   85\% MVC torque, and the association between motor twitch contraction
   times and peak twitch torque was defined as a weak linear association
   (R-2 = 0.096; P < 0.001). These results indicate that the steadiness of
   isometric contractions performed with the dorsiflexor muscle depended
   more on the distributions of mechanical properties than discharge
   properties across the population of motor units in the tibialis
   anterior.}},

   603-615. DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00635.x Abstract: Public
   investment in urban stream restoration is growing, yet little has been
   done to quantify whether its benefits outweigh its cost. The most common
   drivers of urban stream projects are water quality improvement and
   infrastructure protection, although recreational and aesthetic benefits
   are often important community goals. We use standard economic methods to
   show that these contributions of restoration can be quantified and
   compared to costs. The approach is demonstrated with a case study in
   Baltimore, Maryland, a city with a legal mandate to reduce its pollutant
   load. Typical urban stream restoration costs of US\$500-1,200 per foot
   are larger than the cost of the least expensive alternatives for
   management of nitrogen loads from stormwater (here, detention ponds,
   equivalent to \$30-120 per foot of restored stream) and for protecting
   infrastructure (rip-rap armoring of streambanks, at \$0-120 per foot).
   However, the higher costs of stream restoration can in some cases be
   justified by its aesthetic and recreational benefits, valued using a
   contingent valuation survey at \$560-1,100 per foot. We do not intend to
   provide a definitive answer regarding the worth of stream restoration,
   but demonstrate that questions of worth can be asked and answered.
   Broader application of economic analysis would provide a defensible
   basis for understanding restoration benefits and for making restoration
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The bicontinuous cubic (Q) lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) phases formed
   by the phase-separation and self-organization of amphiphilic molecules
   in water are intriguing structures for a number of transport-related
   applications because they possess ordered, uniform, 3D-interconnected
   water channels on the size of single molecules. Polymeric materials
   formed from either the templated polymerization or cross-linking of
   conventional monomers around Q phases, or the direct polymerization or
   cross-linking of Q phases formed by reactive amphiphiles retain the
   desired LLC nanostructure but are more robust for true application
   development. The structures of Q LLC phases were only elucidated in the
   late 1980s, and the first successful preparation of polymers based on Q
   phases was reported soon after. However, the development and
   demonstration of these nanoporous polymers for material applications
   were not realized until the first decade of the twenty-first century.
   This focus review provides an overview of work in the area of Q LLC
   phase-based polymer materials, with a focus on the work of our research
   group and that of our collaborators on polymer networks prepared by the
   direct polymerization of reactive Q phases and their development as
   functional materials for several engineering applications. Polymer

   traditional SPA. After insertion into a channel, the device deploys a
   small camera module and LED lamp in vivo. An integrated, on-patient LCD
   provides the view of the surgical site. The design intent of the port
   camera is to enhance SPA by (a) reducing the size of the SPA port
   through the elimination of the dedicated laparoscope channel; (b)
   reducing equipment cost by integrating an inexpensive CMOS sensor and
   LED lamp at the port tip; (c) eliminating the need for an assistant who
   operates the laparoscope; and (d) mechanically coupling the camera, tool
   port, and on-patient LCD screen. The effectiveness of the device was
   evaluated by comparing the video performance with a leading industry
   laparoscope and by performing a user evaluation study and live porcine
   surgery with the device. Effectiveness of the device was mixed. Overall
   video system performance of the device is better than an industry
   standard high-definition laparoscope, implying that significant cost
   savings over a traditional system are possible. Participant study
   results suggest that simulated laparoscopic tasks are as efficient with
   the SPA Port Camera as they are with a typical SPA configuration.
   However, live surgery revealed several shortcomings of the SPA Port
   Camera.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to quantify the influence of amplitude
   cancellation on the accuracy of detecting the onset of muscle activity
   based on an analysis of simulated surface electromyographic (EMG)
   signals. EMG activity of a generic lower limb muscle was simulated
   during the stance phase of human gait. Surface EMG signals were
   generated with and without amplitude cancellation by summing simulated
   motor unit potentials either before (cancellation EMG) or after
   (no-cancellation EMG) the potentials had been rectified. The two sets of
   EMG signals were compared at forces of 30\% and 80\% of maximum
   voluntary contraction (MVC) and with various low-pass filter cut-off
   frequencies. Onset time was determined both visually and by an algorithm
   that identified when the mean amplitude of the signal within a sliding
   window exceeded a specified standard deviation (SD) above the baseline
   mean. Onset error was greater for the no-cancellation conditions when
   determined automatically and by visual inspection. However, the
   differences in onset error between the two cancellation conditions
   appear to be clinically insignificant. Therefore, amplitude cancellation
   does not appear to limit the ability to detect the onset of muscle
   activity from the surface EMG. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The common morphological metrics of size, shape, and enamel thickness of
   teeth are believed to reflect the functional requirements of a primate's
   diet. However, the mechanical and material properties of enamel also
   contribute to tooth function, yet are rarely studied. Substantial wear
   and tooth loss previously documented in Lemur catta at the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve suggests that their dental morphology, structure, and
   possibly their enamel are not adapted for their current fallback food
   (the mechanically challenging tamarind fruit). In this study, we
   investigate the nanomechanical properties, mineralization, and
   microstructure of the enamel of three sympatric lemur species to provide
   insight into their dietary functional adaptations. Mechanical properties
   measured by nanoindentation were compared to measurements of mineral
   content, prism orientation, prism size, and enamel thickness using
   electron microscopy. Mechanical properties of all species were similar
   near the enamel dentin junction and variations correlated with changes
   in microstructure (e.g., prism size) and mineral content. Severe wear
   and microcracking within L. catta's enamel were associated with up to a
   43\% reduction in nanomechanical properties in regions of cracking
   versus intact enamel. The mechanical and material properties of L.
   catta's enamel are similar to those of sympatric folivores and suggest
   that they are not uniquely mechanically adapted to consume the
   physically challenging tamarind fruit. An understanding of the material
   and mechanical properties of enamel is required to fully elucidate the
   functional and ecological adaptations of primate teeth. Am J Phys

Abstract = {{The blazarAO 0235+164 (z=0.94) has been one of the most active objects
   observed by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) since its launch in Summer
   2008. In addition to the continuous coverage by Fermi, contemporaneous
   observations were carried out from the radio to gamma-ray bands between
   2008 September and 2009 February. In this paper, we summarize the rich
   multi-wavelength data collected during the campaign (including F-GAMMA,
   GASP-WEBT, Kanata, OVRO, RXTE, SMARTS, Swift, and other instruments),
   examine the cross-correlation between the light curves measured in the
   different energy bands, and interpret the resulting spectral energy
   distributions in the context of well-known blazar emission models. We
   find that the gamma-ray activity is well correlated with a series of
   near-IR/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in the optical
   polarization degree. On the other hand, the X-ray light curve shows a
   distinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not
   match the extrapolation of the optical/UV synchrotron spectrum. We
   tentatively interpret this feature as the bulk Compton emission by cold
   electrons contained in the jet, which requires an accretion disk corona
   with an effective covering factor of 19\% at a distance of 100 R-g. We
   model the broadband spectra with a leptonic model with external
   radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dusty torus.}},

   Alternative Mechanisms for Sulfur Resistance}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigations of Ni-based catalysts for the steam reforming of
   hydrocarbons have indicated that the addition of a second metal can
   reduce the effects of sulfur poisoning. Two systems that have previously
   shown promise for such applications, NiW and NiRu, are considered here
   for the steam reforming of ethylene, a key component of biomass derived
   tars. Monometallic and bimetallic Al2O3-supported Ni and W catalysts
   were employed for ethylene steam reforming in the presence and absence
   of sulfur. The NiW catalysts were less active than Ni in the absence of
   sulfur, but were more active in the presence of 50 ppm H2S. The
   mechanism for the W-induced improvements in sulfur resistance appears to
   be different from that for Ru in NiRu. To probe reasons for the sulfur
   resistance of NiRu, the adsorption of S and C2H4 on several bimetallic
   NiRu alloy surfaces ranging from 11 to 33 \% Ru was studied using
   density functional theory (DFT). The DFT studies reveal that sulfur
   adsorption is generally favored on hollow sites containing Ru. Ethylene
   preferentially adsorbs atop the Ru atom in all the NiRu (111) alloys
   investigated. By comparing trends across the various bimetallic models
   considered, sulfur adsorption was observed to be correlated with the
   density of occupied states near the Fermi level while C2H4 adsorption
   was correlated with the number of unoccupied states in the d-band. The
   diverging mechanisms for S and C2H4 adsorption allow for bimetallic
   surfaces such as NiRu that enhance ethylene binding without accompanying
   increases in sulfur binding energy. In contrast, bimetallics such as
   NiSn and NiW appear to decrease the affinity of the surface for both the
   reagent and the poison.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{190}},
Pages = {{143-149}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In prior first-principles theoretical work we predicted a complete solid
   solution in the Co3O4-Co2ZnO4 system, with a negligibly small mixing
   enthalpy. In this work we tested this prediction on bulk, large-grained
   specimens across the Co3O4-Co(2)Zna(4) join, combining oxide melt
   solution calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, precise lattice
   parameter measurements, anomalous X-ray and neutron diffraction, and in
   situ electrical measurements. The calorimetric results confirm the
   presence of a solid solution at high temperatures, but with a large
   enthalpy of mixing that exceeds the predicted value. Because Co3O4 and
   Co2ZnO4 have essentially identical lattice parameters, this energetic
   destabilization must arise from factors other than the strain energy
   resulting from size mismatch. Changes in Co3+ spin states vs.
   temperature and zinc content are proposed to account for the positive
   excess enthalpy, and may also provide additional entropy to stabilize
   the solid solution at high temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Line search algorithms for nonlinear programming must include safeguards
   to enjoy global convergence properties. This paper describes an exact
   penalization approach that extends the class of problems that can be
   solved with line search sequential quadratic programming methods. In the
   new algorithm, the penalty parameter is adjusted at every iteration to
   ensure sufficient progress in linear feasibility and to promote
   acceptance of the step. A trust region is used to assist in the
   determination of the penalty parameter, but not in the step computation.
   It is shown that the algorithm enjoys favorable global convergence
   properties. Numerical experiments illustrate the behavior of the
   algorithm on various difficult situations.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to synthesize a set of heterocyclic derivatives
   of lupane, lup-20(29)-ene, and 18 alpha-oleanane, and to investigate
   their cytotoxic activities. Some of those heterocycles were previously
   known in the oleanane (allobetulin) group; however, to our knowledge the
   syntheses and biological activities of lupane heterocycles have not been
   reported before. Starting from betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2), we
   prepared 3-oxo compounds and 2-bromo-3-oxo compounds 3-10,
   2-hydroxymethylene-3-oxo compounds 11-13 and beta-oxo esters 14-16.
   Condensation of these intermediates with hydrazine, phenylhydrazine,
   hydroxylamine, or thiourea yielded the pyrazole and phenylpyrazole
   derivatives 1722, pyrazolones 23-25, isoxazoles 26 and 27, and thiazoles
   28-31. Fifteen compounds (14-16, 18-25, and 29-32) have not been
   reported before. The cytotoxicity was measured using panel of seven
   cancer cell lines with/without MDR phenotype and non tumor MRC-5 and BJ
   fibroblasts. The preferential cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines,
   particularly to hematological tumors was observed, the bromo acids 5, 6
   showed highest activity and selectivity against tumor cells. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Phase coexistence is frequently observed in molecular monolayers and
   bilayers. The free energy per unit length of phase boundaries in these
   quasi-two-dimensional (2D) systems is known as line tension, and is
   directly analogous to surface tension in three dimensions. The existence
   of line tension implies the possibility of 2D capillary phenomena, a
   fundamentally intriguing possibility. Moreover, line tension has
   important implications with respect to the formation and stability of
   nm-scale features in thin films, ranging from lithographically-prepared
   molecular features in devices (e.g. sensor nanoarrays or molecular
   electronics) to signaling domains in biological membranes (i.e. lipid
   rafts). It has been proposed that such nm-scale domains may have
   important ramifications for budding and/or fusion in bilayer membranes.
   Various methods have been developed to measure line tension, including
   observations of domain boundary fluctuations, relaxation dynamics,
   nucleation rates, and others. The competition between line tension and
   long-range forces (e.g. electrostatic repulsion or curvature elasticity)
   can lead to a preferred equilibrium domain size, domain shape
   instabilities, or even unusual domain morphologies (e.g. stripe phases)
   near critical points. Since liquid crystalline mesophases are ubiquitous
   in 2D, it is not unusual for the line tension to be anisotropic: this
   can lead to non-circular domains exhibiting kinks and/or chirality.
   Recent efforts have been aimed at controlling line tension by the
   addition of line-active compounds that are analogous to surfactants
   potentially leading to the observation of new 2D ``capillary{''}
   phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An elegant solution is proposed to an old problem of how to remove
   expired or malfunctioning satellites from the geosynchronous belt.
   Previous ``space-tug{''} concepts describe a scenario where one craft
   (the tug) docks with another (debris) and then boosts that object to a
   super-synchronous orbit. The most challenging aspect of these concepts
   is the very complex proximity operations to an aging, possibly rotating
   and, probably, non-cooperative satellite. Instead, the proposed method
   uses an elegant blend of electrostatic charge control and low-thrust
   propulsion to avoid any contact requirement. The Geosynchronous Large
   Debris Reorbiter (GLiDeR) uses active charge emission to raise its own
   absolute potential to 10's of kilovolts and, in addition, directs a
   stream of charged particles at the debris to increase its absolute
   potential. In a puller configuration the opposite polarity of the debris
   creates an attractive force between the GLiDeR and the debris. Pusher
   configurations are feasible as well. Next, fuel-efficient
   micro-thrusters are employed to gently move the reorbiter relative to
   the debris, and then accelerate the debris out of its geosynchronous
   slot and deposit it in a disposal orbit. Preliminary analysis shows that
   a 1000 kg debris object can be re-orbited over two-four months. During
   the reorbit phase the separation distance is held nominally fixed
   without physical contact, even if the debris is tumbling, by actively
   controlling the charge transfer between the reorbiter and the debris.
   Numerical simulations are presented illustrating the expected
   performance, taking into account also the solar radiation pressure.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Interannual variability in biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2 is
   driven by a diverse range of biotic and abiotic factors. Replicating
   this variability thus represents the acid test for terrestrial biosphere
   models. Although such models are commonly used to project responses to
   both normal and anomalous variability in climate, they are rarely tested
   explicitly against inter-annual variability in observations. Herein,
   using standardized data from the North American Carbon Program, we
   assess the performance of 16 terrestrial biosphere models and 3 remote
   sensing products against long-term measurements of biosphere-atmosphere
   CO2 exchange made with eddy-covariance flux towers at 11 forested sites
   in North America. Instead of focusing on model-data agreement we take a
   systematic, variability-oriented approach and show that although the
   models tend to reproduce the mean magnitude of the observed annual flux
   variability, they fail to reproduce the timing. Large biases in modeled
   annual means are evident for all models. Observed interannual
   variability is found to commonly be on the order of magnitude of the
   mean fluxes. None of the models consistently reproduce observed
   interannual variability within measurement uncertainty.
   Underrepresentation of variability in spring phenology, soil thaw and
   snowpack melting, and difficulties in reproducing the lagged response to
   extreme climatic events are identified as systematic errors, common to
   all models included in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been
   validated as cancer therapeutics, yet efficacy can differ widely between
   tumor types and individual patients. In addition, such agents are costly
   and can have significant toxicities. Rapid noninvasive determination of
   response could provide significant benefits. We tested if response to
   the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (BV) could be detected using
   contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS). We used two xenograft model
   systems with previously well-characterized responses to VEGF inhibition,
   a responder (SK-NEP-1) and a non-responder (NGP), and examined
   perfusion-related parameters. CEUS demonstrated that BV treatment
   arrested the increase in blood volume in the SK-NEP-1 tumor group only.
   Molecular imaging of alpha(V)beta(3) with targeted microbubbles was a
   more sensitive prognostic indicator of BV efficacy. CEUS using
   RGD-labeled microbubbles showed a robust decrease in alpha(V)beta(3)
   vasculature following BV treatment in SK-NEP-1 tumors. Paralleling these
   findings, lectin perfusion assays detected a disproportionate pruning of
   smaller, branch vessels. Therefore, we conclude that the response to BV
   can be identified soon after initiation of treatment, often within 3
   days, by use of CEUS molecular imaging techniques. The use of a
   noninvasive ultrasound approach may allow for earlier and more effective
   determination of efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy. (E-mail: mark.

Title = {{Semi-analytic solution of the motion of two spheres in arbitrary shear
   flow}},

Abstract = {{The semi-analytic solution for the motion of two spheres suspended in
   arbitrary, unbounded shear flow is developed. The solution is a
   generalization of classical bispherical-coordinate solutions for two
   spheres moving along or perpendicular to the line of centers, rotating
   about the centerline in a quiescent liquid, and suspended in linear
   flow. The semi-analytic solution is highly efficient and can be used to
   study dilute sphere interactions in low Reynolds number flows. Several
   application problems are considered including the net particle migration
   of rough spheres in Couette and Poiseuille flow and the self-diffusivity
   of spheres in linear and nonlinear flow. Although it has been
   established previously that rough sphere pairs in nonlinear shear flow
   migrate towards the low shear rate region of the flow field, the physics
   behind this migration is elucidated. It is also shown that, under
   certain circumstances, a rough sphere pair undergoing short period
   oscillatory Poiseuille flow can actually migrate towards the high-shear
   rate region of the flow field. Finally, new results are generated for
   the effect of particle radius ratio on the migration phenomenon. (C)

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out to determine whether nickel or Inconel are

   the problem of flame flashback and/or inlet preignition in hydrogen-rich

   experiments were performed using small resistively heated tubular
   reactors with matrix isolation/infrared diagnostics. Reactors were
   manufactured from stainless steel, nickel and Inconel. For the flow
   conditions studied, the conversion efficiency was about 3\% for the
   nickel reactor and 0.9\% for the Inconel reactor. No activity was seen
   for stainless steel. Comparison with a published surface kinetic
   reaction mechanism for nickel suggests that the surface oxidation rate
   of H-2 in our reactors is about two orders of magnitude less than for

Abstract = {{Therapeutic proteins must be generally formulated to reduce unwanted
   aggregation. Fusion proteins, which comprise domains assembled from
   separate proteins, may require unique formulation strategies in order to
   maximize their stability. A fusion protein of human serum albumin (HSA)
   and human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF; HSAGCSF) was used
   as a model to test the hypothesis that formulations that increase the
   thermodynamic conformational stability of the least stable domain of a
   fusion protein will stabilize the entire fusion protein against
   aggregation. Conformational stability of HSAGCSF was modulated by
   addition of octanoic acid, which was previously shown to increase the
   conformational stability of HSA, the least stable domain. Contrary to
   our hypothesis, increased conformational stability of the HSA domain did
   not result in increased resistance to aggregation of HSAGCSF. These
   results for HSAGCSF were also compared with similar studies conducted
   previously on a therapeutic protein formed by the fusion of HSA and
   human growth hormone (hGH; HSAhGH). (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, modified with RGD, are promising
   platforms for cell encapsulation and tissue engineering. While these
   hydrogels offer tunable mechanical properties, the extent of the host
   response may limit their in vivo applicability. The overall objective
   was to characterize the effects of hydrogel stiffness on the in vitro
   macrophage response and in vivo host response. We hypothesized that
   stiffer substrates induce better attachment, adhesion, and increased
   cell spreading, which elevates the macrophage classically activated
   phenotype and leads to a more severe foreign body reaction (FBR).
   PEG-RGD hydrogels were fabricated with compressive moduli of 130, 240,
   and 840 kPa, and the same RGD concentration. Hydrogel stiffness did not
   impact macrophage attachment, but elicited differences in cell
   morphology. Cells retained a round morphology on 130 kPa substrates,
   with localized and dense F-actin and localized aV integrin stainings.
   Contrarily, cells on stiffer substrates were more spread, with filopodia
   protruding from the cell, a more defined F-actin, and greater aV
   integrin staining. When stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, macrophages
   had a classical activation phenotype, with increased expression of
   TNF-a, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, however the degree of activation was
   significantly reduced with the softest hydrogels. A FBR ensued in
   response to all hydrogels when implanted subcutaneously in mice, but 28
   days postimplantation the layer of macrophages at the implant surface
   was significantly lower in the softest hydrogels. In conclusion,
   hydrogels with lower stiffness led to reduced macrophage activation and
   a less severe and more typical FBR, and therefore are more suited for in
   vivo tissue engineering applications. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{A digital approach to provide phase surveillance in resonant converters
   is proposed. The approach provides a mechanism for controllers in
   resonant inverters to maintain zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) mode
   operation despite large and abrupt changes in load behavior.
   Applications are focused on but not limited to generation and control of
   electrical discharges. The phase surveillance provides effective arc
   ignition, prevents the eventual arc extinction and assures ZVS in MOSFET
   turn-on transients. The proposed circuit and control approach makes the
   converter robust to distorted waveforms associated with either low Q
   operation, the use of nonlinear soft-saturation core inductors or any
   other cause that jeopardizes ZVS in high-frequency resonant inverters,
   including component tolerance, aging, and temperature effects. Two
   practical circuits are used to demonstrate the phase surveillance
   operation. A two-phase resonant inverter controlling a welding arc shows
   how the phase surveillance assures ZVS operation and a single-phase
   resonant electronic ballast for high-intensity discharge lamps shows how
   the phase surveillance solves the problem of arc generation. Phase
   surveillance maintains the frequency dependent characteristics of the
   resonant inverter, such as the high output impedance that stabilizes the
   arc beyond the control loop bandwidth, while achieving robust operation
   for any combination of load, component tolerances, and driver dead
   times.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust control synthesis framework for switched

   the proposed synthesis method is a gain-scheduled controller that
   guarantees stability despite the accounted nonlinear dynamics and can
   provide excellent performances. Two different synthesis examples are
   shown for a DC-DC boost converter and their performance and robustness
   are compared with a standard control approach as current-mode control,
   both in nominal and non-nominal conditions. Finally, the proposed

Title = {{Analyzing grid independency and numerical viscosity of computational

Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{107-118}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been introduced to indoor
   environment study for decades. Analysis of CFD results will first
   require the reach of a grid-independent CFD solution to eliminate the
   false information induced by numerical causes, e.g., grid and numerical
   scheme. judging a grid-independent solution has been mostly
   experience-based, leading the necessity of developing an objective and
   easy-to-use criterion for grid independency evaluation. This paper
   presents a new approach to assessing the grid independency of CFD
   modeling for indoor environment applications. A normalized root mean
   square error (RMSE) index is developed from the grid convergence index
   (GCI) concept in literature to evaluate the overall differences of
   predicted results with varying grid resolutions. The paper further
   introduces the use of numerical viscosity analysis method to verify the
   grid-independent solution of a CFD analysis, which also provides
   fundamental insight into the grid-induced error in numerical solutions.
   Although initially developed for indoor environment applications, the
   proposed RMSE index along with the numerical viscosity analysis method
   can be applied to most general CFD studies and has great potential of
   being incorporated into commercial CFD software to provide user a more
   accurate and objective alternative of checking grid independency of CFD
   simulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Garment materials that provide protection against exposure to toxic
   chemical warfare agents (CWAs) not only require the ability to block the
   passage of these toxic compounds in vapor form but also the ability to
   transport water vapor to allow cooling for the wearer. Only a very
   limited number of examples of such ``breathable{''} CWA barrier
   materials are known. A new type of reactive organic/inorganic composite
   film material is presented that has a very high water vapor transport
   rate (>1800 g m(-2) day(-1) for a 220-mu m-thick film) and the ability
   to completely block penetration of the mustard agent simulant,
   2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), after 22 h of continuous exposure.
   This new composite material is based on two components: (1) a
   cross-linked, diol-functionalized room-temperature ionic liquid polymer
   that serves as a dense, flexible hydrophilic matrix, and (2) a basic
   zeolite (sodium zeolite-Y (NaY)) that serves as an inexpensive,
   nucleophilic additive that chemically degrades the CEES as it enters the
   film. Preliminary FT-IR studies on this new reactive barrier material
   suggest that the OH groups on the ionic polymer not only facilitates

Abstract = {{To better understand the nature of alkyl intermediates often invoked in
   reactions involving hydrocarbon reactants and products, the adsorption
   of linear and branched C-1-C-4 alkyls on Cu(111) at 1/4 ML and 1/9 ML
   coverages was studied using density functional theory. The adsorption
   energy and site preference are found to be coverage-dependent, and both
   direct alkyl-alkyl interactions and changes in the Cu electronic
   structure play a role in these trends. It was found that methyl strongly
   prefers the hollow sites, the branched alkyls strongly prefer the top
   site, and the linear C-2-C-4 alkyls have weak site preferences that
   change with coverage. To explain these differences, rationalize alkyl
   adsorption trends, and predict the binding energy of other alkyls, a
   simple model was developed in which the binding energy is fit as a
   linear function of the number of C-Cu and C-H-Cu interactions as well as
   the C-H bond energy in the corresponding alkane. Site preference can be
   understood as a compromise between C-Cu interactions and C-H-Cu
   interactions. Density of states analysis was used to gain a
   molecular-orbital understanding of the bonding of alkyls to Cu(111). (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, we develop thiol/acrylate two-stage reactive network
   forming polymer systems that exhibit two distinct and orthogonal stages
   of curing. Using a thiol-acrylate system with excess acrylate functional
   groups, a first stage polymer network is formed via a 1 to 1
   stoichiometric thiol-acrylate Michael addition reaction (stage 1). At a
   later point in time, the excess acrylate functional groups are
   homopolymerized via a photoinitiated free radical polymerization to form
   a second stage polymer network (stage 2). By varying the monomers within
   the system as well as the stoichiometery of the thiol to acrylate
   functional groups, we demonstrate the ability of the two-stage polymer
   network forming systems to encompass a wide range of properties at the
   end of both the stage 1 and stage 2 polymerizations. Using urethane di-
   and hexaacrylates within the formulations led to two-stage reactive
   polymeric systems with stage 1 T(g)s that ranged from - 12 to 30 degrees
   C. The systems were then photocured, upon which the T-g of the systems
   increases by up to 90 degrees C while also achieving a nearly 20 fold
   modulus increase. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental and modeling study of the effects of
   physical aging on the shape-memory performance of (meth)acrylate-based
   networks composed of tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) crosslinked by various
   concentrations of poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (PEGDMA). The
   experiments measured the unconstrained recovery response of samples
   stored at 20 degrees C (T-g - 36 degrees C) for zero to 180 days and
   evaluated the effects of storage on the strain fixity, activation
   temperature, and initial recovery rate. A thermoviscoelastic model
   recently developed for amorphous networks near the T-g was applied to
   study the influence of structural and viscoelastic relaxation and the
   aging time and temperature on the recovery response. Results showed that
   the activation temperature and the initial recovery rate increased with
   the aging time, producing a sharper initial recovery response. The
   thermoviscoelastic model predicted that the magnitude of these effects
   depended on the aging temperature. There was an optimum aging
   temperature that maximized the initial recovery rate. These results
   suggest that physical aging can be manipulated to accelerate the
   recovery performance of shape-memory polymer devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes of noble metals are gaining
   increasing interest for applications in catalysis and microelectronics.
   Platinum ALD from (methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum (MeCpPtMe3)
   and O-2 gas has been considered as a model system for noble metal ALD.
   However, many questions about the underlying reaction mechanisms remain.
   In this work, the insight into the Pt ALD reaction mechanisms is
   extended by considering the catalytic nature of the Pt film. It is
   evaluated which surface reactions are likely to take place during Pt ALD
   on the basis of surface science results on the interaction of the Pt
   surface with O-2 and hydrocarbon species, combined with previously
   reported Pt ALD mechanistic studies. In analogy to the reactions of
   hydrocarbon species on catalytic Pt, it is proposed that, in addition to
   combustion-like reactions, dehydrogenation of precursor ligands plays a
   role in the mechanism. The formation of CH4 during the MeCpPtMe3
   exposure pulse is explained by hydrogenation of methyl species by
   hydrogen atoms released from dehydrogenation reactions. The implications
   of the surface reactions on the self-limiting behavior, the growth rate,
   and the temperature dependence of the process are discussed. Moreover,
   this work demonstrates that surface science studies are of great use in
   obtaining more understanding of metal ALD processes.}},

Abstract = {{The development of nanostructured polymeric systems containing
   directionally continuous poly(ionic liquid) (poly(IL)) domains has
   considerable implications toward a range of transport-dependent,
   energy-based technology applications. The controlled, synthetic
   integration of poly(IL)s into block copolymer (BCP) architectures
   provides a promising means to this end, based on their inherent ability
   to self-assemble into a range of defined, periodic morphologies. In this
   work, we report the melt-state phase behavior of an
   imidazolium-containing alkyl ionic BCP system, derived from the
   sequential ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of imidazolium-
   and alkyl-substituted norbornene monomer derivatives. A series of 16 BCP
   samples were synthesized, varying both the relative volume fraction of
   the poly(norbornene dodecyl ester) block (f(DOD) = 0.42-0.96) and the
   overall molecular weights of the block copolymers (M-n values from
   5000-20 100 g mol(-1)). Through a combination of small-angle X-ray
   scattering (SAXS) and dynamic rheology, we were able to delineate clear
   compositional phase boundaries for each of the classic BCP phases,
   including lamellae (Lam), hexagonally packed cylinders (Hex), and
   spheres on a body-centered-cubic lattice (S-BCC). Additionally, a
   liquid-like packing (LLP) of spheres was found for samples located in
   the extreme asymmetric region of the phase diagram, and a persistent
   coexistence of Lam and Hex domains was found in lieu of the bicontinuous
   cubic gyroid phase for samples located at the intersection of Hex and
   Lam regions. Thermal disordering was opposed even in very low molecular
   weight samples, detected only when the composition was highly asymmetric
   (f(DOD) = 0.96). Annealing experiments on samples exhibiting Lam and Hex
   coexistence revealed the presence of extremely slow transition kinetics,
   ultimately selective for one or the other but not the more complex
   gyroid phase. In fact, no evidence of the bicontinuous network was
   detected over a 2 month annealing period. The ramifications of these
   results for transport-dependent applications targeting the use of highly
   segregated poly(IL)-containing BCP systems are carefully considered.}},

Title = {{THE EFFECTS OF IRRADIATION ON HOT JOVIAN ATMOSPHERES: HEAT
   REDISTRIBUTION AND ENERGY DISSIPATION}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{751}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Hot Jupiters, due to the proximity to their parent stars, are subjected
   to a strong irradiating flux that governs their radiative and dynamical
   properties. We compute a suite of three-dimensional circulation models
   with dual-band radiative transfer, exploring a relevant range of
   irradiation temperatures, both with and without temperature inversions.
   We find that, for irradiation temperatures T-irr less than or similar to
   2000 K, heat redistribution is very efficient, producing comparable
   dayside and nightside fluxes. For T-irr approximate to 2200-2400 K, the
   redistribution starts to break down, resulting in a high day-night flux
   contrast. Our simulations indicate that the efficiency of redistribution
   is primarily governed by the ratio of advective to radiative timescales.
   Models with temperature inversions display a higher day-night contrast
   due to the deposition of starlight at higher altitudes, but we find this
   opacity-driven effect to be secondary compared to the effects of
   irradiation. The hotspot offset from the substellar point is large when
   insolation is weak and redistribution is efficient, and decreases as
   redistribution breaks down. The atmospheric flow can be potentially
   subjected to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (as indicated by the
   Richardson number) only in the uppermost layers, with a depth that
   penetrates down to pressures of a few millibars at most. Shocks
   penetrate deeper, down to several bars in the hottest model. Ohmic
   dissipation generally occurs down to deeper levels than shock
   dissipation (to tens of bars), but the penetration depth varies with the
   atmospheric opacity. The total dissipated Ohmic power increases steeply
   with the strength of the irradiating flux and the dissipation depth
   recedes into the atmosphere, favoring radius inflation in the most
   irradiated objects. A survey of the existing data, as well as the
   inferences made from them, reveals that our results are broadly
   consistent with the observational trends.}},

Title = {{Zonal-mean global teleconnection from 15 to 110 km derived from SABER
   and WACCM}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{We derive the correlation patterns over the global latitudes and from
   the stratosphere to lower thermosphere (broadly referred to as
   teleconnection) using temperature data measured by the Sounding of the
   Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) from 2002 to
   2010, and using 54 years of simulations of temperatures and winds by the
   Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). We also analyze the
   possible mechanisms of teleconnection by investigating the correlations
   between the temperature and residual circulation. The correlation
   patterns show that teleconnection exists globally over the equatorial,
   mid-and high-latitudes, and temperature anomalies correspond well to the
   anomalies of the residual circulations through adiabatic
   heating/cooling. A main new finding of this study is that the
   teleconnection extends well into the lower thermosphere, the
   thermospheric anomalies are consistent with the corresponding changes of
   the winter-to-summer lower-thermospheric branch of the residual
   circulation, and the winter stratosphere perturbations influence the
   thermosphere globally. Using a reference point chosen in the northern
   winter stratosphere, we find that the teleconnection structures for time
   periods with and without Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) display
   similar patterns in SABER, and teleconnection patterns in WACCM are
   nearly identical for days with major SSWs, minor SSWs and without SSWs.
   WACCM results show strong inter-annual and intra-annual altitude
   variations of the teleconnection patterns in the southern polar region
   but stable altitudes of correlation regions in the equatorial and
   northern latitudes. The altitude variations are likely responsible for
   the weak correlations poleward of 60 degrees S when multiyear or
   multimonth data are used.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of cancer drugs such as cisplatin (Cp) and oxaliplatin
   (Ox), which covalently bind to DNA to form drug-DNA adducts, is linked
   to their recognition by repair proteins such as HMGB1a. Previous
   experimental studies showed that HMGB1a's binding affinity for Cp- and
   Ox-DNA varies with the drug used and the local DNA sequence context of
   the adduct. We link this differential binding affinity to the free
   energy of deforming (bending and minor groove opening) the drug-DNA
   molecule during HMGB1a binding. Specifically, the minimal binding
   affinity of HMGB1a for Ox-DNA in the TGGA context is explained by its
   larger deformation free energy compared with Cp-DNA or Ox-DNA in other
   sequence contexts. Methyl groups on neighboring thymine bases in Ox-TGGA
   crowd the minor groove and sterically hinder the motion of the
   diaminocyclohexane ring of Ox, leading to this reduced deformability and
   resultant decrease in HMGB1a's binding affinity.}},

Abstract = {{We report a simple method to investigate crystallite nucleation and
   growth in stepwise, thermally annealed plasma enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition and hot wire chemical vapor deposition a-Si:H films. By
   confining film thicknesses to the range 500-4000 angstrom, optical
   microscopy in the reflection mode can be used to readily detect
   crystallites in the thermally annealed a-Si:H lattice. Measurements of
   the crystallite density versus annealing time for identically prepared
   films of different thickness show that the crystallite nucleation rate
   is smaller for thinner films, suggesting that crystallite nucleation is
   homogeneous, in agreement with previous results. A comparison of film
   nucleation rates with those obtained by other methods on identically
   prepared films shows excellent agreement, thus establishing the validity
   of the current technique. The potential effect of impurity (oxygen)
   incorporation during the stepwise annealing in air is shown not to
   affect crystallite nucleation and growth, in that SIMS oxygen profiles
   for stepwise versus continuous annealing show not only similar impurity
   profiles but also similar bulk impurity densities. (C) 2012 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Some primary physical relationships related to the surface climate and
   atmospheric boundary layer were examined over East Antarctica and
   evaluated in the regional climate model HIRHAM for 2005-2008. For stable
   conditions, the observation-derived relationship between wind-scaled
   sensible heat flux and air-surface temperature difference distinctively
   differs between different surface flux parameterizations. Some of them
   decrease the heat transfer coefficient CH for strongly stable
   conditions, while others, such as the Louis scheme, do not. However,
   HIRHAM's application of the Louis parameterization produces small CH for
   strongly stable conditions similar to observations and other schemes,
   likely because a surface roughness much larger than observed is used and
   the bulk Richardson number differs. For Zhongshan, the observed
   radiation-cloud, temperature-cloud, and temperature-wind relationships
   are reproduced in the model, though quantitative differences are
   evident. An observed longwave warming effect of clouds is larger in the
   model, while the reduction of downwelling shortwave radiation by clouds
   is twice as large in the model. The model partially reproduces an
   observed weak wind regime associated with atmospheric decoupling, but
   fails to reproduce increasing temperatures with increasing winds. The
   quantitative differences in the radiation-cloud relationship suggest
   that errors in cloud characteristics produce a significant deficiency in
   downwelling net radiation for clear and cloudy conditions. This
   deficiency is the likely cause of HIRHAM's strong cold bias in the
   surface temperature and positive bias in near-surface stability. The
   sensible heat flux analyses and a sensitivity test suggest that errors
   in the sensible heat flux relationship are not the primary cause.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we generate and probe the shortest wavelength surface
   acoustic waves to date, at 45 nm, by diffracting coherent extreme
   ultraviolet beams from a suboptical phononic crystal. The short acoustic
   wavelengths correspond to penetration depths of approximately 10 nm. We
   also measure the acoustic dispersion in two-dimensional nanostructured
   phononic crystals down to this wavelength for the first time, showing
   that it is strongly influenced by the ultrashort acoustic penetration
   depth, and that advanced finite-element analysis is required to model
   the dispersion. Finally, we use pulse sequences to control surface
   acoustic wave generation in one-dimensional nanostructured gratings, to
   preferentially enhance higher-order surface waves, while suppressing
   lower frequency waves. This allows us to reduce the generated surface
   acoustic wavelength by a factor of two for a defined nanostructure
   period.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on Si core/C shell nanofibers as an anode material
   for Li-ion batteries. The Si core/C shell nanofibers are synthesized
   using co-axial electrospinning of Si nanoparticles in
   styrene-co-acrylonitrile core solution and poly(acrylonitrile) shell
   solution combined with subsequent thermal treatments. The microstructure
   and elemental composition of the nanofibers are systematically examined
   using FE-SEM, TEM and WAXD for confirmation of the crystalline Si
   core/turbostratic C shell structure. In situ observation of
   contact-lithiation of the Si core/C shell nanofibers is carried out to
   investigate their mechanical durability during the electrochemical
   reactions. The electrochemical performances of the nanofibers as an
   anode are characterized by galvanostatic charge-discharge test. Due to
   simple processing but a well-developed core/shell structure and good
   electrochemical performance, the Si core/C shell nanofibers fabricated
   in this study offer the potential to develop enhanced Si/C
   nanostructured composite anodes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Extending generalized Horton laws to test embedding algorithms for
   topologic river networks}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},

Volume = {{151}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{River networks in the landscape can be described as topologic rooted
   trees embedded in a three-dimensional surface. We examine the problem of
   embedding topologic binary rooted trees (BRTs) by investigating two
   space-filling embedding procedures: Top-Down, previously developed in
   the context of random self-similar networks (RSNs). and Bottom-Up, a new
   procedure developed here. We extend the concept of generalized Horton
   laws to interior sub catchments and create a new set of scaling laws
   that are used to test the embedding algorithms. We compare the two
   embedding strategies with respect to the scaling properties of the
   distribution of accumulated areas A(omega) and network magnitude M-omega
   for complete order streams omega. The Bottom-Up procedure preserves the
   equality of distributions A(omega),/E{[}A(omega)] =(d)
   M-omega,/E{[}M-omega]; a feature observed in real basins. The Top-Down
   embedded networks fail to preserve this equality because of strong
   correlations of tile areas in the final tessellation. We conclude that
   the presence or absence of this equality is a useful test to diagnose
   river network models that describe the topology/geometry of natural
   drainage systems. We present some examples of applying the embedding
   algorithms to self similar trees (SSTs) and to RSNs. Finally, a
   technique is presented to map the resulting tiled region into a
   three-dimensional surface that corresponds to a landscape drained by the
   chosen network. Our results are a significant first step toward the goal
   of creating realistic embedded topologic trees, which are also required
   for the study of peak flow scaling in river networks in the presence of
   spatially variable rainfall and flood-generating processes. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This article presents effects of polydispersity in polymers grafted on
   spherical surfaces on grafted polymer chain conformations, grafted layer
   thickness, and free-end monomer distribution within the grafted layer.
   At brush-like grafting densities, as polydispersity index (PDI)
   increases, the scaling exponent of radius of gyration of grafted chains
   approaches that of a single chain grafted on the same nanoparticle,
   because polydispersity alleviates monomer crowding within the brush. At
   high PDI, the chains shorter than the number average chain length, Nn,
   have more compressed conformations, and the chains longer than Nn
   overall stretch less than in the monodisperse case. As seen in
   polydisperse flat brushes at high grafting densities, the grafted layer
   thickness on spherical nanoparticle increases with PDI. Polydispersity
   eliminates the region near the surface devoid of free-end monomers seen
   in monodisperse cases, and it reduces the width of free-end monomer
   distribution and shifts the free-end monomer distribution close to the
   surface. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B: Polym

Abstract = {{RATIONALE: A study of pesticide transformation products (TPs) was
   carried out in soils of agricultural areas working under integrated pest
   management programs (IPMs). Bupirimate and cyromazine were the
   pesticides detected in soils after an initial pre-screening. The aim of
   this work was the identification of relevant TPs of these two
   pesticides.
   METHODS: Soil samples were extracted by pressurized liquid extraction
   (PLE), using a mixture of ethyl acetate/methanol (3: 1, v/v), and
   analyzed by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid
   quadrupoletime- of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). For
   confirmation purposes, tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) experiments were
   carried out using QTOF-MS, obtaining specific fragment structures of the
   pesticides and their degradates.
   RESULTS: Retention times and exact masses of the protonated molecules
   were used for the identification of the pesticides bupirimate (m/z
   317.1642) and cyromazine (m/z 167.1040) and their respective TPs, namely
   ethirimol (m/z 210.1601) and melamine (m/z 127.0727). A novel strategy
   using pseudo-MS3 experiments was developed to confirm the structure of
   bupirimate TP (ethirimol). This strategy consists of generating the
   particular TP in the ion source, via collision-induced fragmentation,
   and then performing MS/MS to the fragment ion formed in-source.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ethirimol and melamine were identified as degradation
   products of bupirimate and cyromazine, respectively. The study was
   applied to the analysis of 15 agricultural soil samples finding
   bupirimate and ethirimol in seven samples, cyromazine in one sample and
   melamine in four samples. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{241-253}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasonic Time Domain Reflectometry (UTDR) is used to monitor the
   deposition and physicochemical nature of colloidal silica fouling on a
   polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane under crossflow and constant
   flux conditions. The fouling can be characterized by four stages based
   on the rate of increase of the transmembrane pressure (TMP): (1) an
   initial rapid increasing rate due to concentration polarization; (2) a
   slow constant rate; (3) a nonconstant increasing rate associated with
   metastability of the colloidal silica; (4) a constant rapid rate
   associated with the foulant layer having a constant thickness. The
   destabilization of the colloidal particles in the foulant layer during
   stage 3 is associated with an increase in the UTDR peak amplitude.
   During stage 4 the foulant layer thickness reaches a plateau value that
   decreases with increasing crossflow velocity. The rheological behavior
   of the foulant layer is described by the Bingham plastic model for which
   the yield stress can be obtained from the UTDR data. When membrane
   cleaning is done by switching from a fouling to a non-fouling feed
   solution, marked decreases in both the foulant layer thickness and TMP
   are observed. However, a residual tightly bound foulant layer remains on
   the membrane whose thickness, determined by UTDR, corroborates well with
   off-line scanning electron microscopy analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Title = {{A comparison of magnetic field measurements and a plasma-based proxy to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{Wave-particle interactions are fundamental to the dynamics of the outer
   radiation belt. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can resonate
   with energetic electrons, causing pitch angle diffusion and scattering
   of the electrons into Earth's atmosphere. These waves act locally; thus,
   accurately measuring their spatial and temporal distributions is
   critical to understanding their contribution to radiation belt electron
   losses. Using Los Alamos National Laboratory Magnetospheric Plasma
   Analyzer data from geosynchronous orbit, we examine a plasma-based proxy
   for enhanced EMIC wave growth during a set of 52 relativistic electron
   flux dropout events. This proxy is compared to in situ wave measurements
   from the GOES satellites, also at geosynchronous orbit, for single-wave
   events as well as a superposed epoch statistical analysis. The proxy is
   extended to calculate an amplitude for the inferred waves, to enable a
   more quantitative comparison to the in situ GOES EMIC measurements.
   Signatures of EMIC waves are present in both the proxy and the direct
   wave observations at similar local times as well as epoch times. The
   waves are most prevalent in the afternoon sector, with enhanced
   occurrences beginning half a day before the onset of the dropouts and
   peaking in the day following. We see agreement in occurrence between the
   proxy and waves both statistically and in individual instances. This
   study demonstrates the powerful applications of plasma data to infer
   wave distributions in space.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of deposited Pt clusters and adsorbed O-2 in the photoactivity
   of anatase TiO2 (101) surfaces have been studied using density
   functional theory. O-2 only adsorbs to TiO2 surfaces when excess
   negative charge is available to form O-Ti bonds, which can be provided
   by a photoexcited electron or subsurface oxygen vacancy, in which cases
   the adsorption energies are -0.94 and -2.52 eV, respectively. When O-2
   adsorbs near a subsurface defect, it scavenges extra electron density
   and creates a hole that can annihilate excited electrons. In aqueous
   solutions, O-2 interactions with the TiO2 surface are rare because water
   preferentially adsorbs at the surface. Pt clusters on TiO2 significantly
   enhance O-2 adsorption providing many adsorption sites with adsorption
   energies up to -1.69 eV, stronger than the -0.52 eV adsorption energy of
   H2O on the Pt cluster. Consequently, Pt increases the rate of electron
   scavenging by O-2 relative to that of undoped TiO2 leading to enhanced
   photocatalytic performance. Pt states completely bridge the band gap and
   act as electron-hole recombination centers, which are deleterious to the
   photoactivity of TiO2. The initial rise and subsequent fall in TiO2's
   photoactivity with Pt loading results from the competition between
   enhanced electron scavenging due to increased O-2 adsorption and
   increased electron-hole recombination.}},

Abstract = {{We report on charmonium measurements {[}J/psi (1S), psi' (2S), and
   chi(c) (1P)] in p + p collisions at root s = 200 GeV. We find that the
   fraction of J/psi coming from the feed-down decay of psi' and chi(c) in
   the midrapidity region (vertical bar y vertical bar < 0: 35) is 9.6 +/-
   2.4\% and 32 +/- 9\%, respectively. We also present the p(T) and
   rapidity dependencies of the J/psi yield measured via dielectron decay
   at midrapidity (vertical bar y vertical bar < 0.35) and via dimuon decay
   at forward rapidity (1.2 < vertical bar y vertical bar < 2.2). The
   statistical precision greatly exceeds that reported in our previous
   publication {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 232002 (2007)]. The new results are
   compared with other experiments and discussed in the context of current
   charmonium production models.}},

Title = {{Pentachlorophenol Hydroxylase, a Poorly Functioning Enzyme Required for
   Degradation of Pentachlorophenol by Sphingobium chlorophenolicum}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3848-3860}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Several strains of Sphingobium chlorophenolicum have been isolated from
   soil that was heavily contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP), a toxic
   pesticide introduced in the 1930s. S. chlorophenolicum appears to have
   assembled a poorly functioning pathway for degradation of PCP by
   patching enzymes recruited via two independent horizontal gene transfer
   events into an existing metabolic pathway. Flux through the pathway is
   limited by PCP hydroxylase. PCP hydroxylase is a dimeric protein that
   belongs to the family of flavin-dependent phenol hydroxylases. In the
   presence of NADPH, PCP hydroxylase converts PCP to
   tetrachlorobenzoquinone (TCBQ). The k(cat) for PCP (0.024 s(-1)) is very
   low, suggesting that the enzyme is not well evolved for turnover of this
   substrate. Structure-activity studies reveal that substrate binding and
   activity are enhanced by a low pK(a) for the phenolic proton, increased
   hydrophobicity, and the presence of a substituent ortho to the hydroxyl
   group of the phenol. PCP hydroxylase exhibits substantial uncoupling;
   the C4a-hydroxyflavin intermediate, instead of hydroxylating the
   substrate, can decompose to produce H2O2 in a futile cycle that consumes
   NADPH. The extent of uncoupling varies from 0 to 100\% with different
   substrates. The extent of uncoupling is increased by the presence of
   bulky substituents at position 3, 4, or 5 and decreased by the presence
   of a chlorine in the ortho position. The effectiveness of PCP
   hydroxylase is additionally hindered by its promiscuous activity with
   tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a downstream metabolite in the
   degradation pathway. The conversion of TCHQ to TCBQ reverses flux
   through the pathway. Substantial uncoupling also occurs during the
   reaction with TCHQ, Photo used with permission from Johannes Rudolph.}},

Title = {{Charged nanograins in the Enceladus plume}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{There have been three Cassini encounters with the south-pole eruptive
   plume of Enceladus for which the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) had
   viewing in the spacecraft ram direction. In each case, CAPS detected a
   cold dense population of heavy charged particles having mass-to-charge
   (m/q) ratios up to the maximum detectable by CAPS (similar to 10(4)
   amu/e). These particles are interpreted as singly charged
   nanometer-sized water-ice grains. Although they are detected with both
   negative and positive net charges, the former greatly outnumber the
   latter, at least in the m/q range accessible to CAPS. On the most
   distant available encounter (E3, March 2008) we derive a net (negative)
   charge density of up to similar to 2600 e/cm(3) for nanograins, far
   exceeding the ambient plasma number density, but less than the net
   (positive) charge density inferred from the RPWS Langmuir probe data
   during the same plume encounter. Comparison of the CAPS data from the
   three available encounters is consistent with the idea that the
   nanograins leave the surface vents largely uncharged, but become
   increasingly negatively charged by plasma electron impact as they move
   farther from the satellite. These nanograins provide a potentially
   potent source of magnetospheric plasma and E-ring material.}},

Title = {{Climate change projection of snowfall in the Colorado River Basin using
   dynamical downscaling}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{Recent observations show a decrease in the fraction of precipitation
   falling as snowfall in the western United States. In this work we
   evaluate a historical and future climate simulation over the Colorado
   River Basin using a 35 km continuous 111 year simulation (1969-2079) of
   the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model with
   boundary forcing from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and
   Research/Met Office's HadCM3 model with A2 emission scenario. The focus
   of this work is to (1) evaluate the simulated spatiotemporal variability
   of snowfall in the historical period when compared to observations and
   (2) project changes in snowfall and the fraction of precipitation that
   falls as snow during the 21st century. We find that the spatial
   variability in modeled snowfall in the historical period (1981-2005) is
   realistically represented when compared to observations. The trends of
   modeled snowfall are similar to the observed trends except at higher
   elevations. Examining the continuous 111 year simulation, we find the
   future projections show statistically significant increases in
   temperature with larger increases in the northern part of the basin.
   There are statistically insignificant increases in precipitation, while
   snowfall shows a statistically significant decrease throughout the
   period in all but the highest elevations and latitudes. The fraction of
   total precipitation falling as snow shows statistically significant
   declines in all regions. The strongest decrease in snowfall is seen at
   high elevations in the southern part of the basin and low elevations in
   the northern part of the basin. The regions of most intense decreases in
   snow experience a decline of approximately 50\% in snowfall throughout
   the 111 year simulation period. The regions of strongest declines in
   snowfall roughly correspond to the region of migration of the zero
   degree Celsius line and emphasize snowfall dependence on both altitude
   and latitude.}},

Abstract = {{To help genetics instructors become aware of fundamental concepts that
   are persistently difficult for students, we have analyzed the evolution
   of student responses to multiple-choice questions from the Genetics
   Concept Assessment. In total, we examined pretest (before instruction)
   and posttest (after instruction) responses from 751 students enrolled in
   six genetics courses for either majors or nonmajors. Students improved
   on all 25 questions after instruction, but to varying degrees. Notably,
   there was a subgroup of nine questions for which a single incorrect
   answer, called the most common incorrect answer, was chosen by >20\% of
   students on the posttest. To explore response patterns to these nine
   questions, we tracked individual student answers before and after
   instruction and found that particular conceptual difficulties about
   genetics are both more likely to persist and more likely to distract
   students than other incorrect ideas. Here we present an analysis of the
   evolution of these incorrect ideas to encourage instructor awareness of
   these genetics concepts and provide advice on how to address common
   conceptual difficulties in the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the accuracy of spatially resolved skin friction
   velocity ut measurements using a large number of Irwin sensors (Irwin,
   1981). A fast and simple procedure to calibrate the sensors against a
   two-component hot-film anemometer is introduced which leads to a
   universal calibration function that can then be used for all sensors.
   Insignificantly lower accuracies are obtained using the universal
   calibration function instead of individual calibration functions for
   each sensor. The overall accuracy of the skin friction velocity
   measurements averages about +/- 5\% for u(tau) > 0.13 m s(-1) and
   decreases strongly to +/- 20\% at lower u(tau). The main sources of
   errors are as follows: (i) deviations from flush mounting of the sensors
   with the wall surface, (ii) inhomogeneous boundary layers produced in
   wind tunnels, (iii) pressure transducer inaccuracies, (iv) Irwin sensor
   geometry variations and (v) Irwin sensor calibration errors. An
   excellent linear relationship between u(tau) measured with the Irwin
   sensors and the free stream velocity as well as the good agreement of
   Irwin sensor with independent hot-film measurements validate the
   reliability of the measurement setup. An exemplary measurement of the
   skin friction velocity distribution around a single wall-mounted
   rectangular block is presented, discussed and compared to literature and
   can serve as a test case for simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We consider lossy data compression in capacity-constrained networks with
   correlated sources. We derive, using dual decomposition, a distributed
   algorithm that maximizes an aggregate utility measure defined in terms
   of the distortion levels of the sources. No coordination among sources
   is required; each source adjusts its distortion level according to
   distortion prices fed back by the sinks. The algorithm is developed for
   the case of squared error distortion and high resolution coding where
   the rate-distortion region is known, and can be easily extended to
   consider achievable regions that can be expressed in a related form. Our
   distributed optimization framework applies to unicast and multicast with
   and without network coding. Numerical examples show relatively fast
   convergence, allowing the algorithm to be used in time-varying networks.}},

Abstract = {{With rapidly increasing energy consumption attributed to residential
   buildings in South Korea, there is a need to update requirements of the
   building energy code in order to improve the energy performance of
   buildings. This paper provides some guidelines to improve the building
   energy code to better select glazing types that minimize total energy
   use of residential buildings in Korea. In particular, detailed energy
   simulation analyses coupled with economical and environmental
   assessments are carried out to assess the thermal, economical, and
   environmental impacts of glazing thermal characteristics as well as
   window sizes associated with housing units in various representative
   climates within South Korea. The results of the analyses have clearly
   indicated that selecting glazing with low solar heat gain coefficient is
   highly beneficial especially for large windows and for mild climates. In
   particular, it is found that using any double-pane low-e glazing would
   provide better performance for windows in residential buildings than the
   clear double-pane glazing, currently required by the Korean building
   energy code. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A single double-gimbal variable-speed control moment gyroscope is
   considered as a method for three-dimensional spacecraft attitude
   control. First, the system's equations of motion are developed, where
   gimbal and wheel accelerations. are prescribed as control inputs. The
   resulting necessary motor torques as well as system energy rates are
   computed for verification. Next, a novel control algorithm is developed
   from the stability constraint for reference trajectory tracking. In
   contrast with the control development for single-gimbal variable-speed
   gyros, a Newton Raphson scheme is required to solve for the desired
   double-gimbal variable-speed control moment gyroscope control variables
   because they appear in cross product and quadratic form, preventing
   analytical solutions. Analysis of the control theory suggests that the
   same torque amplification effects exist as in a single-gimbal control
   moment gyro, but control by a single double-gimbal variable-speed
   control moment gyroscope device is not robust due to potential
   configurations that result in control singularities. When these
   singularities are avoided, a simulation with successful reference
   trajectory tracking is achieved. Allowing double-gimbal gyros to have
   variable wheel speeds provides additional torquing capabilities, which
   is significant if failure modes are considered. As will be shown, a
   single double-gimbal variable-speed control moment gyroscope device can
   provide limited three-dimensional attitude control.}},

Abstract = {{Space missions to small solar system bodies such as asteroids and comets
   must deal with multiple perturbations acting on the spacecraft. These
   include strong perturbations from the gravity field and solar tide, but
   for small bodies, the most important perturbations may arise from solar
   radiation pressure acting on the spacecraft. Previous research has
   generally investigated the effect of the gravity field, solar tide, and
   solar radiation pressure acting on a spacecraft trajectory about an
   asteroid in isolation and has not considered their joint effect. In this
   paper, a more general theoretical discussion of the joint effects of
   these forces will be given. Specific criteria are found for when it is
   possible for a spacecraft to orbit about a small body in a bound orbit.
   In the case where such hound motion is possible, a general solution for
   the averaged motion of a spacecraft subject to solar radiation pressure
   perturbations is given. Finally, interactions between solar radiation
   pressure and gravity field perturbations are investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Federal land managers are faced with the task of balancing multiple uses
   and goals when making decisions about land use and the activities that
   occur on public lands. Though climate change is now well recognized by
   federal agencies and their local land and resource managers, it is not
   yet clear how issues related to climate change will be incorporated into
   on-the-ground decision making within the framework of multiple use
   objectives. We conducted a case study of a federal land management
   agency field office, the San Juan Public Lands Center in Durango, CO,
   U.S.A., to understand from their perspective how decisions are currently
   made, and how climate change and carbon management are being factored
   into decision making. We evaluated three major management sectors in
   which climate change or carbon management may intersect other use goals:
   forests, biofuels, and grazing. While land managers are aware of climate
   change and eager to understand more about how it might affect land
   resources, the incorporation of climate change considerations into
   everyday decision making is currently quite limited. Climate change is
   therefore on the radar screen, but remains a lower priority than other
   issues. To assist the office in making decisions that are based on sound
   scientific information, further research is needed into how management
   activities influence carbon storage and resilience of the landscape
   under climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Many geologic observations suggest that the eastern portion of the
   Tibetan Plateau has expanded eastward and grown in height over the past
   15-10 Ma, and other observations suggest that climate over the
   northwestern Indian subcontinent ({''}NW India{''}) became more arid
   between similar to 11 and 7 Ma. We suggest that they are linked: higher
   terrain increased orographic precipitation over eastern Tibet, which
   diabatically heated the atmosphere there; that heating then forced
   subsidence to the west via the mechanism proposed by Rodwell and
   Hoskins; and subsidence suppressed rainfall. Simple Gill-model
   calculations for a heat source displaced from the equator show such
   subsidence, and a regression of July-August outgoing long-wave radiation
   (OLR) over southeastern Tibet with rainfall shows a negative
   relationship between eastern Tibet and NW India, consistent with the
   proposed link between growth of eastern Tibet and diminished South Asian
   monsoon rainfall over the northwestern Indian subcontinent. Citation:

Abstract = {{Uncertainty in the future atmospheric burden of methane, a potent
   greenhouse gas(1), represents an important challenge to the development
   of realistic climate projections. The Arctic is home to large reservoirs
   of methane, in the form of permafrost soils and methane hydrates(2),
   which are vulnerable to destabilization in a warming climate.
   Furthermore, methane is produced in the surface ocean(3) and the surface
   waters of the Arctic Ocean are supersaturated with respect to
   methane(4,5). However, the fate of this oceanic methane is uncertain.
   Here, we use airborne observations of methane to assess methane efflux
   from the remote Arctic Ocean, up to latitudes of 82 degrees north. We
   report layers of increased methane concentrations near the surface
   ocean, with little or no enhancement in carbon monoxide levels,
   indicative of a non-combustion source. We further show that high methane
   concentrations are restricted to areas over open leads and regions with
   fractional sea-ice cover. Based on the observed gradients in methane
   concentration, we estimate that sea-air fluxes amount to around 2 mg
   d(-1) m(-2), comparable to emissions seen on the Siberian shelf. We
   suggest that the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean represent a
   potentially important source of methane, which could prove sensitive to
   changes in sea-ice cover.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate possible linear waves and nonlinear wave interactions in

   simulations. For sharp interfaces, we obtain analytic solutions for the
   admissible linear mode-one parent/signature waves that exist in the
   system. For diffuse interfaces, we compute the overtaking interaction of
   nonlinear mode-two solitary waves. Mathematically, owing to a small loss
   of energy to dispersive tails during the interaction, the waves are not
   solitons. However, this energy loss is extremely minute, and because the
   dispersively coupled waves in the system exhibit the three types of Lax
   KdV interactions, we conclude that for all intents and purposes the
   solitary waves exhibit soliton behavior.}},

Abstract = {{There has been considerable recent research into the connection between
   Parkinson's disease (PD) and speech impairment. Recently, a wide range
   of speech signal processing algorithms (dysphonia measures) aiming to
   predict PD symptom severity using speech signals have been introduced.
   In this paper, we test how accurately these novel algorithms can be used
   to discriminate PD subjects from healthy controls. In total, we compute
   132 dysphonia measures from sustained vowels. Then, we select four
   parsimonious subsets of these dysphonia measures using four feature
   selection algorithms, and map these feature subsets to a binary
   classification response using two statistical classifiers: random
   forests and support vector machines. We use an existing database
   consisting of 263 samples from 43 subjects, and demonstrate that these
   new dysphonia measures can outperform state-of-the-art results, reaching
   almost 99\% overall classification accuracy using only ten dysphonia
   features. We find that some of the recently proposed dysphonia measures
   complement existing algorithms in maximizing the ability of the
   classifiers to discriminate healthy controls from PD subjects. We see
   these results as an important step toward noninvasive diagnostic
   decision support in PD.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments involving monodisperse Geldart Group B particles have been
   carried out in a pilot-scale riser of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB).
   Several combinations of superficial gas velocity (U-s), solid flux
   (G(s)), average particle diameter (d(ave)), and particle material
   density (rho(s)) were investigated. Surprisingly, the experiments reveal
   the presence of a reverse core-annulus profile (i.e., a dense core with
   a dilute annulus) under certain conditions. Specifically, for the large
   glass beads (d(ave) = 650 mu m, rho(s) = 2500 kg/m(3)), the reverse
   coreannulus profile was observed near the top of the riser for all U-s
   and G(s) combinations examined. For high-density polyethylene (HDPE)
   pellets (d(ave) = 650 mu m, rho(s)=900 kg/m(3)) of the same d(ave),
   reverse coreannulus was observed at the top of the riser only at
   relatively low G(s). However, for the smaller glass beads (d(ave)= 170
   mu m, rho(s)= 2500 kg/m(3)), the traditional core-annulus profile was
   observed for all U-s and G(s) combinations. Although previous work
   provides possible explanations for this behavior (gas-phase turbulence,
   etc.), the evidence obtained in this system suggests a novel dominant
   factor for reverse core-annulus flow: the particle Stokes number (St).
   Lower-St particles are more apt to follow the gas exiting the riser,
   while higher-St particles have a longer relaxation time and thus are
   more likely to re-enter the riser after collision with the roughened
   rounded-elbow exit. Accordingly, the re-direction of particles from the
   rounded-elbow exit and back into riser due to large-scale roughness
   along the elbow is greater for higher-St particles. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The functionalization of fine primary particles, including nanoparticles
   and nanotubes, is easily carried out using atomic or molecular layer
   deposition (ALD or MLD, respectively) techniques. Particle ALD/MLD can
   be used to deposit conformal and pinhole-free films of refractory
   oxides, non-oxides, metals, and hybrid polymer-based materials, amongst
   others. Fluidized bed reactors are well-suited for large scale
   operations and can be operated at reduced pressures while using inert
   gases necessary for standard self-limiting, flow-based ALD/MLD
   processes. The continuous-flow processing allows for process control
   using an in-line mass spectrometer downstream from the reactor chamber.
   Many insulating, semiconducting, metallic, polymeric and hybrid
   inorganic/organic films have been successfully deposited on primary
   particle surfaces in fluidized bed reactors using a variety of precursor
   types. This paper reviews some of the Particle ALD/MLD work carried out
   by the authors, including techniques and measurements used in Particle
   ALD/MLD. Some current and future applications of functionalized or

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used to deposit ceramic films on
   the surfaces of particles to improve the slurry and dry powder rheology
   of bulk powders. An overview of several studies is presented here, which
   demonstrates the extent and limitations for this ceramic coating
   platform technology to improve the tribological and/or flow properties
   of microfine and ultrafine particles. Direct evidence of the effect of
   the nanoscale ceramic coatings is shown via a significant improvement in
   flow properties of dry particles, including dynamic, bulk and shear
   properties obtained using a FT4 Powder Rheometer, and a marked reduction
   in slurry viscosity at high solids loadings. Microfine zinc powders,
   similar to those used in alkaline batteries, have been coated using
   boron nitride ALD films of sub-nanometer thickness, or about 0.1 wt.\%.
   The low surface energy coatings reduced the cohesion of 1-5 mu m
   particles by 52\%. A highly-loaded slurry of the same material in
   concentrated KOH showed a 10-30\% reduction in slurry viscosity over a
   range of shear rates, with a shear-thinning effect at high shear rates.
   Boron nitride platelets were coated using Al2O3 and SiO2 films to change
   the surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The coated and
   uncoated powders were dispersed into an epoxy to evaluate the solids
   loading to viscosity ratio. The ALD films improved the particle-resin
   adhesion and decreased the viscosity of equivalently-loaded slurry of
   uncoated powder. Coated microfine nickel, aluminum and iron powders were
   also dispersed into epoxies, and lower viscosities and yield stresses
   were observed due to ceramic-epoxy interactions being more favorable
   than metallic-epoxy interactions. The ALD platform can be used to modify
   surfaces of primary particles in order to change the interparticle and
   particle-liquid forces, which provides a lubricating effect without
   detracting from the bulk properties of the core particles themselves.

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells play a key role in determining adaptive immunity, and
   there is growing interest in characterizing and manipulating the
   interactions between dendritic cells and biomaterial surfaces. Contact
   with several common biomaterials can induce the maturation of immature
   dendritic cells, but substrates that reduce dendritic cell maturation
   are of particular interest within the field of cell-based therapeutics
   where the goal is to reduce the immune response to cell-laden material
   carriers. In this study, we use a materials-based strategy to
   functionalize poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels with immobilized
   immunosuppressive factors (TGF-beta 1 and IL-10) to reduce the
   maturation of immature dendritic cells. TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 are
   commonly employed as soluble factors to program dendritic cells in
   vitro, and we demonstrate that these proteins retain bioactivity towards
   dendritic cells when immobilized on hydrogel surfaces. Following
   stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or cytokines, a dendritic
   cell line interacting with the surfaces of immunosuppressive hydrogels
   expressed reduced markers of maturation, including IL-12 and MHCII. The
   bioactivity of these immunomodulatory hydrogels was further confirmed
   with primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) isolated from
   non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as quantified by a decrease in activation
   markers and a significantly reduced capacity to activate T cells.
   Furthermore, by introducing a second signal to promote BMDC-material
   interactions combined with the presentation of tolerizing signals, the
   multifunctional PEG hydrogels were found to further increase signaling
   towards BMDCs, as evidenced by greater reductions in maturation markers.

Abstract = {{We present the first investigation that explores the effects of an
   isolated topographic ridge on thermal convection in a planetary
   core-like geometry and using core-like fluid properties (i.e. using a
   liquid metal-like low Prandtl number fluid). The models mean azimuthal
   flow resonates with the ridge and results in the excitation of a
   stationary topographic Rossby wave. This wave generates recirculating
   regions that remain fixed to the mantle reference frame. Associated with
   these regions is a strong longitudinally dependent heat flow along the
   inner core boundary; this effect may control the location of melting and
   solidification on the inner core boundary. Theoretical considerations
   and the results of our simulations suggest that the wavenumber of the
   resonant wave, LR, scales as Ro-1/2, where Ro is the Rossby number. This
   scaling indicates that small-scale flow structures {[}wavenumber ] in
   the core can be excited by a topographic feature on the coremantle
   boundary. The effects of strong magnetic diffusion in the core must then
   be invoked to generate a stationary magnetic signature that is
   comparable to the scale of observed geomagnetic structures {[}].}},

Abstract = {{Algal flocculation using naturally-available ions in brackish water was
   evaluated as a technique to rapidly settle algae while minimizing
   flocculant costs. Basicity-induced flocculation using
   naturally-available ions with NaOH addition was used as surrogate for an
   autoflocculation process at photosynthetically-elevated pH. Flocculation
   was attempted with a variety of precipitating ions, including Mg2+,
   Ca-2, and C-3(2-). Satisfactory flocculation was only achieved in the
   presence of Mg2+, while extensive CaCO3 precipitation yielded only
   partial, presumably sweep, flocculation. The flocculation was
   characterized by the settling-rate distribution, measured via light
   attenuation. Using Mg2- dependent flocculation, an optimum pH was
   observed at which rapid settling was achieved with minimal
   precipitation. Further base addition caused extensive Mg(OH)(2)
   precipitation, formation of loose macroflocs, and a reduction of
   settling rate. Experiments demonstrated that both increased Mg2+
   concentration during growth and the presence of extracellular organic
   matter necessitated a higher flocculation pH and greater Mg2 depletion.
   A proof-of-concept flocculation was demonstrated in surrogate media
   previously developed to mimic brackish waters of the southwestern United
   States (Barclay et al., 1987). These flocculations achieved median
   settling rates of at least 100 cm/h, more than 100-fold greater than the
   settling rate of unflocculated cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study presents spatiotemporally-resolved measurements of surface
   shear-stress tau (s) in live plant canopies and rigid wooden cube arrays
   to identify the sheltering capability against sediment erosion of these
   different roughness elements. Live plants have highly irregular
   structures that can be extremely flexible and porous resulting in
   considerable changes to the drag and flow regimes relative to rigid
   imitations mainly used in other wind-tunnel studies. Mean velocity and
   kinematic Reynolds stress profiles show that well-developed natural
   boundary layers were generated above the 8 m long wind-tunnel test
   section covered with the roughness elements at four different roughness
   densities (lambda = 0, 0.017, 0.08, 0.18). Speed-up around the cubes
   caused higher peak surface shear stress than in experiments with plants
   at all roughness densities, demonstrating the more effective sheltering
   ability of the plants. The sheltered areas in the lee of the plants are
   significantly narrower with higher surface shear stress than those found
   in the lee of the cubes, and are dependent on the wind speed due to the
   plants ability to streamline with the flow. This streamlining behaviour
   results in a decreasing sheltering effect at increasing wind speeds and
   in lower net turbulence production than in experiments with cubes.
   Turbulence intensity distributions suggest a suppression of horseshoe
   vortices in the plant case. Comparison of the surface shear-stress
   measurements with sediment erosion patterns shows that the fraction of
   time a threshold skin friction velocity is exceeded can be used to
   assess erosion of, and deposition on, that surface.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate modeling of the optical properties of atmospheric mineral dust
   is important for climate modeling calculations and remote sensing data
   retrievals. Atmospheric mineral dust in the accumulation mode size range
   is often rich in silicate clays including kaolinite and like. This is
   important because dust optical properties depend on particle shape, and
   fundamental clay particles are known to consist of very thin flakes.
   In this combined laboratory and modeling study, we investigate the
   optical properties (IR extinction and visible light scattering) of two
   samples of silicate clay dust aerosol, kaolinite and illite. Particle
   size distributions are measured simultaneously with the optical
   properties. T-Matrix theory based simulations using a spheroidal
   particle approximation are compared with experimental data. We find that
   the full range of visible scattering and polarimetry data, and IR
   extinction profiles are not well fit by assuming a single size-shape
   distribution for the aerosol. In contrast, a simple bimodal distribution
   model that treats small particles (fundamental clay flakes) in the
   distribution as highly eccentric oblate spheroids with axial ratio
   parameters >= 5, but approximates larger particles by a more moderate
   shape distribution with axial ratio parameters < 3, gives better
   agreement with the full range of experimental data. These conclusions
   are consistent with mineralogical data on the dimensions of fundamental
   clay particles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the influences of dust on atmospheric composition, climate,
   and human health requires accurate knowledge of dust emissions, but
   large uncertainties persist in quantifying mineral sources. This study
   presents a new method for combined use of satellite-measured radiances
   and inverse modeling to spatially constrain the amount and location of
   dust emissions. The technique is illustrated with a case study in May
   2008; the dust emissions in Taklimakan and Gobi deserts are spatially
   optimized using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and its adjoint
   constrained by aerosol optical depth (AOD) that are derived over the
   downwind dark-surface region in China from MODIS (Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer) reflectance with the aerosol single
   scattering properties consistent with GEOS-chem. The adjoint inverse
   modeling yields an overall 51\% decrease in prior dust emissions
   estimated by GEOS-Chem over the Taklimakan-Gobi area, with more
   significant reductions south of the Gobi Desert. The model simulation
   with optimized dust emissions shows much better agreement with
   independent observations from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging
   SpectroRadiometer) AOD and MODIS Deep Blue AOD over the dust source
   region and surface PM10 concentrations. The technique of this study can
   be applied to global multi-sensor remote sensing data for constraining
   dust emissions at various temporal and spatial scales, and hence
   improving the quantification of dust effects on climate, air quality,
   and human health. Citation: Wang, J., X. Xu, D. K. Henze, J. Zeng, Q.

Abstract = {{We have discovered a 2.5 Mpc (projected) long filament of
   infrared-bright galaxies connecting two of the three similar to 5 x
   10(14) M-circle dot clusters making up the RCS 2319+00 supercluster at z
   = 0.9. The filament is revealed in a deep Herschel Spectral and
   Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) map that shows 250-500 mu m
   emission associated with a spectroscopically identified filament of
   galaxies spanning two X-ray bright cluster cores. We estimate that the
   total (8-1000 mu m) infrared luminosity of the filament is L-IR similar
   or equal to 5 x 10(12) L-circle dot, which, if due to star formation
   alone, corresponds to a total SFR similar or equal to 900 M-circle dot
   yr(-1). We are witnessing the scene of the buildup of a >10(15) M-circle
   dot cluster of galaxies, seen prior to the merging of three massive
   components, each of which already contains a population of red, passive
   galaxies that formed at z > 2. The infrared filament demonstrates that
   significant stellar mass assembly is taking place in the moderate
   density, dynamically active circumcluster environments of the most
   massive clusters at high redshift, and this activity is concomitant with
   the hierarchical buildup of large-scale structure.}},

Abstract = {{Thus far, studies on the effects of the polydisperse size distribution
   on the minimum particle entrainment velocity (U-PU) in horizontal
   pneumatic transport are limited to binary mixtures of sandlike
   particles. Herein we experimentally investigate U-PU of ternary mixtures
   involving large (i.e., 400 and 170 mu m) and fine particles (40 mu m),
   where the roles of the fine particles in the entrainment of the large
   particles are elucidated. The presence of the 40 mu m particles below
   approximate to 20\% (w/w) enhances the entrainment of the 400 and 170 mu
   m particles attributed to the high interstitial velocity of the
   conveying air because the fine particles occupy the interstitial spaces
   of the larger particles. Similar to monodisperse particles, a master
   curve of the particle Reynolds number versus Archimedes number is
   obtained for the ternary mixtures. From the master curve, a new
   empirical correlation for polydisperse U-PU is derived using the Sauter
   mean diameter, where improved U-PU predictions are demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent phonon transmission across dissimilar material interfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the size effects on the phonon transmission
   across material interfaces using the atomistic Green's function method.
   Layered Si and Ge or Ge-like structures are modeled with a variety of
   confined sizes in both transverse and longitudinal directions. The
   dynamical equation of the lattice vibration (phonon waves) is solved
   using the Green's function method and the phonon transmission is
   calculated through the obtained Green's function. Phonon transmission
   across a single interface of semi-infinite Si and Ge materials is
   studied first for the validation of the methodology. We show that phonon
   transmission across an interface can be tuned by changing the mass ratio
   of the two materials. Multi-layered superlattice-like structures with
   longitudinal size confinement are then studied. Frequency-dependent
   phonon transmission as a function of both the number of periods and the
   period thickness is reported. A converged phonon transmission after ten
   periods is observed due to the formation of phonon minibands.
   Frequency-dependent phonon transmission with transverse size confinement
   is also studied for the interface of Si and Ge nanowire-like structures.
   The phonon confinement induces new dips and peaks of phonon transmission
   when compared with the results for a bulk interface. With increasing
   size in the transverse direction, the phonon transmission approaches
   that of a bulk Si/Ge interface.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4, 1}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{An intriguing phenomenon displayed by granular flows and predicted by
   kinetic-theory-based models is the instability known as particle
   ``clustering,{''} which refers to the tendency of dissipative grains to
   form transient, loose regions of relatively high concentration. In this
   work, we assess a modified-Sonine approximation recently proposed
   {[}Garzo, Santos, and Montanero, Physica A 376, 94 (2007)] for a
   granular gas via an examination of system stability. In particular, we
   determine the critical length scale associated with the onset of two
   types of instabilities-vortices and clusters-via stability analyses of
   the Navier-Stokes-order hydrodynamic equations by using the expressions
   of the transport coefficients obtained from both the standard and the
   modified-Sonine approximations. We examine the impact of both Sonine
   approximations over a range of solids fraction phi < 0.2 for small
   restitution coefficients e = 0.25-0.4, where the standard and modified
   theories exhibit discrepancies. The theoretical predictions for the
   critical length scales are compared to molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations, of which a small percentage were not considered due to
   inelastic collapse. Results show excellent quantitative agreement
   between MD and the modified-Sonine theory, while the standard theory
   loses accuracy for this highly dissipative parameter space. The modified
   theory also remedies a high-dissipation qualitative mismatch between the
   standard theory and MD for the instability that forms more readily.
   Furthermore, the evolution of cluster size is briefly examined via MD,
   indicating that domain-size clusters may remain stable or halve in size,
   depending on system parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A series of cross-linked poly(vinylimidazolium)-RTIL gel membranes was
   synthesized and evaluated for room-temperature, ideal CO2/N-2, CO2/CH4,
   and CO2/H-2 separation performance. The membranes were formed by
   photo-polymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol)-functionalized
   cross-linking (i.e., di-functional) and non-cross-linking (i.e.,
   mono-functional) vinylimidazolium RTIL monomers with nonpolymerizable,
   ``free RTIL.{''} The effect of free RTIL ({[}emim]{[}Tf2N]) loading on
   CO2 separation performance was evaluated by varying RTIL loading at
   three levels (45, 65, and 75 wt.\%). The effect of cross-linker content
   on CO2 separation performance was also evaluated by varying the
   copolymer composition of cross-linked membranes from 5 to 100 mol\%
   di-functional monomer. The substituent on the monofunctional RTIL
   monomer was also varied to investigate the effect of substituent
   structure and chemistry on CO2 separation performance. CO2 permeability
   was dramatically increased with higher loading of free RTIL. Increased
   RTIL loading had no effect on CO2/N-2 or CO2/CH4 permeability
   selectivity, but significantly improved CO2/H-2 permeability
   selectivity. Reducing the cross-linking monomer concentration generally
   improved CO2 permeability. However, anomalous permeability and
   selectivity behavior was observed below critical concentrations of
   cross-linker. The effect of the substituent on the monofunctional
   monomer on CO2 separation performance was minimal compared to the
   effects of RTIL loading and copolymer composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There are distinct advantages to designing polymer systems that afford
   two distinct sets of material properties an intermediate polymer that
   would enable optimum handling and processing of the material, while
   maintaining the ability to tune in different, final polymer properties
   that enable the optimal functioning of the material. In this study, by
   designing a series of non-stoichiometric thiol-acrylate systems, a
   polymer network is initially formed via a base catalyzed Michael
   addition reaction that proceeds stoichiometrically via the
   thiol-acrylate click reaction. This self-limiting reaction results in a
   polymer with excess acrylic functional groups within the network. At a
   later point in time, the photoinitiated, free radical polymerization of
   the excess acrylic functional groups results in a highly crosslinked,
   robust material system. These two stage reactive thiol-acrylate networks
   that have intermediate stage rubbery moduli and glass transition
   temperatures that range from 0.5 MPa and -10 degrees C to 22 MPa and 22
   degrees C, respectively, are formulated and characterized. The same
   polymer networks can then attain glass transition temperatures that
   range from 5 degrees C to 195 degrees C and rubbery moduli of up to 200
   MPa after the subsequent photocuring stage. The two stage reactive
   networks formed by varying the stoichiometric ratios of the thiol and
   acrylate monomers were shown to perform as substrates for three specific
   applications: shape memory polymers, impression materials, and as
   optical materials for writing refractive index patterns.}},

Title = {{Ab initio theory of phase stability and structural selectivity in Fe-Pd
   alloys}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{In Fe-Pd alloys, the competing geometric (fcc versus bcc) and magnetic
   tendencies result in rich phase stability and ordering physics. Here, we
   study these alloys via a first principles mixed-basis cluster expansion
   (CE) approach. Highly accurate fcc and bcc CEs are iteratively and
   self-consistently constructed using a genetic algorithm, based on the
   first principles results for similar to 100 ordered structures. The
   structural and magnetic ``filters{''} are introduced to determine
   whether a fully relaxed structure is of fcc/bcc and high-/low-spin
   types. All structures satisfying the Lifshitz condition for stability in
   extended phase diagram regions are included as inputs to our CEs. We
   find that in a wide composition range (with more than 1/3 atomic content
   of Fe), an fcc-constrained alloy has a single stable ordered compound,
   L1(0) FePd. However, L1(0) is higher in energy than the phase-separated
   mixture of bcc Fe and fcc-FePd2 (beta 2 structure) at low temperatures.
   In the Pd-rich composition range, we find several fcc beta 2-like ground
   states: FePd2 (beta 2), Fe3Pd9, Fe2Pd7, FePd5, Fe2Pd13, and FePd8, yet
   we do not find FePd3 with the the experimentally observed L1(2)
   structure. Fcc Monte Carlo simulations show a transformation from any of
   the attempted beta 2-like ground states directly into a disordered
   alloy. We suggest that the phonon and/or spin excitation contributions
   to the free energy are responsible for the observed stability of L1(2)
   at higher temperatures, and likely lead to a beta 2 <-> L1(2)
   transition. Finally, we present here a complete characterization of all
   the fcc and bcc Lifshitz structures, i.e., the structures with ordering
   vectors exclusively at high-symmetry k points.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical formation of hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) from
   effluent organic matter (EfOM) was evaluated using three bulk wastewater
   samples collected at different treatment facilities under simulated
   sunlight. For the samples studied, the formation rates of HO center dot
   (R-HO center dot) were obtained from the formation rate of phenol
   following the hydroxylation of benzene. The values of R-HO center dot
   ranged from 2.3 to 3.8 x 10(-10) M s(-1) for the samples studied. The
   formation rate of HO center dot from nitrate photolysis (R-NO3(HO center
   dot)) was determined to be 3.0 x 10(-7) M-HO center dot M-NO3(-1) s(-1).
   The HO center dot production rate from EfOM (R-EfOM(HO)) ranged from
   0.76 to 1.3 x 10(-10) M s(-1). For the wastewater samples studied,
   R-EfOM(HO center dot) varied from 1.5 to 2.4 x 10(-7) M-HO center dot
   M-C(-1) s(-1) on molar carbon basis, which was dose to HO center dot
   production from nitrate photolysis. The apparent quantum yield for the
   formation of HO center dot from nitrate (Phi(a)(NO3-HO center dot)) was
   determined as 0.010 +/- 0.001 for the wavelength range 290-400 nm in
   ultrapure water. The apparent quantum yield for HO center dot formation
   in EfOM (Phi(a)(EfOM-HO center dot)) ranged from 6.1 to 9.8 x 10(-5),
   compared to 2.99 to 4.56 x 10-5 for organic matter (OM) isolates. The
   results indicate that wastewater effluents could produce significant
   concentrations of HO center dot, as shown by potential higher nitrate
   levels and relatively higher quantum yields of HO center dot fori-nation
   from EfOM.}},

Abstract = {{We present an overview and analysis of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
   sampled in California by a NOAA WP-3D aircraft during the 2010 CalNex
   project. Four distinct geographical regions are characterized, including
   the Los Angeles basin, the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, and the
   eastern Pacific Ocean west of southern California. Median size
   distributions in the Central Valley were unimodal (D-g similar to 25 nm)
   with a larger fraction of organic species and smaller fraction of
   nitrate species in the Sacramento Valley aerosol than in the San Joaquin
   Valley aerosol. Size distributions in the Los Angeles basin and marine
   outflow were bimodal (geometric mean diameter, D-g similar to 30, 90-100
   nm) with similar organic fractions and some replacement of nitrate with
   sulfate in the marine outflow. Both fine particle and CCN concentrations
   were found to decrease rapidly above the planetary boundary layer
   (similar to 2 km altitude), with CCN concentrations in the boundary
   layer ranging from similar to 10(2)-10(4) cm(-3) STP, while fine
   particle concentrations (0.004-1 mu m diameters) ranged from similar to
   10(3)-10(5) cm(-3) STP. The CCN-active number fraction varied between
   0-100\% in the Los Angeles Basin and Marine Outflow, but was
   substantially lower (0-40\%) in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys.
   Values of the hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, inferred from the CCN
   measurements varied from 0.1-0.25, with the highest values in the marine
   outflow and the lowest values in the Sacramento Valley. The k values
   agreed well with the predictions based on size-resolved aerosol
   composition, but were overpredicted by almost twofold when size-averaged
   composition was used. CCN closure was assessed for simplified
   compositional and mixing state assumptions, and it was found that
   assuming the aerosol to be internally mixed overpredicted CCN
   concentrations by 30-75\% for all air mass types except within the
   Sacramento Valley, where good closure (overprediction < 10\%) was
   achieved by assuming insoluble organics. Assuming an externally-mixed
   aerosol fraction or incorporating size-resolved composition data
   improved closure in the other three regions, consistent with the bimodal
   nature of the aerosol size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing
   research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued
   to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our
   knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding.
   Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring
   autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the
   range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless,
   there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure
   autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that
   needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between
   measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements
   (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic
   process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e.,
   the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in
   autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that
   result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy
   induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within,
   lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as
   Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it
   is especially important that investigators new to the field understand
   that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate
   with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate
   because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant
   change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes
   may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set
   of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by
   investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes,
   as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable
   critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These
   guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the
   appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the
   system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is
   guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we
   strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In
   these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing
   autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them.
   Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy
   assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Energy transfer between two optical centers has long been used to
   promote the down-and up-conversion of light. In conventional phosphors,
   the two centers are distributed uniformly in 3D space and the
   luminescence efficiency is generally limited by energy transfer to
   defect states, where the excitation is quenched through non-radiative
   processes. In this paper, we present a new concept of low-dimensional
   doping of pairs of optical centers and explore its effect on enhancing
   the efficiency of down-and up-converted luminescence. The concept takes
   advantage of the fact that the low-dimensional doping profile
   significantly reduces the energy transfer rate to unintentional defects,
   which are naturally distributed in 3D space. The resultant de-coupling
   between optical centers and defects can lead to a substantial increase
   in luminescence efficiency.
   We first present the theoretical framework and apply the theory to
   well-characterized down-and up-conversion phosphors. For
   BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+, Mn2+ down-conversion phosphor, a factor of two
   increase in efficiency is predicted. For Na2Y3F11:Yb3+, Er3+
   up-conversion phosphor, low-dimensional doping did not lead to increase
   in efficiency. This is because the major quenching mechanism is
   cross-relaxation between Er3+ ions, not energy transfer to defects. In
   an ideal up-conversion phosphor, where defect quenching is the dominant
   loss mechanism, similar increases (by a factor of 2-5) are predicted.
   This work presents a new pathway to engineer luminescent materials and
   achieve high luminescence efficiencies in up-and down-conversion
   phosphors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Encapsulation of autologous adult cartilage cells (chondrocytes) in
   hydrolytically degradable hydrogels may provide a clinically viable
   tissue engineering therapy for replacement of damaged or osteoarthritic
   cartilage. When designing a tissue engineering scaffold, it is crucial
   to evaluate adult chondrocytes due to their limited growth potential.
   The objective for this study was to compare extracellular matrix
   anabolic and catabolic metabolisms by juvenile and adult chondrocytes in
   hydrolytically degradable hydrogels. Cells were photo-encapsulated in
   bimodal degradable hydrogels composed of slow-degrading poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) and the fast-degrading copolymer oligo(lactic
   acid)-b-PEG-b-oligo(lactic acid) crosslinks, and cultured through four
   weeks. Cell density was significantly higher in constructs containing
   adult cells, contributing to higher glycosaminoglycan content per wet
   weight. However, juvenile cells exhibited higher collagen content per
   cell. Immunohistochemical visualization revealed cartilage-specific
   aggrecan and collagen II deposition by both adult and juvenile cells.
   Immunohistochemically stained catabolically degraded collagen fragments
   and western blot-detected degraded aggrecan fragments, especially those
   associated with an osteoarthritic state, were more abundant in
   constructs with adult cells. Overall, bimodal degradable hydrogel
   environments were supportive of viable adult cells. However, major
   challenges with adult cells include their reduced collagen productivity
   and high catabolic activity, which may impact the quality of the
   engineered tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The ``Ice Giants{''} Uranus and Neptune are a different class of planet
   compared to Jupiter and Saturn. Studying these objects is important for
   furthering our understanding of the formation and evolution of the
   planets, and unravelling the fundamental physical and chemical processes
   in the Solar System. The importance of filling these gaps in our
   knowledge of the Solar System is particularly acute when trying to apply
   our understanding to the numerous planetary systems that have been
   discovered around other stars. The Uranus Pathfinder (UP) mission thus
   represents the quintessential aspects of the objectives of the European
   planetary community as expressed in ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025. UP
   was proposed to the European Space Agency's M3 call for medium-class
   missions in 2010 and proposed to be the first orbiter of an Ice Giant
   planet. As the most accessible Ice Giant within the M-class mission
   envelope Uranus was identified as the mission target. Although not
   selected for this call the UP mission concept provides a baseline
   framework for the exploration of Uranus with existing low-cost platforms
   and underlines the need to develop power sources suitable for the outer
   Solar System. The UP science case is based around exploring the origins,
   evolution, and processes at work in Ice Giant planetary systems. Three
   broad themes were identified: (1) Uranus as an Ice Giant, (2) An Ice
   Giant planetary system, and (3) An asymmetric magnetosphere. Due to the
   long interplanetary transfer from Earth to Uranus a significant
   cruise-phase science theme was also developed. The UP mission concept
   calls for the use of a Mars Express/Rosetta-type platform to launch on a
   Soyuz-Fregat in 2021 and entering into an eccentric polar orbit around
   Uranus in the 2036-2037 timeframe. The science payload has a strong
   heritage in Europe and beyond and requires no significant technology
   developments.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment to measure granular temperature in a sheared low density
   granular bed containing a range of sizes of particles has been
   performed. Using positron emission particle tracking, a single particle
   was tracked from different size phases. From the coordinate data, the
   second moment of the velocity fluctuations about the mean flow in each
   direction was determined. It was found that the larger particles are
   ``hotter{''} and that most of the energy is contained in the theta
   (shearing) direction fluctuations. Evidence was found for Knudsen layer
   and higher order Burnett effects, suggesting extensions of the
   Navier-Stokes approaches are necessary to describe heat transport in
   polydisperse systems.}},

Title = {{A moving-frame boundary-integral method for particle transport in
   microchannels of complex shape}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A new, three-dimensional algorithm is developed to accurately simulate
   low-Reynolds number, flow-driven motion of a neutrally buoyant spherical
   particle in plane-parallel microchannels of complex shape. The channel
   profile may consist of an arbitrary number of straight line segments
   with sharp corners in an arbitrary configuration. This geometry provides
   a suitable model for particle transport in many microfluidic devices
   with multiple branch bifurcations. The particle may be comparable with
   the narrowest channel dimensions, but is typically much smaller than the
   overall channel domain, which creates difficulties with a standard
   boundary-integral approach. To make simulations feasible, the 3D problem
   is solved locally in a computational cell that is smaller than the full
   domain and is dynamically constructed around the particle as it moves
   through the channel; the outer boundary conditions are provided by the
   2D flow that would exist in the channel in the absence of the particle.
   Difficulties with particle-corner close interactions are alleviated
   using special iterative techniques, (near-) singularity subtractions and
   corner-fitted, gap-adaptive discretizations of the cell boundary. The
   algorithm is applied to simulate ``pinched-flow fractionation{''} and
   predict how particle interactions with a narrow pinch region and sharp
   corners result in particle focusing and separation in the outlet
   according to their size. As another application, the particle motion
   through a T-bifurcation with sharp corners is simulated, with
   calculation of the particle flux partition ratio for a broad range of
   parameters. It is demonstrated how the particle-corner interactions can
   make the side branch inaccessible to particles, even for relatively
   strong fluid suction through this branch. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The United States Green Building Council (USGBC)-sponsored Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building program represents
   the largest program in the United States for the measurement,
   verification, and certification of green buildings. A recent study found
   that LEED-certified buildings have accounted for a higher injury rate
   than comparative traditional non-LEED buildings. This finding served as
   the impetus for the present study, which aimed to identify and evaluate
   the safety and health risks associated with the design elements and
   construction management practices implemented to achieve LEED
   certification. To explore this topic, six detailed case studies and two
   validation case studies were conducted following a strict protocol
   developed from guiding literature. The results indicate that (1) workers
   on LEED construction projects are exposed to work at height, with
   electrical current, near unstable soils, and near heavy equipment for a
   greater period of time than workers on traditional projects; (2) workers
   are exposed to new high-risk tasks such as constructing atria,
   installing green roofs, and installing photovoltaic (PV) panels; and (3)
   some credits result in a positive impact on construction worker safety
   and health when low volatile organic compound (VOC) adhesives and
   sealants are specified. It is expected that these results can be used by
   practitioners to focus attention and resources on new highrisk work

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Despite improvements in safety performance over the past 30 years, the
   construction industry still accounts for an injury-and-illness rate that
   is approximately five times greater than the all-industry average. This
   disproportionate injury-and-illness rate has been attributed, in part,
   to the complex, dynamic, and transient nature of construction projects.
   To address these challenges, construction organizations must be able to
   adapt to change by effectively identifying, capturing, storing, and
   transferring safety knowledge. To investigate how safety-knowledge
   management strategies are employed in the construction industry, 11 case
   studies were conducted with a geographically dispersed sample of
   American general contractors. The sample was stratified by experience
   modification rate (EMR), a relative measure of safety performance. The
   results of the case studies indicate that construction organizations
   tend to acquire safety knowledge from a variety of internal and external
   sources, but have ineffective knowledge storage and transfer systems,
   which impede the ability of the workforce to obtain critical knowledge
   to solve urgent safety-related problems. High-performing organizations
   were distinguished by their ability to manage tacit safety knowledge
   with formal processes such as data-entry systems that capture reactions
   to safety situations from experienced workers and safety mentoring.
   Other innovative strategies include acquiring tacit safety knowledge
   during safety stand-downs through interviews with workers and storing
   safety knowledge in proprietary training videos. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fabrication and application of a micro-scale
   hybrid wicking structure in a flat polymer-based heat pipe heat
   spreader, which improves the heat transfer performance under high
   adverse acceleration. The hybrid wicking structure which enhances
   evaporation and condensation heat transfer under adverse acceleration
   consists of 100 mu m high, 200 mu m wide square electroplated copper
   micro-pillars with 31 mu m wide grooves for liquid flow and a woven
   copper mesh with 51 mu m diameter wires and 76 mu m spacing. The
   interior vapor chamber of the heat pipe heat spreader was 30x30x1.0
   mm(3). The casing of the heat spreader is a 100 mu m thick liquid
   crystal polymer which contains a two-dimensional array of copper-filled
   vias to reduce the overall thermal resistance. The device performance
   was assessed under 0-10 g acceleration with 20, 30 and 40 W power input
   on an evaporator area of 8x8 mm(2). The effective thermal conductivity
   of the device was determined to range from 1653 W (m K)(-1) at 0 g to
   541 W (m K)(-1) at 10 g using finite element analysis in conjunction
   with a copper reference sample. In all cases, the effective thermal
   conductivity remained higher than that of the copper reference sample.
   This work illustrates the possibility of fabricating flexible,
   polymer-based heat pipe heat spreaders compatible with standardized
   printed circuit board technologies that are capable of efficiently
   extracting heat at relatively high dynamic acceleration levels.}},

Abstract = {{A Soft-Sphere Discrete Element Method (SSDEM) is used to simulate the
   rotational reshaping and disruption of cohesionless self-gravitating
   granular aggregates (as a representation of ``rubble-pile{''}
   asteroids). Aggregates with spherical and ellipsoidal shapes are
   subjected to impulsive increments of their angular velocity to initiate
   a reshaping process leading up to the disruption of the aggregate.
   Internal stress fields are monitored during the process as well as
   critical angular velocities to initiate reshaping. In addition, the time
   evolution of other parameters such as filling fraction, angle of
   friction, mechanical energy, yield stress, semi-axes, density and mass
   dependence are also analysed. Several predictions from continuum theory
   are recovered in our simulations, in addition to further insight into
   the process by which cohesionless rubble piles can deform. Fundamentally
   different outcomes are found for frictionless grains and grains with
   surface friction modelled, verifying the importance of including such
   models in granular simulations. We find that the initiation of shape
   deformation is most consistently described by a Drucker-Prager failure
   criterion, which also provides an independent measure of the effective
   friction angle of our self-gravitating pile. Insight is also gained into
   the energetics of deformation, with most of the kinetic energy loss
   going into the deformation of the rubble pile, and a smaller component
   being internally dissipated. Finally, with this work we want to compare
   this computational approach with the theoretical predictions and, if
   possible, to mutually validate them. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   measurement accuracy is found to be < 10 cm (1 sigma) when
   short-baseline differential GPS processing is used to position the
   aircraft, and IMU data are used to correct for off-nadir pointing of the

Abstract = {{The high-performance camera control systems carried aboard the
   DigitalGlobe WorldView satellites, WorldView-1 and WorldView-2, are
   capable of rapid retargeting and high off-nadir imagery collection. This
   provides the capability to collect dozens of multiangle very high
   spatial resolution images over a large target area during a single
   overflight. In addition, WorldView-2 collects eight bands of
   multispectral data. This paper discusses the improvements in urban
   classification accuracy available through utilization of the spatial and
   spectral information from a WorldView-2 multiangle image sequence
   collected over Atlanta, GA, in December 2009. Specifically, the
   implications of adding height data and multiangle multispectral
   reflectance, both derived from the multiangle sequence, to the textural,
   morphological, and spectral information of a single WorldView-2 image
   are investigated. The results show an improvement in classification
   accuracy of 27\% and 14\% for the spatial and spectral experiments,
   respectively. Additionally, the multiangle data set allows the
   differentiation of classes not typically well identified by a single
   image, such as skyscrapers and bridges as well as flat and pitched
   roofs.}},

Abstract = {{Protective materials and structures found in natural organisms may
   inspire new armors with improved resistance to penetration, flexibility,
   light weight, and other interesting properties such as transparency and
   breathability. All these attributes can be found in teleost fish scales,
   which are the most common types of scales in modern fish species. In
   this work, we have studied the structure and mechanics of fish scales
   from striped bass (Morone saxatilis). This scale is about 200-300 mu m
   thick and consists of a hard outer bony layer supported by a softer
   cross-ply of collagen fibrils. Perforation tests with a sharp needle
   indicated that a single fish scale provides a high resistance to
   penetration which is superior to polystyrene and polycarbonate, two
   engineering polymers that are typically used for light transparent
   packaging or protective equipment. Under puncture, the scale undergoes a
   sequence of two distinct failure events: First, the outer bony layer
   cracks following a well defined cross-like pattern which generates four
   flaps of bony material. The deflection of the flaps by the needle is
   resisted by the collagen layer, which in biaxial tension acts as a
   retaining membrane. Remarkably this second stage of the penetration
   process is highly stable, so that an additional 50\% penetration force
   is required to eventually puncture the collagen layer. The combination
   of a hard layer that can fail in a controlled fashion with a soft and
   extensible backing layer is the key to the resistance to penetration of
   individual scales.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, ground-based observations of equinox diurnal tide wind
   fields from the first CAWSES Global Tidal Campaign are compared with
   results from five commonly used models, in order to identify systematic
   differences. WACCM3 and Extended CMAM are both self-consistent general
   circulation models, which resolve general climatological features, while
   TIME-GCM can be forced to approximate specific conditions using
   reanalysis fields. GSWM is a linear mechanistic model; while GEWM is an
   empirical model derived from ground-based and satellite observations.
   The models resolve diurnal tides consistent in latitudinal structure
   with observations, dominated by the upward propagating (1,1) mode. There
   is disagreement in the magnitudes of the tidal amplitudes and vertical
   wavelengths, while differences in longitudinal tidal variability
   indicate differences in the nonmigrating tides in the models. These
   points suggest inconsistencies in model forcing, dissipation, and
   background winds that must be examined as part of a coordinated effort
   from the modeling community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates how the mean zonal wind affects the propagation
   of tidal energy from the troposphere to the mesosphere-lower
   thermosphere (MLT) region (60-120 km). We diagnose the
   seasonal-latitudinal variation of the eastward-propagating diurnal tide
   with zonal wavenumber 3 (DE3), which is a prominent tidal component and
   agrees well between model and observation in recent studies. It is shown
   that during the course of a year the seasonal-latitudinal variation of
   mean zonal wind modulates and filters DE3 energy propagating upwards
   from tropospheric radiative and latent heating sources. Our results are
   based upon ISCCP and TRMM troposphere heating rates, SABER-derived zonal
   mean gradient wind, SABER tidal signatures and GSWM (the global-scale
   wave model) diagnoses. The tropospheric tidal heating rates are derived
   from ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) radiative
   fluxes and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) latent heating
   profiles together with TRMM rainfall rates. The zonal mean winds are
   derived from measurements of geopotential height from the SABER
   (sounding of the atmosphere with broadband emission radiometry)
   instrument on the TIMED (thermosphere, ionosphere, mesosphere energetics
   and dynamics) spacecraft, and the tidal signatures are determined from
   SABER temperature measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Polarization measurements have become nearly indispensible in lidar
   cloud and aerosol studies. Despite polarization's widespread use in
   lidar, its theoretical description has been widely varying in accuracy
   and completeness. Incomplete polarization lidar descriptions invariably
   result in poor accountability for scatterer properties and instrument
   effects, reducing data accuracy and disallowing the intercomparison of
   polarization lidar data between different systems. We introduce here the
   Stokes vector lidar equation, which is a full description of
   polarization in lidar from laser output to detector. We then interpret
   this theoretical description in the context of forward polar
   decomposition of Mueller matrices where distinct polarization attributes
   of diattenuation, retar-dance, and depolarization are elucidated. This
   decomposition can be applied to scattering matrices, where volumes
   consisting of randomly oriented particles are strictly depolarizing,
   while oriented ice crystals can be diattenuating, retarding, and
   depolarizing. For instrument effects we provide a description of how
   different polarization attributes will impact lidar measurements. This
   includes coupling effects due to retarding and depolarization attributes
   of the receiver, which have no description in scalar representations of
   polarization lidar. We also describe how the effects of polarizance in
   the receiver can result in nonorthogonal polarization detection

Abstract = {{Cell-based tissue engineering strategies have shown tremendous promise
   for the repair of bone mass deficiencies, but the efficient and
   appropriate induction of stem cells down osteogenic pathways remains a
   significant roadblock to the effective implementation of cell-based
   therapies. When grown in culture, human Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells
   (hMSCs) remain multipotent, requiring specific exogenous signals to
   induce osteogenic differentiation. hMSCs used in transplantations,
   therefore, must be presented with local signals, often provided by the
   host's own tissues, to be directed down bone-related lineages. This
   process is relatively inefficient and remains difficult to control. In
   an effort to enhance osteogenesis, hMSCs were transfected with specific
   miRNA mimics and inhibitors that had originally identified for their
   ability to increase Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity. Transfection
   with miRNA reagents had the effect of sensitizing hMSCs to soluble
   osteogenic factors, resulting in a rapid and robust induction of
   bone-related markers, including ALP activity and calcium deposition.
   Synthetic 3D tissue constructs prepared with miRNA-transfected hMSCs
   demonstrated similar responses to soluble osteogenic signals, suggesting
   that controlling miRNA activity in hMSCs can be an effective tool for
   enhancing the induction of osteogenesis for tissue engineering purposes.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a dense-phase
   treatment on the hydrodynamic description of granular, binary mixtures
   relative to a previous dilute-phase treatment. Two theories were
   considered for this purpose. The first, proposed by Garzo and Dufty (GD)
   {[}Phys. Fluids 14, 146 (2002)], is based on the Boltzmann equation
   which does not incorporate finite-volume effects, thereby limiting its
   use to dilute flows. The second, proposed by Garzo. Hrenya and Dufty
   (GHD){[}Phys. Rev. E 76, 31303 and 031304 (2007)], is derived from the
   Enskog equation which does account for finite-volume effects;
   accordingly this theory can be applied to moderately dense systems as
   well. To demonstrate the significance of the dense-phase treatment
   relative to its dilute counterpart, the ratio of dense (GHD) to dilute
   (GD) predictions of all relevant transport coefficients and equations of
   state are plotted over a range of physical parameters (volume fraction,
   coefficients of restitution, material density ratio, diameter ratio, and
   mixture composition). These plots reveal the deviation between the two
   treatments, which can become quite large (>100\%) even at moderate
   values of the physical parameters. Such information will be useful when
   choosing which theory is most applicable to a given situation, since the
   dilute theory offers relative simplicity and the dense theory offers
   improved accuracy. It is also important to note that several corrections
   to original GHD expressions are presented here in the form of a
   complete, self-contained set of relevant equations. (c) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Biomass thermochemical conversion, often done in fluidized beds,
   recently gained a lot of attention due to its potential to efficiently
   produce renewable liquid fuels. Optimization of reactor design and
   operating conditions, however, requires a fundamental understanding of
   bed dynamics. In this work, a numerical framework based on an
   Euler-Lagrange approach is developed and used to perform and analyze
   large-scale simulations of two- and three-dimensional periodic fluidized
   beds. Collisions are handled using a soft-sphere model. An efficient
   parallel implementation allows one to explicitly track over 30 million
   particles, which is representative of the number of particles found in
   lab-scale reactor. therefore demonstrating the capability of Lagrangian
   approaches to simulate realistic systems at that scale. An on-the-fly
   bubble identification and tracking algorithm is used to characterize
   bubble dynamics for inlet velocities up to 9 times the minimum
   fluidization velocity. Statistics for gas volume fraction, gas and
   particle velocities, bed expansion, and bubble size and velocity, is
   compared across the two- and three-dimensional configurations, and
   comparison with literature data generally shows good agreement. The wide
   distribution of gas residence times observed in the simulations is
   linked to the different gas hold-up characteristics of the gas-solid
   system. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the orbit radial stabilization of a two-craft
   virtual Coulomb structure about circular orbits and at Earth-Moon
   libration points. A generic Lyapunov feedback controller is designed for
   asymptotically stabilizing an orbit radial configuration about circular

   the libration points is provided as a generic control law in which
   circular Earth orbit control form a special case. This control law can
   withstand differential solar perturbation effects on the two-craft
   formation. Electrostatic Coulomb forces acting in the longitudinal
   direction control the relative distance between the two satellites and
   inertial electric propulsion thrusting acting in the transverse
   directions control the in-plane and out-of-plane attitude motions. The
   electrostatic virtual tether between the two craft is capable of both
   tensile and compressive forces. Using the Lyapunov's second method the
   feedback control law guarantees closed loop stability. Numerical
   simulations using the non-linear control law are presented for circular

Abstract = {{A game-theoretic framework is introduced for studying selfish user
   behavior in shared wireless networks. The investigation treats an
   n-unicast problem in a wireless network that employs a restricted form
   of network coding called reverse carpooling. Unicast sessions
   independently choose routes through the network. The cost of a set of
   unicast routes is the number of wireless transmissions required to
   establish those connections using those routes. Game theory is employed
   as a tool for analyzing the impact of cost sharing mechanisms on the
   global system performance when each unicast independently and selfishly
   chooses its route to minimize its individual cost. The investigation
   focuses on the performance of stable solutions, where a stable solution
   is one in which no single unicast can improve its individual cost by
   changing its route. The results include bounds on the best-and
   worst-case stable solutions compared to the best performance that could
   be found and implemented using a centralized controller. The optimal
   cost sharing protocol is derived and the worst-case solution is bounded.
   That worst-case stable performance cannot be improved using cost-sharing
   protocols that are independent of the network structure.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is used commonly to detect adenovirus
   (Ads) and norovirus (Nvs) in recreational waters. However, qPCR
   detection may be limited by interference from inhibitory substances
   found in recreational waters. In previous work, viruses in Avalon and
   Doheny Beach water samples were concentrated by electropositive
   cartridge filtration and PEG precipitation, and high inhibition was
   found in the samples when using qPCR for detection of Ads and Nvs.
   Therefore, different approaches were evaluated for removal or blocking
   of inhibitory compounds that affect qPCR. Avalon and Doheny concentrates
   were spiked with known amounts of Ads 41 and Nvs GII, and spiked
   deionized water was used as a positive control. Modifications included
   gel chromatography with columns of Sephadex G-200/Chelex 100, different
   sample volumes for nucleic acid extraction, organic solvent extraction,
   and nucleic acid precipitation. The efficiency of each treatment varied
   according to sampling location and virus type. The best option for
   improved Nvs detection by reverse transcription-qPCR was to reduce the
   sample volume for nucleic acid purification. The best option for
   improving Ads detection in both beach samples was Sephadex/Chelex spin
   column chromatography. Chloroform extraction only improved virus
   detection in Doheny Beach samples but not in Avalon Beach samples.
   Observed differences in effective treatments between viruses may be
   related to the different PCR targets, amplification conditions, and
   enzymes used in each assay, and differences between beaches may be
   related to differences in PCR inhibitory environmental compounds at each
   location. The results suggest that methods for detecting viruses from
   marine beaches, including treatments for the removal of PCR inhibitory
   compounds, should be optimized for each sampling site and probably for
   each virus of interest. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for detection of two fecal indicator viruses, F+ and somatic
   coliphages, were evaluated for application to recreational marine water.
   Marine water samples were collected during the summer of 2007 in
   Southern California, United States from transects along Avalon Beach (n
   = 186 samples) and Doheny Beach (n = 101 samples). Coliphage detection
   methods included EPA method 1601 - two-step enrichment (ENR), EPA method
   1602 - single agar layer (SAL), and variations of ENR. Variations
   included comparison of two incubation times (overnight and 5-h
   incubation) and two final detection steps (lysis zone assay and a rapid
   latex agglutination assay). A greater number of samples were positive
   for somatic and F+ coliphages by ENR than by SAL (p < 0.01). The
   standard ENR with overnight incubation and detection by lysis zone assay
   was the most sensitive method for the detection of F+ and somatic
   coliphages from marine water, although the method takes up to three days
   to obtain results. A rapid 5-h enrichment version of ENR also performed
   well, with more positive samples than SAL and could be performed in
   roughly 24 h. Latex agglutination-based detection methods require the
   least amount of time to perform, although the sensitivity was less than
   lysis zone-based detection methods. Rapid culture-based enrichment of
   coliphages in marine water may be possible by further optimizing
   culture-based methods for saline water conditions to generate higher
   viral titers than currently available, as well as increasing the
   sensitivity of latex agglutination detection methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   the differentiation of MSC into vascular cell types. Electrospinning and
   photopolymerization techniques were used to fabricate a
   three-dimensional (3-D) polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate nanofiber
   hydrogel matrix with tunable elasticity for use as a cellular substrate.
   Compression testing demonstrated that the elastic modulus of the
   hydrated 3-D matrices ranged from 2 to 15 kPa, similar to the in vivo
   elasticity of the intima basement membrane and media layer. MSC seeded
   on rigid matrices (8-15 kPa) showed an increase in cell area compared
   with those seeded on soft matrices (2-5 kPa). Furthermore, the matrix
   elasticity guided the cells to express different vascular-specific
   phenotypes with high differentiation efficiency. Around 95\% of MSC
   seeded on the 3-D matrices with an elasticity of 3 kPa showed Flk-1
   endothelial markers within 24 h, while only 20\% of MSC seeded on the
   matrices with elasticity >8 kPa demonstrated Flk-1 marker. In contrast,
   similar to 80\% of MSC seeded on 3-D matrices with elasticity >8 kPa
   demonstrated smooth muscle alpha-actin marker within 24 h, while fewer
   than 10\% of MSC seeded on 3-D matrices with elasticity <5 kPa showed
   alpha-actin markers. The ability to control MSC differentiation into
   either endothelial or smooth muscle-like cells based purely on the local
   elasticity of the substrate could be a powerful tool for vascular tissue
   regeneration. (C) 2012 Acts Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Introduction: In vitro or in situ methods to assess neuromuscular
   performance in rodents are invasive and inadequate to fully assess large
   hindlimb muscles. Methods: An in vivo hindlimb exertion force test
   (HEFT) was developed to quantify muscle function peak force (PF), peak
   rate of force development (PRFD), and short- and long-latency reaction
   times (SLRT and LLRT, respectively) in C57BL/6J mice. Results: PF did
   not change with one- and three-times-per-week repeated HEFT trials,
   demonstrating assessment reproducibility. However, PRFD decreased with
   trial, indicating that mice modified response behavior while achieving
   the same PF. Separately, mice were subjected to 14 days of hindlimb
   suspension (HS) to induce muscle atrophy. Concomitant with decreased
   lean carcass and individual muscle masses, HS mice showed reduced PF and
   LLRT. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that HEFT is an effective
   tool for evaluating in vivo hindlimb neuromuscular performance due to
   disuse muscle atrophy and potentially for other disease and injury
   models. Muscle Nerve, 2012}},

Abstract = {{A human serum albuminhuman growth hormone (HSAhGH) fusion protein was
   used as a model to understand the contributions of individual domains to
   the aggregation behavior of the overall fusion protein. Aggregation of
   HSAhGH was studied at two different pH conditions, pH 5 and pH 7.
   Conformational stability of the HSA domain was modulated by addition of
   octanoic acid, a binding ligand. Conformational stability of the fusion
   protein and the HSA domain were determined from experimentally measured
   values for free energies of unfolding (?Gunf) with midpoint of apparent
   unfolding temperatures (Tm) used as surrogate in some cases. Apparent
   Tms of both HSA and HSAhGH were increased by octanoic acid binding.
   Osmotic second virial coefficients were measured to monitor
   proteinprotein interactions in solution. Reductions in rates of
   aggregation were observed under solution conditions that increased
   proteinprotein repulsive interactions even when no changes in
   conformational stability were detected. The results indicate that
   colloidal instabilities are responsible for HSAhGH aggregation and that
   conformational stability of the HSA domain does not play a dominant role
   in the aggregation of HSAhGH. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

Abstract = {{This study is designed to investigate the feasibility for molecular
   imaging of endothelial CD81 expression in vitro and in vivo using the
   CD81-targeted ultrasound contrast agents (UCA). In the in vitro study,
   murine bEnd.3 cells were stimulated with phenazine methosulfate (PMS),
   an oxidative stress inducer. Changes in CD81 expression after
   stimulation were confirmed by Western blotting, tracked by using the
   targeted UCA and further imaged under ultrasound imaging system with 5
   MHz transmit frequency. In the in vivo study, expression of endothelial
   CD81 proteins in murine carotid artery vessels was studied using
   high-frequency ultrasound system with 40 MHz transmit frequency. Our
   results showed that endothelial CD81 expression was gradually
   up-regulated with the increase of PMS concentration. Correspondingly,
   the accumulation of targeted UCA was gradually improved and could be
   inhibited significantly upon addition of free anti-CD81 antibodies. The
   mean video intensity (grey-level) of stimulated cells and vessels from
   backscatter of the CD81-targeted UCA was 17.2 (interquartile range
   {[}IQR] 15.4-19.8) and 27.2 (IQR 22.4-29.8), significantly greater than
   that of non-stimulated cells with 9.0 (IQR 8.6-10.8) (p < 0.01) and
   non-stimulated vessels with 11.3 (IQR 10.4-13.2) (p < 0.01),
   respectively. In conclusion, CD81-targeted UCA allows noninvasive
   assessment of the expression levels of CD81 on the vascular endothelium
   and may provide potential insights into early atherosclerotic plaque
   detection and treatment monitoring. (E-mail: hr.zheng@siat.ac.cn) (C)

Abstract = {{Following the idea that there exists an optimal bandwidth for maximizing
   the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT), we conduct detailed
   calculations in this paper to search for the optimal ZT in Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3
   quantum dot (QD) nanocomposites (NCs) with Bi2Te3 QDs uniformly embedded
   in Sb2Te3 matrix where electron minibands are formed. The two-channel
   transport model, which considers both the miniband transport by the
   quantum-confined carriers and the background transport by the bulklike
   carriers, is used for electrical transport, while the lattice thermal
   conductivity is modeled using the modified effective medium
   approximation. Simultaneous decrease of the lattice thermal conductivity
   and the Lorenz number leads to an enhanced ZT in QD NCs when the Seebeck
   coefficient is not dramatically decreased. The optimal structural
   parameters that result in optimal electronic structure for maximizing ZT
   are found, with the consideration of realistic carrier scattering
   physics including phonon bottleneck effect. The optimal QD size is found
   to be similar to 6 nm, and the optimal interdot distance depends on the
   QD size and the doping concentration. For a given QD size, the maximum
   ZT is determined by the minimum of Lorenz number, which occurs when the
   quantum-confined carrier transport overwhelms the bulklike carrier
   transport.}},

Title = {{Evaluating Ecohydrological Theories of Woody Root Distribution in the
   Kalahari}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of savannas to global carbon storage is poorly
   understood, in part due to lack of knowledge of the amount of
   belowground biomass. In these ecosystems, the coexistence of woody and
   herbaceous life forms is often explained on the basis of belowground
   interactions among roots. However, the distribution of root biomass in
   savannas has seldom been investigated, and the dependence of root
   biomass on rainfall regime remains unclear, particularly for woody
   plants. Here we investigate patterns of belowground woody biomass along
   a rainfall gradient in the Kalahari of southern Africa, a region with
   consistent sandy soils. We test the hypotheses that (1) the root depth
   increases with mean annual precipitation (root optimality and plant
   hydrotropism hypothesis), and (2) the root-to-shoot ratio increases with
   decreasing mean annual rainfall (functional equilibrium hypothesis).
   Both hypotheses have been previously assessed for herbaceous vegetation
   using global root data sets. Our data do not support these hypotheses
   for the case of woody plants in savannas. We find that in the Kalahari,
   the root profiles of woody plants do not become deeper with increasing
   mean annual precipitation, whereas the root-to-shoot ratios decrease
   along a gradient of increasing aridity.}},

Abstract = {{Current methods to contain and decontaminate materials contacted by
   toxic chemical warfare agents (CWAs) have disadvantages with respect to
   ease of delivery, portability, and effectiveness on porous substrates. A
   portable, easy-to-use, spreadable coating that immediately acts as a
   barrier to contain CWA vapors on contacted substrates and also
   decontaminates soaked-in CWAs is highly desired. A new type of
   decontaminating barrier coating for sulfur mustard (i.e., blister agent)
   CWAs has been developed that is made of (1) a spreadable nonvolatile,
   fluid matrix based on a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), (2) an
   organic gelator that acts as a solidifying agent to help the applied
   coating adhere to and prevent runoff from angled or vertical surfaces,
   and (3) a polyamine that acts as a reagent to chemically degrade and
   help draw out adsorbed blister agent. When applied to porous and
   nonporous substrates contacted with 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES, a
   mustard agent simulant), this spreadable, soft solid coating was found
   to act as an effective barrier, blocking 70-90\% of the CEES vapor from
   entering the overhead space compared to uncoated samples. Furthermore,
   this reactive gel RTIL coating was able to remove (i.e., draw out and
   degrade) 70-95\% of the liquid CEES soaked into porous substrates after
   24 h at ambient temperature when applied as a static, single-application
   coating. Preliminary studies with added dyes and indicators to this
   coating system have shown that the decontamination process may be
   followed visually via color changes.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal systems find important applications ranging from fabrication
   of photonic crystals to direct probing of phenomena typically
   encountered in atomic crystals and glasses. New applications-such as
   nanoantennas, plasmonic sensors, and nanocircuits-pose a challenge of
   achieving sparse colloidal assemblies with tunable interparticle
   separations that can be controlled at will. We demonstrate
   reconfigurable multiscale interactions and assembly of colloids mediated
   by defects in cholesteric liquid crystals that are probed by means of
   laser manipulation and three-dimensional imaging. We find that colloids
   attract via distance-independent elastic interactions when pinned to the
   ends of cholesteric oily streaks, line defects at which one or more
   layers are interrupted. However, dislocations and oily streaks can also
   be optically manipulated to induce kinks, allowing one to lock them into
   the desired configurations that are stabilized by elastic energy
   barriers for structural transformation of the particle-connecting
   defects. Under the influence of elastic energy landscape due to these
   defects, sublamellarsized colloids self-assemble into structures
   mimicking the cores of dislocations and oily streaks. Interactions
   between these defect-embedded colloids can be varied from attractive to
   repulsive by optically introducing dislocation kinks. The reconfigurable
   nature of defect-particle interactions allows for patterning of defects
   by manipulation of colloids and, in turn, patterning of particles by
   these defects, thus achieving desired colloidal configurations on scales
   ranging from the size of defect core to the sample size. This
   defect-colloidal sculpturing may be extended to other lamellar media,
   providing the means for optically guided self-assembly of mesoscopic
   composites with predesigned properties.}},

Abstract = {{We describe laser-induced two-dimensional periodic photonic structures
   formed by localized particle-like excitations in an untwisted confined
   cholesteric liquid crystal. The individual particle-like excitations

   crystal director matched to the uniform background director field by
   topological point defects. Using both single-beam-steering and
   holographic pattern generation approaches, the periodic crystal lattices
   are tailored by tuning their periodicity, reorienting their
   crystallographic axes, and introducing defects. Moreover, these lattices
   can be dynamically reconfigurable: generated, modified, erased and then
   recreated, depending on the needs of a particular photonic application.
   This robust control is performed by tightly focused laser beams of power
   10-100 mW and by low-frequency electric fields at voltages similar to 10
   V applied to the transparent electrodes. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The ability of wavelet multi-resolution analysis to detect and track the
   energy-containing motions that govern the dynamics of a fluid flow
   offers a unique hierarchical framework for modelling and simulating
   turbulence. In this paper, the role of the wavelet thresholding level in
   wavelet-based modelling and simulation of turbulent flows is
   systematically examined. The thresholding level controls the relative
   importance of resolved energetic structures and residual unresolved
   background flow and, thus, the achieved turbulence resolution. A fully
   adaptive eddy capturing approach is developed that allows
   variable-fidelity numerical simulations of turbulence to be performed.
   The new method is based on wavelet filtering with time-varying
   thresholding. The thresholding level automatically adapts to the desired
   turbulence resolution during the simulation. The filtered governing
   equations supplemented by a localized dynamic energy-based closure model
   are solved numerically using the adaptive wavelet collocation method.
   The approach is successfully tested in the numerical simulation of both
   linearly forced and freely decaying homogeneous turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) resulting from the oxidation of organic
   species emitted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were sampled during
   two survey flights conducted by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration WP-3D aircraft in June 2010. A new technique for fast
   measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) supersaturation spectra
   called Scanning Flow CCN Analysis was deployed for the first time on an
   airborne platform. Retrieved CCN spectra show that most particles act as
   CCN above (0.3 +/- 0.05)\% supersaturation, which increased to (0.4 +/-
   0.1)\% supersaturation for the most organic-rich aerosol sampled. The
   aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, was inferred from both
   measurements of CCN activity and from humidified-particle light
   extinction, and varied from 0.05 to 0.10 within the emissions plumes.
   However, kappa values were lower than expected from chemical composition
   measurements, indicating a degree of external mixing or size-dependent
   chemistry, which was reconciled assuming bimodal, size-dependent
   composition. The CCN droplet effective water uptake coefficient,
   gamma(cond), was inferred from the data using a comprehensive instrument
   model, and no significant delay in droplet activation kinetics from the
   presence of organics was observed, despite a large fraction of
   hydrocarbon-like SOA present in the aerosol.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Infrared radiative emissions by carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide
   (NO) are the major cooling mechanisms of the lower thermosphere. During
   geomagnetically active periods, the NO density and cooling rate in the
   auroral regions increase significantly as a result of particle
   precipitation and Joule heating. Previous studies have shown that the
   time for NO density to recover to quiet time levels is longer than that
   of the thermosphere temperature or density recovery. This study explores
   the implications of these different recovery rates for the post-storm
   thermosphere. Thermosphere densities retrieved from the CHAMP and GRACE
   accelerometer measurements and NO cooling rates measured by TIMED/SABER
   are used to examine their variations during the post-storm period of the
   October 2003 geomagnetic storms. It was found that thermosphere
   densities at both CHAMP and GRACE altitudes recovered rapidly and
   continuously decreased below the quiet time densities during the
   post-storm period, especially at middle latitudes. Compared with the
   quiet time values, the maximum depletion in the CHAMP and GRACE
   densities after the storm is about 23-36\%, and the estimated decrease
   of thermospheric temperature is as large as 70-110 K. Our analysis
   suggests that the elevated NO cooling rate, resulting from the slower
   recovery of NO densities in the post-storm period, is a plausible cause
   for this apparent post-storm overcooling of the thermosphere.}},

Abstract = {{A simple explicit-implicit finite element tearing and interconnecting
   (FETI) algorithm (AFETI-EI algorithm) is presented for partitioned
   transient analysis of linear structural systems. The present algorithm
   employs two decompositions. First, the total system is partitioned via
   spatial or domain decomposition to obtain the governing equations of
   motions for each partitioned domain. Second, for each partitioned
   sub-system, the governing equations are modally decomposed into the
   rigid-body and deformational equations. The resulting rigid-body
   equations are integrated by an explicit integrator, for its stability is
   not affected by step-size restriction on account of zero-frequency
   contents (omega = 0). The modally decomposed partitioned deformation
   equations of motion are integrated by an unconditionally stable implicit
   integration algorithm. It is shown that the present AFETI-EI algorithm
   exhibits unconditional stability and that the resulting interface
   problem possesses the same solution matrix profile as the basic FETI
   static problems. The present simple dynamic algorithm, as expected,
   falls short of the performance of the FETI-DP but offers a similar
   performance of implicit two-level FETI-D algorithm with a much cheaper
   coarse solver; hence, its simplicity may offer relatively easy means for
   conducting parallel analysis of both static and dynamic problems by
   employing the same basic scalable FETI solver, especially for
   research-mode numerical experiments. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{With the discovery by the Cassini spacecraft of an oxygen atmosphere
   over Saturn's main rings, and a strong source of water products from the
   plumes of Saturn's moon Enceladus, our picture of the physics of
   Saturn's magnetosphere from the main rings to inside the orbit of
   Enceladus has changed dramatically. This region contains oxygen ions
   from the ring atmosphere and water-group ions from the Enceladus torus.
   The purpose of this study is to examine ion densities, temperatures, and
   composition from several equatorial periapsis passes from 2004 to 2010
   for the region from 2.4 to 3.5 Saturn radii (similar to 60,300 km) in
   addition to Voyager 2 in order to separate contributions from Saturn's
   ring atmosphere from the water products in the Enceladus torus and to
   describe the temporal variations in the plasma. Because of the high
   background due to so-called penetrating radiation in this region, only
   six orbits are used in this study. Our analysis indicates that large
   variations in ion density, temperature, and composition occurred between
   the Voyager 2 flyby, 2004, and 2010. Although the Enceladus plumes may
   be variable, we propose that the large change in the ion density from
   2004 to equinox near 2010 is due to the seasonal variation in the ring
   atmosphere. Our interpretation of the plasma data is supported by a
   simple photochemical model, combining the water products from Enceladus
   and the seasonal variations in the ring atmosphere.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2089-2100}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{The HO2 + HO2 -> H2O2 + O-2 chemical reaction is studied using
   statistical rate theory in conjunction with high level ab initio
   electronic structure calculations. A new theoretical rate coefficient is
   generated that is appropriate for both high and low temperature regimes.
   The transition state region for the ground triplet potential energy
   surface is characterized using the CASPT2/CBS/aug-cc-pVTZ method with 14
   active electrons and 10 active orbitals. The reaction is found to
   proceed through an intermediate complex bound by approximately 9.79
   kcal/mol. There is no potential barrier in the entrance channel,
   although the free energy barrier was determined using a large Monte
   Carlo sampling of the HO2 orientations. The inner (tight) transition
   state lies below the entrance threshold. It is found that this inner
   transition state exhibits two saddle points corresponding to torsional
   conformations of the complex. A unified treatment based on vibrational
   adiabatic theory is presented that permits the reaction to occur on an
   equal footing for any value of the torsional angle. The quantum
   tunneling is also reformulated based on this new approach. The rate
   coefficient obtained is in good agreement with low temperature
   experimental results but is significantly lower than the results of
   shock tube experiments for high temperatures.}},

Title = {{Kinetics of Proton Transport into Influenza Virions by the Viral M2
   Channel}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{M2 protein of influenza A viruses is a tetrameric transmembrane proton
   channel, which has essential functions both early and late in the virus
   infectious cycle. Previous studies of proton transport by M2 have been
   limited to measurements outside the context of the virus particle. We
   have developed an in vitro fluorescence-based assay to monitor internal
   acidification of individual virions triggered to undergo membrane
   fusion. We show that rimantadine, an inhibitor of M2 proton conductance,
   blocks the acidification-dependent dissipation of fluorescence from a
   pH-sensitive virus-content probe. Fusion-pore formation usually follows
   internal acidification but does not require it. The rate of internal
   virion acidification increases with external proton concentration and
   saturates with a pK(m) of similar to 4.7. The rate of proton transport
   through a single, fully protonated M2 channel is approximately 100 to
   400 protons per second. The saturating proton-concentration dependence
   and the low rate of internal virion acidification derived from authentic
   virions support a transporter model for the mechanism of proton
   transfer.}},

Title = {{Process-evaluation of tropospheric humidity simulated by general
   circulation models using water vapor isotopologues: 1. Comparison
   between models and observations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to determine how H2O and HDO measurements in
   water vapor can be used to detect and diagnose biases in the
   representation of processes controlling tropospheric humidity in
   atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). We analyze a large number
   of isotopic data sets (four satellite, sixteen ground-based
   remote-sensing, five surface in situ and three aircraft data sets) that
   are sensitive to different altitudes throughout the free troposphere.
   Despite significant differences between data sets, we identify some
   observed HDO/H2O characteristics that are robust across data sets and
   that can be used to evaluate models. We evaluate the isotopic GCM LMDZ,
   accounting for the effects of spatiotemporal sampling and instrument
   sensitivity. We find that LMDZ reproduces the spatial patterns in the
   lower and mid troposphere remarkably well. However, it underestimates
   the amplitude of seasonal variations in isotopic composition at all
   levels in the subtropics and in midlatitudes, and this bias is
   consistent across all data sets. LMDZ also underestimates the observed
   meridional isotopic gradient and the contrast between dry and convective
   tropical regions compared to satellite data sets. Comparison with six
   other isotope-enabled GCMs from the SWING2 project shows that biases
   exhibited by LMDZ are common to all models. The SWING2 GCMs show a very
   large spread in isotopic behavior that is not obviously related to that
   of humidity, suggesting water vapor isotopic measurements could be used
   to expose model shortcomings. In a companion paper, the isotopic
   differences between models are interpreted in terms of biases in the
   representation of processes controlling humidity.}},

   were the derived response variables. Response surface methodology was
   then used to evaluate the experimental design results to find the
   operating conditions that resulted in either the least amount of flux
   decline or the highest moving average flux. A life cycle cost analysis
   determined that a plant designed and operated to achieve minimum flux
   decline resulted in a higher total plant cost than a plant designed and
   operated at more aggressive filtration conditions, which produced the
   higher moving average flux and more flux decline. This is due to the
   high material cost for a ceramic membrane. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{While today's lithium-ion batteries offer acceptable energy storage
   capability, they lack the ability to be cycled repeatedly more than a
   couple thousand times. Electrochemical capacitors, i.e.,
   supercapacitors, are being developed whose lifetimes exceed 1 x 10(6)
   cycles and power densities surpass those of batteries by several times.
   Here, we present an all-solid-state supercapacitor using a Li2S-P2S5
   glass-ceramic electrolyte as both separator and ion conductor. Three
   device architectures are examined including two with nanostructured
   electrodes which incorporate multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).
   Cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance measurements
   demonstrate that these devices develop reversible double layer
   capacitance, and a maximum of 7.75 F/g is achieved in the device
   constructed by mechanically mixing the nanostructured electrodes.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy explains non-idealities observed
   when MWCNTs are incorporated in the electrode layers. (C) 2012 American

   MICROFABRIC}},
Journal = {{PALAIOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{206-219}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Alternating light-dark laminae within stromatolites have been attributed
   to a phototactic response of the constituent microbial communities,
   whereby filaments orient vertically during the day and recline at night.
   This study examines the orientation of cyanobacterial filaments within a
   laminated siliceous stromatolite from a Yellowstone National Park hot
   spring to identify the controls on microfabric development and whether
   phototaxis plays a role. Results indicate that filament orientation is
   predominantly perpendicular or parallel to lamination, even when laminae
   are steeply inclined. Thus, phototaxis is not a significant control of
   microfabric development in these stromatolites. Vertical aspects of the
   fabric are dominated by hourglass-shaped filament bundles (hourglass
   structures) adjacent to rounded pores, rather than being defined by
   individual filaments. The rounded pores likely represent oxygen-rich
   bubbles generated during photosynthesis. Upon stabilization by
   filaments, upward buoyancy of the bubbles rotated the bundles toward a
   vertical orientation. Thus, vertical aspects of the fabric in this
   stromatolite result from buoyancy forces rather than phototaxis.
   Examples from the Neoproterozoic Beck Spring Dolomite reveal that
   similar subvertical hourglass structures are present in the rock record
   and may be better preserved than individual filaments. The presence of
   rounded pores (fenestrae) and hourglass structures in ancient
   microbialites, here termed the hourglass-associated fenestral fabric,
   can serve as an indication of biogenic influence in stromatolites,
   especially in the absence of preserved filaments, and may be an
   indication of oxygenic photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new thermo-hydro-mechanical true triaxial cell
   used for the evaluation of the impact of stress-induced anisotropy on
   thermally induced volume changes in saturated soils. Specifically,
   details of the experimental setup, instrumentation, thermal calibration
   of the device, experimental procedures, and typical measurements are
   presented in this paper. Principal stresses were applied to the sides of
   a cubical specimen with a side length of 178 mm independently using
   flexible bladders, while the pore water pressure and temperature were
   controlled at the top and bottom of the specimen using rigid plates with
   embedded heaters and fluid control ports. In the testing program,
   temperatures between 25 and 65 therefore C were applied in stages to
   four different specimens of compacted bonny silt which had been
   consolidated to different initial anisotropic stress states under
   quasi-plane strain conditions. Consistent volumetric contraction was
   measured in each of the specimens during heating, regardless of the
   initial stress state. However, for specimens with a greater initial
   principal stress difference, the soil was observed to expand in the
   direction of the minor principal axis and contract in the direction of
   the major principal stress during heating. Relatively consistent elastic
   volumetric and axial contraction was noted during cooling regardless of
   initial stress state. The results from this preliminary investigation
   indicate the importance of measuring the impact of temperature changes
   in the directions of anisotropic stresses as part of the design of
   thermally active geotechnical systems.}},

Journal = {{NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{137-147}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Prediction of noise levels at long ranges from such sources as flying
   aircraft or moving ground vehicles is an important practical problem.
   When terrain, wind, and atmospheric effects are taken into account, this
   problem cannot be solved analytically, and, thus, numerical solutions
   are required. There are several numerically efficient algorithms to
   solve the problem, but, typically, all of them are designed for an
   omnidirectional point source. Such specification is inadequate for
   complex and extended sources exhibiting directional radiation patterns.
   Thus, a method for incorporating directional sound sources into
   propagation algorithms is needed. This paper describes the equivalent
   source method (ESM), which enables reconstruction of a compact
   point-source distribution reproducing a given, arbitrarily complicated,
   radiation pattern in the far field. The ESM is demonstrated using an
   asymmetrical surrogate aircraft radiation pattern. Application of the
   ESM to parabolic equation algorithms is also considered. Some issues of
   acquisition of input data, such as outliers and data incompleteness, and
   their adverse effect on source reconstruction are also discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{We evaluate the performance of a combined feedforward/feedback control
   architecture applied to the raster scan of a piezo-based positioning
   system. Proper design of feedforward filters for minimum and
   nonminimum-phase plants is discussed. Further, empirical work suggests
   that a nontraditional variation upon the feedforward plant-injection
   architecture allows our system to track a raster pattern at a greater
   performance level than previously achieved in our research. This
   variation is manifested as additional delay inserted in the feedforward
   control system rather than a unity-gain filter constructed from plant
   parameters. An online adaptive technique is used to determine the
   required amount of additional delay. The key benefit of the algorithm is
   an adaptation calculation that does not require knowledge of plant
   parameters. This method can be applied to piezo-based positioning
   systems including atomic force microscopes, other scanning probe
   microscopes, probe-based data storage systems or other systems in which
   raster tracking is a critical control objective.}},

   effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated using a trajectory
   computation for a realistic path that is traversed with a demanding

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this project is to design, fabricate, and test
   a small, integrated camera system for aiding in the visualization and
   surgical repair of certain types of ventricular septal defects (VSD), in
   pediatric patients. Currently, no purpose-designed commercial device to
   view VSDs from the left ventricle of the heart exists. The left
   ventricular perspective is ideal for obtaining an unobstructed view of
   the VSD. This VSD camera device would also provide a platform for
   passing a suture through the hole in the ventricular septum, with future
   work implementing additional tools capable of more advanced tasks. This
   camera device will help solve some of the major issues currently
   associated with cardiac imaging and surgical closure of VSDs in newborns
   and young children This paper examines the design development and
   preliminary evaluation of a proof of concept device. Included are
   preliminary results of image quality comparisons, design details of a
   pediatric-specific VSD camera device, and initial outcomes from in vitro
   testing. DOI: 10.1115/1.4005778]}},

Abstract = {{The essence of real time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is the reliance on a
   physical test (virtual finite element) in support of a numerical
   simulation, which is unable to properly simulate it numerically. Hence,
   the computational support for a hybrid simulation is of paramount
   importance, and one with anything less than a state of the art
   computational support may defeat the purpose of such an endeavor. A
   critical, yet often ignored, component of RTHS is precisely the
   computational engine, which unfortunately has been a bottleneck for
   realistic studies. Most researches have focused on either the control or
   on the communication (mostly in distributed, non-real time hybrid
   simulation) leaving the third leg of RTHS (computation) ignored and
   limited to the simulation of simple models (small number of degrees of
   freedom and limited nonlinearities). This paper details the development
   of a specialized software written explicitly to perform, single site,
   hybrid simulation ranging from pseudo-dynamic to hard real time ones.
   Solution strategy, implementation details, and actual applications are
   reported. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Low-cost MEMS-based IMUs, video cameras and portable GNSS devices are
   commercially available for automotive applications and some
   manufacturers have already integrated such facilities into their vehicle
   systems. GNSS provides positioning, navigation and timing solutions to
   users worldwide. However, signal attenuation, reflections or blockages
   may give rise to positioning difficulties. As opposed to GNSS, a generic
   IMU, which is independent of electromagnetic wave reception, can
   calculate a high-bandwidth navigation solution, however the output from
   a self-contained IMU accumulates errors over time. In addition, video
   cameras also possess great potential as alternate sensors in the
   navigation community, particularly in challenging GNSS environments and
   are becoming more common as options in vehicles. Aiming at taking
   advantage of these existing onboard technologies for ground vehicle
   navigation in challenging environments, this paper develops an
   integrated camera/IMU/GNSS system based on the extended Kalman filter
   (EKF). Our proposed integration architecture is examined using a live
   dataset collected in an operational traffic environment. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed integrated system
   provides accurate estimations and potentially outperforms the tightly
   coupled GNSS/IMU integration in challenging environments with sparse
   GNSS observations.}},

Abstract = {{We present dynamic tuning and symmetry lowering of Fano resonances in
   gold heptamers accomplished by applying uniaxial mechanical stress. The
   flexible heptamer structure was obtained by embedding the
   seven-gold-nanocylinder complex in a polydimethylsiloxane membrane.
   Under uniaxial stress, the Fano resonance exhibited opposite spectral
   shifts for the two orthogonal polarizations parallel and perpendicular
   to the mechanical stress. Furthermore, a new resonance was observed for
   polarization parallel to the mechanical stress but not for the
   perpendicular polarization. The experimental results showed good
   agreement with the numerical simulations. A detailed group theoretical
   analysis showed that the symmetry lowering caused by the mechanical
   stress not only splits the originally degenerate mode but also modifies
   the originally optically inactive mode into an optically active mode,
   which then interacts strongly with a closely spaced mode and exhibits
   anticrossing behavior. The symmetry tuning enabled by applying
   mechanical stress Is a simple and efficient way to engineer the nature
   of coupled plasmon resonances in complex nanostructures. The
   mechanically tunable plasmonic nanostructures also provide an excellent
   platform for dynamically tunable nanophotonic devices such as tunable
   filters and sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying contaminant sources in a precise and rapid manner is
   critical to indoor air quality (IAQ) management as disclosed source
   information can facilitate proper and effective IAQ controls in
   environments with airborne infection, fire smoke and chemical pollutant
   release etc. Probability-based inverse modeling method was shown
   feasible for locating single instantaneous source in IAQ events. To
   tackle more realistic sources of continuous release, this paper advances
   the method to identify continuously releasing single contaminant source.
   The study formulates a suite of inverse modeling algorithms that can
   promptly locate dynamic source with known release time for IAQ events.
   Two field experiments are employed to verify the prediction: one in a
   multi-room apartment and the other in a hospital ward which was involved
   in a SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. The developed algorithms
   promptly and accurately identify the source locations in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{Phase change materials (PCMs) and rubber particles from recycled tires
   were used in portland cement mortar with a potential application as
   insulation mortar. Series of tests were designed and conducted including
   compressive strength, flexural strength, thermal conductivity, drying
   shrinkage, and bond strength tests at 7 days and 28 days of age.
   Different types of additives were also used in the mix designs. The
   experimental results showed that mechanical properties of
   rubberized-mortar can be improved by adjusting the size of rubber
   particles and the amount of additives. With the same volume fraction of
   PCM and rubbers, the mechanical properties of PCM-modified mortar are
   either the same or better than that of rubberized-mortar. In terms of
   thermal properties, the rubber particles can reduce thermal conductivity
   of the mortar significantly, while the PCM can improve heat capacity of
   the mortar. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for the fast accurate computation of
   several useful Mie-based parameters for homogeneous, spherical, liquid
   water, and ice hydrometeor distributions over a wide range of
   frequencies, mean hydrometeor diameters, and physical temperatures as
   occur in the terrestrial atmosphere. The absorption coefficient,
   scattering coefficient, backscattering coefficient, and phase asymmetry
   parameters are cast into functions of three independent variables:
   frequency, temperature, and mean diameter. An exponential drop size
   distribution with a constant fractional volume of 10(-6) is used to
   model polydispersed hydrometeors. The ranges used for frequency,
   temperature, and mean diameter are {[}1, 1000] GHz, {[}-50, + 50]degrees
   C, and {[}0.002, 20] mm, respectively. The functions are then sampled on
   a logarithmic grid. Trivariate cubic spline interpolation using
   nonuniform basis splines (B-splines) is then used to efficiently
   represent these 3-D functions in a compact library. By using this
   method, four important criteria are achieved: 1) fast random
   computability of any of these parameters given the values of frequency,
   temperature, and mean diameter; 2) minimal memory usage by storage of
   only B-spline coefficients; 3) representation of parameters using
   well-behaved functional forms amenable to analytical differentiation for
   the evaluation of Jacobians, or alternatively, for higher accuracy,
   B-spline coefficients calculated using true Jacobian values can be used;
   and 4) negligibly small and bounded error over the entire domain of the
   library. These procedures result in considerable acceleration of
   microwave radiative transfer simulations across a broad frequency
   spectrum, as demonstrated in calculations for both scattering and
   nonscattering atmospheres. The methods discussed can also be applied to
   other geophysical problems requiring rapid calculation of series-based
   functions of several independent variables, where the function
   evaluation is a time-consuming process, and maximum error bounds are
   critical.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the large size of wireless networks, it is often impractical for
   nodes to track changes in the complete network state. As a result, nodes
   have to make distributed decisions about their transmission and
   reception parameters based on their local view of the network. In this
   paper, we characterize the impact of distributed decisions on the global
   network performance in terms of achievable sum rates. We first formalize
   the concept of local view by proposing a protocol abstraction using the
   concept of local message passing. In the proposed protocol, nodes
   forward information about the network state to other neighboring nodes,
   thereby allowing network-state information to trickle to all the nodes.
   The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a message
   followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then
   provides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at
   each node. We next study two network connectivities, Z-channel, and a
   three-user double Z-channel. In each case, we characterize achievable
   sum rate with partial message passing leading to two main results.
   First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed decisions with only
   local information about the network and can still achieve the same sum
   capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective of the
   actual channel gains. We label such schemes as universally optimal.
   Second, for the case of three-user double Z-channel, we show that
   universal optimality is not achievable if the per node information is
   below a threshold. In fact, distributed decisions can lead to unbounded
   losses compared to full information case for some channel gains.}},

   averaged momentum equations. Two first-order closure equations proposed
   by O'Brien and by Large, McWilliams, and Doney were tested; both models
   approximate the eddy diffusivity as a function of height using cubic
   polynomials. Of these two models, the O'Brien model, which requires data
   both at the surface layer and at the top of the boundary layer, proved
   superior. The higher-order k-epsilon model also agreed well with DNS
   results and more accurately represented the eddy diffusivity in this

Abstract = {{Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics is applied to investigate thermal
   transport across two CNTs connected longitudinally by molecular linkers,
   which is a basic building-block for CNT network structures. We show the
   effect of different numbers, monomer types, and lengths of molecular
   linkers on the interfacial thermal conductance between CNTs and
   molecular linkers. We also analyze the density of vibrational normal
   modes to further understand the interfacial thermal conductance between
   different molecular linkers and CNTs. For most of the molecular linker
   type we simulated, the interfacial thermal conductance decreases with
   the increasing chain length. We find that aromatic-backbone structures
   are better than aliphatic-backbone structures to obtain higher
   interfacial thermal conductance with CNTs. Incorporating double bonds,
   oxygen atoms and amide groups into polymer chains shifts or
   redistributes of the density of vibrational normal modes, which in turn
   tunes the interfacial thermal conductance of molecular linker with CNTs.
   These results provide guidance for choosing molecular linkers to build
   up large-scale CNT-based network structures with tunable thermal
   properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a general-purpose communication package built on
   top of MPI which is aimed at improving inter-processor communications
   independently of the supercomputer architecture being considered. The
   package is developed to support parallel applications that rely on
   computation characterized by large number of messages of various sizes,
   often small, that are focused within processor neighborhoods. In some
   cases, such as solvers having static mesh partitions, the number and
   size of messages are known a priori. However, in other cases such as
   mesh adaptation, the messages evolve and vary in number and size and
   include the dynamic movement of partition objects. The current package
   provides a utility for dynamic applications based on two key attributes
   that are: (i) explicit consideration of the neighborhood communication
   pattern to avoid many-to-many calls and also to reduce the number of
   collective calls to a minimum, and (ii) use of non-blocking MPI
   functions along with message packing to manage message flow control and
   reduce the number and time of communication calls. The test application
   demonstrated is parallel unstructured mesh adaptation. Results on IBM
   Blue Gene/P and Cray XE6 computers show that the use of
   neighborhood-based communication control leads to scalable results when
   executing generally imbalanced mesh adaptation runs. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{EFFECT OF SURFACE ARCHITECTURE ON IN VIVO ULTRASOUND CONTRAST
   PERSISTENCE OF TARGETED SIZE-SELECTED MICROBUBBLES}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound molecular imaging is a powerful diagnostic modality using
   microbubbles coated with targeting ligands specific for endothelial
   biomarkers. The circulation persistence of ligand-bearing contrast
   agents is a key determinant in their contrast enhancement and targeting
   capability. Prior studies have shown that targeted microbubbles with
   ligands attached to the shell using the conventional exposed-ligand
   architecture (ELA) could trigger undesired ligand-induced complement
   activation and decreased circulation time. Microbubbles with the
   buried-ligand architecture (BLA), however, were found to inhibit
   complement activation and prolong circulation time. In the present
   study, we extended the stealth BLA microbubble design to size-selected
   (4 to 5-mu m diameter) microbubbles targeted with cyclic RGD peptide
   using the postlabeling technique. Microbubble circulation persistence
   was measured in the healthy mouse kidney using a Visualsonics Vevo 770
   scanner operating at 40 MHz in fundamental mode. The circulation
   persistence for targeted BLA microbubbles was significantly longer
   compared with their ELA counterparts and similar to no-ligand controls.
   Use of the BLA instead of the ELA increased the circulation half-life
   approximately two-fold. Analysis of the time-intensity and
   time-fluctuation curves with a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model
   showed a minimal degree of nonspecific vascular adhesion for any group.
   These results demonstrate the importance of surface architecture in the
   design of targeted microbubbles for ultrasound molecular imaging.

Abstract = {{Protein instability and immunogenicity are two main roadblocks to the
   clinical success of novel protein drug delivery systems. In this
   commentary, we discuss the need for more extensive analytical
   characterization in relation to concerns about protein instability in
   injectable drug delivery systems for sustained release. We then will
   briefly address immunogenicity concerns and outline current best
   practices for using state-of-the-art analytical assays to monitor
   protein stability for both conventional and novel therapeutic protein
   dosage forms. Next, we provide a summary of the stresses on proteins
   arising during preparation of drug delivery systems and subsequent in
   vivo release. We note the challenges and difficulties in achieving the
   absolute requirement of quantitatively assessing the degradation of
   protein molecules in a drug delivery system. We describe the potential
   roles for academic research in further improving protein stability and
   developing new analytical technologies to detect protein degradation
   byproducts in novel drug delivery systems. Finally, we provide
   recommendations for the appropriate approaches to formulation design and
   assay development to ensure that stable, minimally immunogenic
   formulations of therapeutic proteins are created. These approaches
   should help to increase the probability that novel drug delivery systems
   for sustained protein release will become more readily available as
   effective therapeutic agents to treat and benefit patients. (c) 2011

Pages = {{1972-1981}},

Abstract = {{We study the patterns spontaneously formed by bilayer polymer films upon
   annealing. Specifically, polystyrene (PS) films were spin-cast on
   topographically patterned poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates
   and subsequently annealed at temperatures above the glass transition
   temperature of both polymers. The influence of the molecular weight and
   the volume of PS on the morphological evolution of the corrugated
   liquid-liquid interface was examined. When the PS formed isolated
   stripes both on the mesas and within the trenches of the PMMA pattern,
   capillary instability was observed for these nonaxisymmetric PS threads.
   The kinetics of the capillary breakup depended on the thread-to-matrix
   viscosity ratio, and was dictated by the more viscous component. In
   contrast, the characteristic wavelength of the breakup only slightly
   depended on some viscosity ratio, and reached a minimum at the viscosity
   ratio around 1. When the PS was thick enough to form a continuous layer,
   the instability of the film further depended on the molecular weight of
   the PS. For a molecular weight of 13 kg/mol, the PS dewetted from PMMA
   via a random nucleation and growth mechanism. However, for a molecular
   weight of 2000 kg/mol, localized nucleation on top of the PMMA mesas led
   to a mesh-like PS morphology, which eventually broke up due to capillary
   instability. Therefore, by controlling the molecular weight and the
   spin-cast volume of the top layer, the kinetics of morphological
   evolution and the resulting patterns can be controlled.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene's featureless optical absorption, ultrahigh carrier mobility,

   structure. These modulators provide a large degree of design freedom,
   which allows tailoring of their optical properties to specific needs.
   Current devices feature an active aperture similar to 100 mu m, and
   provide uniform modulation with flat frequency response from 1 Hz to >
   100 MHz. These novel, low insertion-loss graphene-based modulators offer
   solutions to a variety of high-speed amplitude modulation tasks that
   require optical amplitude modulation without phase distortions, a flat

   monolithic, high-repetition rate mode-locked lasers or active

Abstract = {{Experiments on the time-periodic liquid sloshing-induced sideways motion
   of containers are presented. The measurements are compared with
   finite-depth potential theory developed from standard normal mode
   representations for rectangular boxes, upright cylinders, wedges and
   cones of 90 degrees apex angles, and cylindrical annuli. It is assumed
   that the rectilinear horizontal motion of the containers is
   frictionless. The study focuses on measurements of the horizontal
   oscillations of these containers arising solely from the liquid waves
   excited within. While the wedge and cone exhibit only one mode of
   oscillation, the boxes, cylinders and annuli have an infinite number of
   modes. For the boxes, cylinders and one of the annuli, we have been able
   to excite motion and record data for both the first and second modes of
   oscillation. Frequencies omega were acquired as the average of three
   experimental determinations for every filling of mass m in the dry
   containers of mass m(0). Measurements of the dimensionless frequencies
   omega/omega(R) over a range of dimensionless liquid masses M = m/m(0)
   are found to be in essential agreement with theoretical predictions. The
   frequencies omega(R) used for normalization arise naturally in the
   mathematical analysis, different for each geometry considered. Free
   surface waveforms for a box, a cylinder, the wedge and the cone are

   Previous research has shown that many mammals became smaller during the

   high-resolution record of continental climate and equid body size change
   shows a directional size decrease of similar to 30\% over the first
   similar to 130,000 years of the PETM, followed by a similar to 76\%
   increase in the recovery phase of the PETM. These size changes are
   negatively correlated with temperature inferred from oxygen isotopes in
   mammal teeth and were probably driven by shifts in temperature and
   possibly high atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These findings could be
   important for understanding mammalian evolutionary responses to future
   global warming.}},

Abstract = {{Glaciers and ice caps (GICs) are important contributors to present-day
   global mean sea level rise(1-4). Most previous global mass balance
   estimates for GICs rely on extrapolation of sparse mass balance
   measurements(1,2,4) representing only a small fraction of the GIC area,
   leaving their overall contribution to sea level rise unclear. Here we
   show that GICs, excluding the Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs,
   lost mass at a rate of 148 +/- 30 Gt yr(-1) from January 2003 to
   December 2010, contributing 0.41 +/- 0.08 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise.
   Our results are based on a global, simultaneous inversion of monthly
   GRACE-derived satellite gravity fields, from which we calculate the mass
   change over all ice-covered regions greater in area than 100 km(2). The
   GIC rate for 2003-2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous
   mass balance estimate that most closely matches our study period(2). The
   high mountains of Asia, in particular, show a mass loss of only 4 +/- 20
   Gt yr(-1) for 2003-2010, compared with 47-55 Gt yr(-1) in previously
   published estimates(2,5). For completeness, we also estimate that the
   Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, including their peripheral GICs,
   contributed 1.06 +/- 0.19 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise over the same time
   period. The total contribution to sea level rise from all ice-covered
   regions is thus 1.48 +/- 0.26 mm yr(-1), which agrees well with
   independent estimates of sea level rise originating from land ice loss
   and other terrestrial sources(6).}},

Abstract = {{Transport of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and microspheres in two
   disparate (a clay- and Fe-rich, volcanic and a temperate, humic)
   agricultural soils were studied in the presence and absence of 100 mg
   L-1 of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), and Suwannee River Humic
   Acid (SRHA) at pH 5.0-6.0. Transport of carboxylate-modified, 1.8 mu m
   microspheres in soil columns was highly sensitive to the nature of the
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), whereas oocysts transport was more
   affected by soil mineralogy. SDBS increased transport of microspheres
   from 48\% to 87\% through the tropical soil and from 43\% to 93\% in
   temperate soil. In contrast, SRHA reduced transport of microspheres from
   48\% to 28\% in tropical soil and from 43\% to 16\% in temperate soil.
   SDBS also increased oocysts transport through the temperate soil 5-fold,
   whereas no oocyst transport was detected in tropical soil. SRHA had only
   a nominal effect in increasing oocysts transport in tropical soil, but
   caused a 6-fold increase in transport through the temperate soil.
   Amendments of only 4 mg L-1 SRHA and SDBS decreased oocyst
   hydrophobicity from 66\% to 20\% and from 66\% to 5\%, respectively.
   However, SDBS increased microsphere hydrophobicity from 16\% to 33\%.
   Soil fines, which includes clays, and SRHA, both caused the oocysts zeta
   potential (zeta) to become more negative, but caused the highly
   hydrophilic microspheres to become less negatively charged. The
   disparate behaviors of the two colloids in the presence of an ionic
   surfactant and natural organic matter suggest that microspheres may not
   be suitable surrogates for oocysts in certain types of soils. These
   results indicate that whether or not DOC inhibits or promotes transport
   of oocysts and microspheres in agricultural soils and by how much,
   depends not only on the surface characteristics of the colloid, but the
   nature of the DOC and the soil mineralogy.}},

Abstract = {{The multispecies analysis of daily air samples collected at the NOAA
   Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) in Weld County in northeastern
   Colorado since 2007 shows highly correlated alkane enhancements caused
   by a regionally distributed mix of sources in the Denver-Julesburg
   Basin. To further characterize the emissions of methane and non-methane
   hydrocarbons (propane, n-butane, i-pentane, n-pentane and benzene)
   around BAO, a pilot study involving automobile-based surveys was carried
   out during the summer of 2008. A mix of venting emissions (leaks) of raw
   natural gas and flashing emissions from condensate storage tanks can
   explain the alkane ratios we observe in air masses impacted by oil and
   gas operations in northeastern Colorado. Using the WRAP Phase III
   inventory of total volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil
   and gas exploration, production and processing, together with flashing
   and venting emission speciation profiles provided by State agencies or
   the oil and gas industry, we derive a range of bottom-up speciated
   emissions for Weld County in 2008. We use the observed ambient molar
   ratios and flashing and venting emissions data to calculate top-down
   scenarios for the amount of natural gas leaked to the atmosphere and the
   associated methane and non-methane emissions. Our analysis suggests that
   the emissions of the species we measured are most likely underestimated
   in current inventories and that the uncertainties attached to these
   estimates can be as high as a factor of two.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy
   loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) were
   used to investigate the thermal surface chemistry of 2-iodoethanol
   (ICH2CH2OH) on Pd(111). 2-Iodoethanol undergoes C-I scission upon
   adsorption at low temperatures, resulting in 2-hydroxyethyl (CH2CH2OH)
   formation. At low coverage, this intermediate decomposes to form carbon
   monoxide and hydrogen during TPD. At higher coverage, hydroxyethyl
   reacts to produce ethanol, ethylene, water, 2-iodoethanol, and
   acetaldehyde, with nearly complete suppression of the decarbonylation
   pathway. DFT and HREELS results indicate that the coverage dependence of
   the reaction pathways is correlated with a change in the adsorption
   geometry of hydroxyethyl. At low coverage the C-O bond lies parallel to
   the surface, while at higher coverage it is shifted into a perpendicular
   position. Adsorbed iodine is observed to play a significant role in
   blocking sites and favoring the upright adsorption geometry. These
   results have important implications for the use of catalyst modifiers in
   controlling selectivity in reactions of functional alcohols.}},

Title = {{A model for the effective thermal conductivity of metal-nonmetal
   particulate composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The effective thermal conductivity of particulate composites with
   oriented spheroidal metallic particles embedded in a dielectric matrix
   is analyzed under the framework of the two-temperature model of heat
   conduction. The obtained analytical results show that the effective
   thermal conductivity depends strongly on (1) the relative size of the
   particle inclusions with respect to the electron-phonon coupling length
   and (2) the ratio between the electron and phonon thermal
   conductivities. The effect of the electron-phonon coupling inside
   metallic particles is expressed by the reduction of the composite
   thermal conductivity with respect to its corresponding values obtained
   for an infinite electron-phonon coupling factor, where the analysis
   could be established based on the Fourier law of heat conduction. It is
   shown that the composite thermal conductivity has upper and lower
   bounds, which are determined by the particle size in comparison with the
   electron-phonon coupling length. The generalized model for spheroidal
   particles is then used to analyze the thermal conductivity for limiting
   cases on the particle shape including spheres, cylinders, and flat
   plates. For perfect electron-phonon coupling, the proposed model reduces
   to various previously-reported results. This study shows that the
   particle size dependence of the thermal conductivity of metal-nonmetal
   composites appears not only through the interfacial thermal resistance
   but also by means of the electron-phonon coupling. The results of this
   work could be useful for guiding the design of particulate composites
   with spheroidal metallic inclusions from macro/micro-to nanoscales. (C)

Abstract = {{The connectivity, and thus long-range continuity of the domains, in a
   lamellar polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymer in thin
   films depends on the volume fraction of each block and can be shifted by
   homopolymer addition to substrate-spanning continuity of either the
   polystyrene (PS) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) domains. Essential
   features of the lamellar morphology were captured by a simple network
   analysis that quantified the number of branch points and end points in
   the lamellar domains. The transition in network continuity from the PS
   to PMMA domain as a function of copolymer. volumetric composition (from
   f(PMMA) = 0.45 to 0.55) was correlated with a 5-fold increase in the
   PMMA branch point density and a concomitant 3-fold reduction in the PMMA
   end point density. These results indicate that the copolymer's
   composition drastically impacts the self-assembled lamellar morphology
   in thin films and is an important design consideration when using such
   materials for lithographic applications, including for directed assembly
   to generate long-range, defect-free order.}},

Title = {{Low-force AFM nanomechanics with higher-eigenmode contact resonance
   spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods for quantitative measurements of
   elastic modulus on stiff (>10 GPa) materials typically require
   tip-sample contact forces in the range from hundreds of nanonewtons to a
   few micronewtons. Such large forces can cause sample damage and preclude
   direct measurement of ultrathin films or nanofeatures. Here, we present
   a contact resonance spectroscopy AFM technique that utilizes a
   cantilever's higher flexural eigenmodes to enable modulus measurements
   with contact forces as low as 10 nN, even on stiff materials. Analysis
   with a simple analytical beam model of spectra for a compliant
   cantilever's fourth and fifth flexural eigenmodes in contact yielded
   good agreement with bulk measurements of modulus on glass samples in the
   50-75 GPa range. In contrast, corresponding analysis of the
   conventionally used first and second eigenmode spectra gave poor
   agreement under the experimental conditions. We used finite element
   analysis to understand the dynamic contact response of a cantilever with
   a physically realistic geometry. Compared to lower eigenmodes, the
   results from higher modes are less affected by model parameters such as
   lateral stiffness that are either unknown or not considered in the
   analytical model. Overall, the technique enables local mechanical
   characterization of materials previously inaccessible to AFM-based
   nanomechanics methods.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin and conformal hybrid organic-inorganic thin films can be
   deposited by molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques. By combining
   the hybrid organic-inorganic MLD process with an inorganic atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) process, ALD/MLD alloy films can be deposited that have
   an adjustable organic-inorganic composition. These alloys have tunable
   properties that may be useful for designing various functional films. In
   this study, alucone MLD using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and ethylene
   glycol (EG) was employed together with Al2O3 ALD using TMA and H2O to
   deposit alucone alloys at 135 degrees C. The surface species and film
   growth were examined using in situ Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. The mass gain for each reactant exposure during film
   growth was also monitored using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance
   (QCM) in a viscous flow reactor. The composition of the alucone alloy
   was varied by adjusting the relative number of ALD and MLD cycles in the
   reaction sequence. Alucone alloys were grown using relative numbers of
   ALD and MLD cycles varying from 1:3 to 6:1 (TMA/H2O:TMA/EG). These
   alucone alloys displayed varying density, refractive index, elastic
   modulus, and hardness. The density and refractive index changed from 1.6
   g/cm(3) and n = 1.45 for pure alucone to 3.0 g/cm(3) and n = 1.64 for
   pure Al2O3, respectively. The elastic modulus and hardness varied from
   21 +/- 8 GPa and 1.0 +/- 0.1 GPa for pure alucone to 198 +/- 8 GPa and
   13.0 +/- 0.2 GPa for pure Al2O3, respectively. These results demonstrate
   the potential of ALD/MLD alloy films to provide tunable properties for
   many functional film applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a new technique that grafts poly (ethylene glycol)
   (PEG) onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to enhance the cohesion and water
   lubrication performances of PDMS. The technique employs a two-step
   hydrosilylation, using vinyl PEG, poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS). and
   poly(methylvinylsiloxane) (PMVS). Characterization of the
   hydrosilylation process was performed with attenuated total
   reflectance-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Results
   showed that around 88\% of active Si H function groups in PMHS were
   consumed to graft vinyl PEG and the rest were used to crosslink PMVS.
   Measurements of contact angles were used to determine the hydrophilicity
   and surface energy of the resultant PEG-g-PMHS-c-PMVS copolymers with
   varying PEG ratio. Results showed that both hydrophilicity and surface
   energy of the copolymers increased with the PEG ratio. Mechanical and
   cohesive characterizations of the copolymers showed that the flexibility
   of the copolymers increased with the PEG ratio, and thus normal preloads
   required to produce maximal cohesion forces or cohesion strengths
   decreased with increasing ratio of PEG. Results from friction tests
   further demonstrated that water lubrication performances of copolymers
   gradually increased with the PEG ratio. Our results suggested that the
   two-step hydrosilylation technique enhanced the formation of homogeneous
   mixtures between polar PEG and non-polar PDMS macromolecules. PMHS
   groups, through mediating PEG grafting onto PMVS, played an important
   role in improving PDMS properties, including hydrophilicity, cohesion
   and water lubrication performances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Elevated mixing ratios of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and CFC-12), and
   sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have been observed at Lamont-Doherty Earth
   Observatory (LDEO), located approximately 25 km north of New York City
   (NYC). Emissions and transport of these gases are of interest because of
   their global warming potential, the role of CFCs in depletion of
   stratospheric ozone and information they provide on the transport of
   atmospheric pollutants. Comparison of trace gas time series with
   meteorological data indicates that both NYC and the region to the
   southwest (New Jersey and the Philadelphia -Washington DC area) are
   significant sources of CFCs, and confirms that NYC is an unusually large
   source of SF6. From 1996 to 2005 the elevation of CFC-12 mixing ratio
   above that of the remote (well mixed) atmosphere has decreased on
   average by 5.2 +/- 0.6 ppt y(-1), whereas that of CFC-11 has not changed
   significantly (0.0 +/- 2.0 ppt y(-1)). From 1998 to 2006, the elevation
   of SF6 mixing ratios above that of the remote atmosphere declined by 0.4
   +/- 0.1 ppt y(-1). Time series of the same gases measured at Harvard
   Forest, 205 km northeast of LDEO, demonstrate transport of air masses
   with elevated levels of these gases from their source region to central
   Massachusetts. Emissions in the local area around LDEO were quantified
   through analysis of diurnal cycles. Local CFC-12 emissions decreased ca.
   95\% between 1996 and 2005 while CFC-11 emission decreased ca. 51\%
   during the same period. Local SF6 emissions decreased by 47\% between
   1998 and 2005. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforced-concrete-frame buildings, particularly midrise multifamily
   condominium structures, experienced significant damage in the 2009
   L'Aquila, Italy earthquake. The most frequently observed damage was
   cracking and failure of nonstructural masonry infill walls, but some
   buildings also experienced structural damage, including column shear
   failure and collapse. Fieldwork conducted approximately 3 weeks after
   the earthquake was used to collect data from approximately 483 concrete
   frame structures in L'Aquila, including building location,
   characteristics, damage, and postearthquake occupancy. A second survey 1
   year later investigated whether buildings had been repaired or
   reoccupied. These results show that the building damage is correlated to
   height, usage, elevation irregularities in strength and stiffness, and
   the ground-shaking intensity at each site. This information provides the
   basis for empirically derived fragility functions for this typology of
   concrete frame. Approximately 0.2\% of concrete structures collapsed.
   The study also shows that occupants of tall and older condominium
   structures in areas north and west of the city center were particularly
   affected; single-family homes were less damaged and more likely to be
   occupied during fieldwork. Damaged concrete buildings have led to
   significant disruption of the community and social fabric, causing the
   temporary or permanent closure of small businesses, medical offices,
   restaurants, churches, and schools. DOI:

Abstract = {{We examined home safety hazards, comparing renter- to owner-occupied
   housing among urban, immigrant Mexican families. Methods: Interviews and
   home inspections were conducted among urban, Spanish-speaking immigrant
   families with children. We estimated weighted hazard prevalence and used
   logistic regression to compare owner- and renter-occupied homes. Of 313
   eligible households, 250 (80\%) enrolled. Respondents were predominantly
   Mexican-born (99\%), low income (72.6\%) and lower education (92.3\%).
   Most homes had fire, burn, fall, poisoning, electrocution and fire
   escape hazards, including high tap water temperatures (76.4\%; 95\% CI:
   69.0, 83.7\%), no working smoke alarms (60.0\%; 51.3, 68.8\%), slippery
   bathtub/shower surfaces (58.7\%; 49.9, 67.5\%), blocked fire escape
   routes (55.9\%; 47.2, 64.5\%) and child-accessible medications (71.0\%;
   60.1, 81.3\%). After adjustment for sociodemographics, fire escape (OR =
   8.8; 95\% CI: 2.8, 27.7), carbon monoxide poisoning (OR = 2.9; 1.4, 6.2)
   and drowning (OR = 3.5; 1.3, 9.4) hazards were more likely in owner-than
   renter-occupied homes. Housing age and type explained most differences.
   Many urban, immigrant Spanish-speaking families live in unsafe homes.
   For this population, housing safety programs should be targeted based on
   housing age and type rather than tenure.}},

   This paper presents the four awarded algorithms and the conclusions of
   the contest, investigating both supervised and unsupervised methods and
   the use of multi-modal data for flood detection. Interestingly, a simple
   unsupervised change detection method provided similar accuracy as
   supervised approaches, and a digital elevation model-based predictive

Abstract = {{The areal capacity of nanowire-based micro-batteries can be potentially
   increased by increasing the length of nanowires. However, agglomeration
   of high aspect ratio nanowire arrays could greatly degrade the
   performance of nanowires for lithium ion (Li-ion) battery applications.
   In this work, a three-dimensional (3-D) Ni/TiO2 nanowire network was
   successfully fabricated using a 3-D porous anodic alumina (PAA)
   template-assisted electrodeposition of Ni followed by TiO2 coating using
   atomic layer deposition. Compared to the straight Ni/TiO2 nanowire
   arrays fabricated using conventional PAA templates, the 3-D Ni/TiO2
   nanowire network shows higher areal discharging capacity. The areal
   capacity increases proportionally with the length of nanowires. With a
   stable Ni/TiO2 nanowire network structure, 100\% capacity is retained
   after 600 cycles. This work paves the way to build reliable 3-D
   nanostructured electrodes for high areal capacity microbatteries.}},

Abstract = {{Acousto-optic imaging is a hybrid imaging technique that exploits the
   interaction between light and sound to image optical contrast at depth
   in optically turbid media with the high spatial resolution of
   ultrasound. Quantitative measurement of optical properties using this
   technique is confounded by multiple parameters that influence the
   detected acousto-optic signal. In this article, we describe the origin
   of the acousto-optic response and review techniques that have been
   proposed to relate this response to the optical properties of turbid
   media. We present an overview of two acousto-optic sensing approaches.
   In the first, we demonstrate that the local transport mean free path
   within turbid media can be obtained by varying the pressure of the
   ultrasound field and processing the resulting acousto-optic signals. In
   the second, we demonstrate that the acousto-optic response elicited by a
   high-intensity ultrasound field during thermal therapy can be used to
   monitor the onset of lesion formation, ascertain lesion volume, and
   provide real-time control of exposure duration.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The optical, electrical, magnetic, and catalytic properties of colloidal
   nanocrystals are intimately tied to their form, in particular their
   physical size and shape. Synthetic techniques have been developed to
   produce metallic and semiconducting nanomaterials with well-controlled
   forms; however, characterization tools for describing shape have
   remained limited to small samples and lack the quantitative rigor
   necessary for a universal classification scheme. Here complex Fourier
   descriptors are shown to be a quantitative and high-throughput approach
   for classifying the shape of colloidal nanocrystals. Large,
   monodisperse, and polydisperse ensembles of CdSe nanocrystals are
   characterized with respect to shape and categorized as circles,
   triangles, squares, rods, and pentagonal or hexagonal platelets. These
   results suggest that classification of shape by Fourier descriptor
   analysis may in the near future be a powerful tool for continuous
   monitoring of synthesis, purification, or packaging/integration
   processes during industrial-scale production of nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of VIRTIS-M-IR observations of 1.74 mu m emission
   from the nightside of Venus. The 1.74 mu m window in the near infrared
   spectrum of Venus is an ideal proxy for investigating the evolution of
   middle and lower cloud deck opacity of Venus because it exhibits good
   signal to noise due to its brightness, good contrast between bright and
   dark regions, and few additional sources of extinction beside the clouds
   themselves. We have analyzed the data from the first 407 orbits
   (equivalent to 407 Earth days) of the Venus Express mission to determine
   the magnitude of variability in the 1.74 mu m radiance. We have also
   performed an analysis of the evolution of individual features over a
   span of roughly 5-6 h on two successive orbits of Venus Express. We find
   that the overall 1.74 mu m brightness of Venus has been increasing
   through the first 407 days of the mission, indicating a gradual
   diminishing of the cloud coverage and/or thickness, and that the lower
   latitudes exhibited more variability and more brightening than higher
   latitudes. We find that individual features evolve with a time scale of
   about 30 h, consistent with our previous analysis. Analysis of the
   evolution and motion of the clouds can be used to estimate the mesoscale
   dynamics within the clouds of Venus. We find that advection alone cannot
   explain the observed evolution of the features. The measured vorticity
   and divergence in the vicinity of the features are consistent with
   evolution under the influence of significant vertical motions likely
   driven by a radiative dynamical feedback. We measure a zonal wind speed
   of around 65 m/s, and a meridional wind speed around 2.5 m/s by tracking
   the motion of the central region of the features. But we also find that
   the measured wind speeds depend strongly on the points chosen for the
   wind speed analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of ultraviolet markings on Venus, their observations
   have been a powerful tool to study the morphology, motions and dynamical
   state at the cloud top level. Here we present the results of
   investigation of the cloud top morphology performed by the Venus
   Monitoring Camera (VMC) during more than 3 years of the Venus Express
   mission. The camera acquires images in four narrow-band filters centered
   at 365, 513, 965 and 1010 nm with spatial resolution from 50 km at
   apocentre to a few hundred of meters at pericentre. The VMC experiment
   provides a significant improvement in the Venus imaging as compared to
   the capabilities of the earlier missions. The camera discovered new
   cloud features like bright ``lace clouds{''} and cloud columns at the
   low latitudes, dark polar oval and narrow circular and spiral
   ``grooves{''} in the polar regions, different types of waves at the high
   latitudes. The VMC observations revealed detailed structure of the
   sub-solar region and the afternoon convective wake, the bow-shape
   features and convective cells, the mid-latitude transition region and
   the ``polar cap{''}. The polar orbit of the satellite enables for the
   first time nadir viewing of the Southern polar regions and an
   opportunity to zoom in on the planet. The experiment returned numerous
   images of the Venus limb and documented global and local brightening
   events. VMC provided almost continuous monitoring of the planet with
   high temporal resolution that allowed one to follow changes in the cloud
   morphology at various scales.
   We present the in-flight performance of the instrument and focus in
   particular on the data from the ultraviolet channel, centered at the
   characteristic wavelength of the unknown UV absorber that yields the
   highest contrasts on the cloud top. Low latitudes are dominated by
   relatively dark clouds that have mottled and fragmented appearance
   clearly indicating convective activity in the sub-solar region. At
   similar to 50 degrees latitude this pattern gives way to streaky clouds
   suggesting that horizontal, almost laminar, flow prevails here. Poleward
   from about 60 degrees S the planet is covered by almost featureless
   bright polar hood sometimes crossed by dark narrow (similar to 300 km)
   spiral or circular structures. This global cloud pattern can change on
   time scales of a few days resulting in global and local ``brightening
   events{''} when the bright haze can extend far into low latitudes and/or
   increase its brightness by 30\%. Close-up snapshots reveal plenty of
   morphological details like convective cells, cloud streaks, cumulus-like
   columns, wave trains. Different kinds of small scale waves are
   frequently observed at the cloud top. The wave activity is mainly
   observed in the 65-80 degrees latitude band and is in particular
   concentrated in the region of Ishtar Terra that suggests their possible
   orographic origin. The VMC observations have important implications for
   the problems of the unknown UV absorber, microphysical processes,
   dynamics and radiative energy balance at the cloud tops. They are only
   briefly discussed in the paper, but each of them will be the subject of
   a dedicated study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison campaign to evaluate and compare troposphere delays from
   different ray-tracing software was carried out under the umbrella of the
   International Association of Geodesy Working Group 4.3.3 in the first
   half of 2010 with five institutions participating: the GFZ German
   Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), the Groupe de Recherche de
   Geodesie Spatiale, the National Institute of Information and
   Communications Technology (NICT), the University of New Brunswick, and
   the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics of the Vienna University of
   Technology. High-resolution data from the operational analysis of the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for stations
   Tsukuba (Japan) and Wettzell (Germany) were provided to the participants
   of the comparison campaign. The data consisted of geopotential
   differences with respect to mean sea level, temperature, and specific
   humidity, all at isobaric levels. Additionally, information about the
   geoid undulations was provided, and the participants computed the
   ray-traced total delays for 5. elevation angle and every degree in
   azimuth. In general, we find good agreement between the ray-traced slant
   factors from the different solutions at 5. elevation if determined from
   the same pressure level data of the ECMWF. Standard deviations and
   biases are at the 1-cm level (or significantly better for some
   combinations). Some of these discrepancies are due to differences in the
   algorithms and the interpolation approaches. If compared with slant
   factors determined from ECMWF native model level data, the biases can be
   significantly larger.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization under multiple linear constraints is important for
   practical systems with individual power constraints, per-antenna power
   constraints, and/or interference constraints as in cognitive radios.
   While for single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel
   transmitter optimization, no one uses general purpose convex programming
   because water-filling is optimal and much simpler, it is not true for
   MIMO multiaccess channels (MAC), broadcast channels (BC), and the
   nonconvex optimization of interference networks because the traditional
   water-filling is far from optimal for networks. We recently found the
   right form of water-filling, polite water-filling, for capacity or
   achievable regions of the general MIMO interference networks, named
   B-MAC networks, which include BC, MAC, interference channels, X
   networks, and most practical wireless networks as special cases. In this
   paper, we extend the polite water-filling results from a single linear
   constraint to multiple linear constraints and use weighted sum-rate
   maximization as an example to show how to design high efficiency and low
   complexity algorithms, which find optimal solution for convex cases and
   locally optimal solution for nonconvex cases. Several times faster
   convergence speed and orders of magnitude higher accuracy than the
   state-of-the-art are demonstrated by numerical examples.}},

Title = {{Ray-traced slant factors for mitigating the tropospheric delay at the
   observation level}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODESY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{149-160}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional ray tracing through a numerical weather model has been
   applied to a global precise point positioning (PPP) campaign for
   modeling both the elevation angle- and azimuth-dependence of the
   tropospheric delay. Rather than applying the ray-traced slant delays
   directly, the delay has been parameterized in terms of slant factors,
   which are applied in a similar manner to traditional mapping functions,
   but which can account for the azimuthal asymmetry of the delay. Five
   strategies are considered: (1) Vienna Mapping Functions 1 (VMF1) and
   estimation of a residual zenith delay parameter; (2) VMF1, estimation of
   a residual zenith delay and estimation of two tropospheric gradient
   parameters; (3) three-dimensional ray-traced slant factors and
   estimation of a residual zenith delay; (4) using only ray-traced slant
   factors and no estimation of any tropospheric parameters and; (5) using
   both ray-traced slant factors and estimating a residual zenith delay and
   two tropospheric gradient parameters. The use of the ray-traced slant
   factors (solution 3) showed a 3.8\% improvement in the repeatability of
   the up component when compared to the assumption of a symmetric
   atmosphere (solution 1), while the estimation of two tropospheric
   gradient parameters gave the best results showing an 7.6\% improvement
   over solution 1 in the up component. Solution 4 performed well in the
   horizontal domain, allowing for sub-centimeter repeatability but the up
   component was degraded due to deficiencies in the modeling of the zenith
   delay, particularly for stations located at equatorial latitudes. The
   magnitude of the differences in the mean coordinates between solution 2
   and solution 3, and the strong correlation with the differences between
   the north component and the ray-traced gradients (coefficient of
   correlation of 0.83), as well as the impact of observation geometry on
   the gradient solution indicate that the use of the ray-traced slant
   factors could have an implication on the realization of reference
   frames. The estimated tropospheric products from the PPP solutions were
   compared to those derived from ray tracing. For the zenith delay, a root
   mean square (RMS) of 5.4 mm was found, while for the gradient terms, a
   correlation coefficient of 0.46 for the N-S and 0.42 for the E-W was
   found for the north-south and east-west components, suggesting that
   there are still important differences in the gradient parameters which
   could be due to either errors in the NWM or to non-tropospheric error
   sources leaking into the PPP-estimated gradients.}},

Title = {{Terrestrial biosphere models need better representation of vegetation
   phenology: results from the North American Carbon Program Site Synthesis}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{566-584}},

Abstract = {{Phenology, by controlling the seasonal activity of vegetation on the
   land surface, plays a fundamental role in regulating photosynthesis and
   other ecosystem processes, as well as competitive interactions and
   feedbacks to the climate system. We conducted an analysis to evaluate
   the representation of phenology, and the associated seasonality of
   ecosystem-scale CO2 exchange, in 14 models participating in the North
   American Carbon Program Site Synthesis. Model predictions were evaluated
   using long-term measurements (emphasizing the period 20002006) from 10
   forested sites within the AmeriFlux and Fluxnet-Canada networks. In
   deciduous forests, almost all models consistently predicted that the
   growing season started earlier, and ended later, than was actually
   observed; biases of 2 weeks or more were typical. For these sites, most
   models were also unable to explain more than a small fraction of the
   observed interannual variability in phenological transition dates.
   Finally, for deciduous forests, misrepresentation of the seasonal cycle
   resulted in over-prediction of gross ecosystem photosynthesis by +160
   145 g C m-2 yr-1 during the spring transition period and +75 +/- 130 g C
   m-2 yr-1 during the autumn transition period (13\% and 8\% annual
   productivity, respectively) compensating for the tendency of most models
   to under-predict the magnitude of peak summertime photosynthetic rates.
   Models did a better job of predicting the seasonality of CO2 exchange
   for evergreen forests. These results highlight the need for improved
   understanding of the environmental controls on vegetation phenology and
   incorporation of this knowledge into better phenological models.
   Existing models are unlikely to predict future responses of phenology to
   climate change accurately and therefore will misrepresent the
   seasonality and interannual variability of key biosphereatmosphere
   feedbacks and interactions in coupled global climate models.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal efficiency of a parabolic trough collector is a function of
   both the fraction of direct normal radiation absorbed by the receiver
   (the optical efficiency) and the heat lost to the environment when the
   receiver is at operating temperature. The thermal efficiency can be
   determined by testing the collector under actual operating conditions or
   by separately measuring these two components. This paper describes how
   outdoor measurement of the optical efficiency is combined with
   laboratory measurements of receiver heat loss to obtain the thermal
   efficiency curve. This paper describes this approach and also makes the
   case that there are advantages to plotting collector efficiency versus
   the difference between the operating temperature and the ambient
   temperature at which the receiver heat loss was measured divided by
   radiation to a fractional power (on the order of 1/3 but obtained via
   data regression)-as opposed to the difference between operating and
   ambient temperatures divided by the radiation. The results are shown to
   be robust over wide ranges of ambient temperature, sky temperature, and
   wind speed. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005247]}},

Abstract = {{Distributed hydrologic models typically require spatial estimates of
   precipitation interpolated from sparsely located observational points to
   the specific grid points. We compare and contrast the performance of
   regression-based statistical methods for the spatial estimation of
   precipitation in two hydrologically different basins and confirmed that
   widely used regression-based estimation schemes fail to describe the
   realistic spatial variability of daily precipitation field. The methods
   assessed are: (1) inverse distance weighted average; (2) multiple linear
   regression (MLR); (3) climatological MLR; and (4) locally weighted
   polynomial regression (LWP). In order to improve the performance of the
   interpolations, the authors propose a two-step regression technique for
   effective daily precipitation estimation. In this simple two-step
   estimation process, precipitation occurrence is first generated via a
   logistic regression model before estimate the amount of precipitation
   separately on wet days. This process generated the precipitation
   occurrence, amount, and spatial correlation effectively. A distributed
   hydrologic model (PRMS) was used for the impact analysis in daily time
   step simulation. Multiple simulations suggested noticeable differences
   between the input alternatives generated by three different
   interpolation schemes. Differences are shown in overall simulation error
   against the observations, degree of explained variability, and seasonal
   volumes. Simulated streamflows also showed different characteristics in
   mean, maximum, minimum, and peak flows. Given the same parameter
   optimization technique, LWP input showed least streamflow error in
   Alapaha basin and CMLR input showed least error (still very close to
   LWP) in Animas basin. All of the two-step interpolation inputs resulted
   in lower streamflow error compared to the directly interpolated inputs.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on hollow carbon nanofibers (HCNIrs) as anode
   materials for Li-ion batteries. Various HCNEs are synthesized using
   co-axial electrospinning of styrene-co-acrylonitrile (core) and
   poly(acrylonitrile) (shell) solutions and subsequent thermal treatments.
   The microstructures of HCNEs are examined using SEM, Raman spectroscopy,
   WAXD, and HR-TEM. The effect of the carbonization temperature on their
   turbostratic carbon structures and electrochemical properties is
   systematically investigated. As the carbonization temperature increases,
   both crystallite thickness and length significantly increases while the
   initial irreversible capacity decreases. These predictable
   microstructure and electrochemical performance of HCNEs provide
   important insight for the design of novel nanostructurecl anode
   materials such as Si or Sn encapsulated HCNFs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{484-498}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to characterise stochastic macroscopic
   material properties of heterogeneous composite fabrics from limited-size
   macro-scale experimental measurements. The work is presented in a
   sequence of two papers. In the first paper (Part I), a database
   consisting of observations of heterogeneous Young's modulus fields is
   obtained by a set of deterministic inverse problems. In this paper (Part
   II), a data assimilation framework is considered to identify a
   stochastic random field model of the Young's modulus. Such a model is
   set up to account for both aleatory uncertainties, related to sample
   inter-variabilities, as well as epistemic uncertainties due to
   insufficiency of the available data. This uncertainty characterisation
   is achieved by discretising the random field using a spectral
   decomposition procedure known as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. Random
   variables of this representation are expanded in a Hermite Polynomial
   Chaos (PC) basis whose coefficients themselves are considered as random
   variables. While the Gaussian variables of the PC basis model the
   aleatory uncertainty, the PC coefficients represent the epistemic
   uncertainty. A Bayesian inference scheme with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   sampler is implemented to characterise the PC coefficients according to
   the Maximum A posteriori Probability (MAP) estimator. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{The ecology of pulse events: insights from an extreme climatic event in
   a polar desert ecosystem}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is occurring globally, with wide ranging impacts on
   organisms and ecosystems alike. While most studies focus on increases in
   mean temperatures and changes in precipitation, there is growing
   evidence that an increase in extreme events may be particularly
   important to altering ecosystem structure and function. During extreme
   events organisms encounter environmental conditions well beyond the
   range normally experienced. Such conditions may cause rapid changes in
   community composition and ecosystem states. We present the impact of an
   extreme pulse event ( a flood) on soil communities in an Antarctic polar
   desert. Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, is dominated by large
   expanses of dry, saline soils. During the austral summer, melting of
   glaciers, snow patches and subsurface ice supplies water to ephemeral
   streams and wetlands. We show how the activation of a non-annual
   ephemeral stream, Wormherder Creek, and the associated wetland during an
   exceptional high-flow event alters soil properties and communities. The
   flow of water increased soil water availability and decreased salinity
   within the wetted zone compared with the surrounding dry soils. We
   propose that periodic leaching of salts from flooding reduces soil
   osmotic stress to levels that are more favorable for soil organisms,
   improving the habitat suitability, which has a strong positive effect on
   soil animal abundance and diversity. Moreover, we found that communities
   differentiated along a soil moisture gradient and that overland water
   flow created greater connectivity within the landscape, and is expected
   to promote soil faunal dispersal. Thus, floods can `precondition' soils
   to support belowground communities by creating conditions below or above
   key environmental thresholds. We conclude that pulse events can have
   significant long-term impacts on soil habitat suitability, and knowledge
   of pulse events is essential for understanding the present distribution
   and functioning of communities in soil ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube reinforced polymer composites have novel properties that
   make them useful in a wide variety of applications and there has been
   numerous studies to predict the overall bulk properties of these
   nanocomposites. Theoretical studies to understand the properties of
   these nanomaterials consider the nanometer dimension of a nanotube and
   attempt to understand its interaction with a polymer chain thereby
   coupling the various length scales and time scales. In this paper, we
   estimate the properties of the central nanotube (neat or functionalized)
   which is embedded in a matrix material. The investigation of mechanical
   behavior of nanostructure materials is carried out using molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations and these interactions are subsequently
   idealized into a homogenized model. The interactions of the molecules of
   the nanotube with the matrix usually creates an interphase layer which
   has reduced mobility. This paper also discusses the variation of the
   effective properties of the interphase region in a carbon nanotube
   reinforced nanocomposite system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Highly porous alumina particles with precise wall thickness control were
   synthesized by atomic layer deposition (AID) of alumina on highly porous
   poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) particle templates. Alumina ALD
   was carried out using alternating reactions of trimethylaluminum and
   water at 33 degrees C. The growth rate of alumina was similar to 0.3 nm
   per coating cycle. The wall thickness can be precisely controlled by
   adjusting the number of ALD coating cycles. Thermo-gravimetric analysis,
   X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy,
   and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the
   fabricated porous alumina particles. The effect of number of ALD coating
   cycles and calcination temperature on the mesoporous structure of the
   alumina particles was investigated. gamma-Alumina was formed at
   temperature above 600 degrees C. Porous alumina particles with a surface
   area of 80-100 m(2)/g were obtained and thermally stable at 800 degrees
   C. The pore volume of the porous particles can be as high as 1 cm(3)/g
   after calcination at 800 degrees C. Such porous alumina particles may
   find wide application in nanotechnology and catalysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents are being developed as
   image-guided gene carriers for targeted delivery in vivo. In this study,
   novel polyplex-microbubbles were synthesized, characterized and
   evaluated for systemic circulation and tumor transfection. Branched
   polyethylenimine (PEI; 25 kDa) was modified with polyethylene glycol (
   PEG; 5 kDa), thiolated and covalently attached to maleimide groups on
   lipid-coated microbubbles. The PEI-microbubbles demonstrated
   increasingly positive surface charge and DNA loading capacity with
   increasing maleimide content. The in vivo ultrasound contrast
   persistence of PEI-microbubbles was measured in the healthy mouse
   kidney, and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model accounting for free
   and adherent microbubbles was developed to describe the anomalous
   time-intensity curves. The model suggested that PEI loading dramatically
   reduced free circulation and increased nonspecific adhesion to the
   vasculature. However, DNA loading to form polyplex-microbubbles
   increased circulation in the bloodstream and decreased nonspecific
   adhesion. PEI-microbubbles coupled to a luciferase bioluminescence
   reporter plasmid DNA were shown to transfect tumors implanted in the
   mouse kidney. Site-specific delivery was achieved using ultrasound
   applied over the tumor area following bolus injection of the
   DNA/PEI-microbubbles. In vivo imaging showed over 10-fold higher
   bioluminescence from the tumor region compared to untreated tissue. Ex
   vivo analysis of excised tumors showed greater than 40-fold higher
   expression in tumor tissue than non-sonicated control ( heart) tissue.
   These results suggest that the polyplex-microbubble platform offers
   improved control of DNA loading and packaging suitable for
   ultrasound-guided tissue transfection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate an improved technique for nanomechanical imaging in
   atomic force microscopy. By merging the sensitivity to contact stiffness
   inherent to contact resonance (CR) spectroscopy with the delicate nature
   and potential for adhesion data of pulsed-force mode, we address major
   shortcomings of both techniques. Fast CR data are recorded during each
   pulsed cycle by driving the sample at two frequencies near the CR
   frequency and modeling the contact as a harmonic oscillator. The
   technique provides nanomechanical parameters including frequency,
   quality factor, and adhesion force. Compared to continuous contact, the
   technique should reduce damage and support more complex analysis models.

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{The pyrolyses of phenol and d(5)-phenol (C6H5OH and C6D5OH) have been
   studied using a high temperature, microtubular (mu tubular) SiC reactor.
   Product detection is via both photon ionization (10.487 eV)
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry and matrix isolation infrared
   spectroscopy. Gas exiting the heated reactor (375 K-1575 K) is subject
   to a free expansion after a residence time in the mu tubular reactor of
   approximately 50-100 mu s. The expansion from the reactor into vacuum
   rapidly cools the gas mixture and allows the detection of radicals and
   other highly reactive intermediates. We find that the initial
   decomposition steps at the onset of phenol pyrolysis are enol/keto
   tautomerization to form cyclohexadienone followed by decarbonylation to
   produce cyclopentadiene; C6H5OH -> c-C6H6  O -> c-C5H6 + CO. The
   cyclopentadiene loses a H atom to generate the cyclopentadienyl radical
   which further decomposes to acetylene and propargyl radical; c-C5H6 ->
   c-C5H5 + H -> HC  CH + HCCCH2. At higher temperatures, hydrogen loss
   from the PhO-H group to form phenoxy radical followed by CO ejection to
   generate the cyclopentadienyl radical likely contributes to the product
   distribution; C6H5O-H -> C6H5O + H -> c-C5H5 + CO. The direct
   decarbonylation reaction remains an important channel in the thermal
   decomposition mechanisms of the dihydroxybenzenes. Both catechol
   (o-HO-C6H4-OH) and hydroquinone (p-HO-C6H4-OH) are shown to undergo
   decarbonylation at the onset of pyrolysis to form
   hydroxycyclopentadiene. In the case of catechol, we observe that water
   loss is also an important decomposition channel at the onset of
   pyrolysis. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Title = {{The quasi 2 day wave and spatial-temporal variability of the OH emission
   and ionosphere}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{The quasi 2 day wave (QTDW) during January 2006 is investigated using
   Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER)
   observations of OH airglow and temperature in the mesosphere and lower
   thermosphere (MLT) and CHAMP in situ electron density observations at an
   altitude of similar to 360 km. The zonal structure of the QTDW during
   early 2006 in the Southern Hemisphere MLT and low-latitude ionosphere is
   dominated by westward propagating zonal wave number 3 (W3) and eastward
   propagating zonal wave number 2 (E2) components. However, the observed
   longitude variability is not fully described by the E2 and W3 components
   of the QTDW. The remaining longitude variability is attributed to the
   presence of nonmigrating tides and secondary waves generated by the
   nonlinear interaction of the QTDW with migrating tides. The nonmigrating
   tides are a combination of those that are generated in situ by QTDW-tide
   nonlinear interactions and those of tropospheric origin that propagate
   upward into the MLT. The results presented demonstrate that nonmigrating
   tides and secondary waves are of considerable importance for determining
   the total longitude variability during periods of enhanced QTDW
   activity. The general similarity between the QTDW in OH airglow and
   temperature indicates that variations in atomic oxygen concentrations
   due to vertical winds during the QTDW are the primary driver of the QTDW
   in the OH airglow emission. However, there are some differences in the
   OH airglow and temperature that we consider to be connected to changes
   in eddy diffusion due to changes in gravity waves during the QTDW. Last,
   although similar zonal structure of the QTDW is observed in the
   ionosphere, the observed longitude variations are not well represented
   by the QTDW components, indicating that nonmigrating tides play a
   critical role in determining longitudinal variability in the ionosphere
   during the QTDW. The importance of nonmigrating tides in the ionosphere
   may be related to the relative efficiency of the QTDW and different
   nonmigrating tides in the generation of electric fields.}},

Title = {{Ionosphere response to recurrent geomagnetic activity in 1974}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{The 9 day variation of Earth's thermosphere neutral density in 2005 and
   2006 is known to have been influenced by rotating solar coronal holes
   and the quasiperiodic solar wind high-speed streams (HSSs) and by the
   concomitant recurrent geomagnetic activity that they induce. The
   corresponding responses in ion temperature, ionospheric electron
   density, and total electron content have also been reported during the
   same period. In 1974, a significant 13.5 day periodicity in geomagnetic
   activity was created by the quasiperiodic HSS associated with two major
   solar coronal hole regions separated by about 180 degrees. In the
   present paper, ionospheric F-region peak plasma density (NmF2) and
   height (h(m)F(2)) in the daytime and nighttime from 12 ionosonde
   stations are analyzed to delineate the responses to this epoch of HSS
   forcing of the geospace system. Results show that the ionospheric
   responses to this 13.5 day periodic forcing are similar in some ways to
   responses to the 9 day periodicity. For instance, in middle and high
   latitudes, daytime and nighttime NmF2 is mostly out of phase with the
   fluctuations in the daily mean K-p index ((K-p) over bar), while the
   daytime h(m)F(2) are in phase with the (K-p) over bar fluctuations.
   Empirical model results confirm the important role of thermal expansion
   in connecting thermospheric and ionospheric changes driven by high-speed
   streams and recurrent geomagnetic activity. At low latitudes, the 13.5
   day signatures are not as straightforward as those at middle and high
   latitudes, and significant spectral energy thought to be connected with
   planetary waves and perhaps other lower-atmosphere influences exists at
   periods of less than 13.5 days.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrashort pulses of extreme ultraviolet light from high-harmonic
   generation are a new tool for probing coupled charge, spin, and phonon
   dynamics with element specificity, attosecond pump-probe
   synchronization, and time resolution of a few femtoseconds in a tabletop
   apparatus. In this paper, we address an important question in
   magneto-optics that has implications for understanding magnetism on the
   fastest time scales: Is the signal from the transverse magneto-optical
   Kerr effect at the M-2,M-3 edges of a magnetic material purely magnetic
   or is it perturbed by nonmagnetic artifacts? Our measurements
   demonstrate conclusively that transverse magneto-optical Kerr
   measurements at the M-2,M-3 edges sensitively probe the magnetic state,
   with almost negligible contributions from the transient variation of the
   refractive index by the nonequilibrium hot-electron distribution. In
   addition, we compare pump-probe demagnetization dynamics measured by
   both high harmonics and conventional visible-wavelength magneto-optics
   and find that the measured demagnetization times are in agreement.}},

   Group B particles have been carried out with an emphasis on cluster

   (Chew et al., this issue). A fiber optic probe was used for detection of
   solids, with the resulting solids cluster identification accomplished
   using wavelet decomposition. Three cluster characteristics were
   evaluated - appearance probability, duration, and frequency - as a
   function of riser position, operating condition, and type of solids
   (i.e., variations in particle size and/or material density). Results
   indicate that the riser position has the most dominant influence on
   cluster characteristics with the cluster appearance probability
   appearing to be largely a function of riser position only, and
   insensitive to changes in operating condition or material type. The
   cluster duration and frequency are influenced by the particle material
   and operating condition, though only from mid-height of the riser
   upwards. The results presented provide a comprehensive picture of
   factors affecting cluster trends. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Experiments with a focus on the impact of polydispersity on clustering
   characteristics (namely, appearance probability, duration, and
   frequency) of Geldart Group B particles in a circulating fluidized bed
   (CFB) riser have been performed. Three mixtures are considered: (i) a
   density-difference binary mixture, with species of different material
   density (rho(s)) but similar particle sizes (d(ave)), (ii) a
   size-difference binary mixture, with species of different d(ave) but
   similar material density rho(s), and (iii) a continuous particle size
   distribution (PSD). Local cluster information spanning the entire riser
   was obtained over a range of operating conditions using a fiber optic
   probe. Results show that cluster trends for the binary mixtures are
   similar to those reported in the companion work for monodisperse
   materials (Chew et al., this issue) on two counts. First, local riser
   position has a significant influence on all three cluster
   characteristics, while effects of operating condition and material type
   are secondary. Second, among the three cluster characteristics, the
   cluster appearance probability is most influenced by local position, and
   least affected by operating condition and material type. Furthermore,
   the density-difference binary mixture exhibits a distinctly lower
   cluster duration than either of its constituent components. In contrast,
   the size-difference binary mixture has a cluster duration profile that
   mimics one constituent component, while the frequency profile mimics the
   other. Comparing the two binary mixtures at any riser location, the
   density-difference binary mixture has lower cluster duration and higher
   frequency than the size-difference binary mixture regardless of local
   position. Finally, with respect to the continuous PSD, which was
   investigated under a wider range of operating conditions, the effect of
   operating condition is more apparent. This deviation may be due to an
   inherent behavioral difference between binary mixture and continuous PSD
   and/or to the wider range of operating conditions examined. (C) 2011

   double triple (CCSD(T)) with the augmented correlation consistent triple
   zeta basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ). The reaction path potentials are obtained
   from a series of CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVnTZ calculations extrapolated to the
   complete basis set limit. Approximate 1D calculations of the tunneling
   splitting for these 1,2-H atom migrations are obtained using each of
   these potentials as well as quite different 1D Hamiltonians. The
   splittings are calculated over a large energy ranges, with results from
   the two sets of calculations in excellent agreement. Though negligibly
   slow (> 1 s) for the vibrational ground state, this work predicts
   tunneling-promoted 1,2 hydride shift dynamics in vinyl to exhibit
   exponential growth with internal vibrational excitation, specifically
   achieving rates on the sub-mu s time scale at energies above E
   approximate to 7500 cm(-1). Most importantly, these results begin to
   elucidate the possible role of quantum isomerization through barriers
   without dissociation, in competition with the more conventional picture
   of classical roaming permitted over a much narrower window of energies
   immediately below the bond dissociation limit. Furthermore, when
   integrated over a Boltzmann distribution of thermal energies, these
   microcanonical tunneling rates are consistent with sub-mu s time scales
   for 1,2 hydride shift dynamics at T > 1400 K. These results have
   potential relevance for combustion modeling of low-pressure flames, as
   well as recent observations of nuclear spin statistical mixing from
   high-resolution IR/microwave spectroscopy on vinyl radical. (C) 2012

Title = {{Daily spatiotemporal precipitation simulation using latent and
   transformed Gaussian processes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{A daily stochastic spatiotemporal precipitation generator that yields
   spatially consistent gridded quantitative precipitation realizations is
   described. The methodology relies on a latent Gaussian process to drive
   precipitation occurrence and a probability integral transformed Gaussian
   process for intensity. At individual locations, the model reduces to a
   Markov chain for precipitation occurrence and a gamma distribution for
   precipitation intensity, allowing statistical parameters to be included
   in a generalized linear model framework. Statistical parameters are
   modeled as spatial Gaussian processes, which allows for interpolation to
   locations where there are no direct observations via kriging. One
   advantage of such a model for the statistical parameters is that
   stochastic generator parameters are immediately available at any
   location, with the ability to adapt to spatially varying precipitation
   characteristics. A second advantage is that parameter uncertainty,
   generally unavailable with deterministic interpolators, can be
   immediately quantified at all locations. The methodology is illustrated
   on two data sets, the first in Iowa and the second over the Pampas
   region of Argentina. In both examples, the method is able to capture the
   local and domain aggregated precipitation behavior fairly well at a wide
   range of time scales, including daily, monthly, and annually.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation and dissolution reactions in fractures alter apertures,
   which in turn affects their flow and transport properties. We consider
   aperture alteration by precipitation in a ``gradient-reaction{''} regime
   where fluids are close to chemical equilibrium with a mineral

   Carlo simulations on computer-generated aperture fields suggest that the

   formation of elongated precipitate bodies perpendicular to the mean flow

Title = {{The role of dissolved organic matter in arctic surface waters in the
   photolysis of hexachlorobenzene and lindane}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{Terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) can impact the fate
   of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are transported to the
   Arctic via global distillation. Interactions between DOM and POPs
   through hydrophobic binding processes may influence their photofate in
   arctic surface waters. We examined the DOM-mediated photodegradation of
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in
   arctic surface waters. These two halogenated organic compounds are
   commonly detected in the Arctic. We examined how different sources of
   DOM affect the indirect photolysis of these compounds. We conducted our
   study using DOM from arctic streams and lakes near the Toolik Lake
   Long-term Ecological Research Site. HCB or lindane was irradiated in the
   presence and absence of DOM from these sources, both at the surface of
   an arctic lake and at 10 cm depth, to investigate the indirect
   phototransformation of these two compounds and the depth dependence of
   the observed chemistry. In both artificial and natural sunlight, two of
   four DOM sources studied stimulated the photodegradation of HCB but not
   of lindane, suggesting that the indirect phototransformation is a
   selective process depending on the interactions between DOM and POPs.
   Through solubility studies, we found that HCB readily partitions to
   isolated Toolik Lake DOM, while lindane shows no affinity for DOM,
   findings that corroborate results previously reported in the literature.
   We demonstrate for the first time DOM's role as a sensitizer for
   photodegradation of some POPs under field conditions, thus confirming
   that this process may be an important control on the fate of POPs
   exhibiting a strong affinity for DOM.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The majority of previous research investigating the fate of
   endocrine-disrupting compounds has focused on single processes generally
   in controlled laboratory experiments, and limited studies have directly
   evaluated their fate and transport in rivers. This study evaluated the
   fate and transport of 4-nonylphenol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone in a
   10-km reach of the Redwood River in southwestern Minnesota. The same
   parcel of water was sampled as it moved downstream, integrating chemical
   transformation and hydrologic processes. The conservative tracer bromide
   was used to track the parcel of water being sampled, and the change in
   mass of the target compounds relative to bromide was determined at two
   locations downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent outfall.
   In-stream attenuation coefficients (k(stream)) were calculated by
   assuming first-order kinetics (negative values correspond to
   attenuation, whereas positive values indicate production). Attenuation
   of 17 beta-estradiol (k(stream) = -3.2 +/- 1.0 day(-1)) was attributed
   primarily due to sorption and biodegradation by the stream biofilm and
   bed sediments. Estrone (k(stream) = 0.6 +/- 0.8 day(-1)) and
   4-nonylphenol (k(stream) = 1.4 +/- 1.9 day(-1)) were produced in the
   evaluated 10-km reach, likely due to biochemical transformation from
   parent compounds (17 beta-estradiol, 4-nonylphenolpolyethoxylates, and
   4-nonyphenolpolyethoxycarboxylates). Despite attenuation, these
   compounds were transported kilometers downstream, and thus additive
   concentrations from multiple sources and transformation of parent
   compounds into degradates having estrogenic activity can explain their
   environmental persistence and widespread observations of biological
   disruption in surface waters.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-activation localization microscopy is a far-field superresolution
   imaging technique based on the localization of single molecules with
   subdiffraction limit precision. Known under acronyms such as PALM
   (photo-activated localization microscopy) or STORM (stochastic optical
   reconstruction microscopy), these techniques achieve superresolution by
   allowing only a sparse, random set of molecules to emit light at any
   given time and subsequently localizing each molecule with great
   precision. Recently, such techniques have been extended to three
   dimensions, opening up unprecedented possibilities to explore the
   structure and function of cells. Interestingly, proper engineering of
   the three-dimensional (3D) point spread function (PSF) through
   additional optics has been demonstrated to theoretically improve 3D
   position estimation and ultimately resolution. In this paper, an optimal
   3D single-molecule localization estimator is presented in a general
   framework for noisy, aberrated and/or engineered PSF imaging. To find
   the position of each molecule, a phase-retrieval enabled
   maximum-likelihood estimator is implemented. This estimator is shown to
   be efficient, meaning it reaches the fundamental Cramer-Rao lower bound
   of x, y, and z localization precision. Experimental application of the
   phase-retrieval enabled maximum-likelihood estimator using a particular
   engineered PSF microscope demonstrates unmatched low-photon-count 3D
   wide-field single-molecule localization performance.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a phase-control holographic technique to characterize
   scattering media with the purpose of focusing light through it. The
   system generates computer-generated holograms implemented via a
   deformable mirror device (DMD) based on micro-electro-mechanical
   technology. The DMD can be updated at high data rates, enabling high
   speed wavefront measurements using the transmission matrix method. The
   transmission matrix of a scattering material determines the hologram
   required for focusing through the scatterer. We demonstrate this
   technique measuring a transmission matrix with 256 input modes and a
   single output mode in 33.8 ms and creating a focus with a signal to

Abstract = {{Recent studies imply that the external surface area of the nanozeolite
   product may, at least in some cases, be related to the average size of
   the particle population participating in aggregative nucleation, a
   population which itself is a product of aggregation of even smaller
   primary nanoparticles. This possibility puts more importance on our
   understanding of the variation of particle size and its distribution
   during the crystallization of zeolite nanoparticles. Variation of the
   particle size and PSD during nanoparticle silicalite-1 crystallization
   was followed with respect to time by a laser light scattering device
   with a scattering angle of 1730, for several starting synthesis
   compositions. Effects of varying TPAOH and water contents in the
   starting synthesis mixtures on the variation with time of the particle
   sizes and PSDs, especially across the two distinct aggregation events,
   were investigated. The products were also analyzed by XRD and AFM.
   Parallel to the decrease in the average particle size of the final
   product population with increasing alkalinity and organic template
   content, its PSD was observed to become narrower too. A reversal in the
   dependence on TPAOH content, of the average size of the population
   formed by aggregation, with respect to that of the population
   participating in aggregation, was observed across both aggregation
   events, implying that smaller particles aggregated to form larger
   particles, while larger particles aggregated to form smaller particles
   during these processes, and this was also seen from the AFM images, to
   be reflected to the surface features of the final product particles. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{We assess the impact of transport of pollution from midlatitudes on the
   abundance of ozone in the Arctic in summer 2006 using the GEOS-Chem
   global chemical transport model and its adjoint. We find that although
   the impact of midlatitude emissions on ozone abundances in the Arctic is
   at a maximum in fall and winter, in July transport from North America,
   Asia, and Europe together contributed about 25\% of surface ozone
   abundances in the Arctic. Throughout the summer, the dominant source of
   ozone in the Arctic troposphere was photochemical production within the
   Arctic, which accounted for more than 50\% of the ozone in the Arctic
   boundary layer and as much as 30\%-40\% of the ozone in the middle
   troposphere. An adjoint sensitivity analysis of the impact of NOx
   emissions on ozone at Alert shows that on synoptic time scales in both
   the lower and middle troposphere, ozone abundances are more sensitive to
   emissions between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N, with important
   influences from anthropogenic, biomass burning, soil, and lightning
   sources. Although local surface NOx emissions contribute to ozone
   formation, transport of NOx in the form of peroxyacetyl nitrate ( PAN)
   from outside the Arctic and from the upper troposphere also contributed
   to ozone production in the lower troposphere. We find that in late May
   and June the release of NOx from PAN decomposition accounted for 93\%
   and 55\% of ozone production at the Arctic surface, respectively.}},

Title = {{Simulations of the equatorial thermosphere anomaly: Field-aligned ion
   drag effect}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{In this paper the impact of the field-aligned ion drag on equatorial
   thermosphere temperature and density is quantitatively investigated on
   the basis of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere
   Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (NCAR TIEGCM)
   simulations under high solar activity (F107 = 180). The increase of
   upward vertical winds over the magnetic equator associated with the
   additional divergence of meridional winds, caused by the inclusion of
   field-aligned ion drag, leads to a reduction in thermosphere temperature
   and density at the magnetic equator through enhanced adiabatic cooling.
   We found that the field-aligned ion drag has an obvious impact on the
   thermosphere only over the magnetic equatorial region in the daytime and
   evening sectors, whereas it has less effect on the equatorial
   thermosphere anomaly (ETA) crests. The daytime neutral temperature over
   the magnetic equator is reduced by about 30 K, for altitudes above 250
   km without significant altitudinal variations, when field-aligned ion
   drag is included in the simulation. The thermosphere density in the
   magnetic equatorial region starts to change slightly at 300 km and
   depletes by about 5\% at 400 km, while experiencing a greater decrease
   with altitude. Furthermore, the trough produced in the neutral
   temperature and density corresponds well with the magnetic dip equator.
   The ETA features during 12: 00-18:00 LT become obvious as a result of
   the inclusion of the field-aligned ion drag. Specifically, our results
   show that at 400 km the crest-trough differences in neutral temperature
   are about 30-60 K, and the crest-trough ratios in thermosphere density
   are 1.03-1.06, comparable with observations.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{In addition to its metal-insulator transition (MIT), VO2 exhibits a rich
   phase behavior of insulating monoclinic (M1, M2) and triclinic (T)
   phases. By using micro-Raman spectroscopy and independent control of
   temperature and uniaxial strain in individual single-crystal microbeams,
   we map these insulating phases with their associated structural changes
   as represented by their respective phonon frequencies. The competition
   between these structural forms is dictated by the internal strain due to
   differing lattice constants, the experimentally applied external strain,
   and the temperature-dependent phase stability. We identify the nature of
   the triclinic phase as a continuously distorted variant of the M1
   monoclinic phase, while a discontinuous transition into the M2 phase
   occurs from both the M1 and T phases. The results suggest that
   understanding the driving forces that determine the interplay between
   M1, M2, and T phases near the MIT could be critical for the
   identification of the underlying mechanism behind the MIT itself.}},

Abstract = {{Cell mechanical adaptivity to external stimuli is vital to many of its
   biological functions. A critical question is therefore to understand the
   formation and organization of the stress fibers from which emerge the
   cell's mechanical properties. By accounting for the mechanical aspects
   and the viscoelastic behavior of stress fibers, we here propose a
   thermodynamic model to predict the formation and orientation of stress
   fibers in contractile cells subjected to constant or cyclic stretch and
   different substrate stiffness. Our results demonstrate that the stress
   fibers viscoelastic behavior plays a crucial role in their formation and

Abstract = {{Multi-Blade Coordinates (MBC) is a technique used to transform rotating
   degrees of freedom into a reference frame that is fixed. In application
   to wind turbines, it has a number of advantages, a primary one being
   that its application tends to make dynamics that change with rotor
   position, appear fairly time invariant. Another advantage is that with
   MBC, controls that mitigate cyclic loads can be implemented using
   straight forward integral control that operates over a wide range of
   rotor speeds. However, using the standard MBC approach, the control
   system will not provide asymptotically perfect rejection of cyclic loads
   unless the rotor is symmetric with respect to each blade. On the other
   hand, at constant rotor speeds, a non-MBC approach can provide
   asymptotic rejection of cyclic loads even when the rotor is not
   symmetric. In this study, we investigate to what extent asymptotically
   perfect load mitigation is lost for MBC based controllers, in conditions
   that include rotor asymmetry and time varying wind speeds. It is found
   that although the standard MBC approach fails to achieve asymptotic
   rejection of cyclic loads, its performance is comparable to higher-order
   non-MBC approaches in turbulent wind conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the minimum lap-time problem for a single-track
   rigid car which includes tire models and load transfer. Given a planar
   track including lane boundaries, our goal is to find a trajectory of the
   car minimizing the lap time subject to tire and steering limits. By
   using a new set of coordinates, the time-dependent system is transformed
   into a ``space-dependent{''} (and space-variant) system. The choice of a
   suitable set of coordinates and the partition of the dynamics into a
   ``longitudinal{''} one and a ``transverse{''} one, allows us to convert
   the minimum time problem into a fixed horizon constrained optimal
   control problem. Based on a projection operator nonlinear optimal
   control technique, we propose a minimum lap-time strategy to push the
   rigid car to the limit of its handling capabilities. Finally, we provide
   numerical computations that: (i) show the effectiveness of the proposed
   strategy, and (ii) allow us to highlight important features of minimum
   lap-time trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{The central goal in multi-agent systems is to engineer a decision making
   architecture where agents make independent decisions in response to
   local information while ensuring that the emergent global behavior is
   desirable with respect to a given system level objective. Our previous
   work identified a systematic methodology for such a task using the
   framework of state based games. One core advantage of the approach is
   that it provides a two step process that can be decoupled by utilizing
   specific classes of games. Exploiting this decomposition could lead to a
   rich class of distributed learning algorithm. However, a drawback of our
   previous approach is the dependence on a time-invariant and connected
   communication graph. These conditions are not practical for a wide
   variety of multi-agent systems. In this paper we propose a new game
   theoretical approach for addressing distributed optimization problems
   that permits relaxations in the structure of the communication graph.}},

Abstract = {{The motivation of this work is to examine how well methods, such as
   successive interference cancellation and interference alignment from
   information theoretic solution, work in real-world where the received
   signal is quantized for digital processing. As a first step, we consider
   Gaussian Multiple Access Channels with the quantization noise modeled as
   Gaussian noise, whose variance depends on the received signal power at
   the receiver. We call this model Gaussian Multiple Access Channel with
   Signal Dependent Noise. The achievable rate region of this model is
   given under finite transmitted signal power constraint, where the
   achievable scheme could be successive interference cancellation (SIC).
   This region is outer bounded by a finite region with unlimited received
   signal power, where the achievable scheme is time division multiple
   access (TDMA). Thus, one way to measure the usefulness of successive
   interference cancellation is to study the gap between the SIC region and
   the TDMA region under finite power constraints. For the symmetric
   maximum signal to channel noise ratio (SCNR) case, where the maximum
   SCNR of all users are the same, we show that the gap between the SIC
   region and the TDMA region is within 0.5 bits for any number of users.
   Furthermore, for this case, if the maximum quantization noise power due
   to one user is stronger than the channel noise power, then the sum rate
   difference between the SIC region and the TDMA region is within 0.5
   bits. For the asymmetric maximum SCNR case, the gap can be small when
   all users have high SCNR (e.g., 30dB), where the receiver is equipped
   with a low precision ADC (e.g., 2-3 bits).}},

Abstract = {{We derive the exact dispersion relations for flexural elastic wave
   motion in a beam under finite deformation. We employ the Euler-Bernoulli
   kinematic hypothesis. Focusing on homogeneous waveguides with constant
   cross-section, we utilize the exact strain tensor and retain all high
   order terms. The results allow us to quantify the deviation in the
   dispersion curves when exact large deformation is considered compared to
   the small strain assumption. We show that incorporation of finite
   deformation shifts the frequency dispersion curves downwards.
   Furthermore, the group velocity increases with wavenumber but this trend
   reverses at high wavenumbers when the wave amplitude is sufficiently
   high. At sufficiently high wave amplitudes, the group velocity becomes
   negative at high wavenumbers. This study on nonlinear homogeneous beams
   lays the foundation for future development to nonlinear periodic beams.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we designed and fabricated High-throughput Microfluidic
   device for membrane protein polyhedral. Protein is the most important
   functional element in our human body and also it could be applied to the
   key application areas of drug bonding and drug delivery. However protein
   stucture is difficult to be analyzed due to the complex and variable
   geometry of protein stucture which can be randomly formed by 20 amino
   acids and also plused 3D folding of stucture possibly. Based on this, we
   could imagine it would be a huge variable number of protein stucture,
   let's say billion possibilities. Therefore if we can successful discover
   protein stucture, then we can expect that will improve drug delivery of
   medical technology forward to a big step.}},

Abstract = {{An elastoplasticity model is formulated and demonstrated in
   one-dimension (1D) for modeling finite deformations in poly-crystalline
   metals. Quasi-static to high strain rate effects as well as temperature
   sensitivity are included. A multiplicative decomposition of the
   deformation gradient into elastic, plastic, and thermal parts, that
   includes a voluntetric/isochoric split of the elastic stretching tensor
   is assumed. The kinematics and thermodynamic formulation lead to
   constitutive equations, stresses. and constraints on the evolution of
   the internal state variables. The model accounts for (i) dislocation
   drag effects on flow stress, and (ii) generation (hardening) and
   annihilation (recovery) of statistically-stored dislocations (SSDs). The
   resulting model is normalized to dimensionless form to allow
   dimensionless material parameters fit for one metal to approximate the
   behavior of another metal of similar lattice structure, if data are
   limited. One dimensional material parameter fitting is demonstrated for
   two refractory metals, body centered cubic (bcc) Tantalum and Tungsten.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we combine Bloch theory with familiar techniques of
   structural dynamics to study the effects of energy dissipation (i.e.,
   damping) in an acoustic metamaterial. The formulation we present has the
   novel feature of incorporating a temporal component to wave attenuation
   in addition to the standard spatial component. The frequency band
   structure reflects the metamaterial response to the damping intensity.
   In the context of a lumped parameter nested mass model, increasing the
   magnitude of damping is shown to cause the band structure to descend the
   frequency range and reveal an intriguing phenomenon: branch overtaking.
   This effect occurs as dissipation causes the optical branch to descend
   below the acoustical branch. The resulting decrease in the width of the
   band gap would impact vibration minimization and isolation. We also
   examine the effective properties of the metamaterial, specifically, the
   effective mass and effective stiffness, and the conditions for these
   quantities to become negative. Finally, the aforementioned material
   results are shown to be related to their finite counterpart. For ease of
   exposition, we consider a special form of Rayleigh damping in which the
   damping is proportional to the stiffness. The intrinsic presence of
   dissipation in acoustic metamaterials and the limited scientific
   literature addressing damped wave propagation in periodic media in
   general motivates our present study.}},

Abstract = {{While resonant propagation modes are non-existent within band gaps in
   infinite periodic structures, it is possible for anomalous band-gap
   resonances to appear in finite periodic structures. We establish two
   criteria for the characterization of band-gap resonances and propose
   approaches for their elimination. By considering flexural periodic
   beams, we show that as the number of unit-cells is increased the
   vibration response corresponding to band-gap resonances (1) does not
   shift in frequency, and (2) drops in amplitude. Both these outcomes are
   not exhibited by regular pass-band resonances, nor by resonances in
   finite homogenous beams when the length is changed. Our conclusions stem
   from predictions based on Timoshenko beam theory coupled with matching
   experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{A heat exchanger (HX) plays an important role in many cryogenic systems.
   This paper demonstrates a fully integrated fabrication process to make a
   novel monolithic polyimide micro heat exchanger. This heat exchanger
   consists of two parallel rectangular polyimide channels stacked on top
   of each other with a typical dimension of 15 mm x 4 mm x 90 pm. The
   stacked channels were suspended on top of a silicon substrate as one of
   the ends anchored. The fabrication is based on surface micro-machining
   technology using electroplated copper as the sacrificial layers and
   polyimide as the structural material. Preliminary testing results
   demonstrated that the polyimide HX can sustain a cryogenic temperature
   lower than 77 K and is able to hold a pressure larger than 1 MPa. The
   pressure drop across the channel was found to increase parabolically
   with the flow-rate through it, as assessed with standard nitrogen at
   room temperature.}},

   environments, such as high temperature or irradiated environments.
   Electrostatically actuated MEMS/NEMS switches offer improved performance
   in these environments. In this work, out-of-plane three terminal
   microswitches suitable for digital logic are presented. Each switch
   consists of a suspended fixed-fixed bowtie shaped electroplated nickel
   beam (300 mu m x 250 mu m x similar to 2 mu m) buckled out-of-plane over
   a 10 mu m wide gold electrode on a LPCVD nitride coated low resistance
   Si substrate, which acts as a common gate electrode. Atomic layer
   deposited (ALD) alumina (100nm thick) is incorporated as a sacrificial
   layer to keep the fabrication processing low temperature and provide
   precise gap uniformity across chip. Steady-state I-V performance results
   are presented showing contact voltages between 17-36V. Mechanical
   modeling of the beam deformation is performed using commercial PEA
   software and compared to the actual measured beam response. These
   devices offer a valid approach for simple MEMS based logic circuitry
   with proper film stress management and geometry scaling.}},

Abstract = {{Band structure calculation provides a basis for the study of thermal,
   optical and magnetic properties of crystals. The reduced Bloch mode
   expansion (RBME) method is a model reduction method in which a selected
   set of Bloch eigenvectors within the irreducible Brillouin zone at high
   symmetry points are used to expand the unit cell problem at hand. In
   this method, a major reduction in computational cost is achieved with
   minimum loss of accuracy. The method applies to both classical and ab
   inito band structure calculations of periodic media, and to any type of
   wave propagation problem: phononic, photonic, electronic, etc. In this
   work, the applicability of RBME in calculating the three-dimensional
   (3D) electronic band structure for crystal structures with different
   symmetries is demonstrated. Using the Kronig-Penney fixed potential, a
   high-symmetry cubic model and a low-symmetry triclinic model are
   considered. For both cases, the energy (eigenvalues) and wave functions
   (eigenvectors) demonstrate very good convergence performance with the
   number of expansion points.}},

Abstract = {{Fitting discrete-time models to frequency-response functions without
   addressing existing transport delay can yield higher-order models
   including additional non-physical nonminimum-phase (NMP) zeros beyond
   those that may appear as a result of sampling. These NMP zeros can be
   attributed to a discrete-time representation of a Fade approximation to
   account for the transport delay {[}1, 2]. Here, we explore this idea in
   greater detail and this discussion motivates the main contribution of
   this paper; the presentation of a procedure for fitting a discrete-time
   model to experimentally measured frequency response data. The appearance
   of NMP zeros in a system model can complicate controller design and
   limits the desired closed-loop performance. This discrete-time
   model-fitting procedure presents a technique that will help yield a
   model that reflects the measured frequency-response functions
   accurately, while minimizing the presence of non-physical NMP zeros. The
   key benefit being that, with respect to previous model fits, it may be
   possible to eliminate all NMP zeros in the discrete-time model. In the
   case of model-inverse-based control design, this will allow the stable
   inversion of the model without the use of approximation methods to
   account for NMP zeros.}},

   model, the transport of quantum-confined electrons through the hopping
   mechanism is studied by tight-binding model together with Kubo formula
   and Green's function method. The formation of minibands due to the
   quantum confinement and the phonon-bottleneck effect on carrier-phonon

   studied by Boltzmann-transport-equation-based model. We consider the
   intrinsic carrier scatterings as well as the carrier-interface
   scattering of these bulk-like electrons. Thermoelectric transport
   properties are studied with different quantum dot sizes, inter-dot

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been reported to have excellent thermal and
   mechanical properties over the past two decades. However, the practical
   application of CNT-based technologies has been limited, due to the
   inability to transform the excellent properties of single CNTs into
   macroscopic applications. CNT network structure connects CNTs and can be
   possibly scaled up to macro-scale CNT-based application. In this paper,
   nonequilibrium molecular dynamics is applied to investigate thermal
   transport across two CNTs connected longitudinally by molecular linkers.
   We show the effect of different types and lengths of molecular linkers
   on interfacial thermal conductance. We also analyze the density of
   vibrational normal modes to further understand the interfacial thermal
   conductance between different molecular linkers and CNTs. These results
   provide guidance for choosing molecular linkers to build up large-scale
   CNT-based network structures.}},

Abstract = {{We report the successful fabrication and application of a micro-scale
   hybrid liquid wicking structure in flat polymer-based heat spreaders to
   improve the heat transfer performance under gravitational acceleration.
   The hybrid wick consists of 100 mu m high, 200 mu m wide square
   electroformed high aspect ratio copper micro-pillars with 31 mu m
   spacing for liquid flow. A woven copper mesh with 51 mu m diameter and
   76 mu m spacing was bonded to the top surface of the pillars to enhance
   evaporation and condensation heat transfer. The exterior device geometry
   is 40 mm x 40 mm x 1.0 mm. The 100 mu m thick liquid crystal polymer
   (LCP) casing contains a two-dimensional array of copper filled vias to
   reduce the overall thermal resistance. The device was tested with heat
   flux input of up to 63 W/cm(2) at horizontal and vertical orientations.
   The difference in temperature between the evaporator and condenser was
   measured and compared to a copper reference block of identical exterior
   dimensions. The experimentally determined thermal resistance of the
   copper block remained nearly constant at 1.2 K/W. The thermal resistance
   of the flat polymer heat spreader at horizontal orientation was 0.55
   K/W. The same device at -90 degrees adverse orientation resulted in a
   thermal resistance of 0.60 K/W. These measurements indicate that this
   hybrid wicking structure is capable of providing a capillary pumping
   pressure that is effective at transferring at least 63 W/cm(2) heat flux
   regardless of orientation. This work illustrates an important step to
   developing more effective thermal management strategies for the next
   generation of heat generating components and the possibility of
   developing flexible, polymer-based heat spreaders fabricated with
   standardized printed circuit board technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management plays an important role in both high power
   electronics and energy conversion systems. A key issue in thermal
   management is the dissipation of the high heat flux generated by
   functional components. In this paper, various microstructures,
   nanostructures and hybrid micro/nano-structures were successfully
   fabricated on copper (Cu) surfaces, and the corresponding pool boiling
   heat transfer performance was systematically studied. It is found that
   the critical heat flux (CHF) of hybrid structured surfaces is about 15\%
   higher than that of the surfaces with nanowires only and micro-pillars
   only. More importantly, the superheat at CHF for the hybrid structured
   surface is much smaller than that of the micro-pillared surface (about
   35\%), and a maximum heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of about
   90,000W/m(2)K. is obtained. Compared with the known best pool boiling
   performance on biporous media, a much larger HTC and much lower
   superheat at a heat flux of 250W/cm(2) have been obtained on the novel

Abstract = {{We know from motivation theory that enhanced motivation in students is
   positively correlated with engagement and active learning, interest, and
   value. We know less about the types of instructional strategies and
   curricular interventions that work to enhance student motivation in a
   typical engineering course. Grounded in motivation theory, the purpose
   of this research is to evaluate how the context of project-based
   service-learning affects aspects of student motivation in a required
   undergraduate Mechanical Engineering course.
   Our research aims to answer: 1) How does project-based service learning
   affect students' motivation as compared to conventional (non-service)
   project-based learning? 2) How are women affected differentially by
   project-based service-learning? The research, which began in 2010, is
   being completed over a two-year period. The students and activities in
   Component Design, an existing junior-level course at the University of
   Colorado at Boulder, will serve as the research focus. Specifically,
   project-based service-learning curriculum will be implemented into a
   required design and build activity for Component Design students. Using
   a conventional design project as the control, how the context of
   project-based service learning affects aspects of student motivation
   will be studied. This paper will discuss the research design,
   theoretical framework, and the results from our first year of research.
   Our objective is to provide a more thorough understanding of the effects

Abstract = {{At the University of Colorado, Boulder, a new program designed to link
   graduate students with 1st and 2nd year undergraduate students through
   engineering research projects and mentoring relationships was initiated
   in Spring 2011. Your Own Undergraduate Research Experience at the
   University of Colorado (YOU'RE@CU) has three main goals: (1) increase
   retention of undergraduate students in engineering, particularly women
   and underrepresented minorities (URMs); (2) excite undergraduate student
   interest in research projects and future careers in academia or
   industry; (3) provide graduate students with training and hands-on
   mentoring experience with the expectation that this will positively
   influence graduate student choices to seek a career in academia. This
   paper illustrates the details of the YOU'RE@CU program during its pilot
   implementation in Spring 2011. The assessment strategy and methods are
   also explained, with presentation of qualitative data and discussion of
   the overall data analysis process.}},

   system. The larger the magnitude of NEND means that the system exhibits
   the greater time delay. In other words, performing NEND compensation
   achieves time-delay compensation. This NEND compensation is achieved by
   introducing the control scheme with an observer for NEND estimation. The
   proposed design has been verified in the wired network.}},

Abstract = {{Algorithms that can efficiently recover principal components of
   high-dimensional data from compressive sensing measurements (e. g.
   low-dimensional random projections) of it have been an important topic
   of recent interest in the literature. In this paper, we show that, under
   certain conditions, normal principal component analysis (PCA) on such
   low-dimensional random projections of data actually returns the same
   result as PCA on the original data set would. In particular, as the
   number of data samples increases, the center of the randomly projected
   data converges to the true center of the original data (up to a known
   scaling factor) and the principal components converge to the true
   principal components of the original data as well, even if the dimension
   of each random subspace used is very low. Indeed, experimental results
   verify that this approach does estimate the original center and
   principal components very well for both synthetic and real-world
   datasets, including hyperspectral data. Its performance is even superior
   to that of other algorithms recently developed in the literature for

Abstract = {{Satellite formations utilizing Coulomb forces are being studied due to
   their potential for their extremely low-fuel, low-power close formation
   flying control. Prior studies into Coulomb formations employ point
   charge or isolated sphere assumptions with well known electrostatic
   behavior. This is justified by having the custom Coulomb spacecraft
   assume near-spherical shapes to minimize charge densities for a given
   potential. Complex geometries, however, are the norm for existing
   satellite structures. This paper develops a method to model complex
   geometries as finite spheres. Finite element electrostatic field
   solutions are used to model the force interactions between a sphere and
   a non-spherical body. The effective sphere method is demonstrated on a
   sphere, a cylinder and a generic satellite structure. Force behavior is
   shown to match between the finite element solution and a 3D body's
   effective sphere for separation distances beyond 3 - 4 craft radii.
   Differences in the effective radii for the same non-spherical body are
   discussed along principal body axes and a near-elliptical distribution
   of effective radii are found for the case of a cylindrical shape.
   Finally, the nadir-aligned relative motion control of a cylinder-sphere
   formation is considered using the cylinder's effective radius and a
   voltage control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic static actuation of free-flying spacecraft is being
   considered to directly control spacecraft relative motion. This paper
   investigates the effectiveness of using active electrostatic charging to
   perform orbit altitude adjustments of a nominally circular orbit.
   Coulomb forces are employed to gently pull a charged object in the along
   track direction. In contrast to prior work, this study uses an enhanced
   electrostatic force model which accounts for the increased capacitance
   of an object if another charged object is nearby with opposite charge
   polarity. The pulling configuration is shown to provide larger
   electrostatic forces over a pushing configuration due to the coupled
   capacitance modeling. Variational equations are developed to estimate
   the semi-major axis changes if spherical objects with controlled
   electrostatic potentials are actuated in the along-track direction.
   Numerical sweeps are performed to illustrate that kilo-Volt levels of
   potential are sufficient to achieve kilometer level radius changes per
   orbit for geosynchronous orbit regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Earth science satellite missions currently require orbit determination
   solutions with position accuracies to within a centimeter. The
   estimation of empirical accelerations has become commonplace in precise
   orbit determination (POD) for Earth-orbiting satellites. Dynamic model
   compensation (DMC) utilizes an exponentially time-correlated system
   noise process, known as a first-order Gauss-Markov process (GMP1) to
   estimate un-modeled accelerations. In this work, we address the use of a
   second-order Gauss-Markov process to compensate for higher order
   spherical harmonic gravity accelerations, beyond J(3). Improvements in
   POD and orbit prediction through the implementation of an optimal GMP2
   for empirical acceleration estimation are assessed. The use of a single
   well calibrated GMP2 outperforms a GMP1 and a poorly calibrated GMP2 for
   both continuous observations and poor tracking data.}},

Abstract = {{Operating in the highly dynamic Earth-Moon libration point orbit (LPO)
   region, which is predominantly perturbed by the Earth, the Moon, and the
   Sun, is a challenge. The Artemis mission operated by the NASA Goddard
   Space Flight Center and the University of California at Berkeley
   recently became the first to ever maintain orbits in this regime. The
   resulting operational data provides significant opportunity for analysis
   to better understand these orbits and their operational constraints.
   Future efforts to quantify orbit determination results, recover
   un-modeled accelerations, realistic uncertainty propagation, and
   ultimately LPO utilization will grow out of an ability to post-process
   this operational data for further understanding of the dynamics
   involved. To prepare for post-processing of this data, this paper
   quantifies the effects of various contributors to the dynamic models,
   experimentally models errors in a simulated environment, and outlines
   areas of future focus. Realistic spacecraft ephemeris and attribute
   information will be used to the maximum extent possible. Simulations of
   orbit determination efficacy are performed using the Analytical Graphics
   Inc. Orbit Determination Tool Kit (ODTK) with appropriate tracking and

Abstract = {{Situational awareness of Earth-orbiting particles such as active
   satellites and space debris is highly important for all current and
   future space-faring nations. Previous research has proposed a
   correlation and initial orbit determination technique for ground based
   optical observations where multiple admissible region maps are
   intersected in the Poincare orbit element space. In this paper, a new
   application of the admissible region to space-based observations is
   introduced. A modification must be made to the correlation process as
   the observer's state is always a valid solution. Numerical examples for
   several observation scenarios are discussed, including LEO-on-GEO and

Abstract = {{The Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) is a three-unit
   (10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm) CubeSat mission.funded by the National Science
   Foundation; it was launched into a low Earth, polar orbit on 13
   September 2012 as a secondary payload under NASA's Educational Launch of
   Nanosatellites program. The science objectives of CSSWE are to
   investigate the relationship of the location, magnitude, and frequency
   of solar flares to the timing, duration, and energy spectrum of solar
   energetic particles reaching Earth and to determine the precipitation
   loss and the evolution of the energy spectrum of radiation belt
   electrons. CSSWE contains a single science payload, the Relativistic
   Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment (REPTile),
   which is a miniaturization of the Relativistic Electron and Proton
   Telescope (REPT) built at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space
   Physics. The REPT instrument will fly onboard the NASA Radiation Belt
   Storm Probes mission, which consists of two identical spacecraft
   launched on 30 August 2012 that will go through the heart of the
   radiation belts in a low-inclination orbit. CSSWE's REPTile is designed
   to measure the directional differential flux of protons ranging from 10
   to 40 MeV and electrons from 0.5 to >3 MeV. Such differential flux
   measurements have significant science value, and a number of engineering
   challenges were overcome to enable these clean measurements to be made
   under the mass and power limits of a CubeSat. The CSSWE is an ideal
   class project, providing training for the next generation of engineers
   and scientists over the full life cycle of a satellite project.}},

Abstract = {{Heating Degree Days (HDDs), calculated from hourly weather data, are
   often used to estimate energy savings for a variety of energy efficiency
   measures (EEMs) to be applied to conditioned spaces in buildings. More
   specifically, application of HDDs is useful for estimating savings from
   weather-dependent EEMs. For first order estimation, it is often
   problematic to calculate HDDs for a given base temperature, when
   temperature setbacks are used in the conditioned spaces.
   This paper provides a set of correlations to characterize HDDs for
   selected ASHRAE Climate Zones as functions of three key parameters
   including the base temperature, setback temperature level (delta-T), and
   setback duration. In addition to the well-documented pattern of
   decreasing HDDs for decreasing base temperature, it was also shown that
   HDDs are inversely proportional to both setback duration and temperature
   setback differential levels. In the analysis presented in this paper,
   corrections to estimate HDDs when temperature setbacks are used for
   typical residential space heating schedules during unoccupied periods
   which occurred from 8 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday. In particular,
   regression correlations using two- and three-parameter models have been
   developed to estimate HDDs for multiple US locations that account for
   the impact of temperature setbacks on the heating requirements of
   residential buildings. For the two-parameter model, the input variables
   for the regression correlations are setback hours and delta T; for the
   three-parameter model, the input variables for the correlations include
   setback hours, delta T, and base temperature.
   The prediction accuracy for the energy savings, due to a set of EEMs,
   obtained from the HDD method using the developed correlations- is tested
   against whole-building detailed energy simulation analysis for two
   single family homes. Detailed energy audits including utility data
   analysis have been carried out for both homes to calibrate the detailed
   simulation model and evaluate the effectiveness of the EEMs in reducing
   building energy use. The results from the detailed simulation analysis
   are then compared to those obtained from the HDD with temperature
   setbacks}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the city of Boulder, CO has recently approved mandatory energy
   efficiency standard, called SmartRegs Program, for rental properties.
   Improving residential energy efficiency is a goal of the city as they
   strive to meet the green house gas reduction targets of the Kyoto
   Protocol. However, energy efficiency is typically not implemented in
   rental units because of a split incentive between landlords and tenants.
   This paper evaluates the various retrofit measures that improve rental
   homes energy efficiency as well as the effectiveness of SmartRegs
   Program. First, various energy efficiency measures are evaluated through
   walk-through and detailed energy audits to assess their effectiveness in
   improving the energy performance of rental homes. Based on the results
   of the energy audits and survey of various stake holders, a set of
   recommendations have been defined to ensure that the SmartRegs program
   be successfully implemented in order to improve the overall performance
   and quality of rental homes. Moreover, it is found that energy efficient
   can increase the thermal comfort levels and decrease the energy costs
   for tenants, increase the value of the property for landlords, and help
   the city meet their green house gas reduction goals.}},

Abstract = {{Tankless water heaters present an opportunity to dramatically reduce
   water heating energy use. These impacts are possible because of their
   dramatic reduction of environmental losses through lower heat transfer
   areas and not keeping the heat exchanger at operating temperature
   between draws. The potential for energy savings has caused a lot of
   interest in the scientific community. However, the scientific community
   has not yet gained an understanding of these devices and several
   questions regarding their behavior remain. The areas of uncertainty
   include the following: 1) how these heaters behave around the minimum
   flow rate, 2) how well they adapt to changes in water flow rate, 3) how
   they behave in situations with preheated water (i.e. when used with
   solar water heaters) and 4) whether or not draw characteristics impact
   the steady state efficiency. Tests have been performed on a Rinnai
   R75Lsi to determine the answers to these questions for a specific
   heater. Tests were performed with 1) gradually changing flow rate to
   identify the minimum flow rate, 2) rapidly adjusting the flow rate to
   observe how the heater responded to suddenly changing draws, 3)
   temperature-flow combinations such that the minimum heat rate exceeded
   the required heat rate, and 4) draws under steady state conditions with
   varying flow rates and set temperatures. Minimum flow rate results
   indicate that the heater will not fire unless the flow rate surpasses
   2.8 L/min and will cease firing if the flow rate decreases below 2.15
   L/min while the owners manual states that the minimum flow rate is 2.3
   L/min. Rapidly changing flow rate results indicate that there can be
   temperature fluctuations up to 9 C and unsteady operation for up to 1
   minute depending on the magnitude of the flow rate change. Tests with
   preheated inlet water showed that the heater uses feedback controls to
   avoid unstable operation at low heat rates. Steady state efficiency
   tests did not identify any variables which impact efficiency. Future
   work should include testing additional units to determine how other
   heaters, particularly those not manufactured by Rinnai, behave in
   similar situations}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel architecture composed of uniformly distributed
   high melting phase (HMT, e.g. Cu) in a low melting phase (LMP, e.g. In)
   matrix, which can be produced via liquid phase sintering (LPS), is
   proposed to produce next generation thermal interface materials (TIMs)
   and interconnect (IC) materials. The LMP determines the shear compliance
   of these composites whereas the HMP determines its thermal and
   electrical conductivities. The volume fraction of In was optimized to
   produce a Cu-In solder with suitable mechanical, electrical and thermal
   properties for TIM and IC applications. Since, Cu and In react to form
   several Cu-In intennetallic compounds (IMCs), which may deteriorate the
   long-term performance of these solders, interfacial-layers of Au and
   Al2O3 were applied on Cu to further improve the performance of the Cu-In
   solders. The effect of interfacial-layers on the reaction between Cu and
   In, during sintering at 160 degrees C and during aging at 125 degrees C,
   was studied and its impact on the mechanical, thermal and electrical
   properties was evaluated. Au interfacial layer (50 similar to 200nm)
   quickly reacted with In to form AuIn2 IMC, which acted as a tenacious
   diffusion-barrier and slowed down the reactions between Cu and In.
   8-monolayer thick Al2O3 did not react with either Cu or In and inhibited
   reactions between Cu and In. During short-time sintering, the effect of
   interfacial layer on the thicknesses of IMCs was insignificant to affect
   the yield strength of the as-sintered composites. However, IMC layer
   thickened rapidly in the Cu-In composites without an interfacial-layer,
   which led to a drastic decrease in the volume fraction of unreacted In
   leading to an increase in the yield strength of the solder. On the other
   hand, the interfacial-layers effectively suppressed the growth of IMCs
   during aging and hence the yield strength of such composites increased
   at slower rates. Since, the IMCs formed at the interface radically
   affect the contact resistance, significant differences in the thermal
   and electrical conductivities were recorded for the solders with
   different interfacial-layers.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainties inherent to the operating conditions of the Hyshot II
   scramjet flight test are assessed. In particular, the variability of the
   pressure prediction in the combustor due to uncertain free stream
   conditions is investigated using a probabilistic methodology based on
   stochastic collocation. The uncertainties in Mach number, angle of
   attack and flight altitude are inferred from pressure measurements in
   the unfueled combustor using a Bayesian inversion approach. The forward
   computation relies on a reduced order model that represents the
   combustion processes in the scramjet combustor. A ground based
   experimental data set obtained from 1-to-1 model of the HyShot II
   vehicle with well defined operating conditions is used to validate the
   non-reacting solver and to calibrate the heat release model for the
   reacting combustor. The model prediction agrees well with the
   experimentally aquired flight data. On the other hand, our estimated
   flight free stream conditions differ from previously published results.}},

Abstract = {{Providing mobility of miniature, in vivo surgical robots under a variety
   of changing in vivo conditions is necessary to help expand the
   application of minimally invasive surgery. Analytical and finite element
   analysis results of wheeled mobility on tissue inside abdominal cavity
   are presented here, as a preliminary step towards further improved
   mobility performance.
   Results indicate that the mobility of a wheeled robot on tissue is
   influenced by factors including wheel torque application rate and
   material relaxation time. While using a viscoelastic standard linear
   solid material tissue model, the steady state translation speed of the
   wheel decreases with the increase of material relaxation time given a
   constant torque application time. Interestingly, at a relaxation time
   threshold value, the wheel's steady-state speed no longer decreases, but
   abruptly undergoes continuous acceleration. Results also indicate that
   for very small and very large relaxation times the viscoelastic material
   can be approximated as an elastic material.}},

   instantaneous SIR for the two FFR techniques. Comparison of these
   results with those of the nearest BS connectivity model by Novlan et.
   al. show a surprising result that the maximum SIR connectivity, which is
   known to be coverage optimal for static and no frequency reuse
   scenarios, is not optimal anymore with FFR techniques. This shift from
   conventional wisdom demands further exploration on which BS should the

Abstract = {{Microring-resonator filters have important applications as filtering
   elements in microphotonic circuits. In this paper, we address the
   question of optimum design of resonator-based add-drop filters in the
   presence of finite losses, and show that symmetric coupling provides the
   optimum design. This conclusion contravenes previous work on this
   subject, and the oft-cited critically coupled resonator case. While the
   minimum bandwidth of a resonant filter is ultimately limited by
   intrinsic losses, i.e. the intrinsic Q, we show that the symmetric
   design can approach twice as narrow a linewidth as a critically coupled
   design for the same losses, in principle. We present a coupled-mode
   theory (CMT) model, and a complete electromagnetic device design example
   based on finite-difference time-domain field simulations which validates
   our conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Solder self-alignment is one of the most important technologies for cost
   effective optoelectronics assembly. In this study, the wetting of
   Sn-rich solder to the metal pads of chip and substrate was identified as
   a critical factor significantly affecting self-alignment accuracy during
   the assembly. Insufficient wetting of solder to the metallization pads
   was responsible for large chip-to-substrate misalignment post-assembly,
   while fabrication deviations, such as solder volume variation and pad
   diameter deviation, only account for misalignments in the range of
   submicrons. To aid the design of flip-chip assemblies requiring high
   alignment accuracy, a force optimization model was developed and
   validated experimentally. With the input parameters of design and
   manufacturing process for optoelectronics flip-chip assembly using
   solders, such as insufficient solder metallurgical wetting areas,
   positions and diameters of metallization pads, volume of individual
   solder bump, coefficient of solder surface tension, mass of chip,
   external forces acting on chip, and initial pick-and-place position of
   chip before assembly, the model predicts the assembled position of the
   chip in terms of the misalignments in the X-Y planes and the rotation
   angles along the Z axis. The model further confirmed that insufficient
   wetting of solder is the most critical modulator among the undesirable
   factors affecting solder self-alignment accuracy.}},

   bistatic configuration, using one right-handed circular polarized and
   one left-handed circular polarized antenna, was built for this
   experiment in order to measure direct and reflected L1 and L5 signals.
   The direct and reflected signals were compared and the path difference
   between them calculated, leading to altitude measurements with both L1
   and L5 signals. Compared to publicly available signals on L1, the higher
   code rate of L5 will provide higher measurement sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{We identify a series of basal crevasses along a 31 km transect across
   the northern sector of the Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctica, using in situ
   ground-penetrating radar. The basal crevasses propagate from a region of
   multiple, shallow basal fractures to form widely spaced (0.5-2.0 km) but
   deeply incised (70-134 m) features. Surface troughs, observed in visible
   imagery, exist above the basal crevasses as the ice vertically shears to
   reach hydrostatic equilibrium, while widespread surface crevassing
   occurs along the crests and on the flanks of the undulations, primarily
   aligned with the topography. We suggest, based on the location of the
   surface crevasses and the along-flow evolution of the basal crevasses,
   that the former are induced by a bending stress created by gradients in
   hydrostatic forces. Using a linear elastic fracture mechanics model, we
   investigate the sensitivity of basal crevasse propagation to observed
   trends of ice-shelf thinning and acceleration. Basal crevasses are
   large-scale structural weaknesses that can both control meltwater
   ponding and induce surface crevassing. Together, these features may
   represent an important mechanism in both past and future ice-shelf
   disintegration events on the Antarctic Peninsula.}},

Title = {{On the influence of Greenland outlet glacier bed topography on results
   from dynamic ice-sheet models}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{60, 2}},
Pages = {{281-293}},
Abstract = {{Prediction of future changes in dynamics of the Earth's ice sheets, mass
   loss and resultant contribution to sea-level rise are the main
   objectives of ice-sheet modeling. Mass transfer from ice sheet to ocean
   is, in large part, through outlet glaciers. Subglacial topography plays
   an important role in ice dynamics; however, trough systems have not been
   included in bed digital elevation models (DEMS) used in modeling,
   because their size is close to the model resolution. Using recently
   collected CReSIS MCoRDs data of subglacial topography and an algorithm
   that allows topographically and morphologically correct integration of
   troughs and trough systems at any modeling scale (5 km resolution for
   SeaRISE), an improved Greenland bed DEM was developed that includes
   Jakobshavn Isbrae, Helheim, Kangerdlussuaq and Petermann glaciers
   (JakHelKanPet DEM). Contrasting the different responses of two Greenland
   ice-sheet models (UMISM and SICOPOLIS) to the more accurately
   represented bed shows significant differences in modeled surface
   velocity, basal water production and ice thickness. Consequently,
   modeled ice volumes for the Greenland ice sheet are significantly
   smaller using the JakHelKanPet DEM, and volume losses larger. More
   generally, the study demonstrates the role of spatial modeling of data
   specifically as input for dynamic ice-sheet models in assessments of
   future sea-level rise.}},

Abstract = {{A high-level characterization of spacecraft operations and subsystems is
   used to formally define the spacecraft power management problem. Two
   objectives of maximizing the payload reward and minimizing the battery
   discharge are optimized in the Pareto-optimal sense. These objectives

   Even with simplifying assumptions, this formulation is shown to be
   computationally intractable. Nonetheless, a formal proof of optimal
   substructure is used to develop an optimal dynamic programming solution.
   This algorithm is intended to reduce the labor-intensive operations

Abstract = {{For two optical waves propagating through the turbulent atmosphere, the
   temporal cross-correlation of their angle-of-arrival (AOA) fluctuations
   contains information regarding the path-averaged beam transverse
   horizontal wind velocity. Two estimators, namely the time delay of the
   peak (TDP) and slope at zero lag (SZL), both based on the temporal AOA
   cross-correlation function obtained from a pair of spatially separated
   LEDs, are utilized for the retrieval of the transverse horizontal wind
   velocity, v(t). The maximum rms difference between optically retrieved
   and ultrasonic anemometer measured values of vt was found to be
   0.18ms(-1) for the TDP estimator and 0.23ms(-1) for the SZL estimator,
   over a period of 9h during which vt varied between -1.3ms(-1) and
   2.0ms(-1). An objective treatment of the TDP and SZL wind estimators is
   presented with respect to their relative accuracy and limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Long range planning for water reuse is very complex due to the interplay
   of numerous factors. A multi-faceted study was conducted to improve the
   understanding of these factors, to analyze how different scenarios of
   the future may affect these factors and water reuse, and to help
   determine which of these factors and issues are most important to
   address in order to ensure that water reuse is a successful water supply
   option in the future. This paper follows a series of surveys, expert
   workshops and scenario studies that were conducted, with the goal of
   refining a list of factors and issues that affect water reuse down to a
   few key items. From this process, the following aspects were concluded
   to be most important to focus on because they have the most impact, and
   thus will affect the future of water reuse the most: expanding the
   perceived role of water reuse; taking action to improve public
   acceptance; creating a supportive regulatory and legal environment;
   integrating resource management; expanding economic analysis;
   considering energy, climate and sustainability issues; creating water
   reuse institutions and associations; and, encouraging technology
   advancement and innovation. Discussions of these issues, along with
   suggestions for further research and innovation are included.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and its associated consequences pose an increasing risk
   to public lands in the western United States. High-level mandates
   currently require federal agencies to begin planning for adaptation, but
   the extent to which these mandates have resulted in policies being
   implemented that affect on the ground practices is unclear. To examine
   the status of adaptation efforts, we conducted an original survey and
   semistructured interviews with land managers from the four major federal
   land management agencies in the U. S. states of Colorado, Utah, and
   Wyoming. The survey was designed to examine current planning for
   adaptation on public lands and how it differs from prior planning, the
   major challenges facing land managers in this region, the major barriers
   preventing managers from planning for adaptation, and the major hurdles
   associated with implementing adaptation plans. Our results show that
   some adaptation planning is currently taking place, but that few
   adaptation projects have made it to the implementation phase. Overall,
   respondents considered lack of information at relevant scales, budget
   constraints, lack of specific agency direction, and lack of useful
   information to be the most common barriers to adaption planning. Budget
   constraints, lack of perceived importance to the public, and lack of
   public awareness or demand to take action were reported to be the
   biggest hurdles to implementation of adaptation projects. Agencies
   showed differing levels of adaptation activity, and reported different
   barriers to adaptation and hurdles to implementation. Reasons for the
   differences and implications for future research and policy are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A recently issued patent {[}1] describes a method by which vacuum energy
   is extracted from gas flowing through a Casimir cavity. According to
   stochastic electrodynamics, the electronic orbitals in atoms are
   supported by the ambient zero-point (ZP) field. When the gas atoms are
   pumped into a Casimir cavity, where long-wavelength ZP field modes are
   excluded, the electrons spin down into lower energy orbitals and release
   energy in the process. This energy is collected in a local absorber.
   When the electrons exit the Casimir cavity they are re-energized to
   their original orbitals by the ambient ZP fields. The process is
   repeated to produce continuous power. In this way, the device functions
   like a heat pump for ZP energy, extracting it globally from the
   electromagnetic quantum vacuum and collecting it in a local absorber.
   This energy can be used for heating, or converted to electric power.
   We carried out a series of experiments to test whether energy is, in
   fact, radiated from Casimir cavities when the appropriate gas flows
   through them. The Casimir cavity devices we tested were nanopore
   polycarbonate membranes with submicron pores having a density of 3x10(8)
   pores/cm(2). Gas was pumped through the membranes in a stainless steel
   vacuum system, and emitted energy was measured using a broadband
   pyroelectric detector and lock-in amplifier. Emission in the infrared
   was clearly observed. We analyzed the emission from different gases and
   cavities to determine its origin. None of the conventional thermodynamic
   models we applied to our data fully explain it, leaving open the
   possibility that it is due to Casimir-cavity-induced emission from ZP
   fields. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection and/or peer-review

Abstract = {{The generalized multiplexing gain region (GMGR) of the slow-fading MIMO
   interference channel is obtained under the assumption of perfect channel
   state information at the transmitters (CSIT) in the general case where
   there are an arbitrary number of antennas at each of the four nodes. It
   is shown that a simple Han-Kobayashi (HK) linear Gaussian superposition
   coding scheme with a public/private message split at each transmitter
   can achieve the GMGR of the channel if the covariance matrices
   associated with the private and public sub-message codewords at each
   transmitter are certain functions of the null-space of the respective
   cross-link channel matrix. Moreover, in such a coding scheme, the
   multiplexing gains of the sub-messages can be chosen without any CSIT.
   Building on this result, and with M-i and N-i denoting the numbers of
   transmit and receive antennas at the i(th) transmitter and receiver,
   respectively, it is shown that at transmitter i an approximate version
   of the associated null-space expressed in terms of N-j(M-i - N-j)(+)
   log(INRij) bits per channel realization is sufficient to achieve the
   perfect CSIT GMGR of the channel, where INRij is the

   assumption of no CSIT, the GMGR is characterized for two sub-classes of

Abstract = {{As cloud computing and computational needs grow, data centers will
   continue to become a larger part of our energy load. Proper design and
   layout are crucial to efficient energy use in data centers. Modeling the
   rack is one of the critical pieces in the design process. Often this is
   done as a black box rather than modeling the rack in detail. Modeling a
   computer rack as a black box has been done in numerous data center
   studies, but rarely has it been validated against experimental
   temperature and velocity data. This study looks at two simplified rack
   models and compares them against a rack composed of four 10U server
   simulators. The first model is an open box model that has a heating and
   fan plate and allows air to flow through the rack. The second model is a
   black box model that allows no flow through the rack and imposes a
   constant pressure boundary across the inlet and exhaust. The black box
   model adds the rack load from the upwind cells at the rack inlet plate
   to generate the exhaust temperature profile. Both models were tested
   across a range of airflows and rack loads. Agreements were found to be
   within 5.4 degrees F (3 degrees C) and 40 fpm (0.2 m/s), on average,
   over all experiments. An interesting finding of this study was the
   importance of correctly capturing the boundary conditions at the
   perforated floor tile. Modeling the perforated floor tile as a nozzle
   diffuser using the momentum method described in ASHRAE RP-1009 was found
   to produce acceptable results for airflow from the perforated floor
   tile.}},

   {[}78.1 degrees F] was measured, which was approximately 2.1 degrees C
   {[}3.8 degrees F] cooler than the surrounding skin temperature.
   Additional relevant observations of the OR environment are discussed in
   order to improve the engineering knowledge of how these environments are
   used by medical personnel. Occupant heat gain was estimated at 54.3 W
   for an anesthetized patient to 102.9 W for a circulating nurse based on
   a combination of field measurements and surgical personnel thermal
   parameters from literature. The total cooling load in a general OR is
   approximately 2539 W with lighting providing 50\% of the heat gain. The
   supply air Delta T for a generic operating room is approximately 3
   degrees C based on ASHRAE Standard 170-2008 air flow requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the abundance of observational datasets collected since the onset
   of its retreat (c. 1983), Columbia Glacier, Alaska, provides an exciting
   modeling target. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the form and flow
   of Columbia Glacier, using a 1-D (depth-integrated) flowline model, over
   a wide range of parameter values and forcings. An ensemble filter is
   imposed following spin-up to ensure that only simulations that
   accurately reproduce observed pre-retreat glacier geometry are retained;
   all other simulations are discarded. The selected ensemble of
   simulations reasonably reproduces numerous highly transient post-retreat
   observed datasets. The selected ensemble mean projection suggests that
   Columbia Glacier will achieve a new dynamic equilibrium (i.e.
   ``stable{''}) ice geometry c. 2020, at which time iceberg calving rate
   will have returned to approximately pre-retreat values. Comparison of
   the observed 1957 and 2007 glacier geometries with the projected 2100
   glacier geometry suggests that Columbia Glacier had already discharged
   similar to 82\% of its projected 1957-2100 sea level rise contribution
   by 2007. This case study therefore highlights the difficulties
   associated with the future extrapolation of observed glacier mass loss
   rates that are dominated by iceberg calving.}},

Abstract = {{Means to overcome tumor hypoxia have been the subject of clinical
   investigations since the 1960's; however these studies have yet to find
   a treatment which is widely accepted. It has been known for nearly a
   century that hypoxic cells are more resistant to radiotherapy than
   aerobic cells, and tumor hypoxia is a major factor leading to the
   resistance of tumors to radiation treatment as well as several cytotoxic
   agents. In this manuscript, the application of ultrasound combined with
   oxygen-carrier microbubbles is demonstrated as a method to locally
   increase dissolved oxygen. Microbubbles can also be imaged by
   ultrasound, thus providing the opportunity for image-guided oxygen
   delivery. Simulations of gas diffusion and microbubble gas exchange show
   that small amounts (down to 5 vol\%) of a low-solubility osmotic gas can
   substantially increase microbubble persistence and therefore production
   rates and stability of oxygen-carrier microbubbles. Simulations also
   indicate that the lipid shell can be engineered with long-chain lipids
   to increase oxygen payload during in vivo transit. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the application of ultrasound to destroy the
   microbubbles significantly enhances the local oxygen release. We propose
   this technology as an application for ultrasound image-guided release of
   oxygen directly to hypoxic tissue, such as tumor sites to enhance
   radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents have the potential to
   dramatically improve gene therapy treatments by enhancing the delivery
   of therapeutic DNA to malignant tissue. The physical response of
   microbubbles in an ultrasound field can mechanically perturb blood
   vessel walls and cell membranes, enhancing drug permeability into
   malignant tissue. In this review, we discuss literature that provided
   evidence of specific mechanisms that enhance in vivo gene delivery
   utilizing microbubble contrast agents, namely their ability to 1)
   improving cell membrane permeability, 2) modulate vascular permeability,
   and 3) enhance endocytotic uptake in cells. Additionally, we review
   novel microbubble vectors that are being developed in order to exploit
   these mechanisms and deliver higher gene payloads with greater target
   specificity. Finally, we discuss some future considerations that should
   be addressed in the development of nex-generation microbubbles in order
   to improve in vivo microbubble gene delivery. Overall, microbubbles are
   rapidly gaining popularity as efficient gene carriers, and combined with
   their functionality as imaging contrast agents, they represent powerful
   theranostic tools for image guided gene therapy applications.}},

   varies spatially and temporally. These characteristics of the
   environment and radio hardware are transferred from one task to another
   by reusing the hyperparameters. The three transfer learning algorithms
   presented here have different tradeoffs between model efficiency and
   training cost amortizations. 12 sets of flight data from different days
   and using diverse emitter hardware are used to compare the performance
   of the algorithms. Results show that reusing the hyperparameters can
   give reasonable performance in terms of root mean square error over a

   data and generating an image. Under this approach only a small number of
   the pixels in an image, typically as few as 10\%, need to be sampled to
   generate an accurate image. We show that when combined with time-optimal
   control to move the tip of the microscope between measurement locations,
   the imaging time is comparable to high-speed AFM systems while also
   greatly reducing the interactions with and force applied to the sample.
   In addition, the approach can significantly reduce the imaging time in
   applications such as force mapping in which the tip is moved
   point-by-point through a sequence of measurement locations rather than
   continuously scanned as in standard imaging.}},

Abstract = {{As wind energy becomes a larger portion of the world's energy portfolio
   and wind turbines become larger and more expensive, wind turbine control
   systems play an ever more prominent role in the design and deployment of
   wind turbines. The goals of traditional wind turbine control systems are
   maximizing energy production while protecting the wind turbine
   components. As more wind generation is installed there is an increasing
   interest in wind turbines actively controlling their power output in
   order to meet power set-points and to participate in frequency
   regulation for the utility grid. This capability will be beneficial for
   grid operators, as it seems possible that wind turbines can be more
   effective at providing some of these services than traditional power
   plants. Furthermore, establishing an ancillary market for such
   regulation can be beneficial for wind plant owner/operators and
   manufacturers that provide such services. In this tutorial paper we
   provide an overview of basic wind turbine control systems and highlight
   recent industry trends and research in wind turbine control systems for
   grid integration and frequency stability.}},

Abstract = {{S-TALIRO is a software toolbox that performs stochastic search for
   system trajectories that falsify real-time temporal logic
   specifications. S-TALIRO is founded on the notion of robustness of

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) involves passing an acoustic
   wave through a medium and analyzing the reflected waveform. In this
   study, UTDR is used to track the waveform peaks reflected from the outer
   and inner membranes in the outermost feed channel in a Koch 2521
   spiral-wound module. The UTDR amplitude is shown to be more sensitive to
   fouling than the transit (arrival) time. The local (point) measurement
   provided by UTDR is shown to be advantageous since its location can be
   optimized for early fouling detection. Concentration polarization is
   shown not to compromise UTDR. This is an advantage relative to flux
   decline that responds to both fouling and concentration polarization.
   The UTDR amplitude is found to increase with increasing temperature and
   decreasing pressure. This is explained by the effect these parameters
   have on the crystallization rate that changes the fouling layer
   morphology and thereby the reflected UTDR waveform. This study
   underscores the importance of establishing a UTDR reference surface
   suitable for unambiguous detection of fouling. It also emphasizes the
   necessity for good temperature and pressure control during UTDR
   measurements as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the
   effects of operating condition changes on the ultrasound waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a new platform for the
   identification of mutations that produce a mutant phenotype. We used
   Illumina sequencing to identify the mutational profile of three
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant strains. The three strains have more
   than 38,000 changes from the reference genome. NG6 is aflagellate and
   maps to 269 kb with only one nonsynonymous change; the V12E mutation
   falls in the FLA8 gene. Evidence that NG6 is a fla8 allele comes from
   swimming revertants that are either true or pseudorevertants. NG30 is
   aflagellate and maps to 458 kb that has six nonsynonomous changes.
   Evidence that NG30 has a causative nonsense allele in IFT80 comes from
   rescue of the nonswimming phenotype with a fragment bearing only this
   gene. This gene has been implicated in Jeune asphyxiating thoracic
   dystrophy. Electron microscopy of ift80-1 (NG30) shows a novel basal
   body phenotype. A bar or cap is observed over the distal end of the
   transition zone, which may be an intermediate in preparing the basal
   body for flagellar assembly. In the acetate-requiring mutant ac17, we
   failed to find a nonsynonymous change in the 676 kb mapped region, which
   is incompletely assembled. In these strains, 43\% of the changes occur
   on two of the 17 chromosomes. The excess on chromosome 6 surrounds the
   mating-type locus, which has numerous rearrangements and suppressed
   recombination, and the changes extend beyond the mating-type locus.
   Unexpectedly, chromosome 16 shows an unexplained excess of single
   nucleotide polymorphisms and indels. Overall, WGS in combination with
   limited mapping allows fast and accurate identification of point
   mutations in Chlamydomonas.}},

Title = {{Comparison of two polarity measurements of hydrophobic organic matter
   for the evaluation of water treatment processes: XAD resin and PRAM}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2418-2424}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a mixture of thousands of organic
   molecules wide-ranging in molecular weight, polarity and physicochemical
   properties. DOM is responsible for multiple water treatment issues such
   as trihalomethane (THM) formation potential and membrane fouling. Two
   methods of evaluating the polarity of DOM are being used for water
   treatment application: a serial XAD resin adsorption method at acid pH
   and the polarity rapid assessment method (PRAM) by parallel solid phase
   extraction (SPE) cartridges at natural pH. These two methods have been
   described by their authors as able to define a hydrophobic fraction
   though they do so by sorption onto different types of material at
   different pHs. The first part of this study compared the PRAM and XAD
   methods and showed that the hydrophobic fractions defined by the two
   approaches were not correlated. This result highlighted the difficulties
   in defining fractions as `hydrophobic material'. It appeared that the
   sorbents for XAD-8 (an acrylic polymer containing oxygen) at pH <3 and
   C-18 (a pure hydrocarbon polymer coating on silica particles) at neutral
   or pH <3 did not retain similar hydrophobic fractions. This hypothesis
   was verified by fluorescence spectroscopy of the effluent of the XAD-8
   resin and PRAM C-18 SPE cartridge. Finally the study concentrated on the
   use of fluorescence and ultrafiltration methods in series with PRAM to
   gain more insight into the structure and characteristics of the
   hydrophobic DOM present in drinking water sources. This evaluation
   showed that the smaller molecular weight fraction of DOM (<1 kDa) had a
   higher percentage of hydrophobic character and that the
   fluorescence-defined aromatic protein fraction was the most hydrophilic.}},

   the part of the spectrum that benefits from absorption in the AlGaAs QW
   structure, while being transparent to the IR spectrum. The efficiencies
   and short-circuit currents for the AIGaAs MQW cell with and without DBR
   are simulated. The efficiencies and short-circuit currents of an
   optimized AlGaAs MQW cell with and without DBR are simulated. Results
   obtained show improvement in short circuit current, open circuit voltage
   and efficiency when both MQW and DBR were used. Simulation results
   predict an efficiency of about 28.4\% for the MQW AlGaAs-DBR single
   p-i-n junction photovoltaic cell under the presence of both radiative
   and non-radiative recombination mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Abstract = {{Particles in protein therapeutics are undesirable because they may have
   the potential for causing adverse immunogenicity in patients.
   Agitation-induced exposure to the air-water interface during
   manufacturing, shipping, and administration can cause particle formation
   in therapeutic protein products. We systematically studied how
   application of surface pressure during periodic interfacial compressions
   caused a model monoclonal antibody to form particles. Above a critical
   interfacial compression ratio of 5 we observed a dramatic increase in
   the rate of protein particle formation. During continuous interfacial
   compression/dilation cycles, particle numbers increased but the particle
   size distribution remained unchanged. When cyclic compressions were
   halted, particles did not nucleate additional particles or grow further
   in bulk solution suggesting that they are formed only at the air-water
   interface. In fact, we found that particles in the bulk slowly decreased
   in number upon standing. The rate of particle formation was only weakly
   dependent on both the bulk protein concentration and the period of
   cyclical interfacial compressions. These observations are consistent
   with the interfacial aggregation of proteins during periods of high
   surface pressure, followed by collapse of the adsorbed layer and
   detachment of protein particles from the interface into the bulk.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are active materials that can fix a
   temporary shape and recover the permanent shape in response to
   environmental stimuli such as temperature, light, moisture or magnetic
   field. In order to provide insight into the mechanism for shape memory
   behavior and to predict the behaviors of targeted design, several
   constitutive models were developed in the past. Most of these models are
   complicated and require time-consuming experiments to obtain model
   parameters. However, for many engineers, an estimation of key features
   of shape memory behaviors, such as time for free recovery, is
   sufficient. Such estimation should be based on a simplified model
   involving only a few key parameters that can be quickly identified
   experimentally. In this paper, a simple theoretical solution was
   developed to predict the temperature dependent free recovery behaviors
   of amorphous SMPs. This solution is based on a modified standard linear
   solid (SLS) model with a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched
   exponential function and requires only eight parameters that can be
   determined by stress relaxation tests. The theoretical predictions of
   free recovery behaviors show a good agreement with experimental results.
   Parametric studies using this solution reveal that the free recovery
   time can be reduced by increasing the equilibrium modulus (E-0) or KWW
   stretching parameter (beta), or by decreasing the nonequilibrium modulus
   (E-1) or the relaxation time (tau(0)) and is most sensitive to the KWW
   stretching parameter beta.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is becoming a larger portion of the global energy portfolio,
   and wind penetration has increased dramatically in certain regions of
   the world. This increasing wind penetration has driven the need for wind
   turbines to provide active power control (APC) services to the local
   utility grid, as wind turbines do not intrinsically provide frequency
   regulation services that are common with traditional generators. Large
   scale wind turbines are typically decoupled from the utility grid via
   power electronics, which allows the turbines to synthesize APC commands
   via control of the generator torque and blade pitch commands.
   Consequently, the APC services provided by a wind turbine can be more
   flexible than those provided by conventional generators.
   This paper focuses on the development and implementation of both static
   and dynamic droop curves to measure grid frequency and output delta
   power reference signals to a novel power set point tracking control
   system. The combined droop curve and power tracking controller is
   simulated and comparisons are made between simulations using various
   droop curve parameters and stochastic wind conditions. The tradeoffs
   involved with aggressive response to frequency events are analyzed. At
   the turbine level, simulations are performed to analyze induced
   structural loads. At the grid level, simulations test a wind plant's
   response to a dip in grid frequency.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{1197-1210}},
Abstract = {{One critical component of engineering living tissue equivalents is the
   design scaffolds (often made of hydrogels) whose degradation kinetics
   can match that of matrix production by cells. However, cell-mediated
   enzymatic degradation of a hydrogel is a highly complex and nonlinear
   process that is challenging to comprehend based solely on experimental
   observations. To address this issue, this study presents a triphasic
   mixture model of the enzyme-hydrogel system, which consists of a solid
   polymer network, water and enzyme. On the basis mixture theory, the
   rubber elasticity theory and the Michaelis-Menton kinetics for
   degradation, the model naturally incorporates a strong coupling between
   gel mechanical properties, the kinetics of degradation and the transport
   of enzyme through the gel. The model is then used to investigate the
   particular problem of a single spherical enzyme-producing cell, embedded
   in a spherical hydrogel domain, for which the governing equations can be
   cast within the cento-symmetric assumptions. The governing equations are
   subsequently solved using an implicit nonlinear finite element procedure
   to obtain the evolution of enzyme concentration and gel degradation
   through time and space. The model shows that two regimes of degradation
   behaviour exist, whereby degradation is dominated either by diffusion or
   dominated by reaction kinetics. Depending on the enzyme properties and
   the initial hydrogel design, the temporal and spatial changes in gel
   cross-linking are dramatically impacted, a feature that is likely to
   strongly affect new tissue development.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1, SI}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental methodology for using multistage,
   drained triaxial tests on compacted soils under unsaturated conditions
   to estimate soil-specific relationships between mean effective stress
   and matric suction. Tests were performed by applying a matric suction to
   a soil specimen in a triaxial cell using the axis translation technique
   with back-pressure, then shearing the specimen under drained conditions
   until reaching stress-path tangency. The specimen was then unloaded, a
   new suction was applied, and the shearing process was repeated. The
   points of maximum principal stress difference for the unsaturated
   specimen were plotted versus mean effective stress, defined using the
   degree of saturation as the effective stress parameter, and they were
   found to correspond well with the critical state line defined from
   triaxial tests on saturated specimens. The suction stress for the
   compacted soil tested in this study was observed to increase nonlinearly
   with suction, tending toward a constant value with increasing suction.
   Although there are potential changes in soil structure in the specimen
   during loading, unloading, and reloading, the results indicate that the
   multistage testing method may be useful for estimating soil-specific
   effective stress parameters for compacted soils in unsaturated
   conditions. Furthermore, the fact that differences in the soil-water
   retention curve of soil specimens subjected to different net confining
   pressures were observed for the soil tested in this study emphasizes the
   importance of using soil-specific tests to validate predictive
   relationships between suction stress and matric suction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the validation of a centrifuge perrneameter and

   processes in unsaturated soils. The centrifuge perrneameter is capable
   of controlling the boundary conditions for infiltration and drainage and

   centrifugation. Evaluations of the measured matric suction and
   volumetric water content profiles from a series of infiltration and

   levels ranging from 20 to 50 times earth gravity indicate that the
   established equations for calculating the hydraulic conductivity of
   unsaturated soil at steady-state conditions might not be appropriate,
   except at higher centrifuge accelerations. The transient profiles were
   also analyzed using a form of the instantaneous profile method in which
   the centrifuge acceleration was incorporated into the hydraulic
   gradient. Although the calculated soil water retention curve and
   hydraulic conductivity function data show some scatter, the hysteretic
   behavior of the soil during wetting and drying could be assessed.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{9529-9543}},
Abstract = {{We present simultaneous fast, in-situ measurements of formaldehyde and
   glyoxal from two rural campaigns, BEARPEX 2009 and BEACHON-ROCS, both
   located in Pinus Ponderosa forests with emissions dominated by biogenic
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Despite considerable variability in
   the formaldehyde and glyoxal concentrations, the ratio of glyoxal to
   formaldehyde, R-GF, displayed a very regular diurnal cycle over nearly 2
   weeks of measurements. The only deviations in R-GF were toward higher
   values and were the result of a biomass burning event during BEARPEX
   2009 and very fresh anthropogenic influence during BEACHON-ROCS. Other
   rapid changes in glyoxal and formaldehyde concentrations have hardly any
   affect on R-GF and could reflect transitions between low and high NO
   regimes. The trend of increased R-GF from both anthropogenic reactive
   VOC mixtures and biomass burning compared to biogenic reactive VOC
   mixtures is robust due to the short timescales over which the observed
   changes in R-GF occurred. Satellite retrievals, which suggest higher
   R-GF for biogenic areas, are in contrast to our observed trends. It
   remains important to address this discrepancy, especially in view of the
   importance of satellite retrievals and in situ measurements for model
   comparison. In addition, we propose that R-GF represents a useful metric
   for biogenic or anthropogenic reactive VOC mixtures and, in combination
   with absolute concentrations of glyoxal and formaldehyde, furthermore
   represents a useful metric for the extent of anthropogenic influence on
   overall reactive VOC processing via NOx. In particular, R-GF yields
   information about not simply the VOCs dominating reactivity in an
   airmass, but the VOC processing itself that is directly coupled to ozone
   and secondary organic aerosol production.}},

Journal = {{HVAC\&R RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics has been playing an important role in
   building design and indoor environment study for decades. However, the
   computing cost of grid-independent computational fluid dynamics prevents
   its application from real-time simulation in many areas, such as
   building emergency evacuation and hourly-based energy simulation.
   Although coarse-grid computational fluid dynamics has the potential of
   being as fast as or faster than real time and can provide valuable
   information for decision making, the credibility of coarse-grid
   computational fluid dynamics results is questioned due to the unknown
   error scale it brings. This study investigates the grid-induced error,
   evaluates the potential computing cost saving by using a coarse grid,
   and provides a guideline for optimizing the trade-off between grid
   resolution and computing cost. The numerical error caused by coarse grid
   can be minimized by appropriately adapting the distribution of grid
   size. Following the guideline of coarse-grid specifications, coarse-grid
   computational fluid dynamics can provide informative prediction that is
   comparable to a grid-independent result on building environment
   modeling. The computing cost of computational fluid dynamics with an
   optimized coarse grid is usually orders of magnitude less than that with
   uniform fine grid.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a plasticity/damage formulation in the context of
   the physically based micro-continuum theory for multiphase materials
   described in a companion paper (see Vernerey, A physically-based
   micro-continuum theory, Mech. Adv. Mater. Struct., 2012). Based on a
   micro-structurally motivated decomposition of the deformation, the
   presented inelastic formulation is capable of characterizing the
   independent plastic/damage processes occurring in different phases (such
   as fiber or inclusions) and predicting the overall material behavior.
   The inelastic constitutive relation can thus be cast in a simple,
   physically motivated form, compared to conventional models. Such a
   formulation is thus very attractive for establishing a link between
   materials structure and properties. To illustrate the presented
   framework, we apply the micro-continuum model to the tensile failure of
   fiber-reinforced composite and compare it to a ``brute force{''}
   approach in which the microstructure is explicitly modeled. We show that
   the model captures accurately the evolution of various features that
   cannot be calculated with conventional methods such as the independent
   stress, strain, and damage in the matrix and fibers and the fiber/matrix
   interface. Moreover, the existence of a size effect during failure is
   accounted for correctly.}},

Abstract = {{Coulomb formation flight is an emerging concept that utilizes
   electrostatic forces to maintain a formation of close proximity
   spacecraft. This paper uses analytic models and numerical simulations to
   explore the extent of plasma environment shielding on Coulomb forces
   with large potentials relative to the ambient plasma energy. The use of
   effective Debye lengths are used in analytic models to approximately and
   numerically efficiently calculate the force between charged objects.
   This is computed specifically for Coulomb free-flying formations and
   tethered Coulomb structures with nodal separations at dozens of meters
   operating in the geosynchronous plasma environment. It is shown that the
   force between a sphere and point charge is accurately captured with the
   effective Debye length, as opposed to the classic Debye length solutions
   that have errors exceeding 50\%. One notable finding is that the
   effective Debye lengths in low earth orbit plasmas about a charged body
   are increased from the centimeter to meter level. This is a promising
   outcome, as the reduced shielding provides sufficient force levels for
   operating the electrostatically inflated membrane structures concept at
   these dense plasma altitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The use of electrostatic (Coulomb) actuation for formation flying is
   attractive because non-renewable fuel reserves are not depleted and
   plume impingement issues are avoided. Prior analytical electrostatic
   force models used for Coulomb formations assume spherical spacecraft
   shapes, which include mutual capacitance and induced effects. However,
   this framework does not capture any orientation dependent forces or
   torques on generic spacecraft geometries encountered during very close
   operations and docking scenarios. The Multi Sphere Model (MSM) uses a
   collection of finite spheres to represent a complex shape and
   analytically approximate the Coulomb interaction with other charged
   bodies. Finite element analysis software is used as a truth model to
   determine the optimal MSM parameters. The model is robust to varying
   system parameters such as prescribed voltages and external shape size.
   Using the MSM, faster-than-realtime electrostatic simulation of six
   degree of freedom relative spacecraft motion is feasible, which is
   crucial for the development of robust relative position and orientation
   control algorithms in local space situational awareness applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effects of out-of-plane perturbations on planar
   motion for collinear three-craft Coulomb formations with set charges.
   The formation is assumed to be spinning in deep space without relevant
   gravitational forces present. Previous work analytically proves marginal
   stability assuming in-plane motion with circular relative trajectories
   and the initial position and velocity perturbations confined to the
   orbital plane. In this paper, a new derivation of the equations of
   motion in cylindrical coordinates is produced to analyze the
   out-of-plane motion in more detail. The out-of-plane motion is shown to
   decouple to first order from the marginally stable in-plane motion. A
   control law is developed to maintain the out-of-plane motion within
   specified deadbands. For small relative out-of-plane perturbations, the
   control law succeeds in preserving the in-plane variant shape despite
   some out-of-plane motion. A trend between the settling time and
   deadband, which defines the largest out-of-plane errors allowed before
   the controller is turned on, is determined which illustrates how large
   the deadband may be before the in-plane motion is affected. A
   Monte-Carlo analysis also indicates that the spin-rate and formation
   size do not have a significant influence on the out-of-plane instability
   of a collinear invariant shape Coulomb formation.}},

   method) allows us to use significantly fewer force function evaluations

   particular, it is sufficient to use a low-fidelity force model for most
   of the iterations, thus minimizing the use of a high-fidelity force
   model. Our goal is to develop a numerical integration technique that is
   faster than current methods in an effort to address the expected

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a rigid body with nonlinear delayed feedback control are
   studied in this paper. It is assumed that the time delay occurs in one
   of the actuators while the other one remains is delay-free. Therefore, a
   nonlinear feedback controller using both delayed and non-delayed states
   is sought for the controlled system to have the desired linear
   closed-loop dynamics which contains a time-delay term using an inverse
   dynamics approach. First, the closed-loop stability is shown to be
   approximated by a second order linear delay differential equation (DDE)
   for the MRP attitude coordinate for which the Hsu-Bhatt-Vyshnegradskii
   stability chart can be used to choose the control gains that result in a
   stable closed-loop response. An analytical derivation of the boundaries
   of this chart for the undamped case is shown, and subsequently the
   Chebyshev spectral continuous time approximation (ChSCTA) method is used
   to obtain the stable and unstable regions for the damped case. The
   MATLAB dde23 function is implemented to obtain the closed-loop response
   which is in agreement with the stability charts, while the delay-free

Abstract = {{The low Earth orbit debris environment continues to be a concern for the
   space community. While debris mitigation is an important component of
   reducing on-orbit clutter, active debris removal methods are likely to
   be necessary in the future. A debris removal system is proposed which
   uses fuel reserves from the second stage of a heavy launch vehicle after
   it has delivered its primary payload. Upon tethering to a large debris
   object such as another second stage rocket body, a Delta v maneuver is
   performed to lower both objects' periapses. Specifically, a Soyuz-like
   rocket-body is considered the thrusting tug craft, while a Cosmos-3M
   rocket-body is considered the debris object. The Cosmos-3M is found to
   most densely populate the orbits around 700 km - 900 km between 83
   degrees and 98 degrees declination. To deorbit a Cosmos-3M in 25 years
   from an 800 km orbit only requires a combined Delta v = 120 m/s. This is
   within the fuel reserve budget of the Soyuz upper stage.,To provide
   insight into the tug-debris dynamics, the tether is modeled as a spring
   with rigid body end masses while the tether is in tension. In order to
   avoid collision between the two craft, deep-space dynamics reveal that
   the thrust can be throttled in synchronization with the relative motion
   so that, at the end of a burn, zero relative velocity between the two
   craft is achieved. The on-orbit dynamics reveal that the orbital motion
   helps keep both craft separated. Further, low-thrust applications, or
   large initial separation distance, are shown to reduce the likelihood of
   post-burn collisions.}},

Abstract = {{One topic of interest in space situational awareness (SSA) is the
   accurate and consistent representation of an observed object's
   uncertainty under non-linear dynamics, which can be approached
   analytically by employing a special solution to the Fokker-Planck
   dierential equations for Hamiltonian dynamical systems. In this paper,
   we expand this method to include the eects of non-conservative forces.
   In order to describe the evolution of a pdf over time for a dynamical
   system with no diusion, one only needs to find the solution flow to the
   dynamics regardless of whether the forces are conservative or not.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the efficiency of cell phone base station transmitters, it is
   desirable to run the RF Power Amplifier (RFPA) with an envelope
   modulating power supply that provides the RFPA with the voltage and
   current needed for maximum efficiency. However, cell phone transmission
   varies the RF output power considerably over short periods, with the
   average power significantly less than the peak transmission power, which
   is difficult for traditional power supplies to support efficiently. This
   paper describes a switched-mode 8-phase buck envelope modulating power
   supply with a lookup table that varies the duty cycle and operating
   frequency to maintain soft switching under all operating conditions, and
   with dynamic timing correction to keep the phases uniformly distributed
   in time except when tracking signal dynamics that require simultaneous
   switching of multiple phases. The power supply does not require active
   compensation to keep the phase currents balanced. The experimentally
   demonstrated power supply provides 10 MHz large signal bandwidth, >40
   A/mu sec current slew rate, with switching frequency of up to 15 MHz at
   95\% efficiency. The supply is suitable for 2-carrier WCDMA and LTE cell
   phone base stations.}},

Abstract = {{Mitigation of the variability in output power of renewable generators
   such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is a growing concern as these
   generators reach higher penetrations on electric grids. This paper
   presents a system where a bidirectional, highly efficient, DC-DC
   electric vehicle (EV) charger is placed between the high-voltage DC bus
   of a PV system and the EV battery. In addition to providing fast
   charging for the EV battery from PV or from the grid, the charger is
   capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery,
   thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level
   below the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses
   sizing of the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating,
   the desired maximum ramp rate, and site insolation characteristics.
   Analysis suggests that small amounts of energy storage can accomplish
   large reductions in output power ramp rate. Experimental results are
   shown for a 10 kW, 98\% efficient DC-DC charger based on bidirectional
   four-phase zero-voltage-switching converter.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{8829-8849}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation emits large quantities of biogenic volatile organic compounds
   (BVOC). At remote sites, these compounds are the dominant precursors to
   ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production, yet current field
   studies show that atmospheric models have difficulty in capturing the
   observed HOx cycle and concentrations of BVOC oxidation products. In
   this manuscript, we simulate BVOC chemistry within a forest canopy using
   a one-dimensional canopy-chemistry model (Canopy Atmospheric CHemistry
   Emission model; CACHE) for a mixed deciduous forest in northern Michigan
   during the CABINEX 2009 campaign. We find that the base-case model,
   using fully-parameterized mixing and the simplified biogenic chemistry
   of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Model (RACM), underestimates
   daytime in-canopy vertical mixing by 50-70\% and by an order of
   magnitude at night, leading to discrepancies in the diurnal evolution of
   HOx, BVOC, and BVOC oxidation products. Implementing observed
   micrometeorological data from above and within the canopy substantially
   improves the diurnal cycle of modeled BVOC, particularly at the end of
   the day, and also improves the observation-model agreement for some BVOC
   oxidation products and OH reactivity. We compare the RACM mechanism to a
   version that includes the Mainz isoprene mechanism (RACM-MIM) to test
   the model sensitivity to enhanced isoprene degradation. RACM-MIM
   simulates higher concentrations of both primary BVOC (isoprene and
   monoterpenes) and oxidation products (HCHO, MACR+MVK) compared with RACM
   simulations. Additionally, the revised mechanism alters the OH
   concentrations and increases HO2. These changes generally improve
   agreement with HOx observations yet overestimate BVOC oxidation
   products, indicating that this isoprene mechanism does not improve the
   representation of local chemistry at the site. Overall, the revised
   mechanism yields smaller changes in BVOC and BVOC oxidation product
   concentrations and gradients than improving the parameterization of
   vertical mixing with observations, suggesting that uncertainties in
   vertical mixing parameterizations are an important component in
   understanding observed BVOC chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced cell culture techniques are increasingly needed to better
   understand basic cell physiology, predict in vivo response, and engineer
   de novo functional tissue substitutes. Toward this concept, hydrogels
   have emerged as biomimetic in vitro culture systems that allow cells to
   be grown in or on user-defined microenvironments that recapitulate many
   critical aspects of native tissue. Hydrogel biofunctionality can be
   engineered predictably and precisely via the tailorability of the
   hydrogel's chemical and mechanical properties, each of which directly
   influences cell fate. In this review, we highlight state-of-the-art
   hydrogel platforms that have been used to assay and define cell
   behavior, placing an emphasis on recent directions in systems that offer
   dynamic control of material properties in time and space. We review
   current understanding of cell-material interactions in 2D and discuss
   recent and future efforts, as well as challenges, in extending this work

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{52-64}},
Abstract = {{The present paper introduces a concurrent adaptive multiscale
   methodology for elasticity problems in which macroscopic deformation
   strongly interact with microscopic deformation fields at the scale of
   the microstructure. This situation occurs in a variety of important
   situations such as ductile fracture, shear banding and when sharp
   discontinuities are present in the material domain. Our analysis starts
   from the idea that numerical simulations must ensures that numerical
   accuracy is maximum while the error from homogenization is minimum.
   While the first usually implies that element size must be refined, the
   second implies that elements may not be smaller than the representative
   volume elements (RVEs) of the microstructure. To accommodate these two
   conditions, a finite element method is introduced such that continuum
   elements can be replaced by explicit RVEs through properly defined
   macro-micro kinetic conditions reminiscent to those used in classical
   homogenization. When combined with adaptive refinement, the methodology
   provides a flexible numerical method in which both continuum and
   microstructural descriptions can naturally coexist within a single
   simulation. We show, through various examples that the proposed
   framework addresses the important issue of reaching the optimal modeling
   accuracy for a minimal computational cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Identifying index (source) patient location of SARS transmission in a

Journal = {{HVAC\&R RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{616-625}},
Abstract = {{This article presents the application of a probability-concept-based
   algorithm that can track the source origins of viruses based on the
   number and location of infected individuals (cases) observed in an
   enclosed indoor environment. This probability-concept-based prediction
   uses the convective transfer mechanism of virus-containing airborne
   aerosols to track inversely the most probable locations of infection
   sources according to the concentration value measured in certain
   location(s). A new approach is proposed to convert the number of
   infection cases to the concentration values of virus particles that can
   be used as the input for prediction, making the concentration
   measurement unnecessary for source tracking in a real outbreak of
   epidemic disease. The source-tracking method is demonstrated and
   verified by using the SARS infection cases of medical students in a
   hospital ward outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. The model successfully
   predicts the location of the virus origin, i.e., the clinically
   identified SARS patient's bed in the outbreak. The method shows a good
   potential for quickly identifying the index patient location during an
   airborne disease outbreak, as well as confirming the airborne
   transmission mechanism and dispersion of indoor virus-and
   bacterium-containing aerosols.}},

Abstract = {{A commercial computer-aided design tool used by the lighting industry
   was modified to predict fluence rates for upper-room ultraviolet
   germicidal irradiation. Experimental validation based on more than 1600
   measurements and 3 types of commercial ultraviolet fixtures, which was
   done in an experimental chamber and in a homeless shelter having
   fixtures in continuous use for over 7 years, showed differences in
   measured and predicted average upper-room fluence rates of less than
   10\%. The computer-aided design tool, however, was not very successful
   at predicting fluence rates at specific room locations, a capability
   that is needed for mating computational fluid dynamics with ultraviolet
   germicidal irradiation. Although not an objective of this study, it was
   also found that the three types of fixtures used in this study have
   surprisingly significant differences in efficiency based on fixture
   ultraviolet power output and electrical input. One fixture type had an
   efficiency that was more than five times that of another. For comparison
   purposes, a standard method for measuring and reporting fixture
   efficiency is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent katabatic winds form widely distributed localized areas of
   near-zero net surface accumulation on the East Antarctic ice sheet
   (EAIS) plateau. These areas have been called `glaze' surfaces due to
   their polished appearance. They are typically 2-200 km(2) in area and
   are found on leeward slopes of ice-sheet undulations and megadunes.
   Adjacent, leeward high-accumulation regions (isolated dunes) are
   generally smaller and do not compensate for the local low in surface
   mass balance (SMB). We use a combination of satellite remote sensing and
   field-gathered datasets to map the extent of wind glaze in the EAIS
   above 1500 m elevation. Mapping criteria are derived from distinctive
   surface and subsurface characteristics of glaze areas resulting from
   many years of intense annual temperature cycling without significant
   burial. Our results show that 11.2 +/- 1.7\%, or 950 +/- 143 x 10(3)
   km(2), of the EAIS above 1500 m is wind glaze. Studies of SMB
   interpolate values across glaze regions, leading to overestimates of net
   mass input. Using our derived wind-glaze extent, we estimate this excess
   in three recent models of Antarctic SMB at 46-82 Gt. The lowest-input
   model appears to best match the mean in regions of extensive wind glaze.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial uncertainties still exist in the scientific understanding of
   the possible interactions between urban and natural (biogenic) emissions
   in the production and transformation of atmospheric aerosol and the
   resulting impact on climate change. The US Department of Energy (DOE)
   Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Carbonaceous Aerosol
   and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) carried out in June 2010 in Central
   Valley, California, was a comprehensive effort designed to improve this
   understanding. The primary objective of the field study was to
   investigate the evolution of secondary organic and black carbon aerosols
   and their climate-related properties in the Sacramento urban plume as it
   was routinely transported into the forested Sierra Nevada foothills
   area. Urban aerosols and trace gases experienced significant physical
   and chemical transformations as they mixed with the reactive biogenic
   hydrocarbons emitted from the forest. Two heavily-instrumented ground
   sites - one within the Sacramento urban area and another about 40 km to
   the northeast in the foothills area - were set up to characterize the
   evolution of meteorological variables, trace gases, aerosol precursors,
   aerosol size, composition, and climate-related properties in freshly
   polluted and ``aged{''} urban air. On selected days, the DOE G-1
   aircraft was deployed to make similar measurements upwind and across the
   evolving Sacramento plume in the morning and again in the afternoon. The
   NASA B-200 aircraft, carrying remote sensing instruments, was also
   deployed to characterize the vertical and horizontal distribution of
   aerosols and aerosol optical properties within and around the plume.
   This overview provides: (a) the scientific background and motivation for
   the study, (b) the operational and logistical information pertinent to
   the execution of the study, (c) an overview of key observations and
   initial findings from the aircraft and ground-based sampling platforms,
   and (d) a roadmap of planned data analyses and focused modeling efforts
   that will facilitate the integration of new knowledge into improved
   representations of key aerosol processes and properties in climate
   models.}},

Title = {{Atmospheric deposition as a source of carbon and nutrients to an alpine
   catchment of the Colorado Rocky Mountains}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3337-3355}},
Abstract = {{Many alpine areas are experiencing deglaciation, biogeochemical changes
   driven by temperature rise, and changes in atmospheric deposition. There
   is mounting evidence that the water quality of alpine streams may be
   related to these changes, including rising atmospheric deposition of
   carbon (C) and nutrients. Given that barren alpine soils can be severely
   C limited, atmospheric deposition sources may be an important source of
   C and nutrients for these environments. We evaluated the magnitude of
   atmospheric deposition of C and nutrients to an alpine site, the Green
   Lake 4 catchment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Using a long-term
   dataset (2002-2010) of weekly atmospheric wet deposition and snowpack
   chemistry, we found that volume weighted mean dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentrations were 1.12 +/- 0.19 mg l(-1), and weekly
   concentrations reached peaks as high at 6-10 mg l(-1) every summer.
   Total dissolved nitrogen concentration also peaked in the summer,
   whereas total dissolved phosphorus and calcium concentrations were
   highest in the spring. To investigate potential sources of C in
   atmospheric deposition, we evaluated the chemical quality of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) and relationships between DOM and other solutes in
   wet deposition. Relationships between DOC concentration, fluorescence,
   and nitrate and sulfate concentrations suggest that pollutants from
   nearby urban and agricultural sources and organic aerosols derived from
   sub-alpine vegetation may influence high summer DOC wet deposition
   concentrations. Interestingly, high DOC concentrations were also
   recorded during `dust-in-snow' events in the spring, which may reflect
   an association of DOM with dust. Detailed chemical and spectroscopic
   analyses conducted for samples collected in 2010 revealed that the DOM
   in many late spring and summer samples was less aromatic and
   polydisperse and of lower molecular weight than that of winter and fall
   samples. Our C budget estimates for the Green Lake 4 catchment
   illustrated that wet deposition (9.9 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and dry
   deposition (6.9 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) were a combined input of
   approximately 17 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), which could be as high as 24 kg C
   ha(-1) yr(-1) in high dust years. This atmospheric C input approached
   the C input from microbial autotrophic production in barren soils.
   Atmospheric wet and dry deposition also contributed 4.3 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1), 0.15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), and 2.7 kg Ca2+ ha(-1) yr(-1) to this
   alpine catchment.}},

Title = {{Enterprise Risk Management for Transportation Agencies}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2271}},
Pages = {{57-65}},
Abstract = {{Risk management is implicit in transportation business practices.
   Administrators, planners, and engineers coordinate many organizational
   and technical resources to manage transportation network performance.
   Transportation agencies manage some of the largest and highest-valued
   public assets and budgets in federal, state, and local governments. It
   is the agencies' corporate responsibility to set clear strategic goals
   and objectives to manage these assets so economic growth and livability
   of their regions improves and the public gets the best value. Risks can
   affect an agency's ability to meet its goals and objectives. As network
   and delivery managers, these agencies must identify risks, assess the
   possible impacts, develop plans to manage the risks, and monitor the
   effectiveness of their actions. This paper presents the results of (a) a
   comprehensive literature review, (b) a state-of-the-practice survey of
   43 U.S. transportation agencies, and (c) seven case studies from leading
   transportation organizations in Australia, England, Germany, the
   Netherlands, and Scotland. The paper concludes with recommendations for
   achieving enterprise risk management in U.S. highway agencies.
   Recommendations pertain to formalizing enterprise risk management
   approaches, embedding risk management in existing business processes,
   using risk management to build trust with transportation stakeholders,
   defining leadership and organizational responsibilities for risk
   management, identifying risk owners, supporting risk allocation
   strategies, and reexamining existing policies, processes, and standards
   through rigorous risk management analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Passive submillimeter-wave sensors are a way to obtain urgently needed
   global data on ice clouds, particularly on the so far poorly
   characterized `essential climate variable' ice water path (IWP) and on
   ice particle size. CloudIce was a mission proposal to the European Space
   Agency ESA in response to the call for Earth Explorer 8 (EE8), which ran
   in 2009/2010. It proposed a passive submillimeter-wave sensor with
   channels ranging from 183 GHz to 664 GHz. The article describes the
   CloudIce mission proposal, with particular emphasis on describing the
   algorithms for the data-analysis of submillimeter-wave cloud ice data
   (retrieval algorithms) and demonstrating their maturity. It is shown

Abstract = {{Due to the high importance of bacterial infections in medical devices
   there is an increasing interest in the design of anti-fouling coatings.
   The application of substrates with controlled chemical gradients to
   prevent microbial adhesion is presented. We describe here the
   co-polymerization of poly( ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate with a
   hyperbranched multimethacrylate (H30MA) using a chemical gradient
   generator; and the resulting films were characterized with respect to
   their ability to serve as coating for biomedical devices. The
   photo-polymerized materials present special surface properties due to
   the hyperbranched structure of H30MA and phase separation at specific
   concentrations in the PEGDM matrix. This approach affords the
   investigation of cell response to a large range of different chemistries
   on a single sample. Two bacterial strains commonly associated with
   surgical site infections, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
   have been cultured on these substrates to study their attachment
   behaviour. These gradient-coated samples demonstrate less bacterial
   adhesion at higher concentrations of H30MA, and the adhesion is
   substantially affected by the extent of surface phase segregation. (C)

Journal = {{MOLECULAR SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{793-808}},
Abstract = {{Anti-cancer drugs, such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin, covalently bind to
   adjacent guanine bases in DNA to form intra-strand adducts. Differential
   recognition of drug-DNA adducts by the protein HMGB1a has been related
   to the differences in efficacy of these drugs in tumours. Additionally,
   the bases flanking the adduct (the sequence context) also have a marked
   effect on HMGB1a binding affinity. We perform atomistic molecular
   dynamics simulations of DNA with cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in
   four sequence contexts (AGGC, CGGA, TGGA and TGGT) in the absence and
   presence of HMGB1a. The structure of HMGB1a-bound drug-DNA molecules is
   independent of sequence and drug identity, confirming that differential
   recognition cannot be explained by the protein-bound structure. The
   differences in the static and conformational dynamics of the drug-DNA
   structures in the absence of the protein explain some but not all trends
   in differential binding affinity of HMGB1a. Since the minor groove width
   and helical bend of all drug-DNA molecules in the unbound state are
   lower than the protein-bound state, HMGB1a must actively deform the DNA
   during binding. The thermodynamic pathway between the unbound and
   protein-bound states could be an additional factor in the binding
   affinity of HMGB1a for drug-DNA adducts in various sequence contexts.}},

Abstract = {{We study mutual alignment and interactions between colloidal particles

   ensuing elastic pair interactions between microspheres and nanoprisms
   are highly dependent on the nanoparticle shape being omnidirectionally
   attractive for convex prisms but strongly anisotropic for concave
   prisms. Elastic deformations due to spherical particles cause
   well-defined alignment of complex-shaped nanoparticles at distances much
   larger than the microsphere size. We characterize distance and angular
   dependencies of elastic pair interaction forces, torques, and binding
   energies. The studied elasticity-mediated self-assembly of metal and
   dielectric nanoparticles with dissimilar shapes and sizes opens new
   possibilities for self-assembly based fabrication of structured

Abstract = {{A dual polarization lidar was used to sense internal waves from a small
   aircraft. Internal waves are gravity waves that are formed by a vertical
   displacement of a density gradient in the ocean. If the perturbation is
   great enough, a nonlinear wave is produced and the balance between
   nonlinearity and dispersion can create a soliton-like wave packet. We
   observed nonlinear wave packets in West Sound, Orcas Island, Washington.
   In this region, a density gradient is formed in the summer by solar
   heating of the surface water. The perturbation is produced by strong
   tidal flow through a narrow, shallow channel at the mouth of the sound.
   Plankton layers form in association with the density gradients, and
   these layers produce an enhanced lidar return that moves up and down
   with the wave. We observed these internal waves with a lidar operating
   at 532 nm. They were much more visible when the receiver was polarized
   orthogonal to the transmitted laser pulse. This was the case whether
   linear or circular polarization was used, with no significant difference
   between the two cases. These internal waves were also visible to the
   naked eye, when the surface currents produced by the waves modulated the
   small surface waves that produce the apparent texture of the ocean
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{Methanol retrievals from nadir-viewing space-based sensors offer
   powerful new information for quantifying methanol emissions on a global
   scale. Here we apply an ensemble of aircraft observations over North
   America to evaluate new methanol measurements from the Tropospheric
   Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Aura satellite, and combine the TES
   data with observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding
   Interferometer (IASI) on the MetOp-A satellite to investigate the
   seasonality of methanol emissions from northern midlatitude ecosystems.
   Using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model as an intercomparison
   platform, we find that the TES retrieval performs well when the degrees
   of freedom for signal (DOFS) are above 0.5, in which case the model:TES
   regressions are generally consistent with the model:aircraft
   comparisons. Including retrievals with DOFS below 0.5 degrades the
   comparisons, as these are excessively influenced by the a priori. The
   comparisons suggest DOFS > 0.5 as a minimum threshold for interpreting
   retrievals of trace gases with a weak tropospheric signal. We analyze
   one full year of satellite observations and find that GEOS-Chem, driven
   with MEGANv2.1 biogenic emissions, underestimates observed methanol
   concentrations throughout the midlatitudes in springtime, with the
   timing of the seasonal peak in model emissions 1-2 months too late. We
   attribute this discrepancy to an underestimate of emissions from new
   leaves in MEGAN, and apply the satellite data to better quantify the
   seasonal change in methanol emissions for midlatitude ecosystems. The
   derived parameters (relative emission factors of 11.0, 0.26, 0.12 and
   3.0 for new, growing, mature, and old leaves, respectively, plus a leaf
   area index activity factor of 0.5 for expanding canopies with leaf area
   index < 1.2) provide a more realistic simulation of seasonal methanol
   concentrations in midlatitudes on the basis of both the IASI and TES
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic sensors are being employed on airborne platforms, such as
   Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) and Persistent Ground
   Surveillance System (PGSS), for source localization. Under certain
   atmospheric conditions, airborne sensors offer a distinct advantage over
   ground sensors. The performance of both ground and airborne sensors is
   affected by environmental factors, such as atmospheric turbulence and
   wind and temperature profiles. For airborne sensors, the effects of
   refraction must be accounted for in order to determine the source
   coordinates. Such a method for ground-to-air applications has been
   developed and is further refined here. Ideally, knowledge of the exact
   atmospheric profiles will allow for the most accurate mitigation of
   refractive effects. However, acoustic sensors deployed in theater are
   rarely supported by atmospheric sensing systems that retrieve real-time
   temperature and wind fields. Atmospheric conditions evolve through
   seasons, time of day, and are strongly location dependent. Therefore,
   the development of an atmospheric profiles database based on a long time
   series climatological assessment will provide knowledge for use in
   physics-based bearing estimation algorithms, where otherwise no
   correction would have been performed. Long term atmospheric data sets
   from weather modeling systems are used for a climatological assessment
   of the refraction corrections and localization errors over selected
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer nanocomposites consist of nanoscale additives embedded in a
   polymer matrix and are widely used in the automobiles, optics and
   microelectronics industries. Since the composition and the morphology of
   the polymer nanocomposite impact its macroscopic properties, significant
   efforts have been made to understand how parameters, such as polymer and
   nanoparticle chemistries, molecular weight of the matrix polymers and
   nanoparticle size, help tune the morphology. Theory and simulations have
   proven to be useful tools in this field due to their ability to link
   molecular level interactions, the morphology and the macroscopic
   properties. Due to the computational intensity of molecular simulations
   of a dense polymer matrix, there has been a strong effort on the
   theoretical front to develop methodologies that map out equilibrium
   structure and phase behaviour of polymer nanocomposites over a large
   parameter space. In this paper, we review the details of the
   self-consistent polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) Monte
   Carlo (MC) simulation method which integrates theory and simulation to
   study phase behaviour in polymer nanocomposites. We discuss two specific
   cases of polymer nanocomposites containing polymer-grafted nanoparticles
   with chemical and physical heterogeneity in grafts in which this
   self-consistent PRISM-MC approach has been used to study effective
   inter-filler interactions and phase behaviour.}},

Title = {{Intercomparison of modal and sectional aerosol microphysics
   representations within the same 3-D global chemical transport model}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{4449-4476}},
Abstract = {{In the most advanced aerosol-climate models it is common to represent
   the aerosol particle size distribution in terms of several log-normal
   modes. This approach, motivated by computational efficiency, makes
   assumptions about the shape of the particle distribution that may not
   always capture the properties of global aerosol. Here, a global modal
   aerosol microphysics module (GLOMAP-mode) is evaluated and improved by
   comparing against a sectional version (GLOMAP-bin) and observations in
   the same 3-D global offline chemistry transport model. With both
   schemes, the model captures the main features of the global particle
   size distribution, with sub-micron aerosol approximately unimodal in
   continental regions and bi-modal in marine regions. Initial bin-mode
   comparisons showed that the current values for two size distribution
   parameter settings in the modal scheme (mode widths and inter-modal
   separation sizes) resulted in clear biases compared to the sectional
   scheme. By adjusting these parameters in the modal scheme, much better
   agreement is achieved against the bin scheme and observations. Annual
   mean surface-level mass of sulphate, sea-salt, black carbon (BC) and
   organic carbon (OC) are within 25\% in the two schemes in nearly all
   regions. Surface level concentrations of condensation nuclei (CN), cloud
   condensation nuclei (CCN), surface area density and condensation sink
   also compare within 25\% in most regions. However, marine CCN
   concentrations between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S are systematically
   25-60\% higher in the modal model, which we attribute to differences in
   size-resolved particle growth or cloud-processing. Larger differences
   also exist in regions or seasons dominated by biomass burning and in
   free-troposphere and high-latitude regions. Indeed, in the
   free-troposphere, GLOMAP-mode BC is a factor 2-4 higher than GLOMAP-bin,
   likely due to differences in size-resolved scavenging. Nevertheless, in
   most parts of the atmosphere, we conclude that bin-mode differences are
   much less than model-observation differences, although some processes
   are missing in these runs which may pose a bigger challenge to modal
   schemes (e.g., boundary layer nucleation and ultra-fine sea-spray). The
   findings here underline the need for a spectrum of complexity in global
   models, with size-resolved aerosol properties predicted by modal schemes
   needing to be continually benchmarked and improved against freely
   evolving sectional schemes and observations.}},

Title = {{Borehole temperatures reveal details of 20th century warming at Bruce
   Plateau, Antarctic Peninsula}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{675-686}},
Abstract = {{Two ice core boreholes of 143.18 m and 447.73 m (bedrock) were drilled
   during the 2009-2010 austral summer on the Bruce Plateau at a location
   named LARISSA Site Beta (66 degrees 02' S, 64 degrees 04' W, 1975.5 m
   a.s.l.). Both boreholes were logged with thermistors shortly after
   drilling. The shallow borehole was instrumented for 4 months with a
   series of resistance thermometers with satellite uplink. Surface
   temperature proxy data derived from an inversion of the borehole
   temperature profiles are compared to available multi-decadal records
   from weather stations and ice cores located along a latitudinal transect
   of the Antarctic Peninsula to West Antarctica. The LARISSA Site Beta
   profiles show temperatures decreasing from the surface downward through
   the upper third of the ice, and warming thereafter to the bed. The
   average temperature for the most recent year is -14.78 degrees C
   (measured at 15 m depth, abbreviated T-15). A minimum temperature of
   -15.8 degrees C is measured at 173 m depth, and basal temperature is
   estimated to be -10.2 degrees C. Current mean annual temperature and the
   gradient in the lower part of the measured temperature profile have a
   best fit with an accumulation rate of 1.9x10(3) kg m(-2) a(-1) and basal
   heat flux (q) of 88 mW m(-2), if steady-state conditions are assumed.
   However, the mid-level temperature variations show that recent
   temperature has varied significantly. Reconstructed surface temperatures
   (T-s=T-15) over the last 200 yr are derived by an inversion technique
   (Tikhonov and Samarskii, 1990). From this, we find that cold
   temperatures (minimum T-s=-16.2 degrees C) prevailed from similar to
   1920 to similar to 1940, followed by a gradual rise of temperature to
   -14.2 degrees C around 1995, then cooling over the following decade and
   warming in the last few years. The coldest period was preceded by a
   relatively warm 19th century at T(15)a parts per thousand yen-15 degrees
   C. To facilitate regional comparisons of the surface temperature
   history, we use our T-15 data and nearby weather station records to
   refine estimates of lapse rates (altitudinal, adjusted for latitude:
   Gamma(a(l))). Good temporal and spatial consistency of Gamma(a(l)) over
   the last 35 yr are observed, implying that the climate trends observed
   here are regional and consistent over a broad altitude range.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{688-725}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we attempt to understand the success of algorithms that
   organize patches according to graph-based metrics. Algorithms that
   analyze patches extracted from images or time series have led to
   state-of-the art techniques for classification, denoising, and the study
   of nonlinear dynamics. The main contribution of this work is to provide
   a theoretical explanation for the above experimental observations. Our
   approach relies on a detailed analysis of the commute time metric on
   prototypical graph models that epitomize the geometry observed in
   general patch-graphs. We prove that a parametrization of the graph based
   on commute times shrinks the mutual distances between patches that
   correspond to rapid local changes in the signal, while the distances
   between patches that correspond to slow local changes expand. In effect,
   our results explain why the parametrization of the set of patches based
   on the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can concentrate patches that
   correspond to rapid local changes, which would otherwise be scattered in
   the space of patches. While our results are based on a large sample
   analysis, numerical experiments on synthetic and real data indicate that
   the results hold for datasets that are very small in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The design of an open-path 320 GHz - 340 GHz coherent transmissometer
   for experimental measurements of amplitude scintillation, phase
   scintillation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations, and transverse
   coherence near the 325.1529 GHz water absorption resonance is presented.
   The system uses a uni-directional transmitter and two phase-coherent
   receivers with adjustable transverse. The objective of the experiment is
   to verify and improve existing propagation models for use by designers
   of applied THz systems for remote sensing, radiolocation, or
   communications. System stability will be verified using a short range
   near-ground test path of several similar to 10's of meters length using
   a cable for locking the transmitter local oscillator (LO) to the
   receivers' LOs. This short range configuration, similar to tests
   conducted at Flatville, Illinois during the 1980s(1-3), permits
   characterization of system errors in all of the above parameters, thus
   yielding a baseline for the long range experiments. Characterization of
   the phase-coherent RF link will be studied vis-a-vis anticipated
   theoretical performance based on the Rytov approximation(4,5). The
   system will then be configured for long term open-path measurements on a
   1.78 km elevated link between the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU)
   and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
   (NTIA) Mesa site at the NOAA-NIST campus in Boulder, Colorado. The
   system will provide long range coherent THz propagation statistics
   during continuous long-duration study of turbulent atmospheric
   propagation effects over an extensive array of atmospheric conditions in
   a realistic operational environment.}},

Abstract = {{This article first reviews non-traditional heat exchanger geometry,
   laser welding, practical issues with microchannel heat exchangers, and
   high effectiveness heat exchangers. Existing microchannel heat
   exchangers have low material costs, but high manufacturing costs. This
   article presents a new expanded microchannel heat exchanger design and
   accompanying continuous manufacturing technique for potential low-cost
   production. Polymer heat exchangers have the potential for high
   effectiveness. This article discusses one possible joining method - a
   new type of laser welding named `forward conduction welding', used to
   fabricate the prototype. The expanded heat exchanger has the potential
   to have counter-flow, cross-flow, or parallel-flow configurations, be
   used for all types of fluids, and be made of polymers, metals, or
   polymer-ceramic precursors. The cost and ineffectiveness reduction may
   be an order of magnitude or more, saving a large fraction of primary
   energy. The measured effectiveness of the prototype with 28 mm thick
   black low-density polyethylene walls and counterflow, water-to-water
   heat transfer in 2 mm channels was 72 per cent, but multiple low-cost
   stages could realize the potential of higher effectiveness.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{7381-7392}},
Abstract = {{This work highlights the free- and fixed-strain shape-memory response of
   amorphous (meth) acrylate-based shape-memory polymers as the level of
   crosslinking is varied from uncrosslinked to highly crosslinked
   (corresponding to a decrease in failure strains and overall increase in
   rubbery moduli and failure stresses). The effect of long-term storage on
   the free-strain shape-memory response is also considered. Tensile
   deformation levels during the shape-memory cycle are 90\% of failure
   strain values to determine the full extent of free- and fixed-strain
   recovery behavior. All materials demonstrate full shape-recovery under
   free-strain conditions (material is unconstrained during recovery);
   however, total recoverable strains increase with decreasing crosslinking
   level, with uncrosslinked and lightly crosslinked materials recovering
   strains on the order of 3-10x that of moderately and highly crosslinked
   materials. In contrast, under fixed-strain conditions (material is fully
   constrained in the fixed shape during recovery), the magnitude of
   recovery stress generation increases with increasing crosslinking level,
   with highly crosslinked materials demonstrating recovery stress levels
   4-20x that of lightly crosslinked and uncrosslinked materials. The
   ability to produce recovery stresses on par with those reached during
   deformation also increases with crosslinking level. Stored-shape
   fixation and free-strain recovery levels remain stable after long-term
   storage in the deformed temporary state at 20 degrees C; however,
   recovery onset temperatures increase (by up to 9 degrees C) with storage
   time spanning similar to 1 year, as do rates of free-strain recovery (by
   up to 9x), due to physical aging. Results indicate that aging could
   potentially be used as a method for shape-memory response optimization.}},

Title = {{Performance evaluation of network airflow models for natural ventilation}},
Journal = {{HVAC\&R RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{349-365}},
Abstract = {{The potential for natural ventilation in building design to reduce
   associated building cooling and fan energy consumption makes it an area
   of great interest. However, its increased use is dependent on the
   availability of accurate modeling tools to predict its impact on a given
   building design. Network airflow models have been developed to predict
   airflows within buildings and between indoor and outdoor, which usually
   require user-supplied thermal conditions in a space. Because of the
   dependency between airflow and space temperature in naturally ventilated
   buildings, network airflow models need to be incorporated into whole
   building energy simulation models. This study reviews existing network
   models that may be used for natural ventilation design and investigates
   the capability and accuracy of four prevalent network airflow models to
   simulate a wide range of natural ventilation scenarios, with varying
   combinations of geometry and natural ventilation driving forces.
   Comparison of predictions with measurements obtained from literature
   shows that the tools are generally able to predict natural ventilation
   rates within 35\% except for the wind-driven single-sided ventilation
   case. The article indicates some significant needs for improvement of
   the network airflow model for natural ventilation applications.}},

Abstract = {{High throughput single molecule tracking methods were developed to

   characteristic dynamic behavior (residence time or surface diffusion)
   and/or their spatial distribution. Cumulative (i.e. integrated)
   probability distributions were found to be several orders of magnitude
   more sensitive to rare populations than were raw probability
   distributions. Mapping using Accumulated Probe Trajectories (MAPT) was
   used to characterize molecular populations associated with rare surface
   heterogeneities. Importantly, large sample sizes were found to result in
   a dramatic enhancement in the ability to identify rare populations and
   to resolve their dynamic and spatial parameters.}},

Title = {{Reducing overdispersion in stochastic weather generators using a
   generalized linear modeling approach}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-24}},
Abstract = {{Stochastic weather generators are commonly used to simulate time series
   of daily weather, especially minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax)
   temperature and amount of precipitation. Recently, generalized linear
   models (GLM) have been proposed as a convenient approach to fitting
   weather generators. One limitation of weather generators is a marked
   tendency to underestimate the observed interannual variance in monthly,
   seasonal, or annual total precipitation and mean temperature, termed the
   `overdispersion' phenomenon. In this study, aggregated statistics,
   consisting of seasonal total precipitation and mean Tmin and Tmax, are
   introduced as additional covariates into the GLM weather generator. With
   an appropriate degree of smoothing of these aggregated statistics, this
   approach is shown to virtually eliminate overdispersion when applied to
   2 sites, Pergamino and Pilar, in the Argentine Pampas. The addition of
   these covariates does not distort the performance of the weather
   generator in other respects, such as annual cycles in the probability of
   precipitation and in the mean Tmin and Tmax. For seasonal total
   precipitation, the reduction in overdispersion is partially attributable
   to a corresponding reduction in the overdispersion of the frequency of
   precipitation occurrence, as well as to apparent temporal trends or
   `regime' shifts. For seasonal mean Tmin and Tmax, the reduction in
   overdispersion is largely due to temporal trends on an interannual time
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{In designing a periodic acoustic metamaterial it is possible to have one
   or more of the constituent material phases to be damped (i.e.,
   lossy/dissipative), for example by using a viscoelastic material such as
   rubber. The presence of damping results in temporal attenuation of the
   acoustic/elastic waves as they freely propagate through space in the
   periodic media. In this work we develop Bloch wave propagation models
   for damped periodic acoustic metamaterials and study the effects of
   damping on the dispersion relation. We demonstrate several intriguing
   phenomena that get triggered due to the presence of inherent
   dissipation.}},

   transient momentum and energy equations. The nonlinear dynamics between
   the velocity and temperature fields are modeled by solving the coupled
   system of equations simultaneously, where the rate of convergence has
   been optimized so that computational cost remains proportional to the
   number of grid points. Numerical experiments have exhibited good

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{789-808}},
Abstract = {{The increased availability of radio occultation (RO) data offers the
   ability to detect and study turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. An
   analysis of how RO data can be used to determine the strength and
   location of turbulent regions is presented. This includes the derivation
   of a model for the power spectrum of the log-amplitude and phase
   fluctuations of the permittivity (or index of refraction) field. The
   bulk of the paper is then concerned with the estimation of the model
   parameters. Parameter estimators are introduced and some of their
   statistical properties are studied. These estimators are then applied to
   simulated log-amplitude RO signals. This includes the analysis of global
   statistics derived from a large number of realizations, as well as case
   studies that illustrate various specific aspects of the problem.
   Improvements to the basic estimation methods are discussed, and their
   beneficial properties are illustrated. The estimation techniques are
   then applied to real occultation data. Only two cases are presented, but
   they illustrate some of the salient features inherent in real data.}},

   in shape memory polymers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{5687-5695}},
Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers have attracted increasing research interest due to
   their capability of fixing a temporary shape and associated deformation
   energy then releasing them later on demand. Recently, it has been
   reported that polymers with a broad thermomechanical transition
   temperature range can demonstrate a multi-shape memory effect (m-SME),
   where shape recovery and energy release occur in a stepped manner during
   free recovery. This paper investigated the underlying physical
   mechanisms for these observed shape memory behaviors and the associated
   energy storage and release by using a theoretical modeling approach. A
   multibranch model, which is similar to the generalized standard linear
   solid model of viscoelasticity, was used for a quantitative analysis. In
   this model, individual nonequilibrium branches represent different
   relaxation modes of polymer chains with different relaxation times. As
   the temperature was increased in a staged manner, for a given
   temperature, different numbers of branches (or relaxation modes) became
   shape memory active or inactive, leading to the observed m-SME. For
   energy release during free recovery, under a tensile deformation of the
   SMP, stored energy in individual nonequilibrium branches was first
   transferred into a compressive deformation energy, then gradually
   declined to zero. Energy release during recovery was a complicated
   process due to the involvement of multiple relaxation modes.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{6000-6003}},
Abstract = {{We observe the diffusive trajectories of individual bovine serum albumin
   molecules at the oil-water interface over more than two orders of
   magnitude of oil viscosity. At low oil viscosities, the molecular
   mobility is dominated by the expected Stokes-Einstein mode of
   interfacial diffusion, where the effective diffusion coefficient is
   inversely proportional to both the protein hydrodynamic radius and the
   oil viscosity. However, for high viscosity oils, a different diffusive
   regime is observed, with anomalously large effective diffusion
   coefficients that are relatively insensitive to the oil viscosity and
   are similar to the measured diffusion coefficient of the same protein at
   a hydrophobic solid-liquid interface. We propose that in this regime of
   high oil viscosity, interfacial diffusion is dominated by
   desorption-mediated diffusion, which also dominates at many solid-liquid
   interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Using topology optimization, a photonic crystal (PtC) unit cell can be
   designed to exhibit favorable electromagnetic wave propagation
   properties. Among these is the opening of a band gap (BG) with the
   largest possible ratio of width to midgap frequency. In this paper the
   aim is to maximize the relative size of the first and fourth relative
   BGs of two-dimensional (2D) PtCs with a square lattice configuration. In
   addition, we examine the effects of the degree of unit cell symmetry on
   the relative BG size and on the geometric traits of the optimized
   topologies. We use a specialized genetic algorithm (GA) for our search.
   The results show that the type of symmetry constraint imposed has a
   significant, and rather subtle, effect on the unit cell topology and BG
   size of the emerging optimal designs. In pursuit of record values of BG
   size, we report two low-symmetry unit cells as an outcome of our search
   efforts to date: one with a relative BG size of 46\% for TE waves and
   the other with a relative BG size of 47\% for TM waves.}},

Abstract = {{We study the range of Poisson's ratio nu in the theory of isotropic
   linear elasticity. Using the ratio of the Lame constants chi =
   lambda/mu, we defined the parametrized Poisson's ratio as nu = nu(chi)
   and found that it represents a standard hyperbola with center (chi, nu)
   = (-1/3, 1/2) and eccentricity e = root 2. One of the focal points of
   the hyperbola represents a Born instability criterion (or the equivalent
   strong ellipticity condition) and the other determines the sign of nu.
   The hyperbola has a vertex point in the admissible range of nu, and,
   hence, it naturally divides the range into the two subranges: -1 < nu <=
   (1 - root 2)/2 and (1 - root 2)/2 <= nu < 1/2. We also found that there
   are three equivalent formulas among the nine elastic-constant ratios
   chi(i) considered in this study. The geometric conjugate of Poisson's
   ratio, which is defined as nu{*} := 1 - nu, has also been proposed.}},

Abstract = {{We extend, via a reformulation in terms of Poisson brackets, the method
   developed previously (Rey et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 2009, 113, 8949)
   allowing analysis of the pathways of an excited molecule's ultrafast
   vibrational relaxation in terms of intramolecular and intermolecular
   contributions. In particular we show how to ascertain, through the
   computation of power and work, which portion of an initial excess
   molecular energy (e. g. vibrational) is transferred to various degrees
   of freedom (e. g. rotational, translational) of the excited molecule
   itself and its neighbors. The particular case of bend excess energy
   relaxation in pure water is treated in detail, completing the picture
   reported in the work cited above. It is shown explicitly, within a
   classical description, that almost all of the initial water bend
   excitation energy is transferred-either indirectly, via Fermi resonance
   centrifugal coupling to the bend-excited water's rotation, or directly
   via intermolecular coupling-to local water librations, only involving
   molecules in the first two hydration shells of the vibrationally excited
   water molecule. Finally, it is pointed out that the Poisson bracket
   formulation can also be applied to elucidate the microscopic character
   of solvation and rotational dynamics, and should prove useful in
   developing a quantum treatment for energy flow in condensed phases.}},

Abstract = {{An antenna formed by the union of a four-armed, reflective-backed spiral
   antenna with a top-fed quadrifilar helix, operating over the

   dual-layering scheme that allows the modal impedance of the four-armed
   spiral to be greatly reduced while maintaining the desirable
   self-complementary metallization. A reconfigurable end-loading scheme is
   also presented that allows the attachment of high power-handling
   resistive loads, which along with other design features enables the use
   of the antenna in high-power transmitting applications. Mode 1 VSWR less
   than 2.2 is maintained throughout the 0.35-2.6-GHz band. Respective
   cutoff and nominal gains of 0 and 7 dBiC with excellent pattern
   characteristics are demonstrated. Over 30 dB broadside

Abstract = {{A Coulomb structure is a cluster of free-flying satellites which
   maintains its shape through inter-vehicle electrostatic forces. These
   Coulomb forces are generated using on-board charge emission devices.
   This paper investigates the 1-D restricted motion of a 3-craft cluster.
   Two charge feedback strategies are discussed where the charge saturation
   limitation is considered. First a continuous formation shape feedback
   control strategy is presented. Next a saturated control strategy is
   developed to arrest any relative velocities of the Coulomb structure. If
   the structure can be brought to rest, then the continuous charge control
   can be engaged to achieve the desired virtual structure. The saturated
   feedback control is developed using Lyapunov's direct method and can
   control the separation rates between the satellites by changing the
   signs of the three saturated charge products. Implementable real-charge
   solutions are ensured through scaling the Lyapunov function rate. The
   control is shown to be Lyapunov stable. Because of the limitations of
   the control charge magnitudes, certain initial conditions will not lead
   to the desired zero relative motion rates. Conditions under which the
   relative motion of the Coulomb structure can be stabilized are analyzed
   through investigating the total energy of the system in the symmetric
   motion assumption. The general convergence areas are illustrated
   numerically in various state planes. Simulations demonstrate the
   performance of the control.}},

Abstract = {{Point spread function engineering with a double helix (DH) phase mask
   has been recently used in a joint computational-optical approach for the
   determination of depth and intensity information from fluorescence
   images. In this study, theoretically determined DH-PSFs computed from a
   model that incorporates different amounts of depth-induced spherical
   aberration (SA) due to refractive-index mismatch in the
   three-dimensional imaging layers, are evaluated through a comparison to
   empirically determined DH-PSFs measured from quantum dots. The
   theoretically-determined DH-PSFs show a trend that captures the main
   effects observed in the empirically-determined DH-PSFs. Calibration
   curves computed from these DH-PSFs show that SA slows down the rate of
   rotation observed in a DH-PSF which results in: 1) an extended range of
   rotation; and 2) asymmetric rotation ranges as the focus is moved in
   opposite directions. Thus, for accurate particle localization different
   calibration curves need to be known for different amounts of SA. Results
   also show that the DH-PSF is less sensitive to SA than the conventional
   PSF. Based on this result, it is expected that fewer depth-variant (DV)
   DH-PSFs will be required for 3D computational microscopy imaging in the
   presence of SA compared to the required number of conventional DV PSFs.}},

Abstract = {{A phase shifting differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope,
   which provides quantitative phase information and is capable of imaging
   at video rates, has been constructed. Using a combination of phase
   shifting and bi-directional shear, the microscope captures a series of
   eight images which are then integrated in Fourier space. In the
   resultant image the intensity profile linearly maps to the phase
   differential across the object. The necessary operations are performed
   by various liquid crystal devices (LCDs) which can operate at high
   speeds. A set of four liquid crystal prisms shear the beam in both the x
   and y directions. A liquid crystal bias cell delays the phase between
   the e- and o-beams providing phase-shifted images. The liquid crystal
   devices are then synchronized with a CCD camera in order to provide
   real-time image acquisition. Previous implementation of this microscope
   utilized Nomarski prisms, a rotation stage and a manually operated
   Senarmont compensator to perform the necessary operations and was only
   capable of fixed sample imaging. In the present work, a series of images
   were taken using both the new LCD prism based microscope and the
   previously implemented Senarmont compensator based system. A comparison
   between these images shows that the new system achieves equal and in
   some cases superior results to that of the old system with the added
   benefit of real-time imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Lipid-coated microbubbles are being developed for a variety of
   biomedical applications in imaging and therapy. In order to better
   understand microbubble stability and in vivo fate, it is important to
   elucidate the mechanical properties of the phospholipid monolayer shell.
   Here, a gas exchange method was used to probe the monolayer dilatational
   properties of individual microbubbles. The microbubbles were observed to
   grow and then dissolve back to the initial diameter in a manner that
   depended on both microbubble size and lipid composition. The
   experimental diameter-time curves were analyzed with a gas transport
   model employing the energy barrier theory for monolayer permeation to
   account for gas species, acyl-chain length and variable surface
   pressure. Model analysis allowed computation of apparent surface tension
   as a function of area, which exhibited a characteristic
   ``flag-shaped{''} curve comprising three regimes: (i) linear elastic
   expansion, (ii) nonlinear relaxation during expansion and (iii) linear
   elastic compression. A comparison of fitted model parameters suggested a
   molecular mechanism involving expansion, rupture and lipid lateral
   diffusion in the monolayer shell during growth and lipid domain growth
   and packing during dissolution. Overall, these results provide new
   physical insights into lipid monolayer behavior that are relevant to
   understanding microbubble stability and medical performance.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the effect of the Abel inversion on the wave number 4 (WN4)

   an imposed WN4 structure in the F layer are investigated. It is found
   that the Abel inversion can reproduce the real WN4 structure well in the
   F2 layer. However, it will result in pseudo and reversed-phase WN4
   structure in the lower altitude (F1 and E layers). Quantitatively,
   relative +/-15\% WN4 signature in the F2 layer can produce +/-40\%
   artificial WN4 in the E and F1 layers. Analysis on the F-3/C data shows
   about +/-15\% WN4 signature in the F2 layer and +/-50\% WN4 with
   reversed-phase in the E and F1 layers. The F-3/C-observed WN4 structure
   in the E and F1 layers might be the combinations of the real WN4

   primary sequence may potentially affect its behavior, and changes in
   critical properties such as solubility {[}3], binding activity {[}4],
   dynamics {[}5] and assembly {[}6]. In this issue of Biotechnology

Title = {{Surfactant-DNA interactions at the liquid crystal-aqueous interface}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{4335-4342}},
Abstract = {{The presence of single-stranded (ssDNA) vs. double-stranded (dsDNA) DNA
   at a surfactant-laden aqueous-nematic liquid crystal (LC) interface
   results in distinctly different orientations of the LC molecular axis;
   this is of practical interest as a method to detect DNA hybridization.
   Results presented here provide new insights into the molecular-level
   mechanisms of these phenomena. The adsorption of ssDNA to a cationic
   surfactant-laden aqueous-LC interface caused LC reorientation, leading
   to coexistence between homeotropic and planar (birefringent) oriented
   regions. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that ssDNA preferentially
   partitioned into the birefingent regions, presumably causing a decreased
   surface coverage of surfactant and the resultant planar LC orientation.
   Both electrostatic and hydrophobic effects were found to be critical to
   inducing LC reorientation. In particular, insufficient ssDNA adsorption
   occurred in the absence of a cationic surfactant (e. g. with no
   surfactant or with a non-ionic surfactant), demonstrating the importance
   of electrostatic interactions with the polyanionic ssDNA. Even in the
   presence of a cationic surfactant, however, polyanions without
   hydrophobic side-group moieties (poly{[} acrylic acid] and dsDNA) caused
   no LC reorientation, while polyanions with hydrophobic side groups
   (polystyrene sulfonate and ssDNA) initiated the desired LC
   reorientation. These observations are consistent with the fact that
   interfacial hybridization of adsorbed probe ssDNA to complementary
   target ssDNA caused a reorientation from planar back to homeotropic. We
   propose that ssDNA forms an electrostatic interfacial complex with
   cationic surfactant where the hydrophobic nucleobases associate directly
   with the LC phase, effectively competing with surfactant molecules for
   interfacial sites. Upon hybridization, the hydrophobic character of the
   ssDNA is lost and the nucleobases no longer associate directly with the
   LC phase, allowing the surfactant molecules to pack more closely at the
   interface.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{We simulated elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols in
   China and compared model results to surface measurements at Chinese
   rural and background sites, with the goal of deriving `top-down'
   emission estimates of EC and OC, as well as better quantifying the
   secondary sources of OC. We included in the model state-of-the-science
   Chinese `bottom-up' emission inventories for EC (1.92 TgC yr(-1)) and OC
   (3.95 TgC yr(-1)), as well as updated secondary OC formation pathways.
   The average simulated annual mean EC concentration at rural and
   background sites was 1.1 mu gC m(-3), 56\% lower than the observed 2.5
   mu gC m(-3). The average simulated annual mean OC concentration at rural
   and background sites was 3.4 mu gC m(-3), 76\% lower than the observed
   14 mu gC m(-3). Multiple regression to fit surface monthly mean EC
   observations at rural and background sites yielded the best estimate of
   Chinese EC source of 3.05 +/- 0.78 TgC yr(-1). Based on the top-down EC
   emission estimate and observed seasonal primary OC/EC ratios, we
   estimated Chinese OC emissions to be 6.67 +/- 1.30 TgC yr(-1). Using
   these top-down estimates, the simulated average annual mean EC
   concentration at rural and background sites was significantly improved
   to 1.9 mu gC m(-3). However, the model still significantly
   underestimated observed OC in all seasons (simulated average annual mean
   OC at rural and background sites was 5.4 mu gC m(-3)), with little skill
   in capturing the spatiotemporal variability. Secondary formation
   accounts for 21\% of Chinese annual mean surface OC in the model, with
   isoprene being the most important precursor. In summer, as high as 62\%
   of the observed surface OC may be due to secondary formation in eastern
   China. Our analysis points to four shortcomings in the current bottom-up
   inventories of Chinese carbonaceous aerosols: (1) the anthropogenic
   source is underestimated on a national scale, particularly for OC; (2)
   the spatiotemporal distributions of emissions are misrepresented; (3)
   there is a missing source in western China, likely associated with the
   use of biofuels or other low-quality fuels for heating; and (4) sources
   in fall are not well represented, either because the seasonal shifting
   of emissions and/or secondary formation are poorly captured or because
   specific fall emission events are missing. In addition, secondary
   production of OC in China is severely underestimated. More regional
   measurements with better spatiotemporal coverage are needed to resolve
   these shortcomings.}},

Abstract = {{We validate satellite methane observations from the Tropospheric
   Emission Spectrometer (TES) with 151 aircraft vertical profiles over the
   Pacific from the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observation (HIPPO) program. We
   find that a collocation window of +/- 750 km and +/- 24 h does not
   introduce significant error in comparing TES and aircraft profiles. We
   validate both the TES standard product (V004) and an experimental
   product with two pieces of information in the vertical (V005). We
   determine a V004 mean bias of 65.8 ppb and random instrument error of
   43.3 ppb. For V005 we determine a mean bias of 42.3 ppb and random
   instrument error of 26.5 ppb in the upper troposphere, and mean biases
   (random instrument errors) in the lower troposphere of 28.8 (28.7) and
   16.9 (28.9) ppb at high and low latitudes respectively. Even when V005
   cannot retrieve two pieces of information it still performs better than
   V004. An observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) with the
   GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) and its adjoint shows that TES
   V004 has only limited value for constraining methane sources. Our
   successful validation of V005 encourages its production as a standard
   retrieval to replace V004.}},

Title = {{The influence of boreal biomass burning emissions on the distribution of

Abstract = {{We have analysed the sensitivity of the tropospheric ozone distribution
   over North America and the North Atlantic to boreal biomass burning
   emissions during the summer of 2010 using the GEOS-Chem 3-D global
   tropospheric chemical transport model and observations from in situ and
   satellite instruments. We show that the model ozone distribution is
   consistent with observations from the Pico Mountain Observatory in the
   Azores, ozonesondes across Canada, and the Tropospheric Emission
   Spectrometer (TES) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI)
   satellite instruments. Mean biases between the model and observed ozone
   mixing ratio in the free troposphere were less than 10 ppbv. We used the
   adjoint of GEOS-Chemto show the model ozone distribution in the free
   troposphere over Maritime Canada is largely sensitive to NOx emissions
   from biomass burning sources in Central Canada, lightning sources in the
   central US, and anthropogenic sources in the eastern US and southeastern
   Canada. We also used the adjoint of GEOS-Chem to evaluate the Fire
   Locating And Monitoring of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) inventory through
   assimilation of CO observations from the Measurements Of Pollution In
   The Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument. The CO inversion showed
   that, on average, the FLAMBE emissions needed to be reduced to 89\% of
   their original values, with scaling factors ranging from 12\% to 102 \%,
   to fit the MOPITT observations in the boreal regions. Applying the CO
   scaling factors to all species emitted from boreal biomass burning
   sources led to a decrease of the model tropospheric distributions of CO,
   PAN, and NOx by as much as -20 ppbv, -50 pptv, and -20 pptv
   respectively. The modification of the biomass burning emission estimates
   reduced the model ozone distribution by approximately -3 ppbv (-8\%) and
   on average improved the agreement of the model ozone distribution
   compared to the observations throughout the free troposphere, reducing
   the mean model bias from 5.5 to 4.0 ppbv for the Pico Mountain
   Observatory, 3.0 to 0.9 ppbv for ozonesondes, 2.0 to 0.9 ppbv for TES,
   and 2.8 to 1.4 ppbv for IASI.}},

Abstract = {{Although anti-angiogenic agents have shown promise as cancer
   therapeutics, their efficacy varies between tumor types and individual
   patients. Providing patient-specific metrics through rapid noninvasive
   imaging can help tailor drug treatment by optimizing dosages, timing of
   drug cycles, and duration of therapy-thereby reducing toxicity and cost
   and improving patient outcome. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a
   noninvasive three-dimensional imaging modality that has been shown to
   capture physiologic changes in tumors through visualization of
   oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin concentrations, using
   non-ionizing radiation with near-infrared light. We employed a small
   animal model to ascertain if tumor response to bevacizumab (BV), an
   anti-angiogenic agent that targets vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF), could be detected at early time points using DOT. We detected a
   significant decrease in total hemoglobin levels as soon as one day after
   BV treatment in responder xenograft tumors (SK-NEP-1), but not in
   SK-NEP-1 control tumors or in non-responder control or BV-treated NGP
   tumors. These results are confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging T2
   relaxometry and lectin perfusion studies. Noninvasive DOT imaging may
   allow for earlier and more effective control of anti-angiogenic therapy.

Abstract = {{This paper examines the process of design and engineering in large-scale
   construction projects delivered by multinational organizations. The
   analysis is on the basis of using transaction cost economics to
   represent design and engineering as a stream of intra-firm transactions
   between the local contracting office and the network of subsidiary
   offices. The paper then applies the concept of asset specificity to
   process-level design and engineering knowledge and induces a theoretical
   framework on the basis of local and expertise specificity of assets. The
   framework posits that different levels of local and expertise
   specificity lead to different modes for intra-firm governance of work
   packages in design and engineering. The paper validates the theoretical
   framework with interview data from six major international design and
   engineering organizations and derives a set of management
   recommendations for practitioners. The framework takes the transaction
   cost theory into the realm of intra-firm governance represented as a
   stream of asset-specific transactions. The framework extends
   construction engineering and management literature with a
   transaction-based elaboration of the design and engineering process.

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the fitting of ray-tracing results to
   closed-form expressions. We focus on the variation of the delay with
   elevation angle and azimuth. For the elevation angle-dependence we
   compare the continued fraction form of Yan and Ping (Astron J 110(2):
   934-993, 1995) with that of Marini (Radio 11 Sci 7(2): 223-231, 1972)
   (normalized to yield unity at zenith and found negligible differences
   between the two functional formulations for the hydrostatic case, while
   for the non-hydrostatic case, the Yan and Ping model performed
   marginally better. Since the ray-tracing results do not necessarily
   assume azimuthal symmetry, we have to account for the
   azimuth-dependence. For that we compare the linear gradient model of
   Davis et al. (Radio Sci 28(6): 1003-1018, 1993) with the inclusion of
   second order terms (Seko et al., J Meteorol Soc Jpn 82 (1B): 339-350,
   2004) and arbitrary spherical harmonics. These functional forms
   performed very well for the hydrostatic case, although for the
   non-hydrostatic case there were some large biases, particularly in the
   spherical harmonics of order 1, degree 1 and the 2nd order polynomial
   case.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of wastewater derived effluent organic matter (EfOM) on the
   decomposition of ozone and formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO center
   dot) was evaluated for four wastewaters (sites A, B, C1 and C2). The
   reactivity of EfOM was assessed by fractionation into four apparent
   molecular weight (AMW) fractions (<10 kDa, <5 kDa, <3 kDa, and <1 kDa).
   The R-CT, defined as the ratio of HO center dot exposure to ozone
   exposure (integral HO(center dot)dt / integral O(3)dt), was measured for
   all fractions and bulk waters (at times greater than 5 seconds), with an
   initial ozone dose equal to the total carbon concentration of EfOM
   (ozone:DOC ratio of 1). The R-CT of all the samples and ozone
   first-order decay rates of two of the waters increased significantly
   (95\% confidence) from the bulk sample to the <10 kDa fraction, and
   decreased with AMW. This indicates that the intrinsic capacity of
   different molecular weight fractions of the EfOM have different
   reactivity with ozone.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An internal heater capable of 1400 K has been developed for use with a
   gas piston cylinder apparatus capable of achieving in excess of 3 GPa
   with an argon pressure medium. The heated gas piston cylinder produces a
   truly hydrostatic environment for samples up to 3 mm in diameter and 8
   mm in length. The apparatus can be used to study systems that are
   sensitive to stress or samples that cannot withstand shear tractions.
   The gas piston cylinder apparatus was developed in an effort to reduce
   experimental uncertainty in the pressure scale and has been used to

Abstract = {{Ice velocities observed in 2005/06 at three GPS stations along the
   Sermeq Avannarleq flowline, West Greenland, are used to characterize an
   observed annual velocity cycle. We attempt to reproduce this annual ice
   velocity cycle using a 1-D ice-flow model with longitudinal stresses
   coupled to a 1-D hydrology model that governs an empirical basal sliding
   rule. Seasonal basal sliding velocity is parameterized as a perturbation
   of prescribed winter sliding velocity that is proportional to the rate
   of change of glacier water storage. The coupled model reproduces the
   broad features of the annual basal sliding cycle observed along this
   flowline, namely a summer speed-up event followed by a fall slowdown
   event. We also evaluate the hypothesis that the observed annual velocity
   cycle is due to the annual calving cycle at the terminus. We demonstrate
   that the ice acceleration due to a catastrophic calving event takes an
   order of magnitude longer to reach CU/ETH ('Swiss') Camp (46 km upstream
   of the terminus) than is observed. The seasonal acceleration observed at
   Swiss Camp is therefore unlikely to be the result of velocity
   perturbations propagated upstream via longitudinal coupling. Instead we
   interpret this velocity cycle to reflect the local history of glacier
   water balance.}},

Title = {{Flash-Sinterforging of Nanograin Zirconia: Field Assisted Sintering and

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We report on the influence of a uniaxial applied stress on
   flash-sintering and field assisted superplastic behavior of cylindrical
   powder preforms of 3 similar to mol\% tetragonal-stabilized zirconia.
   The experiments use the sinterforging method, where, in addition to
   pressure, a dc electrical field is applied by metal electrodes
   sandwiched between the push-rods and the specimen. The axial and radial
   strains in the experiment provide simultaneous measurement of the
   time-dependent densification and shear strains. Large effects of the
   electric field on sintering and superplasticity are observed. We see
   flash-sintering which is characterized by a threshold level of
   temperature and electric field. With higher applied fields, the sample
   sinters at a lower furnace temperature. Surprisingly, the applied stress
   further lowers this critical temperature: a sample, which sinters at 915
   degrees C under a stress of 1.5 similar to MPa, densifies at only 850
   degrees C when the stress is raised to 12 similar to MPa. This stress
   induced reduction in sintering temperature maybe related to the
   additional electrical fields generated within the specimen by the
   electro-chemo-mechanical mechanism described by Pannikkat and Raj
   {[}Acta Mater., 47 (1999) 3423]. Remarkably, we also show that the
   sample deforms in pure shear to 30\% strain in just a few seconds at
   anomalously low temperatures. The specimen temperature was measured with
   a pyrometer, during the flash sintering, as a check on Joule heating. A
   reading of 1000 degrees C1100 degrees C was obtained, up to 200 degrees
   above the furnace temperature. This temperature is still too low to
   explain the sintering in just a few seconds. It is suggested that the
   electric field can nucleate a defect avalanche that enhances diffusion
   kinetics not by changing the activation energy but by increasing the
   pre-exponential factor for the diffusion coefficient, noting that the
   pre-exponential factor depends on concentration of defects, and not upon
   their mobility.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1307-1325}},
Abstract = {{Tropical tropospheric ozone affects Earth's radiative forcing and the
   oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. Considerable work has been devoted
   to the study of the processes controlling its budget. Yet, large
   discrepancies between simulated and observed tropical tropospheric ozone
   remain. Here, we characterize some of the mechanisms by which the
   photochemistry of isoprene impacts the budget of tropical ozone. At the
   regional scale, we use forward sensitivity simulation to explore the
   sensitivity to the representation of isoprene nitrates. We find that
   isoprene nitrates can account for up to 70\% of the local NOx = NO + NO2
   sink. The resulting modulation of ozone can be well characterized by
   their net modulation of NOx. We use adjoint sensitivity simulations to
   demonstrate that the oxidation of isoprene can affect ozone outside of
   continental regions through the transport of NOx over near-shore regions
   (e.g., South Atlantic) and the oxidation of isoprene outside of the
   boundary layer far from its emissions regions. The latter mechanism is
   promoted by the simulated low boundary-layer oxidative conditions. In
   our simulation, similar to 20\% of the isoprene is oxidized above the
   boundary layer in the tropics. Changes in the interplay between regional
   and global effect are discussed in light of the forecasted increase in
   anthropogenic emissions in tropical regions.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{A differential evolutionary algorithm has been executed to optimize the
   hypersonic aerodynamic and stagnation. point heat transfer performance
   of Earth-entry heat shields for manned and unmanned missions. Objective
   functions comprise maximizing cross range, minimizing heat flux, and
   minimizing heat load. Each considered heat. shield geometry is composed
   of an axial profile tailored to fit a base cross section. Axial profiles
   consist of spherical segments, spherically blunted cones, and power law
   geometries. Heat-shield cross sections include oblate and prolate
   ellipses, rounded-edge parallelograms, and blendings of the two.
   Aerothermodynamic models are based on modified Newtonian impact theory
   with semiempirical correlations for convection and radiation. Entry
   velocities of 11 and 15 km/s are used to simulate atmospheric entry
   conditions at lunar and Mars return conditions, respectively. Results
   indicate that skip trajectories allow for vehicles with a low
   lift-to-drag ratio of 0.25 to achieve 1000 km cross range, a factor of 4
   increase in capability over direct entry. For 11 km/s entry with a 6g
   deceleration limit, the spherical segment provides optimal performance.
   For 15 km/s entry with a 12g deceleration limit, the spherically blunted
   cone produces an 8\% lower heat flux when compared with spherical
   segments with similar aerodynamic characteristics. This result is
   attributed to the blunted cone's smaller shock standoff, which reduces
   the heat load generated by thermal radiation, the dominant heat transfer
   mode.}},

Abstract = {{A nano-scaled coating of titanium oxide (TiO2) on graphene (G) has been

   grown using 50 and 100 ALD cycles, respectively. The nearly identical
   Nyquist plots of the TiO2-G composites compared with those of pure
   graphene demonstrated that the composites possess excellent conductivity
   for charge transfer and open structures for ion diffusion. In addition,
   even with 3-4 times additional mass loading (maximum 3.22 mg/cm(2)), the
   composites exhibit no obvious degradation with respect to the

Abstract = {{While the surface of Tibet is undergoing pervasive pure shear, stable
   terranes, straddling subsurface sutures, remain in the sub-continental
   lithospheric mantle (SCLM), attesting to its strength. Furthermore,
   sub-horizontal, cohesive remnant of Indian SCLM is traced northward from
   the Himalayan deformation front for about 600 km, exemplifying the
   longevity of buoyant, strong SCLM of Archean shields. Bimodal
   distribution of earthquake depths, with peaks concentrating in the
   upper/middle crust and near the Moho, has been a longstanding evidence
   for strong SCLM. Recent results from the Himalayas-Tibet and along the
   East African rift system not only corroborate the bimodal distribution
   but also firmly established that large earthquakes occur below the Moho.
   Intriguingly, non-volcanic tremors-newly discovered mode of elastic
   strain release-also occur near the Moho but well below the seismogenic
   zone in the upper/middle crust. Considering recent field observations
   and laboratory experiments of viscosity contrast across the Moho, the
   SCLM must be strong enough to accumulate elastic strain, a prerequisite
   for earthquakes, over geological time. Moreover, under laboratory
   conditions, recent advances that link the termination of frictional
   instability, an analogue for earthquakes, and the onset of crystal
   plasticity, provided a physical basis for limiting temperatures of
   crustal (similar to 300-400 degrees C) and mantle (similar to 600-700
   degrees C) earthquakes. While any single theological model cannot
   possibly account for all tectonic settings (which also evolve with
   time), lithological contrast across the Moho is important in shaping the
   bimodal distribution of strength in the continental lithosphere. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of
   using phase-change materials (PCMs) in portland cement concrete. The
   objective of this study is to improve the thermal properties of concrete
   as a structural material. A compression test, flexural test, drying
   shrinkage test and thermal conductivity test were conducted. PCMs are
   used in concrete mixtures as both sand replacement and additives. The
   results revealed that in the replacement method, the loss of compressive
   strength due to the addition of PCM is not as high as the additive
   method. For up to 20\% sand replacement by PCM, the strength loss is not
   significant for structural applications. The specific heat of the
   concrete increased considerably. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the
   concrete is reduced and the insulation capacity of the concrete is
   improved. A flexural test, drying shrinkage test, and microstructure
   analysis provide a good understanding of the PCM-modified concrete.
   Overall, the results show that it is quite promising to use PCM in
   concrete to improve its insulation capacity with decreased thermal
   conductivity and, at the same time, that it is possible to keep the
   strength loss of the concrete in an acceptable range.}},

Abstract = {{During the second Texas Air Quality Study 2006 (TexAQS II), a full range
   of pollutants was measured by aircraft in eastern Texas during
   successive transects of power plant plumes (PPPs). A regional
   photochemical model is applied to simulate the physical and chemical
   evolution of the plumes. The observations reveal that SO2 and NOy were
   rapidly removed from PPPs on a cloudy day but not on the cloud-free
   days, indicating efficient aqueous processing of these compounds in
   clouds. The model reasonably represents observed NOx oxidation and PAN
   formation in the plumes, but fails to capture the rapid loss of SO2
   (0.37 h(-1)) and NOy (0.24 h(-1)) in some plumes on the cloudy day.
   Adjustments to the cloud liquid water content (QC) and the default metal
   concentrations in the cloud module could explain some of the SO2 loss.
   However, NOy in the model was insensitive to QC. These findings
   highlight cloud processing as a major challenge to atmospheric models.
   Model-based estimates of ozone production efficiency (OPE) in PPPs are
   20-50\% lower than observation-based estimates for the cloudy day.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{527-543}},
Abstract = {{We present the development of ANISORROPIA, the discrete adjoint of the
   ISORROPIA thermodynamic equilibrium model that treats the
   Na+-SO42--HSO4--NH4+-NO3--Cl--H2O aerosol system, and we demonstrate its
   sensitivity analysis capabilities. ANISORROPIA calculates sensitivities
   of an inorganic species in aerosol or gas phase with respect to the
   total concentrations of each species present with less than a two-fold
   increase in computational time over the concentration calculations. Due
   to the highly nonlinear and discontinuous solution surface of ISORROPIA,
   evaluation of the adjoint required a new, complex-variable version of
   the model, which determines first-order sensitivities with machine
   precision and avoids cancellation errors arising from finite difference
   calculations. The adjoint is verified over an atmospherically relevant
   range of concentrations, temperature, and relative humidity. We apply
   ANISORROPIA to recent field campaign results from Atlanta, GA, USA, and
   Mexico City, Mexico, to characterize the inorganic aerosol sensitivities
   of these distinct urban air masses. The variability in the relationship
   between fine mode inorganic aerosol mass and precursor concentrations
   shown has important implications for air quality and climate.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregates play a major role in the immunogenicity of recombinant human
   interferon beta (rhIFN beta), a protein used to treat multiple
   sclerosis. A possible cause of aggregation is interaction between
   therapeutic protein and surfaces encountered during processing, storage,
   and administration. Moreover, proteins may adsorb to particles shed from
   these surfaces. In this work, we studied the immunogenicity of
   recombinant human interferon beta-1a (rhIFN beta-1a) interacting with
   glass microparticles, stainless steel microparticles, and polystyrene
   nanoparticles. At physiological pH, rhIFN beta-1a readily adsorbed to
   the particles, while the degree of adsorption was influenced by the
   ionic strength of the phosphate buffer. Front-face fluorescence showed
   that the tertiary structure of rhIFN beta-1a slightly changed upon
   adsorption to glass. The interaction with stainless steel microparticles
   resulted in increased levels of aggregates in the free protein fraction.
   Furthermore, protein adsorbed to stainless steel microparticles was more
   difficult to desorb than protein adsorbed to glass. Incubation with
   stainless steel considerably enhanced the immunogenicity of rhIFN
   beta-1a in transgenic mice immune tolerant for human interferon beta.
   The protein fraction adsorbed on stainless steel particles was
   responsible for this. In conclusion, rhIFN beta-1a adsorbs to common
   hydrophilic surface materials, possibly increasing the immunogenicity of
   the protein. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{The highly variable solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is the
   major energy input to the Earth's upper atmosphere, strongly impacting
   the geospace environment, affecting satellite operations,
   communications, and navigation. The Extreme ultraviolet Variability
   Experiment (EVE) onboard the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) will
   measure the solar EUV irradiance from 0.1 to 105 nm with unprecedented
   spectral resolution (0.1 nm), temporal cadence (ten seconds), and
   accuracy (20\%). EVE includes several irradiance instruments: The
   Multiple EUV Grating Spectrographs (MEGS)-A is a grazing-incidence
   spectrograph that measures the solar EUV irradiance in the 5 to 37 nm
   range with 0.1-nm resolution, and the MEGS-B is a normal-incidence,
   dual-pass spectrograph that measures the solar EUV irradiance in the 35
   to 105 nm range with 0.1-nm resolution. To provide MEGS in-flight
   calibration, the EUV SpectroPhotometer (ESP) measures the solar EUV
   irradiance in broadbands between 0.1 and 39 nm, and a MEGS-Photometer
   measures the Sun's bright hydrogen emission at 121.6 nm. The EVE data
   products include a near real-time space-weather product (Level 0C),
   which provides the solar EUV irradiance in specific bands and also
   spectra in 0.1-nm intervals with a cadence of one minute and with a time
   delay of less than 15 minutes. The EVE higher-level products are Level 2
   with the solar EUV irradiance at higher time cadence (0.25 seconds for
   photometers and ten seconds for spectrographs) and Level 3 with averages
   of the solar irradiance over a day and over each one-hour period. The
   EVE team also plans to advance existing models of solar EUV irradiance
   and to operationally use the EVE measurements in models of Earth's
   ionosphere and thermosphere. Improved understanding of the evolution of
   solar flares and extending the various models to incorporate solar flare
   events are high priorities for the EVE team.}},

Title = {{An Analytical Model for a Piezoelectric Axially Driven Membrane
   Microcompressor for Optimum Scaled Down Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A new and comprehensive analytical model for membrane microcompressors
   driven axially by a single lead zirconium titanate (PZT) stack actuator
   that incorporates assembly variation errors is presented. The model can
   be used as a future design aid, to predict dynamic device performance as
   a function of error severity and as microcompressor dimensions are
   scaled down from the macro to micro scale. The major conclusion of this
   work is that since micro compressors can be made adjustable to achieve
   maximum compression ratio another factor besides assembly variation
   error reduces the achievable compression ratio. An analytical method to
   predict the maximum pressure to within similar to 5\% of that
   experimentally measured is developed. Also, a numerical method to
   predict the maximum pressure to within similar to 0.6\% of that
   experimentally measured is defined. Moreover, an analytical method to
   predict the compression ratio degradation factor as a function of
   assembly variation error for adjustable and fixed devices is presented.
   It is shown that compression ratio is a function of this single net
   error parameter, and that this function is scale invariant. The model
   also outputs membrane moments, vertical shear forces, and stresses
   throughout actuation cycles. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005329]}},

   deposition using a multiple slit gas source head}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Continuous atmospheric atomic layer deposition (ALD) is based on the
   separation of ALD reactants in space rather than in time. In this study,
   operating conditions for continuous atmospheric ALD were evaluated using
   a multiple slit gas source head. A test apparatus was constructed
   consisting of a gas source head that sits above a substrate that is
   driven by a programmable stepper motor. The gas source head was composed
   of a series of rectangular channels that spatially separate the ALD
   reactants. With Al(2)O(3) ALD as the model system, the trimethylaluminum
   (TMA) reactant channel was positioned in the center and the H(2)O
   reactant channels were located on both sides of the TMA channel. This
   design allowed for deposition of two Al(2)O(3) ALD cycles during one
   complete back-and-forth translation of the substrate. The gap spacing
   between the gas source head and substrate was fixed and controlled using
   micrometers. A series of experiments was conducted using He as a tag gas
   to determine operating conditions that prevent reactant cross diffusion.
   There was a wider range of suitable exhaust pumping speeds at a 30 mu m
   gap spacing than at a 100 mu m gap spacing. However, mechanical
   tolerances were not sufficient to allow back-and-forth translation of
   the substrate at a gap spacing of 30 mu m. For Al(2)O(3) ALD at a 100 mu
   m gap spacing, the best Al(2)O(3) film uniformity was achieved when
   there was a slight vacuum of similar to-5 Torr beneath the gas source
   head relative to ambient. A larger vacuum beneath the gas source head
   occurred if the pumping speed of the exhaust channel was higher relative
   to the N(2) supplied to the gas source head. These conditions produced a
   smaller footprint of Al(2)O(3) deposition resulting from an influx of
   N(2) from the higher pressure ambient. The gas source head had a higher
   pressure than ambient if the exhaust pumping speed was too low relative
   to the N(2) supply. Under these conditions, reactant gas leaked out the
   sides and formed Al(2)O(3) powder around the perimeter of the gas source
   head resulting from the chemical vapor deposition reaction of TMA with
   ambient moisture. A response surface model was generated to predict the
   dependence of the pressure beneath the gas source head relative to
   ambient on the various operating conditions. (C) 2012 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Ultrathin zinc alkoxide (zincone) hybrid polymer films were coated on
   large quantities of primary titania nanoparticles using molecular layer
   deposition (MLD) in a fluidized bed reactor. Diethyl zinc and ethylene
   glycol were used as reactants at a reaction temperature of 80 or 120
   degrees C. The composition and conformal zincone films were confirmed by
   x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and TEM, respectively. The growth rate
   was higher at a lower reaction temperature. Primary nanoparticles were
   coated individually despite their strong tendency to aggregate during
   fluidization. Porous zinc oxide was formed by the oxidation of the
   hybrid zincone films in air at 400 degrees C. The surface area of the
   porous film itself was similar to 40 m(2)/g for the MLD films after
   oxidation at 250 degrees C, and 31 m(2)/g for the films after oxidation
   at 400 degrees C. Methylene blue oxidation tests indicated that the
   zincone MLD film can reduce the photoactivity of TiO(2) particles, but
   the passivation effect of the aged zincone films decreased due to the
   decomposition of zincone in the presence of water at room temperature to
   form a more stable composite containing zinc. The passivation effect of
   the oxidized zincone films further decreased due to the nonuniformity of
   the zinc oxide films after crystallization during the oxidation process.

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique capable of producing
   ultrathin conformal films with atomic level control over thickness. A
   major drawback of ALD is its low deposition rate, making ALD less
   attractive for applications that require high throughput processing. An
   approach to overcome this drawback is spatial ALD, i.e., an ALD mode
   where the half-reactions are separated spatially instead of through the
   use of purge steps. This allows for high deposition rate and high
   throughput ALD without compromising the typical ALD assets. This paper
   gives a perspective of past and current developments in spatial ALD. The
   technology is discussed and the main players are identified.
   Furthermore, this overview highlights current as well as new
   applications for spatial ALD, with a focus on photovoltaics and flexible
   electronics. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Using enrichment culture, Rhizobium sp. strain GIN611 was isolated as
   having activity for deglycosylation of a ginsenoside, compound K (CK).
   The purified heterodimeric protein complex from Rhizobium sp. GIN611
   consisted of two subunits with molecular masses of 63.5 kDa and 17.5
   kDa. In the genome, the coding sequence for the small subunit was
   located right after the sequence for the large subunit, with one
   nucleotide overlapping. The large subunit showed CK oxidation activity,
   and the deglycosylation of compound K was performed via oxidation of
   ginsenoside glucose by glycoside oxidoreductase. Coexpression of the
   small subunit helped soluble expression of the large subunit in
   recombinant Escherichia coli. The purified large subunit also showed
   oxidation activity against other ginsenoside compounds, such as Rb1,
   Rb2, Rb3, Rc, F2, CK, Rh2, Re, F1, and the isoflavone daidzin, but at a
   much lower rate. When oxidized CK was extracted and incubated in
   phosphate buffer with or without enzyme, (S)-protopanaxadiol {[}PPD(S)]
   was detected in both cases, which suggests that deglycosylation of
   oxidized glucose is spontaneous.}},

Title = {{A large-scale benchmark study of existing algorithms for

Abstract = {{Recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technology have created
   new opportunities to probe the hidden world of microbes.
   Taxonomy-independent clustering of the 16S rRNA gene is usually the
   first step in analyzing microbial communities. Dozens of algorithms have
   been developed in the last decade, but a comprehensive benchmark study
   is lacking. Here, we survey algorithms currently used by
   microbiologists, and compare seven representative methods in a
   large-scale benchmark study that addresses several issues of concern. A
   new experimental protocol was developed that allows different algorithms
   to be compared using the same platform, and several criteria were
   introduced to facilitate a quantitative evaluation of the clustering
   performance of each algorithm. We found that existing methods vary
   widely in their outputs, and that inappropriate use of distance levels
   for taxonomic assignments likely resulted in substantial overestimates
   of biodiversity in many studies. The benchmark study identified our
   recently developed ESPRIT-Tree, a fast implementation of the average
   linkage-based hierarchical clustering algorithm, as one of the best
   algorithms available in terms of computational efficiency and clustering
   accuracy.}},
