Abstract = {{Doping semiconductors is an important step for their technological
   application. While doping bulk semiconductors can be easily achieved,
   incorporating dopants in semiconductor nanostructures has proven
   difficult. Here, we report a facile synthesis method for doping
   titanium-dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes that was enabled by a new
   electrochemical cell design. A variety of optical, electronic and
   magnetic dopants were incorporated into the hollow nanotubes, and from
   detailed studies it is shown that the doping level can be easily tuned
   from low to heavily-doped semiconductors. Using desired dopants
   electronic (p- or n-doped), optical (ultraviolet bandgap to infrared
   absorption in co-doped nanotubes), and magnetic (from paramagnetic to
   ferromagnetic) properties can be tailored, and these technologically
   important nanotubes can be useful for a variety of applications in
   photovoltaics, display technologies, photocatalysis, and spintronic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The current study has examined four cases of a central receiver
   concentrated solar power plant with thermal energy storage using the
   DELSOL3 and SOLERGY computer codes. The current state-of-the-art base
   case was compared with a theoretical high temperature case, which was
   based on the scaling of some input parameters and the estimation of
   other parameters based on performance targets from the Department of
   Energy SunShot Initiative. This comparison was done for both current and
   high temperature cases in two configurations: a surround field with an
   external cylindrical receiver and a north field with a single cavity
   receiver. The optical designs for all four cases were done using the
   DELSOL3 computer code; the results were then passed to the SOLERGY
   computer code, which uses historical typical meteorological year (TMY)
   data to estimate the plant performance over the course of one year of
   operation. Each of the four cases was sized to produce 100 MWe of gross
   electric power, have sensible liquid thermal storage capacity to
   generate electric power at full rated production level for 6 hours, and
   have a solar multiple of 1.8.
   There is a fairly dramatic difference between the design point and
   annual average performance. The largest differences are in the solar
   field and receiver subsystems, and also in energy losses due to the
   thermal energy storage being full to capacity. Another notable finding
   in the current study is the relatively small difference in annual
   average efficiencies between the Base and High Temperature cases. For
   both the Surround Field and North Field cases, the increase in annual
   solar to electric efficiency is < 2\%, despite an increase in thermal to
   electric conversion efficiency of over 8\%. The reasons for this include
   the increased thermal losses due to higher temperature operation and
   operational losses due to start-up and shut-down of plant sub-systems.
   Thermal energy storage can mitigate some of these losses by utilizing
   larger thermal energy storage to ensure that the electric power
   production system does not need to stop and re-start as often, but solar
   energy is inherently transient. Economic and cost considerations were
   not considered here, but will have a significant impact on solar thermal
   electric power production strategy and sizing. (C) 2013 D. Gill.

Abstract = {{Solid particle heat transfer and storage media have been shown to be
   able to operate at temperatures > 1000 degrees C in concentrated solar
   power (CSP) applications, much higher than the operational limit of 600
   degrees C for current state-of-the-art molten nitrate salt heat transfer
   fluid. Solid particles can be endothermically reduced by direct exposure
   to concentrated solar energy, thus absorbing and storing thermal energy
   beyond that possible with sensible heating alone. The particles can then
   be oxidized exothermically at a later time, releasing the stored
   chemical heat and effectively augmenting the thermal energy storage
   capacity of the solid particles. A mixed metal oxide spinel material
   that reduces in the temperature range of interest (1000-1200 degrees C)
   has been examined for applicability to this thermochemical energy
   storage concept. A description of this application, prospective
   materials, and details of the thermochemical cycle are presented. The
   heats of reduction and oxidation for the thermochemical cycle have been
   determined for various operating conditions to evaluate the amount of
   thermal energy that may be stored. Various possible implementations of
   this augmented storage concept are considered, and alternate means of
   controlling the thermochemical cycle are explored. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Particle shape and medium chirality are two key features recently used
   to control anisotropic colloidal self-assembly and dynamics in liquid
   crystals. Here, we study magnetically responsive gourd-shaped colloidal
   particles dispersed in cholesteric liquid crystals with periodicity
   comparable or smaller than the particle's dimensions. Using magnetic
   manipulation and optical tweezers, which allow one to position colloids
   near the confining walls, we measured the elastic repulsive interactions
   of these particles with confining surfaces and found that
   separation-dependent particle-wall interaction force is a non-monotonic
   function of separation and shows oscillatory behavior. We show that
   gourd-shaped particles in cholesterics reside not on a single
   sedimentation level, but on multiple long-lived metastable levels
   separated by a distance comparable to cholesteric periodicity. Finally,
   we demonstrate three-dimensional laser tweezers assisted assembly of
   gourd-shaped particles taking advantage of both orientational order and
   twist periodicity of cholesterics, potentially allowing new forms of
   orientationally and positionally ordered colloidal organization in these
   media.}},

Abstract = {{We present an evaluation of aircraft observations of the carbon and
   greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO using a direct-absorption pulsed
   quantum cascade laser spectrometer (QCLS) operated during the HIPPO and
   CalNex airborne experiments. The QCLS made continuous 1 Hz measurements
   with 1 sigma Allan precisions of 20, 0.5, 0.09, and 0.15 ppb for CO2,
   CH4, N2O, and CO, respectively, over > 500 flight hours on 79 research
   flights. The QCLS measurements are compared to two vacuum ultraviolet
   (VUV) CO instruments (CalNex and HIPPO), a cavity ring-down spectrometer
   (CRDS) measuring CO2 and CH4 (CalNex), two broadband non-dispersive
   infrared (NDIR) spectrometers measuring CO2 (HIPPO), two onboard gas
   chromatographs measuring a variety of chemical species including CH4,
   N2O, and CO (HIPPO), and various flask-based measurements of all four
   species. QCLS measurements are tied to NOAA and WMO standards using an
   in-flight calibration system, and mean differences when compared to NOAA
   CCG flask data over the 59 HIPPO research flights were 100, 1, 1, and 2
   ppb for CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO, respectively. The details of the
   end-to-end calibration procedures and the data quality assurance and
   quality control (QA/QC) are presented. Specifically, we discuss our
   practices for the traceability of standards given uncertainties in
   calibration cylinders, isotopic and surface effects for the long-lived
   greenhouse gas tracers, interpolation techniques for in-flight
   calibrations, and the effects of instrument linearity on retrieved mole

Abstract = {{Stauroneis pachycephala was described in 1881 from the Baakens River,
   Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Recently, it was found during surveys of
   the MacKenzie River (Victoria, Australia), the Florida Everglades (USA)
   and coastal marshes of Louisiana (USA). The morphology, ecology and
   geographic distribution of this species are described in this article.
   This naviculoid species is characterised by lanceolate valves with a
   gibbous centre, a sigmoid raphe, an axial area narrowing toward the
   valve ends, and capitate valve apices. The central area is a distinct
   stauros that is slightly widened near the valve margin. The raphe is
   straight and filiform, and the terminal raphe fissures are strongly
   deflected in opposite directions. Striae are fine and radiate in the
   middle of the valve, becoming parallel and eventually convergent toward
   the valve ends. The external surface of the valves and copulae is smooth
   and lacks ornamentation. We also examined the type material of S.
   pachycephala. Our observations show this species has morphological
   characteristics that fit within the genus Envekadea. Therefore, the
   transfer of S. pachycephala to Envekadea is proposed and a lectotype is
   designated.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of the miniature Versatile Aerosol Concentration
   Enrichment System (m-VACES; Geller et al., 2005) was investigated in
   laboratory and field studies using online instruments. Laboratory tests
   focused on the behavior of monodisperse ammonium sulfate (AS) or dioctyl
   sebacate (DOS) particles in the m-VACES measured with the aerodynamic
   particle sizer (APS) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The
   ambient measurements were conducted at an urban site in Helsinki,
   Finland, where the operation of the m-VACES was explored in conjunction
   with a Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) in addition to
   the SMPS. In laboratory tests, the growth of particles in water vapor
   produced a stable droplet size distribution independent of the original
   particle size. However, when the droplets were dried with the goal of
   measuring the original size distribution, a shift to larger particles
   was observed for small particle sizes (up to similar to 200 nm in
   mobility diameter). That growth was probably caused by watersoluble
   organic compounds absorbed on the water droplets from the gas phase, but
   not evaporated in the drying phase. In ambient measurements, a similar
   enrichment was observed for nitrate and sulfate in the m-VACES whereas
   the presence of acidic ambient particles affected the enrichment of
   ammonium. Gaseous ammonia was likely to be absorbed on acidic particles
   in the m-VACES, neutralizing the aerosol. For organics, the enrichment
   efficiency was comparable with sulfate and nitrate but a small positive
   artifact for hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing organic compounds was
   noticed. Ambient and concentrated organic aerosol (OA) was analyzed
   further with positive matrix factorization (PMF). A three-factor
   solution was chosen for both of the data sets but the factors were
   slightly different for the ambient and concentrated OA, however, the
   data set used for the PMF analysis was limited in size (3 days) and
   therefore had substantial uncertainty. Overall, the operation of the
   m-VACES was not found to lead to any severe sampling artifacts. The
   effect of acidity could be an issue in locations where the aerosol is
   acidic, however, in those cases the use of a denuder (which was not used
   in this study) is recommended. Further ambient tests are needed for the
   characterization of the m-VACES as the time period for the ambient
   measurements was only 5 days in this study. Especially for OA additional
   tests are important as the chemical properties of organics can differ
   widely depending on time and location.}},

Title = {{Tuning the surface microstructure and gradient properties of polymers
   with photopolymerizable polysiloxane-modified nanogels}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{55}},
Pages = {{28928-28936}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a series of photopolymerizable polysiloxane-modified
   nanogels for regulating the surface microstructure and gradient
   properties of polymers, which were synthesized by solution
   polymerization with different feed ratios of methacrylate-modified
   polysiloxane, urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and isobornyl methacrylate
   (IBMA) in the presence of a thiol chain transfer agent. The nanogel
   structures and compositions were characterized by proton nuclear
   magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gel permeation
   chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The
   dispersion of these nanogels in triethylene glycol dimethacrylate
   (TEGDMA) can delay the onset and reduce the magnitude of shrinkage
   stress during polymerization without compromising the mechanical
   properties of the resulting polymers. Most importantly, as demonstrated
   by elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the
   nanogels exhibit good self-floating ability in the monomer-polymer
   matrix and the increase in polysiloxane content in the nanogel can
   enhance the self-floating capability due to the lower surface tension
   and energy associated with the polysiloxane component. As a result, the
   polysiloxane-modified nanogels can spontaneously form a concentration
   gradient that can be locked in upon photopolymerization, leading to a
   well-controlled heterogeneous polymer that presents a gradient change in
   thermal stability. With the increase in polysiloxane content, the
   thermal stability of the polymer was improved significantly.
   Furthermore, the enrichment of the nanogel on the surface resulting from
   the good self-floating ability can reduce the dispersion surface energy
   of the gradient polymer film and generate a more hydrophobic surface
   with an altered surface microstructure. These photopolymerizable
   polysiloxane-modified nanogels are demonstrated to have potentially
   broad applications in the preparation of gradient polymers with
   controlled surface properties.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{67}},
Pages = {{115-126}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic ice-sheet models are used to assess the contribution of mass
   loss from the Greenland ice sheet to sea-level rise. Mass transfer from
   ice sheet to ocean is in a large part through outlet glaciers. Bed
   topography plays an important role in ice dynamics, since the
   acceleration from the slow-moving inland ice to an ice stream is in many
   cases caused by the existence of a subglacial trough or trough system.
   Problems are that most subglacial troughs are features of a scale not
   resolved in most ice-sheet models and that radar measurements of
   subglacial topography do not always reach the bottoms of narrow troughs.
   The trough-system algorithm introduced here employs mathematical
   morphology and algebraic topology to correctly represent subscale
   features in a topographic generalization, so the effects of troughs on
   ice flow are retained in ice-dynamic models. The algorithm is applied to
   derive a spatial elevation model of Greenland subglacial topography,
   integrating recently collected radar measurements (CReSIS data) of the
   Jakobshavn Isbrae, Helheim, Kangerdlussuaq and Petermann glacier
   regions. The resultant JakHelKanPet digital elevation model has been
   applied in dynamic ice-sheet modeling and sea-level-rise assessment.}},

   of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to
   meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance. The RGI
   was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given
   to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is
   attached to each of the similar to 198 000 glaciers in its latest
   version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999-2010 provided most of the
   outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 +/- 34 000 km(2).
   The uncertainty, about +/- 5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier
   and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories
   that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty
   are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover.
   These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them
   reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models,
   the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with
   atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of
   climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the
   generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass
   changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to
   sea-level rise.}},

Abstract = {{Crystalline silicon nanotubes (Si NTs) provide distinctive advantages as
   electrical and biochemical analysis scaffolds through their unique
   morphology and electrical tunability compared to solid nanowires or
   amorphous/non-conductive nanotubes. Such potential is investigated in
   this report. Gate-dependent four-probe current-voltage analysis reveals
   electrical properties such as resistivity to differ by nearly 3 orders
   of magnitude between crystalline and amorphous Si NTs. Analysis of
   transistor transfer characteristics yields a field effect mobility of
   40.0 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in crystalline Si NTs. The hollow morphology also
   allows selective inner/outer surface functionalization and loading
   capability either as a carrier for molecular targets or as a nanofluidic
   channel for biomolecular assays. We present for the first time a
   demonstration of internalization of fluorescent dyes (rhodamine) and
   biomolecules (BSA) in Si NTs as long as 22 mu m in length.}},

Title = {{Simulation of semi-explicit mechanisms of SOA formation from glyoxal in
   aerosol in a 3-D model}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{6213-6239}},
Abstract = {{New pathways to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA) have been
   postulated recently. Glyoxal, the smallest dicarbonyl, is one of the
   proposed precursors. It has both anthropogenic and biogenic sources, and
   readily partitions into the aqueous phase of cloud droplets and
   deliquesced particles where it undergoes both reversible and
   irreversible chemistry. In this work we extend the regional scale
   chemistry transport model WRF-Chem to include detailed gas-phase
   chemistry of glyoxal formation as well as a state-of-the-science module
   describing its partitioning and reactions in the aerosol aqueous-phase.
   A comparison of several proposed mechanisms is performed to quantify the
   relative importance of different formation pathways and their regional
   variability. The CARES/CalNex campaigns over California in summer 2010
   are used as case studies to evaluate the model against observations. A
   month-long simulation over the continental United States (US) enables us
   to extend our results to the continental scale.
   In all simulations over California, the Los Angeles (LA) basin was found
   to be the hot spot for SOA formation from glyoxal, which contributes
   between 1\% and 15\% of the model SOA depending on the mechanism used.
   Our results indicate that a mechanism based only on a reactive (surface
   limited) uptake coefficient leads to higher SOA yields from glyoxal
   compared to a more detailed description that considers aerosol phase
   state and chemical composition. In the more detailed simulations,
   surface uptake is found to give the highest SOA mass yields compared to
   a volume process and reversible formation. We find that the yields of
   the latter are limited by the availability of glyoxal in aerosol water,
   which is in turn controlled by an increase in the Henry's law constant
   depending on salt concentrations ('salting-in'). A time dependence in
   this increase prevents substantial partitioning of glyoxal into aerosol
   water at high salt concentrations. If this limitation is removed, volume
   pathways contribute > 20\% of glyoxal-SOA mass, and the total mass
   formed (5.8\% of total SOA in the LA basin) is about a third of the
   simple uptake coefficient formulation without consideration of aerosol
   phase state and composition. Results from the continental US simulation
   reveal the much larger potential to form glyoxal-SOA over the eastern
   continental US. Interestingly, the low concentrations of glyoxal-SOA
   over the western continental US are not due to the lack of a potential
   to form glyoxal-SOA here. Rather these small glyoxal-SOA concentrations
   reflect dry conditions and high salt concentrations, and the potential
   to form SOA mass here will strongly depend on the water associated with
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{Long-range transport of black carbon (BC) is a growing concern as a
   result of the efficiency of BC in warming the climate and its adverse
   impact on human health. We study transpacific transport of BC during
   HIPPO-3 using a combination of inverse modeling and sensitivity
   analysis. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and its adjoint
   to constrain Asian BC emissions and estimate the source of BC over the
   North Pacific. We find that different sources of BC dominate the
   transport to the North Pacific during the southbound (29 March 2010) and
   northbound (13 April 2010) measurements in HIPPO-3. While biomass
   burning in Southeast Asia (SE) contributes about 60\% of BC in March,
   more than 90\% of BC comes from fossil fuel and biofuel combustion in
   East Asia (EA) during the April mission. GEOS-Chem simulations generally
   resolve the spatial and temporal variation of BC concentrations over the
   North Pacific, but are unable to reproduce the low and high tails of the
   observed BC distribution. We find that the optimized BC emissions
   derived from inverse modeling fail to improve model simulations
   significantly. This failure indicates that uncertainties in BC removal
   as well as transport, rather than in emissions, account for the major
   biases in GEOS-Chem simulations of BC over the North Pacific.
   The aging process, transforming BC from hydrophobic into hydrophilic
   form, is one of the key factors controlling wet scavenging and remote
   concentrations of BC. Sensitivity tests on BC aging (ignoring
   uncertainties of other factors controlling BC long range transport)
   suggest that in order to fit HIPPO-3 observations, the aging timescale
   of anthropogenic BC from EA may be several hours (faster than assumed in
   most global models), while the aging process of biomass burning BC from
   SE may occur much slower, with a timescale of a few days. To evaluate
   the effects of BC aging and wet deposition on transpacific transport of
   BC, we develop an idealized model of BC transport. We find that the
   mid-latitude air masses sampled during HIPPO-3 may have experienced a
   series of precipitation events, particularly near the EA and SE source
   region. Transpacific transport of BC is sensitive to BC aging when the
   aging rate is fast; this sensitivity peaks when the aging timescale is
   in the range of 1-1.5 d. Our findings indicate that BC aging close to
   the source must be simulated accurately at a process level in order to
   simulate better the global abundance and climate forcing of BC.}},

Abstract = {{The Bio-hydro-atmosphere interactions of Energy, Aerosols, Carbon, H2O,
   Organics \& Nitrogen (BEACHON) project seeks to understand the feedbacks
   and inter-relationships between hydrology, biogenic emissions, carbon
   assimilation, aerosol properties, clouds and associated feedbacks within
   water-limited ecosystems. The Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory
   (MEFO) was established in 2008 by the National Center for Atmospheric
   Research to address many of the BEACHON research objectives, and it now
   provides a fixed field site with significant infrastructure. MEFO is a
   mountainous, semi-arid ponderosa pine-dominated forest site that is
   normally dominated by clean continental air but is periodically
   influenced by anthropogenic sources from Colorado Front Range cities.
   This article summarizes the past and ongoing research activities at the
   site, and highlights some of the significant findings that have resulted
   from these measurements. These activities include
   - soil property measurements;
   - hydrological studies;
   - measurements of high-frequency turbulence parameters;
   - eddy covariance flux measurements of water, energy, aerosols and
   carbon dioxide through the canopy;
   - determination of biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compound
   emissions and their influence on regional atmospheric chemistry;
   - aerosol number and mass distributions;
   - chemical speciation of aerosol particles;
   - characterization of ice and cloud condensation nuclei;
   - trace gas measurements; and
   - model simulations using coupled chemistry and meteorology.
   In addition to various long-term continuous measurements, three focused
   measurement campaigns with state-of-the-art instrumentation have taken
   place since the site was established, and two of these studies are the
   subjects of this special issue: BEACHON-ROCS (Rocky Mountain Organic
   Carbon Study, 2010) and BEACHON-RoMBAS (Rocky Mountain Biogenic Aerosol
   Study, 2011).}},

Abstract = {{The mixing of polymers and particles provides a new avenue for
   engineering composite materials that display advantageous magnetic,
   electrical, dialectical and mechanical properties. The mixing quality
   and the derived properties are highly determined and controlled by the
   rheological behavior of the composite materials during mixing. Here, we
   studied the shear rheology of a protocol system, the polyamide/ ferrite
   composites. The key findings of this study were that the apparent shear
   viscosity of polymer composites can be manipulated by the uptake of a
   trace amount of water (less than 0.3 wt\%). Compared to the traditional
   way of tuning the viscosity by adding either lubricants or thickeners,
   our findings presented here provided a reversible, simple, inexpensive
   and environmentally friendly way to control the rheology of polymer
   composites.}},

   a benchmark for defining a classic paper with a new application of the

   of environmental science with an example of ``citation classics{''}
   dealing with aquatic humic substances from a 50-year record and a field
   of >20,000 journal articles. We hypothesize that the h(j)-index may be
   readily calculated for any scientific paper, regardless of its age or
   field of activity, to gauge its past, present, or future citation-impact

   In this paper the authors list most of the existing EEM-PARAFAC
   applications in studies related to DOM dynamics in headwater streams,
   rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, coastal areas and the open ocean,

   HUmic-Like Substances (HULIS) and the low volatility/high molecular
   weight organic aerosol fraction, from the comprehensive 2006 review by
   Graber and Rudich of the similarities and differences between
   terrestrial/aquatic humic substances and HULIS, to new insights on the
   sources and formation, atmospheric distribution and climatic,
   ecological, and epidemiological influences of HULIS from more recent
   observations. HULIS are primarily formed through secondary oxidation of
   gaseous biogenic and anthropogenic precursors followed by
   oligomerization or polymerization reactions and atmospheric aging but
   can also be directly emitted e.g., from biomass burning smoke or
   airborne soil. These diverse processes and sources cause HULIS'
   physicochemical and optical characteristics to evolve over time and vary
   spatially, making conclusions about its climate forcing effects
   uncertain. Recent evidence shows that HULLS is present world-wide and in
   both fine and coarse aerosol size fractions and can impact water optical
   qualities and nutrient cycling in some ecosystems, form complexes with
   metals or organic pollutants, and generate reactive oxygen species,
   which can harm exposed cells. A brief review of mass spectrometric
   techniques that have been applied to study HULIS or have been recently
   developed but not yet extensively utilized is included, as are possible

   of interest due to their role in defining the reactivity of this

   The present study expands on previous works by evaluating both
   photophysical and photochemical processes of OM of distinct origins and
   molecular sizes through the analysis of absorbance and fluorescence
   along with the formation of various RIs of interest ((OM)-O-3, HO.,
   O-I(2)). In general, larger size fractions displayed higher absorptivity
   that extends further into the visible region. On the other hand, smaller
   components displayed higher quantum yields for fluorescence and all RIs
   measured. In accordance with hypotheses previously formulated, possible
   explanations for the observed results are proposed based on the
   increased prevalence of non-radiative energy decay processes in larger
   OM molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorine and chlorine dioxide react with source water organic matter to
   form halogenated organic matter (HOM), often termed organic disinfection
   byproducts (DBPs), some of which are characterized, e.g., the regulated
   trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), and others that can
   be assessed with the adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) measurement. The
   fate of HOM was addressed during alum coagulation of five natural
   waters. THMs and HAAs preformed in the raw waters were not removed by
   coagulation (< 9\%), while the uncharacterized ``AOX (AOX-U), calculated
   as the difference between AOX concentration and THMs and HAA
   concentrations, was removed by 55\% on average over all coagulant doses
   and 75\% at highest doses, with near complete AOX-U removal for three
   waters. Turbidity influenced the removal of AOX-U, where the most turbid
   waters demonstrated 100\% removal of AOX-U and one water spiked with
   kaolin at 100 mg/L also demonstrated a similar removal efficiency; 98\%.
   Once incorporated into the floc, AOX was found not to release back to
   the water. Once flocs formed, no removal of HOM occurred, indicating
   that sorption on aluminum hydroxide precipitate was not the AOX removal
   mechanism. The suggests that other removal mechanisms, such as
   co-precipitation and metal HUM complexation reactions, dominated,
   although they were not directly measured in this study. Chlorine was
   found to react directly with the flocs to produce 40\% of the THMs and
   HAAs formed during coagulation, but not to produce A0X-U. Use of
   chlorine dioxide produced less HOM, and formed TTHMs and HAAs were less
   than 10\% of the AOX-U. Coagulation only removed about 20\% of the
   AOX-U. No quantifiable levels of AOX were formed when chlorine dioxide
   reacted with flocs containing organic matter.}},

   revisited in this chapter using contemporary fluorescence methods to
   characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal. Different

   are compared and suggest that integrated data does not provide

   limitations of analyzing only fluorescence intensities are highlighted,
   because it is difficult to separate changes in DOM quantity, quality,
   and other interactions. While all methods captured the interactions
   between DOM and aluminum species before physical removal, quantum yields
   and fluorescence index (FI) offer more information regarding
   compositional changes. Finally, this study also provides evidence that

Abstract = {{Agriculture comprises a substantial, and increasing, fraction of land
   use in many regions of the world. Emissions from agricultural vegetation
   and other biogenic and anthropogenic sources react in the atmosphere to
   produce ozone and secondary organic aerosol, which comprises a
   substantial fraction of particulate matter (PM2.5). Using data from
   three measurement campaigns, we examine the magnitude and composition of
   reactive gas-phase organic carbon emissions from agricultural crops and
   their potential to impact regional air quality relative to anthropogenic
   emissions from motor vehicles in California's San Joaquin Valley, which
   is out of compliance with state and federal standards for tropospheric
   ozone PM2.5. Emission rates for a suite of terpenoid compounds were
   measured in a greenhouse for 25 representative crops from California in
   2008. Ambient measurements of terpenoids and other biogenic compounds in
   the volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compound ranges were
   made in the urban area of Bakersfield and over an orange orchard in a
   rural area of the San Joaquin Valley during two 2010 seasons: summer and
   spring flowering. We combined measurements from the orchard site with
   ozone modeling methods to assess the net effect of the orange trees on
   regional ozone. When accounting for both emissions of reactive
   precursors and the deposition of ozone to the orchard, the orange trees
   are a net source of ozone in the springtime during flowering, and
   relatively neutral for most of the summer until the fall, when it
   becomes a sink. Flowering was a major emission event and caused a large
   increase in emissions including a suite of compounds that had not been
   measured in the atmosphere before. Such biogenic emission events need to
   be better parameterized in models as they have significant potential to
   impact regional air quality since emissions increase by several factors
   to over an order of magnitude. In regions like the San Joaquin Valley,
   the mass of biogenic emissions from agricultural crops during the summer
   (without flowering) and the potential ozone and secondary organic
   aerosol formation from these emissions are on the same order as
   anthropogenic emissions from motor vehicles and must be considered in
   air quality models and secondary pollution control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed rarefied aerodynamics are usually not coupled with the
   rigid-body dynamics of spacecraft. In part because of computational
   constraints, simpler models based upon the ballistic and drag
   coefficients are employed. Presented is an approach that capitalizes on
   the availability of ever-increasing computational methods and resources.
   The feasibility of increasing the fidelity of modeling spacecraft
   dynamics is explored by coupling rarefied aerodynamics with a rigid-body
   dynamics model similar to that traditionally used for aircraft in
   atmospheric flight. Aerodynamic force inputs for an airfoil section in a
   rarefied flow are provided by analytical equations in the free-molecular
   regime, and the direct simulation Monte Carlo method in the transition
   regime. Examples of nonlinear dynamics that cannot be predicted using
   simpler approaches are presented. The results of this straightforward
   approach to the coupled-field problem highlight the possibilities for
   future improvements in drag prediction, control system design, and
   atmospheric science.}},

Abstract = {{Peak stratospheric chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and other ozone depleting
   substance (ODS) concentrations were reached in the mid- to late 1990s.
   Detection and attribution of the expected recovery of the stratospheric
   ozone layer in an atmosphere with reduced ODSs as well as efforts to
   understand the evolution of stratospheric ozone in the presence of
   increasing greenhouse gases are key current research topics. These
   require a critical examination of the ozone changes with an accurate
   knowledge of the spatial (geographical and vertical) and temporal ozone
   response. For such an examination, it is vital that the quality of the
   measurements used be as high as possible and measurement uncertainties
   well quantified.
   In preparation for the 2014 United Nations Environment Programme
   (UNEP)/World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Scientific Assessment of
   Ozone Depletion, the SPARC/IO3C/IGACO-O-3/NDACC ((SIN)-N-2) Initiative
   was designed to study and document changes in the global ozone profile
   distribution. This requires assessing long-term ozone profile data sets
   in regards to measurement stability and uncertainty characteristics. The
   ultimate goal is to establish suitability for estimating long-term ozone
   trends to contribute to ozone recovery studies. Some of the data sets
   have been improved as part of this initiative with updated versions now
   available.
   This summary presents an overview of stratospheric ozone profile
   measurement data sets (ground and satellite based) available for ozone
   recovery studies. Here we document measurement techniques, spatial and
   temporal coverage, vertical resolution, native units and measurement
   uncertainties. In addition, the latest data versions are briefly
   described (including data version updates as well as detailing multiple
   retrievals when available for a given satellite instrument). Archive
   location information for each data set is also given.}},

Abstract = {{To address the challenges associated with defined control over matrix
   properties in 3D cell culture systems, we employed a peptide
   functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel matrix in which
   mechanical modulus and adhesive properties were tuned. An HT-1080 human
   fibrosarcoma cell line was chosen as a model for probing matrix
   influences on tumor cell migration using the PEG hydrogel platform.
   HT-1080 speed varied with a complex dependence on both matrix modulus
   and Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (CRGDS) adhesion ligand concentration, with
   regimes in which motility increased, decreased, or was minimally altered
   being observed. We further investigated cell motility by forming matrix
   interfaces that mimic aspects of tissue boundaries that might be
   encountered during invasion by taking advantage of the spatial control
   of the thiol-ene photochemistry to form patterned regions of low and
   high cross-linking densities. HT-1080s in 100 Pa regions of patterned
   PEG hydrogels tended to reverse direction or aggregate at the interface
   when they encountered a 360 Pa boundary. In contrast, HT-1080s were
   apparently unimpeded when migrating from the stiff to the soft regions
   of PEG peptide hydrogels, which may indicate that cells are capable of
   ``reverse durotaxis{''} within at least some matrix regimes. Taken
   together, our results identified matrix regimes in which HT-1080
   motility was both positively and negatively influenced by cell adhesion
   or matrix modulus.}},

Title = {{Emissions of organic carbon and methane from petroleum and dairy
   operations in California's San Joaquin Valley}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{4955-4978}},
Abstract = {{Petroleum and dairy operations are prominent sources of gas-phase
   organic compounds in California's San Joaquin Valley. It is essential to
   understand the emissions and air quality impacts of these relatively
   understudied sources, especially for oil/gas operations in light of
   increasing US production. Ground site measurements in Bakersfield and
   regional aircraft measurements of reactive gas-phase organic compounds
   and methane were part of the CalNex (California Research at the Nexus of
   Air Quality and Climate Change) project to determine the sources
   contributing to regional gas-phase organic carbon emissions. Using a
   combination of near-source and downwind data, we assess the composition
   and magnitude of emissions, and provide average source profiles. To
   examine the spatial distribution of emissions in the San Joaquin Valley,
   we developed a statistical modeling method using ground-based data and
   the FLEXPART-WRF transport and meteorological model. We present evidence
   for large sources of paraffinic hydrocarbons from petroleum operations
   and oxygenated compounds from dairy (and other cattle) operations. In
   addition to the small straight-chain alkanes typically associated with
   petroleum operations, we observed a wide range of branched and cyclic
   alkanes, most of which have limited previous in situ measurements or
   characterization in petroleum operation emissions. Observed dairy
   emissions were dominated by ethanol, methanol, acetic acid, and methane.
   Dairy operations were responsible for the vast majority of methane
   emissions in the San Joaquin Valley; observations of methane were well
   correlated with non-vehicular ethanol, and multiple assessments of the
   spatial distribution of emissions in the San Joaquin Valley highlight
   the dominance of dairy operations for methane emissions. The petroleum
   operations source profile was developed using the composition of
   non-methane hydrocarbons in unrefined natural gas associated with crude
   oil. The observed source profile is consistent with fugitive emissions
   of condensate during storage or processing of associated gas following
   extraction and methane separation. Aircraft observations of
   concentration hotspots near oil wells and dairies are consistent with
   the statistical source footprint determined via our FLEXPART-WRF-based
   modeling method and ground-based data. We quantitatively compared our
   observations at Bakersfield to the California Air Resources Board
   emission inventory and find consistency for relative emission rates of
   reactive organic gases between the aforementioned sources and motor
   vehicles in the region. We estimate that petroleum and dairy operations
   each comprised 22\% of anthropogenic non-methane organic carbon at
   Bakersfield and were each responsible for 8-13\% of potential precursors
   to ozone. Yet, their direct impacts as potential secondary organic
   aerosol (SOA) precursors were estimated to be minor for the source
   profiles observed in the San Joaquin Valley.}},

Abstract = {{We present the spoked-ring microcavity, a nanophotonic building block
   enabling energy-efficient, active photonics in unmodified, advanced CMOS
   microelectronics processes. The cavity is realized in the IBM 45nm SOI
   CMOS process - the same process used to make many commercially available
   microprocessors including the IBM Power7 and Sony Playstation 3
   processors. In advanced SOI CMOS processes, no partial etch steps and no
   vertical junctions are available, which limits the types of optical
   cavities that can be used for active nanophotonics. To enable efficient
   active devices with no process modifications, we designed a novel
   spoked-ring microcavity which is fully compatible with the constraints
   of the process. As a modulator, the device leverages the sub-100nm
   lithography resolution of the process to create radially extending p-n
   junctions, providing high optical fill factor depletion-mode modulation
   and thereby eliminating the need for a vertical junction. The device is
   made entirely in the transistor active layer, low-loss crystalline
   silicon, which eliminates the need for a partial etch commonly used to
   create ridge cavities. In this work, we present the full optical and
   electrical design of the cavity including rigorous mode solver and FDTD
   simulations to design the Q-limiting electrical contacts and the
   coupling/excitation. We address the layout of active photonics within
   the mask set of a standard advanced CMOS process and show that
   high-performance photonic devices can be seamlessly monolithically
   integrated alongside electronics on the same chip. The present designs
   enable monolithically integrated optoelectronic transceivers on a single
   advanced CMOS chip, without requiring any process changes, enabling the
   penetration of photonics into the microprocessor.}},

Abstract = {{One photon diffusive photopolymers enable self-developing three
   dimensional (3D) refractive index patterning of up to cm thick solid
   volumes for the fabrication of micro-optics. However, one photon
   absorption in solid, thick materials does not yield complete control of
   the 3D refractive index distribution due to diffraction and the
   excessive development time for index features measuring 100's of microns
   in diameter or larger. We present a fabrication method and photopolymer
   formulation that can efficiently create mm(3) optical devices with
   programmable, gradient index of refraction with arbitrary feature size
   and shape. Index contrast of 0.1 is demonstrated, which is 20 times
   larger than commercial holographic photopolymers. Devices are fabricated
   by repetitive micro-fluidic layering of a self-developing photopolymer
   structured by projection lithography. The process has the unusual
   property that total fabrication time for a fixed thickness decreases as
   the number of layers is increased, reducing the fabrication time for
   high axial resolution micro-optics. We demonstrate the process by
   fabricating thick waveguide arrays and gradient index lenses.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Activity delays are a common issue in the construction industry and can
   increase project schedules and costs. Recent research efforts have
   focused on the quantitative evaluation of delay impacts. The literature
   suggests that the construction industry is in need of additional
   research to systematically relate the causes of delays to their impacts.
   To overcome this limitation, this paper analyzes delay causes in
   activities that were not completed as scheduled. The paper contributes
   to a methodology to examine the qualitative (delay causes) and
   quantitative (time performance) dimensions of the delay issue. The paper
   proposes two indicators, as follows: (1)reason for noncompliance (RNC)
   as an indicator that characterizes scheduling failures, and (2)delay
   index (DI) as a time-performance indicator that describes the impacts of
   delay on critical and noncritical activities. The paper presents two
   building projects as case studies, with planning and subcontractors as
   the primary RNCs that have the greatest impact on time performance.
   Planning was the most harmful delay cause on time performance.}},

Abstract = {{Characterized by fast movement, low surface slope and grounding below
   sea level, Pine Island Glacier (PIG) plays an important role in the
   stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet. In previous work, we reported
   that the spatial distribution of 1995-2003 surface lowering in PIG
   suggests an attribution of changes to an internally forced process in
   the glacier. Other work associates changes in PIG entirely with
   processes in its ice shelf. Here time series of maps of surface
   elevation change in PIG and its ice shelf are derived from
   geostatistical analysis of ICESat GLAS and ERS-1 radar altimeter data.
   Based on spatio-temporal analysis of 1995-2007 elevation change, we
   discuss indications of processes that initiate from changes in the ice
   shelf versus processes that start internally in the glacier. Thinning
   rates continued to increase after 2003, regionally to >15 m a(-1). The
   initiation of acceleration occurred in the interior of the ice stream,
   while in later years largest elevation loss was driven by changes in the
   ice shelf and upward propagation. By 2006, the region of thinning had
   expanded up-glacier beyond the initial areas of surface lowering to 100
   km above the hinge line. More than one process causes dynamically
   complex changes in PIG.}},

Abstract = {{Sputtering of the Martian atmosphere by O(+)pickup ions has been
   proposed as a potentially important process in the early evolution of
   the Martian atmosphere. In preparation for the Mars Atmosphere and
   Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission, we performed a study using a Monte
   Carlo model coupled to a molecular dynamic calculation to investigate
   the cascade sputtering effects in the region of the Martian exobase.
   Pickup ion fluxes based on test particle simulations in an MHD model for
   three different solar wind conditions are used to examine the local and
   global sputtering efficiencies. The resultant sputtering escape rate is
   2x10(24)s(-1) at nominal solar wind condition and can be enhanced about
   50 times when both the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength and
   the solar wind pressure increase. It is found that when the IMF strength
   becomes stronger, both the pickup ion precipitation energies and the
   resultant sputtering efficiencies increase. The related escape flux, hot
   component, and atmospheric energy deposition deduced from the MAVEN
   measurements may reveal clues about the prominent enhanced sputtering
   effects. Significant hemispheric asymmetries can be observed related to
   the solar wind electric fields. The shielding by the crustal fields and
   the recycling onto the nightside due to different magnetic field draping
   features can also lead to regional variations of sputtering
   efficiencies. The results suggest that disturbed or enhanced solar wind
   conditions provide the best prospects for detecting sputtering effects
   for MAVEN mission.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term perspective on Mars' exosphere variability at 405 km is
   provided by merging together density data derived from precise orbit
   determination of the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey (MO)
   satellites extending from 2001 to 2010. These data are heavily weighted
   toward afternoon local times at high latitudes in the Southern
   Hemisphere. Clear long-term solar and annual variations are well
   captured by empirical formulas. Residuals from the empirical fit show
   evidence for relative depletions in exosphere density around Mars'
   closest approach to Earth, which would be consistent with a scavenging
   mechanism that is dependent on solar wind dynamic pressure. Superimposed
   on this variation with Mars-Sun distance are positive density residuals
   during Mars year (MY)25, MY27, and MY29 that are apparently due to
   elevated dust levels in Mars' middle atmosphere. However, during MY24,
   MY26, and MY28 there are dust level increases without any corresponding
   increase in exosphere density. We suspect that this inconsistency is
   related to a variable ability to sense the response to dust-related
   effects, imposed by the high-latitude limitations of our measurements
   combined with interference between the mechanisms that translate middle
   atmosphere heating to an exosphere response. Evidence also supports the
   hypothesis that winter helium bulge effects contributed to the inferred
   interannual density variability during the 2007-2009 solar minimum
   period, when the O-He transition height likely resided near the similar
   to 405 km orbit of MO.}},

Abstract = {{We study the solar wind-induced ion escape from planetary atmospheres at
   different radial heliospheric distances in the solar system. We derive
   histograms of the gyroaveraged ExB velocities, energies, and Larmor
   radii of planetary ions in the solar wind at Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
   Mars. The statistical analysis is based on the interplanetary Pioneer
   Venus Orbiter and OMNI solar wind data sets. In addition to the
   energization in the undisturbed solar wind we also model how planetary
   heavy ions get energized in the solar wind interaction of an
   unmagnetized planet at different distances to the Sun. We found that due
   to the Parker spiral, pickup ions are expected to be found on average at
   lower energies and at velocities more perpendicular to the solar wind
   flow, the closer to the Sun a planet or a comet is. According to a
   global hybrid simulation, planetary heavy ion energization is influenced
   qualitatively in a similar way in the presence of an induced
   magnetosphere than in the upstream solar wind under different Parker
   spiral angles due to fact that the structure of an induced magnetosphere
   depends strongly on the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind
   conditions. Finally, the energization and dynamics of the pickup ions
   vary considerably with the solar activity. The variation is stronger the
   farther away from the Sun an object is. The Larmor radii of the pickup
   ions are largest during a solar minimum while the pickup ion energies
   are highest during the declining phase of a solar cycle.}},

Title = {{Waterless TiO2 atomic layer deposition using titanium tetrachloride and
   titanium tetraisopropoxide}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The surface chemistry for TiO2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) typically
   utilizes water or other oxidants that can oxidize underlying substrates
   such as magnetic disks or semiconductors. To avoid this oxidation,
   waterless or oxidant-free surface chemistry can be used that involves
   titanium halides and titanium alkoxides. In this study, waterless TiO2
   ALD was accomplished using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and titanium
   tetraisopropoxide (TTIP). In situ transmission Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) studies were employed to study the surface species and
   the reactions during waterless TiO2 ALD. At low temperatures between 125
   and 225 degrees C, the FTIR absorbance spectra revealed that the
   isopropoxide species remained on the surface after TTIP exposures. The
   TiCl4 exposures then removed the isopropoxide species and deposited
   additional titanium species. At high temperatures between 250 and 300
   degrees C, the isopropoxide species were converted to hydroxyl species
   by beta-hydride elimination. The observation of propene gaseous reaction
   product by quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) confirmed the b-hydride
   elimination reaction pathway. The TiCl4 exposures then easily reacted
   with the hydroxyl species. QMS studies also observed the 2-chloropropane
   and HCl gaseous reaction products and monitored the self-limiting nature
   of the TTIP reaction. Additional studies examined the waterless TiO2 ALD
   growth at low and high temperature. Quartz crystal microbalance
   measurements observed growth rates of similar to 3ng/cm(2) at a low
   temperature of 150 degrees C. Much higher growth rates of similar to 15
   ng/cm(2) were measured at a higher temperature of 250 degrees C under
   similar reaction conditions. X-ray reflectivity analysis measured a
   growth rate of 0.55 +/- 0.05 angstrom/cycle at 250 degrees C. X-ray
   photoelectron depth-profile studies showed that the TiO2 films contained
   low Cl concentrations <1 at. \%. This waterless TiO2 ALD process using
   TiCl4 and TTIP should be valuable to prevent substrate oxidation during
   TiO2 ALD on oxygen-sensitive substrates. (C) 2014 American Vacuum

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that terrestrial GPS/Global Navigation Satellite
   Systems (GNSS) receivers are vulnerable and have suffered from
   intentional and unintentional interference sources. Unfortunately,
   space-based GPS/GNSS receivers are not exempt from radio frequency
   interference originating from the Earth. This paper explores data
   recorded by the GNSS Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding (GRAS) instrument
   onboard MetOp-A in September 2007, which is assumed to be representative
   of the typical environment for GPS/GNSS instrumentation in LEO orbit.
   Within these data it is possible to detect both pulsed interference and
   variations in the background noise. One plausible source of the pulsed
   interference is identified. We also show that neither the pulsed
   interference nor the variations in the background noise degrades the
   performance of the higher level products from GRAS.

Title = {{Snow density climatology across the former USSR}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{785-799}},
Abstract = {{Snow density is one of the basic properties used to describe snow cover
   characteristics, and it is a key factor for linking snow depth and snow
   water equivalent, which are critical for water resources assessment and
   modeling inputs. In this study, we used long-term data from ground-based
   measurements to investigate snow density (bulk density) climatology and
   its spatiotemporal variations across the former Soviet Union (USSR) from
   1966 to 2008. The results showed that the long-term monthly mean snow
   density was approximately 0.22 +/- 0.05 g cm(-3) over the study area.
   The maximum and minimum monthly mean snow density was about 0.33 g
   cm(-3) in June, and 0.14 g cm(-3) in October, respectively. Maritime and
   ephemeral snow had the highest monthly mean snow density, while taiga
   snow had the lowest. The higher values of monthly snow density were
   mainly located in the European regions of the former USSR, on the coast
   of Arctic Russia, and the Kamchatka Peninsula, while the lower snow
   density occurred in central Siberia. Significant increasing trends of
   snow density from September through June of the next year were observed,
   however, the rate of the increase varied with different snow classes.
   The long-term (1966-2008) monthly and annual mean snow densities had
   significant decreasing trends, especially during the autumn months.
   Spatially, significant positive trends in monthly mean snow density lay
   in the southwestern areas of the former USSR in November and December
   and gradually expanded in Russia from February through April.
   Significant negative trends mainly lay in the European Russia and the
   southern Russia. There was a high correlation of snow density with
   elevation for tundra snow and snow density was highly correlated with
   latitude for prairie snow.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the phase of electrospun MnOx nanofibers (NFs) after thermal
   calcination has been limited to the low oxidation state of Mn (x < 2),

   contents in the as-spun MnOx NFs, which are essential for forming the NF
   structure, make it difficult to obtain the optimum phase (MnO2) to
   achieve high electrochemical performance. Herein, delta-MnO2 NFs, which
   were obtained by galvanostatic oxidation of thermally calcined MnOx NFs,
   were successfully fabricated while maintaining the 1-D nanoscale
   structure and inhibiting loss of the active materials. The
   galvanostatically oxidized Mn3O4 exhibited an outstanding performance of
   380 F g(-1) under a mass loading of 1.2 mg cm(-2). The effect of
   galvanostatic oxidation was strongly dependent on the concentration and
   energetic stability of the Mn2+/3+ ions in the MnOx phases.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide, as an inexpensive anode material, has attracted less
   attention than other metal oxides due to its poor cycling stability. A
   rational design of ZnO nanostructures with well-controlled particle
   sizes and microstructures is essential in order to improve their
   stability and performance as electrodes for lithium ion batteries
   (LIBs). Here, we demonstrate a simple approach via atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) to synthesize ZnO quantum dots (QDs) on graphene
   layers, in which the size of the ZnO QDs can be controlled from 2 to 7
   nm by ALD cycles. A strong relationship between size and electrochemical
   performance is observed, in which smaller sized QDs on graphene display
   enhanced electrochemical performance. A high reversible specific
   capacity of 960 mA h g(-1) is achieved at a current density of 100 mA
   g(-1) for 2 nm ZnO QDs, approaching to the theoretical value of ZnO as
   the LIB anode. The greatly enhanced cycling stability and rate
   performance of the ALD ZnO QD/graphene composite electrode can be
   attributed to the well-maintained structural integrity without
   pulverization upon electrochemical charge/discharge for ZnO QDs with the
   grain size below a critical value.}},

Abstract = {{In order to address the poor energy density of bulk all-solid-state
   lithium-ion batteries a new composite electrode preparation method is
   proposed. This study demonstrates the concurrent synthesis of the FeS2
   active material and a glass electrolyte which is similar to the
   (100-x)P2S5:xLi(2)S system of glass electrolytes. This is accomplished
   through the successive mechanochemical and thermal treatments of Fe2P,
   S, and Li2S. The composite electrode's ionic conductivity of 5.46 x
   10(-5) S cm(-1) 60 degrees C and specific energy of 1.2 Wh g(-1) versus
   a lithium metal anode suggest that this method may provide a more
   intimate solid-solid interfacial contact between active material and
   glass electrolyte. The results of this study provide a completely new
   perspective on the preparation of all-solid-state composite electrodes.

Abstract = {{We have examined the utility of retrieved column-averaged, dry-air mole
   fractions of CO2 (XCO2) from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite
   (GOSAT) for quantifying monthly, regional flux estimates of CO2, using
   the GEOS-Chem four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation
   system. We focused on assessing the potential impact of biases in the
   GOSAT CO2 data on the regional flux estimates. Using different screening
   and bias correction approaches, we selected three different subsets of
   the GOSAT XCO2 data for the 4D-Var inversion analyses, and found that
   the inferred global fluxes were consistent across the three XCO2
   inversions. However, the GOSAT observational coverage was a challenge
   for the regional flux estimates. In the northern extratropics, the
   inversions were more sensitive to North American fluxes than to European
   and Asian fluxes due to the lack of observations over Eurasia in winter
   and over eastern and southern Asia in summer. The regional flux
   estimates were also sensitive to the treatment of the residual bias in
   the GOSAT XCO2 data. The largest differences obtained were for temperate
   North America and temperate South America, for which the largest spread
   between the inversions was 1.02 and 0.96 Pg C, respectively. In the case
   of temperate North America, one inversion suggested a strong source,
   whereas the second and third XCO2 inversions produced a weak and strong
   sink, respectively. Despite the discrepancies in the regional flux
   estimates between the three XCO2 inversions, the a posteriori CO2
   distributions were in good agreement (with a mean difference between the
   three inversions of typically less than 0.5 ppm) with independent data
   from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), the surface
   flask network, and from the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO)
   aircraft campaign. The discrepancy in the regional flux estimates from
   the different inversions, despite the agreement of the global flux
   estimates suggests the need for additional work to determine the minimum
   spatial scales at which we can reliably quantify the fluxes using GOSAT
   XCO2. The fact that the a posteriori CO2 from the different inversions
   were in good agreement with the independent data although the regional
   flux estimates differed significantly, suggests that innovative ways of
   exploiting existing data sets, and possibly additional observations, are
   needed to better evaluate the inferred regional flux estimates.}},

Abstract = {{There is a national need for an increased quantity of engineers. In
   addition to pure quantity, there are calls for a more diverse
   engineering population capable of addressing increasingly complex and
   global future challenges. Many acknowledge that current
   institutionalized models of education may not be filling these needs and
   that extracurricular experiences may recruit and retain diverse
   engineers while supplementing traditional education. This research
   investigates the internationally-focused and largely unstudied
   organization, Engineers Without Borders (EWB-USA), to understand
   members' perceptions of what an engineer needs to know, what gaps they
   experience in their education, and what gains they experience from their
   membership in EWB-USA. Responses to open-ended questions were collected
   from 505 members at five geographically spread regional EWB-USA
   workshops. These responses were analyzed for the total population and
   disaggregated for gender and professional status. The most common gains
   members identified were a global perspective, relationships, experience
   and application, and project management skills, which address both the
   future needs of the profession and more personal connections to the
   engineering field. In comparisons, females showed gains previously
   identified as important for engineering persistence, and student
   participants emphasized the engineering experience they gained through
   the organization. This large-scale study provides empirical evidence for
   past anecdotal indications that EWB-USA-like experiences can supplement
   existing curricula to help generate engineers of the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a unique service-learning course designed to
   introduce students to sustainable human development through a
   combination of classroom, laboratory, and fieldwork exercises. It
   responds to a need to educate engineers in addressing global societal

   the competencies expected of graduating university engineering students
   today. The course was multidisciplinary and involved a cohort of
   international students and faculty. The course employed multiple
   teaching methods and offered a variety of learning experiences. The
   study reported in this paper focuses on the students' views of their
   learning and the course's contribution to their development. More
   specifically, two research questions were considered with regard to
   (1)students' learning outcomes and how they matched the course
   objectives and (2)learning experiences that were perceived as
   significant in promoting personal and professional development. The
   research findings imply that the course promoted various learning
   outcomes, and that the participatory and active learning experiences

Abstract = {{The underprediction of ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) levels by
   current atmospheric models in urban areas is well established, yet the
   cause of this underprediction remains elusive. Likewise, the relative
   contribution of emissions from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles to
   the formation of SOA is generally unresolved. We investigate the source
   of these two discrepancies using data from the 2010 CalNex experiment
   carried out in the Los Angeles Basin (Ryerson et al., 2013).
   Specifically, we use gasphase organic mass (GPOM) and CO emission
   factors in conjunction with measured enhancements in oxygenated organic
   aerosol (OOA) relative to CO to quantify the significant lack of closure
   between expected and observed organic aerosol concentrations
   attributable to fossil-fuel emissions. Two possible conclusions emerge
   from the analysis to yield consistency with the ambient data: (1)
   vehicular emissions are not a dominant source of anthropogenic fossil
   SOA in the Los Angeles Basin, or (2) the ambient SOA mass yields used to
   determine the SOA formation potential of vehicular emissions are
   substantially higher than those derived from laboratory chamber studies.}},

Title = {{Quantifying global terrestrial methanol emissions using observations
   from the TES satellite sensor}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{2555-2570}},
Abstract = {{We employ new global space-based measurements of atmospheric methanol
   from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) with the adjoint of
   the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to quantify terrestrial emissions
   of methanol to the atmosphere. Biogenic methanol emissions in the model
   are based on version 2.1 of the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols
   from Nature (MEGANv2.1), using leaf area data from NASA's Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GEOS-5 assimilated
   meteorological fields. We first carry out a pseudo observation test to
   validate the overall approach, and find that the TES sampling density is
   sufficient to accurately quantify regional-to continental-scale methanol
   emissions using this method. A global inversion of two years of TES data
   yields an optimized annual global surface flux of 122 Tg yr(-1)
   (including biogenic, pyrogenic, and anthropogenic sources), an increase
   of 60\% from the a priori global flux of 76 Tg yr(-1). Global
   terrestrial methanol emissions are thus nearly 25\% those of isoprene
   (similar to 540 Tg yr(-1)), and are comparable to the combined emissions
   of all anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (similar to 100-200 Tg
   yr(-1)). Our a posteriori terrestrial methanol source leads to a strong
   improvement of the simulation relative to an ensemble of airborne
   observations, and corroborates two other recent top-down estimates
   (114-120 Tg yr(-1)) derived using in situ and space-based measurements.
   Inversions testing the sensitivity of optimized fluxes to model errors
   in OH, dry deposition, and oceanic uptake of methanol, as well as to the
   assumed a priori constraint, lead to global fluxes ranging from 118 to
   126 Tg yr(-1). The TES data imply a relatively modest revision of model
   emissions over most of the tropics, but a significant upward revision in
   midlatitudes, particularly over Europe and North America. We interpret
   the inversion results in terms of specific source types using the
   methanol : CO correlations measured by TES, and find that biogenic
   emissions are overestimated relative to biomass burning and
   anthropogenic emissions in central Africa and southeastern China, while
   they are underestimated in regions such as Brazil and the US. Based on
   our optimized emissions, methanol accounts for > 25\% of the
   photochemical source of CO and HCHO over many parts of the northern
   extratropics during springtime, and contributes similar to 6\% of the
   global secondary source of those compounds annually.}},

Title = {{Cloud-scale ice-supersaturated regions spatially correlate with high

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2639-2656}},
Abstract = {{Cirrus clouds have large yet uncertain impacts on Earth's climate. Ice
   supersaturation (ISS) - where the relative humidity with respect to ice
   (RHi) is greater than 100\% - is the prerequisite condition of ice
   nucleation. Here we use 1 Hz (similar to 230 m) in situ, aircraft-based
   observations from 87 degrees N to 67 degrees S to analyze the spatial
   characteristics of ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs). The median length
   of 1-D horizontal ISSR segments is found to be very small (similar to 1
   km), which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. To
   understand the conditions of these small-scale ISSRs, we compare
   individual ISSRs with their horizontally adjacent subsaturated
   surroundings and show that 99\% and 73\% of the ISSRs are moister and
   colder, respectively. When quantifying the contributions of water vapor
   (H2O) and temperature (T) individually, the magnitudes of the
   differences between the maximum RHi values inside ISSRs (RHi(max)) and
   the RHi in subsaturated surroundings are largely derived from the H2O
   spatial variabilities (by 88\%) than from those of T (by 9\%). These
   features hold for both ISSRs with and without ice crystals present.
   Similar analyses for all RHi horizontal variabilities (including ISS and
   non-ISS) show strong contributions from H2O variabilities at various T,
   H2O, pressure (P) and various horizontal scales (similar to 1-100 km).
   Our results provide a new observational constraint on ISSRs on the
   microscale (similar to 100 m) and point to the importance of
   understanding how these fine-scale features originate and impact cirrus
   cloud formation and the RHi field in the upper troposphere (UT).}},

Abstract = {{Coulomb forces associated with charged close-flying satellites can
   efficiently enable static formation equilibria, in which separation
   distances remain constant. However, limited Coulomb force
   controllability presents many challenges in maintaining and maneuvering
   these inherently unstable formations. This paper studies three-craft
   collinear equilibria, admitted in the presence of a central body gravity
   field. Necessary existence conditions for this class of Coulomb
   formation are given in previous research, and this paper extends these
   to be sufficient, while using a more accurate Coulomb force model.
   Stability properties of the resulting configuration cases are analyzed
   for the first time, and it is shown that each can exhibit marginal
   stability normal to the orbit plane. Also, it is demonstrated that
   in-plane perturbations can be asymptotically stabilized, using only
   craft charging, for the radially aligned configurations. A charge
   feedback law is derived for this case, and numerical results are
   provided. These stability and controllability properties correlate with
   those, previously known, for two- and three-craft (in the absence of
   gravity) formations. Lastly, invariant manifolds are generated to
   illustrate dynamic properties of these systems, and the possibility of
   exploiting the manifold flows to target minimum fuel reconfigurations
   (shape changes), is discussed.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},

Abstract = {{A reliable and precise in situ CO2 and CO analysis system has been
   developed and deployed at eight sites in the NOAA Earth System Research
   Laboratory's (ESRL) Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. The network
   uses very tall (> 300 m) television and radio transmitter towers that
   provide a convenient platform for mid-boundary-layer trace-gas sampling.
   Each analyzer has three sample inlets for profile sampling, and a
   complete vertical profile is obtained every 15 min. The instrument suite
   at one site has been augmented with a cavity ring-down spectrometer for
   measuring CO2 and CH4. The long-term stability of the systems in the
   field is typically better than 0.1 ppm for CO2, 6 ppb for CO, and 0.5
   ppb for CH4, as determined from repeated standard gas measurements. The
   instrumentation is fully automated and includes sensors for measuring a
   variety of status parameters, such as temperatures, pressures, and flow
   rates, that are inputs for automated alerts and quality control
   algorithms. Detailed and time-dependent uncertainty estimates have been
   constructed for all of the gases, and the uncertainty framework could be
   readily adapted to other species or analysis systems. The design
   emphasizes use of off-theshelf parts and modularity to facilitate
   network operations and ease of maintenance. The systems report
   high-quality data with > 93\% uptime. Recurrent problems and limitations
   of the current system are discussed along with general recommendations
   for high-accuracy trace-gas monitoring. The network is a key component
   of the North American Carbon Program and a useful model for future
   research-grade operational greenhouse gas monitoring efforts.}},

Title = {{Evaluation and development of novel photoinitiator complexes for
   photoinitiating the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1874-1882}},
Abstract = {{Here, several distinct approaches for photoinitiation and subsequent
   utilization of the Copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)
   reaction are developed. In particular, Cu(II)-ligand complexes were
   synthesized that enabled direct photoreduction of the Cu(II). The
   sequential and orthogonal nature of the photo-CuAAC reaction and a
   chain-growth acrylate homopolymerization were demonstrated and used to
   form branched polymer structures. The efficiency of the photo-initiated
   Cu(II) complexes in regard to their ability to initiate the CuAAC
   reaction was examined by reacting a variety of amino-functional ligands
   with Cu(II) halides to form complexes capable of forming Cu(I) upon
   light irradiation. When irradiated with 365 nm light, the ligand donates
   an electron to Cu(II) to reduce it to Cu(I) which subsequently initiates
   the azide-alkyne cycloaddition (i.e., photo-CuAAC) reaction with
   exquisite spatiotemporal control. Aliphatic amine ligands were found to
   be the most efficient ligands in promoting photoreduction of Cu(II) and
   stabilizing Cu(I), once formed. Among the aliphatic amines studied,
   tertiary amines such as triethylamine (TEA), tetramethylethylenediamine
   (TMDA), N,N,N',N `',N `'-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA), and
   hexamethylenetetramine (HMTETA) were found to be the most effective. In
   addition, the Cu(II)-amine complexes were insensitive to oxygen,
   indicating that the catalytic Cu(I) is largely prevented from
   re-oxidation by complexation with the amine ligand and/or the triazole.
   The reaction kinetics were accelerated by increasing the PMDETA : Cu(II)
   ratio with a ratio of ligand to Cu(II) of 4 : 1 yielding the maximum
   conversion in the shortest time.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{1881-1896}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) mass emission factors (EFBC; g BC (kg fuel)(-1)) from
   a variety of ocean-going vessels have been determined from measurements
   of BC and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in ship plumes intercepted
   by the R/V Atlantis during the 2010 California Nexus (CalNex) campaign.
   The ships encountered were all operating within 24 nautical miles of the
   California coast and were utilizing relatively low sulphur fuels
   (average fuel sulphur content of 0.4\%, 0.09\% and 0.03\% for vessels
   operating slow-speed, medium-speed and high-speed diesel engines,
   respectively). Black carbon concentrations within the plumes, from which
   EFBC values are determined, were measured using four independent
   instruments: a photoacoustic spectrometer and a particle soot absorption
   photometer, which measure light absorption, and a single particle soot
   photometer and soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer, which measure
   the mass concentration of refractory BC directly. These measurements
   have been used to assess the level of agreement between these different
   techniques for the determination of BC emission factors from ship
   plumes. Also, these measurements greatly expand upon the number of
   individual ships for which BC emission factors have been determined
   during real-world operation. The measured EFBC's have been divided into
   vessel type categories and engine type categories, from which averages
   have been determined. The geometric average EFBC (excluding outliers)
   determined from over 71 vessels and 135 plumes encountered was 0.31 +/-
   0.31 gBC (kg fuel)(-1), where the standard deviation represents the
   variability between individual vessels. The most frequent engine type
   encountered was the slow-speed diesel (SSD), and the most frequent SSD
   vessel type was the cargo ship sub-category. Average and median EFBC
   values from the SSD category are compared with previous observations
   from the Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS) in 2006, during which the
   ships encountered were predominately operating on high-sulphur fuels
   (average fuel sulphur content of 1.6 \%). There is a statistically
   significant difference between the EFBC values from CalNex and TexAQS
   for SSD vessels and for the cargo and tanker ship types within this
   engine category. The CalNex EFBC values are lower than those from
   TexAQS, suggesting that operation on lower sulphur fuels is associated
   with smaller EFBC values.}},

Pages = {{2187-2201}},
Abstract = {{As the demand for polymeric materials transitions towards the need for
   customizable, high value, specialty polymeric materials, the ability to
   use light to initiate various physicochemical changes in polymers
   represents one of the most powerful and rapidly evolving approaches.
   Whether for polymer formation, polymer modification, shape change, or
   inducing smart material responses, light has the unique capacity for
   enabling 4D manipulation of each of those processes. Given the simple,
   3D ability to focus light on a targeted voxel and the even simpler
   ability to turn a light on and off to facilitate temporal control, light
   has been used widely in various polymer modifications. Further, in
   addition to the ability to enhance the control of various reactive
   processes, due to the much greater energy available in a photon as
   compared to the thermal energy available, light enables chemical
   processes to occur at ambient conditions that are otherwise inaccessible
   without heating. In particular, within the polymer chemistry field,
   light has been used to cause bond formation, bond degradation, and
   isomerization, with subsequent reactions including polymerization,
   polymer degradation, polymer functionalization, and responsive changes
   in properties of smart materials. Here, this article attempts to provide
   a fundamental basis for the various photochemical processes implemented
   in polymer systems, followed by selected examples of that implementation
   in various polymerization, functionalization, degradation, and other
   reactions.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1337-1352}},
Abstract = {{Emissions factors (EFs) for gas and sub-micron particle-phase species
   were measured in intercepted plumes as a function of vessel speed from
   an underway research vessel, the NOAA ship Miller Freeman, operating a
   medium-speed diesel engine on low-sulfur marine gas oil (fuel sulfur
   content similar to 0.1\% by weight). The low-sulfur fuel in use conforms
   to the MARPOL fuel sulfur limit within emission control areas set to
   take effect in 2015 and to California-specific limits set to take effect
   in 2014. For many of the particle-phase species, EFs were determined
   using multiple measurement methodologies, allowing for an assessment of
   how well EFs from different techniques agree. The total sub-micron PM
   (PM1) was dominated by particulate black carbon (BC) and particulate
   organic matter (POM), with an average POM/BC ratio of 1.3. Consideration
   of the POM/BC ratios observed here with literature studies suggests that
   laboratory and in-stack measurement methods may overestimate primary POM
   EFs relative to those observed in emitted plumes. Comparison of four
   different methods for black carbon measurement indicates that careful
   attention must be paid to instrument limitations and biases when
   assessing EFBC. Particulate sulfate (SO42-) EFs were extremely small and
   the particles emitted by Miller Freeman were inefficient as cloud
   condensation nuclei (CCN), even at high super saturations, consistent
   with the use of very low-sulfur fuel and the overall small emitted
   particle sizes. All measurement methodologies consistently demonstrate
   that the measured EFs (fuel mass basis) for PM1 mass, BC and POM
   decreased as the ship slowed. Particle number EFs were approximately
   constant across the speed change, with a shift towards smaller particles
   being emitted at slower speeds. Emissions factors for gas-phase CO and
   formaldehyde (HCHO) both increased as the vessel slowed, while EFs for
   NOx decreased and SO2 EFs were approximately constant.}},

Title = {{Understanding Uncertainties in Future Colorado River Streamflow}},

Volume = {{95}},

Pages = {{59-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Colorado River is the primary water source for more than 30 million
   people in the United States and Mexico. Recent studies that project
   streamf low changes in the Colorado River all project annual declines,
   but the magnitude of the projected decreases range from less than 10\%
   to 45\% by the mid-twenty-first century. To understand these
   differences, we address the questions the management community has
   raised: Why is there such a wide range of projections of impacts of
   future climate change on Colorado River streamflow, and how should this
   uncertainty be interpreted? We identify four major sources of
   disparities among studies that arise from both methodological and model
   differences. In order of importance, these are differences in 1) the
   global climate models (GCMs) and emission scenarios used; 2) the ability
   of land surface and atmospheric models to simulate properly the
   high-elevation runoff source areas; 3) the sensitivities of land surface
   hydrology models to precipitation and temperature changes; and 4) the
   methods used to statistically downscale GCM scenarios. In accounting for
   these differences, there is substantial evidence across studies that
   future Colorado River streamflow will be reduced under the current
   trajectories of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions because of a
   combination of strong temperature-induced runoff curtailment and reduced
   annual precipitation. Reconstructions of preinstrumental streamflows
   provide additional insights; the greatest risk to Colorado River streamf
   lows is a multidecadal drought, like that observed in
   paleoreconstructions, exacerbated by a steady reduction in flows due to
   climate change. This could result in decades of sustained streamflows
   much lower than have been observed in the \~{}100 years of instrumental
   record.}},

   exchange reactions}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{10108-10117}},
Abstract = {{It was recently reported that thermally malleable polymers with bond
   exchange reactions (BERs) can rearrange their microscopic network
   topology without impairing the network integrity. Besides, two pieces of
   polymers were shown to be able to weld together upon heating without
   introducing additional monomers or chemicals on the interface, enabling
   thermoforming, self-healing, and reprocessing of the polymer, which has
   drawn significant interest in the study of this type of polymers. This
   new breakthrough also opens an avenue to recycle thermoset polymers that
   traditionally are very difficult to recycle. This paper experimentally
   studies the reprocessing and recycling ability of a thermoset polymer
   (an epoxy thermosetting network) with exchangeable bonds in a pulverous
   state. Due to the large surface area and small size of polymer
   particles, their handling, transportation, and storage can offer
   convenience in comparison with traditional polymer scrap in bulk form,
   which can advance their immediate industrial applications in thermoset
   recycling, structure rehabilitations and component rework. A detailed
   investigation was performed to study the effect of reprocessing
   conditions (such as time and pressure) on the material mechanical
   performance. The reprocessing routine was also repeated multiple times
   (representing multiple generations of recycling) to manufacture complex
   objects and to join two separate bulk polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping the nucleation and 3D fault tip growth of the active Osaka-wan
   blind thrust provides an opportunity to asses how reactivated thrusts
   build slip from preexisting faults and the threat they pose as sources
   of large earthquakes. Analysis of folded growth strata, based on 2D
   trishear inverse modeling allows a range of best-fit models of the
   evolution of slip and propagation of the fault to be defined. The depth
   of the fault tip at 1200 ka varies between similar to 1.5-4.5 km,
   suggesting the fault grew upward from high in the crust, and that it is
   reactivated. From its onset at similar to 1500 ka, the fault grew
   rapidly along strike in similar to 300 ky, and upwards with a P/S ratio
   of 2.5-3.0, but variable fault slip in space and time. Shallower depths
   of the fault tip at initiation and thinner basin fill correlates with
   slower propagation with time, contradicting models that argue for
   sediments as inhibitors of fault growth. Results also suggest the
   displacement profile of the currently active thrust is offset from its
   predecessor, assuming shallower depths to the original fault correlate
   with greater displacement in its prior history. These results suggest
   reactivated faults may accrue slip differently than newly developed
   ones, based on the history of upward fault propagation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Different from the usual approach in the inertial frame, the stability
   problem of fictitious Saturn Trojans is studied in the synodic frame in
   this paper. First, some numerical facts are shown to allow us to
   simplify the force model. Then, motion equations centred at the
   geometrical triangular libration points for the planar S-JS model are
   derived. Using these equations, the resonance mechanism that causes the
   instability is studied. We confirm the opinion that the secular
   resonances and the near-commensurability between the libration frequency
   and the great inequality are the reasons to cause the instability of
   motions close to the triangular libration point. By studying the
   survivability of the long period family and the short period family in
   the S-JSUN model, the planar stable region far away from the triangular
   libration point is studied. By frequency analysis of the orbits in the
   stable region, we are able to find two secular resonances associated
   with the boundary of the stable region. Three-dimensional motion is also
   discussed, by starting with the survivability of the vertical period
   family in the S-JSUN model. The secular resonance that causes the orbit
   inclination restriction on the Trojans is qualitatively discussed.
   Lastly, the effects of planetary migrations are briefly studied. With
   the contribution in this paper, a global picture of the dynamics around
   the triangular libration points in the Sun-Saturn system perturbed by
   Jupiter is presented.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers are at the forefront of recent materials research.
   Although the basic concept has been known for decades, recent advances
   in the research of shape memory polymers demand a unified approach to
   predict the shape memory performance under different thermo-temporal
   conditions. Here we report such an approach to predict the shape fixity
   and free recovery of thermo-rheologically simple shape memory polymers.
   The results show that the influence of programming conditions to free
   recovery can be unified by a reduced programming time that uniquely
   determines shape fixity, which consequently uniquely determines the
   shape recovery with a reduced recovery time. Furthermore, using the
   time-temperature superposition principle, shape recoveries under
   different thermo-temporal conditions can be extracted from the shape
   recovery under the reduced recovery time. Finally, a shape memory
   performance map is constructed based on a few simple standard polymer
   rheology tests to characterize the shape memory performance of the
   polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Most benthic invertebrates broadcast their gametes into the sea,
   whereupon successful fertilization relies on the complex interaction
   between the physics of the surrounding fluid flow and the biological
   properties and behavior of eggs and sperm. We present a holistic
   overview of the impact of instantaneous flow processes on fertilization
   across a range of scales. At large scales, transport and stirring by the
   flow control the distribution of gametes. Although mean dilution of
   gametes by turbulence is deleterious to fertilization, a variety of
   instantaneous flow phenomena can aggregate gametes before dilution
   occurs. We argue that these instantaneous flow processes are key to
   fertilization efficiency. At small scales, sperm motility and taxis
   enhance contact rates between sperm and chemoattractant-releasing eggs.
   We argue that sperm motility is a biological adaptation that replaces
   molecular diffusion in conventional mixing processes and enables gametes
   to bridge the gap that remains after aggregation by the flow.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in controlling human
   mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) biology including differentiation, and
   alpha 5 beta 1 integrin signaling plays an important role during
   osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Here, peptide-functionalized
   hydrogels were used to examine the role of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin
   signaling in inducing osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. Further, the
   role of substrate elasticity was also studied. A thiol-ene chemistry was
   used to functionalize poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels with a pendant
   peptide moiety, c(RRETAWA), as previous studies have shown that RRETAWA
   containing peptides bind to the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin with very high
   specificity. Notably, hMSC attachment to c(RRETAWA)-functionalized
   hydrogels was found to occur primarily through alpha 5 integrins, as the
   number of attached cells was significantly reduced to similar to 20\%
   upon blocking the alpha 5 integrin during culture. To investigate the
   interplay between stiffness and c(RRETAWA) concentration, hydrogels were
   formulated with Young's moduli of similar to 2 kPa (soft) and similar to
   25 kPa (stiff) and c(RRETAWA) concentrations of 0.1 mM and 1 mM. Stiff
   substrates led to similar to 3.5 fold higher hMSC attachment and similar
   to 3 fold higher cell area in comparison to soft substrates. hMSCs
   formed robust and larger focal adhesions on stiff substrates at 1 mM
   c(RRETAWA) compared to soft substrates. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
   activity in hMSCs cultured on stiff gels at 0.1 mM and 1 mM c(RRETAWA)
   was increased 2.5 and 3.5 fold, respectively after 14 days in growth
   media. hMSCs did not show an increase in ALP activity when cultured on
   soft gels. Further, gene expression of osteogenic related genes, core
   binding factor-1, osteopontin and Collagen-1a at day 14 in hMSCs
   cultured on stiff gels at 1 mM c(RRETAWA) were increased 10, 7 and 4
   fold, respectively, while on soft gels, gene expression was at basal
   levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the combination of
   high substrate stiffness and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin signaling
   stimulated by c(RRETAWA) is sufficient to induce osteogenic
   differentiation of hMSCs without requiring the addition of soluble
   factors.}},

Title = {{Real-time feedback enhances forward propulsion during walking in old
   adults}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Background: Reduced propulsive function during the push-off phase of
   walking plays a central role in the deterioration of walking ability
   with age. We used real-time propulsive feedback to test the hypothesis
   that old adults have an underutilized propulsive reserve available
   during walking.
   Methods: Bold adults (mean {[}SD], age: 72.1 {[}3.9] years) and 11 young
   adults (age: 21.0 {[}1.5] years) participated. For our primary aim, old
   subjects walked: 1) normally, 2) with visual feedback of their peak
   propulsive ground reaction forces, and 3) with visual feedback of their
   medial gastrocnemius electromyographic activity during push-off. We
   asked those subjects to match a target set to 20\% and 40\% greater
   propulsive force or push-off muscle activity than normal walking. We
   tested young subjects walking normally only to provide reference ground
   reaction force values.
   Findings: Walking normally, old adults exerted 12.5\% smaller peak
   propulsive forces than young adults (P < 0.01). However, old adults
   significantly increased their propulsive forces and push-off muscle
   activities when we provided propulsive feedback. Most notably, force
   feedback elicited propulsive forces that were equal to or 10.5\% greater
   than those of young adults (+20\% target, P = 0.87; +40\% target, P =
   0.02). With electromyographic feedback, old adults significantly
   increased their push-off muscle activities but without increasing their
   propulsive forces.
   Interpretation: Old adults with propulsive deficits have a considerable
   and underutilized propulsive reserve available during level walking.
   Further, real-time propulsive feedback represents a promising
   therapeutic strategy to improve the forward propulsion of old adults and
   thus maintain their walking ability and independence. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Direct conjugation of DNA to quantum dots for scalable assembly of
   photoactive thin films}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{8064-8071}},
Abstract = {{For many thin film applications, it is critical to not only control the
   organization of the materials on surfaces but to also use scalable
   processes that are time and material efficient. This is especially the
   case when using nanomaterials, including metal or semiconductor
   nanocrystals, as building blocks from which to engineer devices. In this
   work, we demonstrate a method to directly conjugate DNA to cadmium based
   quantum dots (QD) to create thin film arrays on surfaces for potential
   optoelectronic devices. These DNA-conjugated QDs showed uniform
   coatings, were oxidation-stable, and remained stable in high ionic
   strength environments. In previously published work, we discovered that
   high salt, in particular magnesium, is critical for fabricating
   nanoparticle assemblies on substrates through DNA interactions. The QD
   thin films were produced by means of interparticle DNA hybridization in
   a few steps with no loss of material and with good control over film
   thickness and roughness. By directly conjugating the DNA to the QDs, it
   also became possible to study DNA's role in mediating charge transport
   in the QD films. For this, DNA-conjugated CdTe nanocrystals were
   assembled onto TiO2 films to fabricate photovoltaic prototypes.
   Current-Voltage measurements from the DNA-QD devices showed the promise
   of using DNA not only as an assembler but also as mediator of charge
   separation and transport.}},

Abstract = {{The remote charging of a passive object using an electron beam enables
   touchless re-orbiting of large space debris from geosynchronous orbit
   (GEO) using electrostatic forces. The advantage of this method is that
   it can operate with a separation distance of multiple craft radii, thus
   reducing the risk of collision. The charging of the tug debris system to
   high potentials is achieved by active charge transfer using a directed
   electron beam. Optimal potential distributions using isolated- and
   coupled-sphere models are discussed. A simple charging model takes into
   account the primary electron beam current, ultra-violet radiation
   induced photoelectron emission, collection of plasma particles,
   secondary electron emission and the recapture of emitted particles. The
   results show that through active charging in a GEO space environment
   high potentials can be both achieved and maintained with about a 75\%
   transfer efficiency. Further, the maximum electrostatic tractor force is
   shown to be insensitive to beam current levels. This latter later result
   is important when considering debris with unknown properties. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{For two decades, the University of Wisconsin Space Science and
   Engineering Center (SSEC) and the Antarctic Meteorological Research
   Center (AMRC) have been creating global, regional and hemispheric
   satellite composites. These composites have proven useful in research,
   operational forecasting, commercial applications and educational
   outreach. Using the Man computer Interactive Data System (McIDAS)
   software developed at SSEC, infrared window composites were created by
   combining Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), and
   polar orbiting data from the SSEC Data Center and polar data acquired at
   McMurdo and Palmer stations, Antarctica. Increased computer processing
   speed has allowed for more advanced algorithms to address the decision
   making process for co-located pixels. The algorithms have evolved from a
   simplistic maximum brightness temperature to those that account for
   distance from the sub-satellite point, parallax displacement, pixel time
   and resolution. The composites are the state-of-the-art means for
   merging/mosaicking satellite imagery. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A unified approach is developed for the study of multi-input,
   multi-output (MIMO) systems under fast fading with quantized covariance
   feedback. In such systems, the receiver computes, using perfect channel
   state information (CSI), the covariance matrices to be adopted by the
   transmitter corresponding to the current channel realization, and feeds
   back a quantized version of this information to the transmitter using
   finite, say, bits per channel realization. Our analysis is based on a
   geometric framework we developed in a companion paper for manifolds of
   positive semi-definite (covariance) matrices with various trace and rank
   constraints. That analysis applies to MIMO systems in a unified manner
   to optimal as well as various suboptimal precoding methods for obtaining
   input covariances. These include, for example, the capacity achieving
   spatio-temporal water-filling strategy, the incorporation of just
   spatial water-filling and reduced- rank beamforming with power
   allocation in both cases, as well as MIMO systems with antenna
   selection. For a given system strategy, including the one that achieves
   capacity, the gap between the communication rates in the perfect and
   quantized covariance cases is shown to be, O(2-(Nf/N)), where is the
   dimension of the particular Pn manifold used for quantization. This
   dimension depends on the precoding strategy adopted and strongly
   determines how quickly the communication rate with quantized covariance
   feedback approaches that with perfect CSI at the transmitter (CSIT). Our
   results show how the choice of covariance quantization manifold can be
   tailored to the available feedback rate in MIMO system design.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{283-299}},
Abstract = {{A new ozone climatology, based on ozonesonde and satellite measurements,
   spanning the altitude region between the earth's surface and similar to
   60 km is presented (TpO(3) climatology). This climatology is novel in
   that the ozone profiles are categorized according to calendar month,
   latitude and local tropopause heights. Compared to the standard
   latitude-month categorization, this presentation improves the
   representativeness of the ozone climatology in the upper troposphere and
   the lower stratosphere (UTLS). The probability distribution of
   tropopause heights in each latitude-month bin provides additional
   climatological information and allows transforming/comparing the TpO(3)
   climatology to a standard climatology of zonal mean ozone profiles. The
   TpO(3) climatology is based on high-vertical-resolution measurements of
   ozone from the satellite-based Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment
   II (in 1984 to 2005) and from balloon-borne ozonesondes from 1980 to
   2006.
   The main benefits of the TpO(3) climatology are reduced standard
   deviations on climatological ozone profiles in the UTLS, partial
   characterization of longitudinal variability, and characterization of
   ozone profiles in the presence of double tropopauses.
   The first successful application of the TpO(3) climatology as a priori
   in ozone profile retrievals from Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board
   the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite shows an improvement of
   ozone precision in UTLS of up to 10 \% compared with the use of
   conventional climatologies.
   In addition to being advantageous for use as a priori in satellite
   retrieval algorithms, the TpO(3) climatology might be also useful for
   validating the representation of ozone in climate model simulations.}},

Abstract = {{While traditional models of protein adsorption focus primarily on direct
   protein-surface interactions, recent findings suggest that
   protein-protein interactions may play a central role. Using
   high-throughput intermolecular resonance energy transfer (RET) tracking,
   we directly observed dynamic, protein-protein associations of bovine
   serum albumin on polyethylene glycol modified surfaces. The associations
   were heterogeneous and reversible, and associating molecules resided on
   the surface for longer times. The appearance of three distinct RET
   states suggested a spatially heterogeneous surface - with areas of high
   protein density (i.e., strongly interacting clusters) coexisting with
   mobile monomers. Distinct association states exhibited characteristic
   behavior, i.e., partial-RET (monomer-monomer) associations were
   shorter-lived than complete-RET (protein-cluster) associations. While
   the fractional surface area covered by regions with high protein density
   (i.e., clusters) increased with increasing concentration, the
   distribution of contact times between monomers and clusters was
   independent of solution concentration, suggesting that associations were
   a local phenomenon, and independent of the global surface coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal performance degradation is a common symptom for the vast majority
   of Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects, who typically follow personalized
   one-to-one periodic rehabilitation meetings with speech experts over a
   long-term period. Recently, a novel computer program called Lee
   Silverman voice treatment (LSVT) Companion was developed to allow PD
   subjects to independently progress through a rehabilitative treatment
   session. This study is part of the assessment of the LSVT Companion,
   aiming to investigate the potential of using sustained vowel phonations
   towards objectively and automatically replicating the speech experts'
   assessments of PD subjects' voices as ``acceptable{''} (a clinician
   would allow persisting during in-person rehabilitation treatment) or
   ``unacceptable{''} (a clinician would not allow persisting during
   in-person rehabilitation treatment). We characterize each of the 156
   sustained vowel /a/ phonations with 309 dysphonia measures, select a
   parsimonious subset using a robust feature selection algorithm, and
   automatically distinguish the two cohorts (acceptable versus
   unacceptable) with about 90\% overall accuracy. Moreover, we illustrate
   the potential of the proposed methodology as a probabilistic decision
   support tool to speech experts to assess a phonation as ``acceptable{''}
   or ``unacceptable.{''} We envisage the findings of this study being a
   first step towards improving the effectiveness of an automated
   rehabilitative speech assessment tool.}},

Abstract = {{Organic matter content and chemistry is vital to the structure and
   function of soil systems, but while organic matter is recognized as
   biogeochemically important, its chemical interaction with soil processes
   is not well understood. In this study we used fluorescence spectroscopy,
   which has been used extensively for understanding the role of organic
   matter in aquatic systems, to identify chemical changes in organic
   matter with depth in a soil system. Soil was collected from nine
   different pits in a first-order montane catchment in the Colorado Front
   Range. The water-soluble soil organic matter was extracted from each
   sample and fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopy was used to analyze its
   chemical character. While organic matter chemistry had little
   correlation with landscape location and local vegetation, there were
   noticeable consistent trends between soil horizon and organic matter
   chemistry in each pit. Total organic matter decreased with depth and
   became less aromatic with increasing depth. This less aromatic material
   in the saprolite also had a greater microbial signature. The redox
   character of the organic matter accompanied this change in source and
   molecular structure, with more oxidized character corresponding with
   organic matter with more microbial input and more reduced character
   corresponding to organic matter with more plant input. A concurrent
   investigation of the microbial population of the same soil samples also
   showed microbial population composition varying more with soil depth
   than landscape position, and depth changes in microbial diversity
   occurred concomitantly with depth changes in organic matter chemistry.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses sidelobe reduction of an antenna array pattern for
   reducing effects of ground or sea clutter of zenith-looking wind
   profiler radar. Simulations are performed for various shapes of compact

   radar. It is shown that minimal low-cost hardware modifications to
   existing compact ground planes of the 915-MHz radar allow for reduction
   of sidelobes of up to 5 dB. The results obtained on a single array are
   extended to a 449-MHz triple hexagonal array interferometric radar.
   Cross-correlation, transmit beam width, and sidelobe levels are
   evaluated for various clutter fence configurations and array spacings.
   The resulting sidelobes are as much as 10 dB below those without a
   clutter fence and can be easily incorporated into existing and future
   915 and 449-MHz wind profiler systems with minimal hardware
   modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Global Positioning System (GPS) multipath signals can be used to infer
   volumetric soil moisture around a GPS antenna. While most GPS users
   concentrate on the signal that travels directly from the satellite to
   the antenna, the signal that is reflected by nearby surfaces contains
   information about the environment surrounding the antenna. The
   interference between the direct and reflected signals produces a
   modulation that can be observed in temporal variations of the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data recorded by the GPS receiver. Changes
   in the dielectric constant of the soil, which are associated with
   fluctuations in soil moisture, affect the effective reflector height,
   amplitude, and phase of the multipath modulation. Empirical studies have
   shown that these changes in SNR data are correlated with near-surface
   volumetric soil moisture. This study uses an electrodynamic
   single-scattering forward model to test the empirical relationships
   observed in field data. All three GPS interferogram metrics (effective
   reflector height, phase, and amplitude) are affected by soil moisture in
   the top 5 cm of the soil; surface soil moisture (< 1-cm depth) exerts
   the strongest control. Soil type exerts a negligible impact on the
   relationships between GPS interferogram metrics and soil moisture. Phase
   is linearly correlated with surface soil moisture. The slope of the
   relationship is similar to that observed in field data. Amplitude and
   effective reflector height are also affected by soil moisture, although
   the relationship is nonlinear. Phase is the best metric derived from GPS
   data to use as a proxy for soil moisture variations.}},

Abstract = {{Since its first experimental realization, tip-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (TERS) has emerged as a potentially powerful nanochemical
   analysis tool. However, questions about the comparability and
   reproducibility of TERS data have emerged. This interlaboratory
   comparison study addresses these issues by bringing together different
   TERS groups to perform TERS measurements on nominally identical samples.
   Based on the spectra obtained, the absolute and relative peak positions,
   number of bands, peak intensity ratios, and comparability to reference
   Raman and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) data are discussed.
   Our general findings are that all research groups obtained similar
   spectral patterns, irrespective of the setup or tip that was used. The
   TERS (and SERS) spectra consistently showed fewer bands than the
   conventional Raman spectrum. When comparing these three methods, the
   spectral pattern match and substance identification is readily possible.
   Absolute and relative peak positions of the three major signals of
   thiophenol scattered by 19 and 9cm(-1), respectively, which can probably
   be attributed to different spectrometer calibrations. However, within
   the same group (but between different tips), the signals only scattered
   by 3cm(-1) on average. This study demonstrated the suitability of TERS
   as an analytical tool and brings TERS a big step forward to becoming a
   routine technique. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Upconversion of infrared radiation into visible light has been
   investigated for applications in photovoltaics and biological imaging.
   However, low conversion efficiency due to small absorption cross-section
   for infrared light (Yb3+), and slow rate of energy transfer (to Er3+
   states) has prevented application of upconversion photoluminescence
   (UPL) for diffuse sunlight or imaging tissue samples. Here, we utilize
   resonant surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) waves to enhance UPL in
   doped-lanthanide nanocrystals. Our analysis indicates that SPP waves not
   only enhance the electromagnetic field, and hence weak Purcell effect,
   but also increase the rate of resonant energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+
   ions by 6 fold. While we do observe strong metal mediated quenching
   (14-fold) of green fluorescence on flat metal surfaces, the
   nanostructured metal is resonant in the infrared and hence enhances the
   nanocrystal UPL. This strong Coulombic effect on energy transfer can
   have important implications for other fluorescent and excitonic systems
   too.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{780}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{We propose and analyze a new mechanism for the formation of the wide
   asynchronous binary population. These binary asteroids have wide
   semimajor axes relative to most near-Earth and main belt asteroid
   systems. Confirmed members have rapidly rotating primaries and
   satellites that are not tidally locked. Previously suggested formation
   mechanisms from impact ejecta, from planetary flybys, and directly from
   rotational fission events cannot satisfy all of the observations. The
   newly hypothesized mechanism works as follows: (1) these systems are
   formed from rotational fission, (2) their satellites are tidally locked,
   (3) their orbits are expanded by the binary
   Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (BYORP) effect, (4) their
   satellites desynchronize as a result of the adiabatic invariance between
   the libration of the secondary and the mutual orbit, and (5) the
   secondary avoids resynchronization because of the YORP effect. This
   seemingly complex chain of events is a natural pathway for binaries with
   satellites that have particular shapes, which define the BYORP effect
   torque that acts on the system. After detailing the theory, we analyze
   each of the wide asynchronous binary members and candidates to assess
   their most likely formation mechanism. Finally, we suggest possible
   future observations to check and constrain our hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Despite tremendous advances in the field of tissue engineering, a number
   of obstacles are still hindering its successful translation to the
   clinic. One of these challenges has been to design cell-laden scaffolds
   that can provide an appropriate environment for cells to successfully
   synthesize new tissue while providing a mechanical support that can
   resist physiological loads at the early stage of in situ implementation.
   A solution to this problem has been to balance tissue growth and
   scaffold degradation by creating new hydrogel systems that possess both
   hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation behaviors. Very little is known,
   however, about the complex behavior of these systems, emphasizing the
   need for a rigorous mathematical approach that can eventually assist and
   guide experimental advances. This paper introduces a mathematical and
   numerical formulation based on mixture theory, to describe the
   degradation, swelling, and transport of extracellular matrix (ECM)
   molecules released by cartilage cells (chondrocytes) within a hydrogel
   scaffold. The model particularly investigates the relative roles of
   hydrolytic and enzymatic degradations on ECM diffusion and their impacts
   on two important outcomes: the extent of ECM transport (and deposition)
   and the evolution of the scaffold's mechanical integrity. Numerical
   results based on finite element show that if properly tuned, enzymatic
   degradation differs from hydrolytic degradation in that it can create a
   degradation front that is key to maintaining scaffold stiffness while
   allowing ECM deposition. These results therefore suggest a hydrogel
   design that could enable successful in situ cartilage tissue
   engineering.}},

   This paper presents an experimentally validated numerical model that can

   investigations of different DMPPT architectures, as well as the impact
   of conversion efficiencies and power constraints. Results are presented
   for annual simulations of three representative partial shading scenarios
   and two scenarios where mismatches are due to aging over a period of 25
   years. It is shown that DMPPT solutions that are based on submodule

Title = {{Using single-trial EEG to predict and analyze subsequent memory}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{712-723}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{We show that it is possible to successfully predict subsequent memory
   performance based on single-trial EEG activity before and during item
   presentation in the study phase. Two-class classification was conducted
   to predict subsequently remembered vs. forgotten trials based on
   subjects' responses in the recognition phase. The overall accuracy
   across 18 subjects was 59.6\% by combining pre- and during-stimulus
   information. The single-trial classification analysis provides a
   dimensionality reduction method to project the high-dimensional EEG data
   onto a discriminative space. These projections revealed novel findings
   in the pre- and during-stimulus periods related to levels of encoding.
   It was observed that the pre-stimulus information (specifically
   oscillatory activity between 25 and 35 Hz)-300 to 0 ms before stimulus
   presentation and during-stimulus alpha (7-12 Hz) information between
   1000 and 1400 ms after stimulus onset distinguished between recollection
   and familiarity while the during-stimulus alpha information and temporal
   information between 400 and 800 ms after stimulus onset mapped these two
   states to similar values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used single-molecule tracking experiments to observe the motion of
   small hydrophobic fluorescent molecules at the interface between water
   and a solid surface that exhibited periodic chemical patterns. The

   of steps to periodic distances, consistent with theoretical predictions
   for diffusion in an atomic/molecular scale periodic potential.
   Surprisingly, this general behavior was observed here for surfaces
   exhibiting characteristic length scales three orders of magnitude larger
   than atomic/molecular dimensions, and may provide a new way to
   understand and control solid-liquid interfacial diffusion for molecular
   targeting applications.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{84-88}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The reflectivity spectrum of radiometer calibration targets with
   alternate geometries is studied in this letter. We have presented normal
   incidence plane-wave reflectivity of conical array and truncated square
   pyramid array in the frequency range {[}6, 200] GHz. Irrespective of
   whether the pyramid cross-section is circular or square, a
   base-to-height ratio of 1:4 or better is required to achieve
   reflectivity of -50 dB or lower for frequencies higher than the first
   Floquet harmonic cutoff frequency. It was found that the variations in
   the reflectivity at high frequencies are less pronounced for conical
   arrays compared to square pyramids. This could make conical structures
   more useful for broadband calibration purposes. In the case of truncated
   square pyramids, a reduction in tip sharpness affects the reflectivity
   at high frequencies substantially. It was found that the use of MF117 or
   MF124 as coating material instead of MF112 can reduce the reflectivity
   by similar to 15 dB. The study concludes with the use of the unscented
   transformation to overcome time consuming Monte Carlo simulations in
   order to quantify the effect of material property uncertainties in
   computational electromagnetic simulations.}},

Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{A linear thermoelastic isotropic material is considered. A complete
   solution in terms of three scalar potential functions for the coupled
   displacement-temperature equations of motion and heat equation is
   presented, where the governing equations for the potential functions are
   the wave, heat, or a repeated wave-heat equation. The completeness
   theorem is proven based on a retarded Newtonian potential function,
   existence of solutions for the repeated wave equation and heat equation,
   and perturbation theory. A connection is also made between a complete
   solution already existing in the literature and the solution introduced
   in this paper, which in itself is another method to prove the
   completeness. If no heat source exists, the number of potential
   functions is reduced to two. In some circumstances, the number of
   potential functions is reduced to only one, and the required conditions
   for this case are discussed. As a special case, the torsionless and
   rotationally symmetric configuration with respect to an arbitrary axis
   is carefully assessed. The degenerated case to elastodynamics is
   obtained, and it is shown that the solutions given here are identical to
   a complete solution, which already exists in the literature for the
   equations of motion. The potential functions may be used for
   elastostatics, if the time dependence of the displacement vector and the
   temperature, and also the potential functions, are suppressed. In
   analogy with the deformation theory of a fluid saturated poroelastic
   material, the results given here may be used in the theory related to
   steady-state water flow.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{738}},
Pages = {{105-123}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A direct numerical simulation is performed on the full time-dependent
   three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a spatially developing
   plane-channel flow at a Reynolds number of 10 000. Two-dimensional
   eigenfunctions based on the solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation are
   introduced at the inflow with random noise added to simulate a vibrating
   ribbon transition experiment. The flow is allowed to choose a natural
   path to secondary instability, either K-type (after Klebanoff) or H-type
   (after Herbert), depending on the amplitude of the two-dimensional
   disturbance. For low-amplitude two-dimensional disturbances (1\% of the
   centreline velocity), H-type modes are found to dominate, while a
   doubling of the amplitude (2\% of the centreline velocity) produces a
   mixed H-type/K-type disturbance field with explosive growth of the
   secondary modes. In addition, the use of a suction/blowing slot that is
   phase lagged with respect to a fixed wall pressure signal is
   demonstrated to significantly reduce the energy in the primary mode
   owing to the destruction of phase between the streamwise and wall-normal
   velocity components. The use of forward finite-time Lyapunov exponents
   to generate Lagrangian coherent structures as a means of flow
   visualization is also presented, showing qualitative agreement with
   previous experimental visualizations, and represents a viable means of
   identifying characteristic vortical flow structures.}},

Title = {{Kinetic-theory predictions of clustering instabilities in granular
   flows: beyond the small-Knudsen-number regime}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{738}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work we quantitatively assess, via instabilities, a
   Navier-Stokes-order (small-Knudsen-number) continuum model based on the
   kinetic theory analogy and applied to inelastic spheres in a homogeneous
   cooling system. Dissipative collisions are known to give rise to
   instabilities, namely velocity vortices and particle clusters, for
   sufficiently large domains. We compare predictions for the critical
   length scales required for particle clustering obtained from transient
   simulations using the continuum model with molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. The agreement between continuum simulations and MD
   simulations is excellent, particularly given the presence of
   well-developed velocity vortices at the onset of clustering. More
   specifically, spatial mapping of the local velocity-field Knudsen
   numbers (Kn(u)) at the time of cluster detection reveals Kn(u) >> 1 due
   to the presence of large velocity gradients associated with vortices.
   Although kinetic-theory-based continuum models are based on a small-Kn
   (i.e. small-gradient) assumption, our findings suggest that, similar to
   molecular gases, Navier-Stokes-order (small-Kn) theories are
   surprisingly accurate outside their expected range of validity.}},

Abstract = {{Immunogenicity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a concern
   because of the effects of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) on therapeutic
   efficacy. Particulate matter has been suggested as a potential
   contributing factor to immunogenicity. In this study, we investigated
   ADA levels in mice in response to administration of a murine
   immunoglobulin G (IgG)2c/ mAb (mAb1) that was generated in C57BL/6J
   mice. Particles of mAb1 were formed by adsorbing the protein to glass
   microparticles. Formulations containing microparticles were administered
   subcutaneously to mice of either the syngeneic strain, C57Bl/6J, or the
   allogeneic strain, BALB/c. ADA levels were measured using an
   isotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Whereas
   BALB/c mice showed strong IgG1 and IgG2b responses against both the
   particulate and native mAb1 samples, adsorption of mAb1 to particles
   rendered it slightly more immunogenic than its native, soluble form. In
   BALB/c mice, immunoglobulin M (IgM) was produced after the first week of
   injections and then faded gradually. In contrast, C57BL/6J mice showed
   moderate IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 responses to injections of glass
   particle-adsorbed mAb1. ADA responses were higher in the allogeneic
   BALB/c mice, which do not produce mAbs of the IgG2c/ isotype. Thus, the
   presence of both foreign epitopes and particles may be important in
   inducing ADA responses. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

Abstract = {{Evaluation and mitigation of the risk of immunogenicity to protein
   aggregates and particles in therapeutic protein products remains a
   primary concern for drug developers and regulatory agencies. To
   investigate how the presence of protein particles and the route of
   administration influence the immunogenicity of a model therapeutic
   protein, we measured the immune response in mice to injections of
   formulations of recombinant murine growth hormone (rmGH) that contained
   controlled levels of protein particles. Mice were injected twice over 6
   weeks with rmGH formulations via the subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or
   intravenous (i.v.) routes. In addition to soluble, monomeric rmGH, the
   samples prepared contained either nanoparticles of rmGH or both nano-
   and microparticles of rmGH. The appearance of anti-rmGH IgG1, IgG2a,
   IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 titers following the second injection of both
   preparations implies that multiple mechanisms contributed to the immune
   response. No dependence of the immune response on particle size and
   distribution was observed. The immune response measured after the second
   injection was most pronounced when i.v. administration was used. Despite
   producing high anti-rmGH titers mice appeared to retain the ability to
   properly regulate and use endogenous growth hormone. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{To improve the effectiveness of the polio vaccination campaign,
   improvements in the thermal stability of the vaccine are being
   investigated. Here, inactivated polio vaccine, serotype 3 (IPV3) was
   characterized via a number of biophysical techniques. The size was
   characterized by transmission electronic microscopy and light
   scattering. The capsid protein conformation was evaluated by intrinsic
   fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD), and the D-antigen content by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The pH thermal stability of
   IPV3 (pH 3.0-8.0; 10 degrees C-87.5 degrees C) was evaluated by
   fluorescence, CD, and static light scattering. The transition
   temperatures reflect the responses, respectively, of tertiary structure,
   secondary structure, and size to applied thermal stress. The data were
   summarized as empirical phase diagrams, and the most stable conditions
   were found to be pH 7.0 with temperature lower than 40 degrees C. CD
   detected a higher transition temperature for capsid protein than that
   for RNA. The effects of certain excipients on IPV3 thermal stability and
   antigen content were evaluated. The results of their effects, based on
   intrinsic fluorescence and ELISA, were in good agreement, suggesting the
   feasibility of applying intrinsic fluorescence as a high-throughput tool
   for formulation development. The study improves the understanding of
   IPV3 thermal stability, and provides a starting point for future
   formulation development of IPV3 and other serotypes. (c) 2013 Wiley

   significant perceptual difference of TE and TFS between Mandarin Chinese
   and American English when the interference noise is speech-shaped noise.
   However, there is a distinct relative perceptual importance difference
   when the interference noise is a competing speech. The results also show
   that speech perception in Mandarin Chinese language is more sensitive to
   TFS distortion than is American English. In addition, with fewer
   auditory channels (one or two bands), speech perception in American
   English is more sensitive to TE distortion compared to Mandarin Chinese.
   Finally, the related discussions are made according to the perceptual
   difference between tonal language and non-tonal language regarding the
   speech signal processing strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a MMIC GaN X-band PA designed to have improved
   efficiency by second harmonic power injection at the output that helps
   shape the time-domain waveforms across the drain. The MMIC contains a
   class-AB PA with a nominal 4-W (36 dBm) output power at 10GHz and a
   small-signal gain of 14 dB. The best results with harmonic injection
   were measured at 10.6 GHz with 3.5W (35.44 dBm) of output, showing an
   increase in drain efficiency from 48.5\% without injection to 70\% when
   26.2dBm was injected at 21.2 GHz. In order to maximize the total
   efficiency, which includes the efficiency of the injection circuit, a
   second harmonic efficient amplifier is integrated in the same GaN MMIC.
   The 20-GHz PA needs to provide a power on the order of P-out - 10dB, and
   is measured to output 27dBm with 8 dB gain and PAE=59\%. The
   relationship between the total efficiency and injector efficiency is
   derived and shows that the total efficiency is not appreciably affected
   by the injector efficiency if a second-harmonic amplifier with a gain
   greater than 6-7 dB and with a PAE > 40\% is employed.}},

   capacity shortfall in the presence of everincreasing wireless data
   demand. In this paper, we formulate demand shaping as an optimization
   problem that minimizes the variation in aggregate traffic. We design a
   distributed and randomized offline demand shaping algorithm under
   complete traffic information and prove its almost surely convergence. We
   further consider a more realistic setting where the traffic information
   is incomplete but future traffic can be predicted to a certain accuracy.
   We design an online demand shaping algorithm that updates the schedules
   of deferrable applications each time when new information and updated
   prediction are available, based on solving at each timeslot an
   optimization problem over a shrinking horizon from the current time to
   the end of the day. We compare the performance of the online algorithm
   against the optimal offline algorithm, and provide numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss work at NIST aimed at developing a passive microwave
   brightness temperature standard. By reducing uncertainty, we can provide
   better calibrations for future weather and climate-monitoring
   radiometers. We discuss the calibration procedure used, measured data,
   and various theoretical and simulated results that have led to an
   improved understanding of the various uncertainty contributions in the
   measurement. We overview a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the
   uncertainty in target brightness temperature as a function of
   measurement distance and target size. We also discuss other future
   improvements including an improved blackbody design. The achievable
   calibration source brightness temperature uncertainty is expected to be
   reduced from the current 0.7 to 1.0 K from 18 to 65 GHz to less than 0.3
   K.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to characterize the social responsibility
   (SR) attitudes of first year engineering students, determine if these
   attitudes changed during the first year in college, and whether students
   cited courses and/or volunteer activities as having impacted these
   views. First year students from four institutions participated in an
   online survey at the beginning and end of the 2012/2013 academic year.
   The majority of the 164 respondents were majoring in civil,
   environmental, or mechanical engineering. Based on the validated
   Engineering Professional Responsibility Assessment (EPRA), there was
   little change in the SR attitudes among the cohort as a whole. However,
   28 individuals (17\%) decreased in SR attitudes and 26 individuals
   (16\%) increased in SR attitudes. Of the students whose SR increased,
   58\% listed one or more courses that influenced their views of SR,
   compared to only 38\% of the students who did not change in SR and 25\%
   of the students who decreased in SR. Common themes of the courses that
   were discussed by the students were international, community, ethics,
   service learning projects, and development. The survey also gathered
   information about students' participation in volunteer activities.
   Students who showed a positive change in SR had the highest average
   volunteer frequency scores of 11.1, compared to average volunteer
   frequency scores of 9.9 and 9.0 for groups of students with no change or
   negative changes in SR scores, respectively. The results suggest that
   courses and volunteer experiences may be effective ways to positively
   influence students' views of SR. On-going research will explore changes
   in students as they progress through the engineering curriculum using a
   longitudinal study.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering promotes itself with messages that engineers help people,
   which may help attract female students. But will the curriculum that the
   students find in college reinforce this desire to help people through
   engineering. or will they decide that they are better able to pursue
   this goal through other avenues? This study explored the attitudes of
   female students at the end of their first semester in engineering in
   order to help answer this question. Students' reflective essays from
   first year introduction to civil engineering (CE), environmental
   engineering (EvE), and architectural engineering (AE) courses were
   analyzed for content. The students were asked to discuss if they were
   interested in continuing to major in CE/EvE/AE and why or why not. A
   rubric was used to score the extent to which the students indicated that
   helping people was a motivation toward engineering; 35\% of CE students
   and 32\% of EvE students indicated that their primary motivation toward
   the major was the ability to help people. Engineers Without Borders
   (EWB) and first-year projects courses were beneficial in helping
   students understand the potential for engineering to positively impact
   people's lives. Of the students who indicated that their primary reason
   for selecting an engineering major was to help people, 50\% persisted in
   CE, AE, or EvE disciplines, 11\% transferred to other engineering
   disciplines, and 39\% transferred to non-engineering disciplines. These
   students cited multiple reasons for plans to transfer out of
   engineering. Most of the students motivated to a career where they could
   help people maintained this vision for non-engineering disciplines. The
   study results indicate that serving society through engineering is a
   significant motivation for many female students and that further
   emphasis on the societal benefits of engineering in the first year might
   help to retain these students.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which
   require access to clean water and sanitation, UNESCO 1 estimates that
   2.5 million new engineers and technicians are needed in sub-Saharan
   Africa alone. Fortunately, engineers are responding to such needs
   through larger participation in engineering development organizations
   and curricula. Among these programs, Engineers Without Borders-USA
   (EWB-USA) stands out as one of the largest and most senior of
   engineering for development programs in the US, making it an important
   group to study in order to gain insight into engineers who participate
   within these organizations. This research aims to understand differences
   between engineers involved and not involved with the organization to
   help educators and employers better understand engineers of the future.
   Extensive qualitative data collection led to the creation of a survey to
   test pre-educational traits, educational gains, and career expectations
   between engineers involved and not involved with EWB-USA to help address
   whether engineers involved in EWB-USA are different from engineers not
   involved in EWB-USA. This paper presents and discusses the results of
   responses from 566 engineering students at the University of Colorado,
   Boulder. Results showed significant differences in which EWB-USA
   engineers displayed different personality traits and community service
   attitudes, higher professional ABET learning outcomes, and higher
   expectations of professional skills in their future careers than
   engineers not involved with the organization. These results can help
   inform how to recruit, create, and retain engineers to work toward the
   MDGs and other major challenges that engineers of the future can
   address.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive screencasts and interactive simulations were prepared and
   made openly available online to increase student interaction with
   chemical engineering teaching resources. Screencasts are short
   (typically less than 10 min) videos made using screen capture software
   and voice narration. Interactive screencasts pose conceptual questions
   that the viewer can answer by clicking on the answer within the video.
   Selecting an answer opens another video. If they selected the incorrect
   answer, the video indicates this and it may give them a hint or tell why
   the answer is incorrect. Then it allows them to select another answer,
   which opens another video. This continues until they choose the correct
   answer; that video then explains why the answer is correct. Similarly,
   interactive Mathematica simulations allow users to manually change
   variables and almost instantly see the effects on the system behavior.
   This encourages student interaction with part of an assignment, and can
   also be used in class where students are asked to predict system
   behavior. More than 400 chemical engineering simulations, prepared by a
   number of authors, are available on the Wolfram Demonstrations Project
   website. We have prepared about 25 of these simulations and are starting
   to prepare screencast that explain their use.}},

Abstract = {{Over 1,000 screencasts have been developed for chemical engineering
   courses. Screencasts are short videos (typically less than 10 minutes)
   with narration and are made by digital capture of a tablet PC screen.
   Screencasts can introduce a topic, solve an example problem, explain a
   concept, explain a diagram and process, demonstrate software use, review
   for an exam, or present a mini-lecture. They can be used in combination
   with textbooks, online reading quizzes, homework assignments, and office
   hours. They can also be used to create flipped classrooms, where
   students work under the supervision of the instructor during class and
   information delivery is outside of class. Their brevity is an important
   attribute that distinguishes them from video lectures, and they have
   significant advantages that supplement textbooks and written materials.
   This personalized method of learning empowers students by giving them
   control over the rate of information delivery and when they receive
   information. As of December 2013, these videos were watched/downloaded
   over 3.2 million times, and they have received an
   overwhelmingly-positive response from students in our classes and from
   YouTube viewers. These screencasts are in the process of being validated
   by chemical engineering faculty. We are also assessing their
   effectiveness in improving student learning gains and attitudes.

Abstract = {{The main hurdles for faculty to implement more effective teaching
   methods in their classrooms are a lack of resources and/or a lack of
   experience with the techniques. In an effort to reduce these hurdles and
   encourage more faculty to use these methods, we have created a digital,
   open-access course package for two chemical engineering courses,
   thermodynamics and material and energy balances. These course packages
   can also be used as templates for faculty who want to develop other
   courses that are student-centric and involve active learning. Many of
   the resources within the package stem from our online inventory of over
   1,400 ConcepTests and 1,000 screencasts. These encompass topics in core
   chemical engineering courses, but many topics are also common to other
   engineering disciplines (i.e., fluid mechanics, heat transfer,
   thermodynamics, material science, and computing). The course packages
   use Microsoft OneNote, which allows the user to centralize all materials
   in one document. These course packages contain ready-to-use class
   templates, suggested readings and screencasts for students to complete
   prior to class, in-class ConcepTests, homework problems, and exam
   questions. The materials are aligned to popular textbooks but allow
   flexibility because they can be easily rearranged to meet individual
   needs. Resources and guides on implementing the methods in a class are
   also provided. These resources provide literature, best practices, and
   suggestions on using the course materials. The objective is to make it
   easier for faculty to convert to active learning instruction and towards
   a flipped class, where most of the information delivery is outside of
   the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{The literature regarding gender in construction engineering and
   management is emerging, with scholars in the area split in their use and
   analysis of gender issues. In general, one group focuses on sex and the
   other on gender and sexuality. While many social scientists and
   humanists differentiate sex and gender and recognize gender as the
   social construction of biological sex, scholars in construction tend not
   to differentiate the two. This distinction is, however, important as it
   has consequences for academic studies and gender issues in industry.
   This paper argues that the discrepancy between these paths needs to be
   addressed to better understand and solve gender issues. To determine the
   current state of practice, this research analyzed three top engineering
   and management journals - Construction Engineering and Management,
   Construction Economics and Management and the Journal of Professional
   Issues in Engineering Education and Practice-from 1998 to 2012. Twenty
   one papers were identified using a keyword search of ``gender{''} and
   ``sex{''}. A discourse analysis of the research questions, results and
   recommendations was performed, using these thematic areas as the macro
   coding categories. The research contributes to the field of gender in
   construction engineering by addressing the difference between the
   existing research paths. To advance the field, the authors suggest that
   future research questions consider both gender and sex.}},

Abstract = {{Engineers play a significant role in society, but the extent to which
   students consider this role as a desirable career attribute and extend
   their beliefs about the social responsibility (SR) of engineers beyond
   basic ethical foundations is not fully understood. A qualitative study
   was completed to understand how first year engineering students define
   SR and how it relates to engineering. Thirty-four first year engineering
   students with a range of attitudes toward SR, as previously assessed by
   a valid survey instrument, were invited to participate in interviews.
   The majority of these students were initially majoring in mechanical,
   civil, or environmental engineering at four institutions. Students
   defined SR differently, but generally linked engineering to SR in some
   manner. First year introduction to engineering courses that discussed
   ethics were cited by more than a third of the students as contributing
   to their ideas about SR. Three students with strong views of SR left
   engineering, due in part to the disconnect they felt between their goals
   to help people and society and the impacts they felt they could have as
   engineers, as judged from what they learned in classes. From the
   interview analysis, it seems that first year courses, specifically the
   ethics component, may have a high potential to affect students'
   connections of the engineering profession to social issues and problems
   they care about addressing. All students who participated in the
   interview will be interviewed again in their second and third years to
   understand how their ideas about SR and engineering change as they
   continue their college careers.}},

Abstract = {{Both the National Academy of Engineering and engineering education
   researchers underscore a necessity that U.S. engineering graduates be
   capable of collaborating across national boundaries to successfully
   ``encounter worlds of professional practice that are increasingly global
   in nature.{''} As a result, this emphasis requires engineering educators
   and professionals to better understand what constitutes a globally
   prepared engineer and the types of learning experiences foster
   preparation of such an engineer.
   This paper offers an overview of a NSF funded multi-university research
   program that investigates how globally focused learning experiences
   within engineering (both co- and extra-curricular) impact students'
   global preparedness. The research protocol involves three studies and
   dissemination platform, each of which is in different levels of
   completion.
   Results from this study offer the engineering education community a set
   of impactful and flexible research-based globally focused engineering
   education pedagogical practices that correlate to learning, diverse
   student populations, and program types.}},

Abstract = {{For over two decades, a number of engineering faculty members at a
   research institution of higher education in the United States have
   successfully integrated service-learning in their courses as an
   effective curricular strategy. While some faculty members have continued
   to integrate service-learning in their teaching, others have
   discontinued its use. This inquiry examines the reasons faculty
   discontinued the integration of service-learning in their courses.
   Specifically, it focuses on engineering faculty members at a public
   research university. Most studies on faculty involvement with
   service-learning have focused on factors that influence whether or not
   faculty adopt service-learning pedagogy, and no study has investigated
   factors for discontinuing the use of service-learning in engineering. A
   qualitative research approach is used to conduct in-depth interviews of
   engineering faculty using a semi structured protocol. The interviews
   were aimed at identifying the faculty experience, and at interpreting
   the reasons for discontinuation. The research findings indicate that
   faculty discontinued the use of service-learning simply because they no
   longer teach the course. Even so, the common theme that emerged among
   the faculty was that most believed in service-learning's intended
   educational outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Improving STEM education requires valid and reliable instruments for
   providing insight into student thinking. Constructed response (CR)
   assessments reveal more about student thinking and the persistence of
   misconceptions than do multiple-choice questions, but require more
   analysis on the part of educators.
   In the Automated Analysis of Constructed Response (AACR) Research Group
   (www.msu.edu/similar to aacr) we have developed constructed response
   versions of well-established conceptual assessment inventories and
   created computer automated analysis resources that predict human ratings
   of student writing about these topics in introductory STEM courses. The
   research uses a two-stage, feature-based approach to automated analysis
   of constructed response assessments. First, we design items to identify
   important disciplinary constructs based on prior research. The items are
   administered via online course management systems where students enter
   responses. We use lexical analysis software to extract key terms and
   scientific concepts from the students' writing. These terms and concepts
   are used as variables for statistical classification techniques to
   predict expert ratings of student responses. The inter-rater reliability
   (IRR) between automated predictions and expert human raters is as high
   as IRR between human experts.
   We recently received another round of funding to extend our work to
   provide an online community where instructors may obtain, score and
   contribute to the library of items and resources necessary for their
   analyses. We provide an overview of the goals of the project and
   introduce the opportunities to participate in the development of a
   national network of faculty}},

Abstract = {{K-12 engineering programs are rapidly increasing around the nation,
   particularly at the high school level. Integrating opportunities for
   high school students to repeatedly practice engineering skills has been
   suggested to increase students' interest in pursuing a career in
   engineering. However, little research exists to show the real impacts on
   the students' attitudes towards engineering and where they end up after
   high school. Also, as the number of programs increases, so does the need
   for qualified teachers to instruct those courses. 1 The majority of K-12
   teachers do not have a background in engineering; more times than not,
   they do not know what an engineer does, nor do they have knowledge of
   the different disciplines of engineering, thusly making it difficult to
   effectively encourage their students to pursue engineering as a
   career.(2,3) One challenge for schools wanting to better implement the
   ``E{''} in STEM is the training required of teachers to effectively
   teach engineering in the classroom.
   This paper examines 76 students who completed engineering courses in a
   targeted STEM Academy program over four years of high school. Data is
   analyzed from multiple sources, including semester surveys that provide
   an in-depth look at students' changing interests and attitudes towards
   engineering over four years in the Academy, retention rates of students
   in the program, and what intended career path these students chose after
   graduation. In addition, the STEM Academy teachers who taught this group
   of students over four years provide their views on their students'
   growth and progress, as well as their opinions of the STEM Academy's
   progression and effectiveness.
   This paper examines how an integrated four-year engineering program in
   high school impacts students over multiple years, as well as gives
   insight into the effectiveness of this kind of program when taught by
   teachers of varying backgrounds trained in partnership with a local
   university. Specifically, this paper addresses the following question,
   ``Does four years of engineering education at the high school level,
   when taught by qualified teachers, significantly increase students'
   interests and attitudes towards engineering, as well as increase the
   number of students who pursue an engineering-related path after high
   school?{''}}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a continuation of the work conducted in Chhabra, M.,
   Barnes, F., ``Robust Current Controller Design using Mu-Synthesis for
   Grid-Connected Three Phase Inverter{''} {[}1]. High penetration of
   distributed photovoltaic generation on a distribution system can present
   several challenges and opportunities for utilities. Voltage sags and
   swells cannot always be compensated for by slowly responding utility
   equipment, resulting in degradation in power quality. Voltage variations
   are commonly caused by rapidly varying solar irradiance, and/or
   variations in the load. In this paper a robust current controller based
   solar-inverter system is used for voltage regulation at a substation.
   Conventional inverter current controllers based on proportional-integral
   (PI) control may not always offer the superior tracking performance, and
   harmonic rejection ability of robust controllers. We use the repetitive
   control strategy, in tandem with a mu-synthesis based controller, to
   attain optimal sinusoidal reference tracking and harmonic rejection.
   Mu-synthesis based control is chosen to attain optimal reference
   tracking in the presence of plant uncertainties. By applying the
   mu-synthesis principle, a feedback controller that simultaneously
   achieves robust stability and robust tracking performance is obtained.
   To test the proposed inverter current controller, the inverter is
   interconnected to a 500kW solar system model and operated in volt-var
   control mode. Ten such 500kW solar-inverter systems are paralleled and
   interconnected to a substation. The substation is modeled with multiple
   loads, tap changing transformers, and a 70MVar variable capacitor bank.
   Simulation performance is compared to an H infinity based optimal
   current controller, and a PI based current controller.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a robust current control strategy is proposed for a grid
   connected three phase inverter. Current controllers based on
   proportional-integral (PI) control may not always offer the superior
   tracking performance and harmonic rejection ability of robust
   controllers. Robust control design offers the ability to design a
   controller that is robust to modeled uncertainties in the plant. A
   typical inverter may experience fluctuations in its input DC voltage due
   to uncertainties in the DC power source. In the case of a
   solar-inverter, large fluctuations in the input DC voltage typically
   occur due to varying irradiance levels, and phase and ground faults. An
   inverter is usually designed to disconnect from service in case its DC
   voltage strays outside a pre-defined operating range. With a current
   controller that's robust with respect to fluctuations in the input DC
   voltage, the inverter's operating range could be widened, giving the
   user more flexibility when designing their system. A common step in the
   PI based current controller operation is the transformation of three
   phase signals to their direct-quadrature equivalent. With the use of the
   repetitive control strategy, the transformation step is no longer
   required. The repetitive control strategy is chosen because it can
   reject a large number of harmonics simultaneously, while providing a
   clean sinusoidal current waveform to the grid, even in the presence of
   grid load and/or voltage distortions. The repetitive control strategy is
   implemented via the internal model principle (IMP). By applying
   mu-synthesis principles, a feedback controller that simultaneously
   achieves robust stability and robust tracking performance is obtained.
   To test the proposed inverter controller, the inverter is interconnected
   to a 500kW solar system. The solar-inverter system model is subject to a
   host of test scenarios. Simulation performance is compared to an H
   infinity based optimal current controller, and a PI based current
   controller.}},

   devices with a high V-oc (up to 1.35 V) were fabricated with a high band

   electron-acceptor. The copolymer (PInCZ), based on carbazole and
   indolocarbazole monomers, posseses a deep lying HOMO (Highest Occupied

Abstract = {{The goal in networked control of multiagent systems is to derive
   desirable collective behavior through the design of local control
   algorithms. The information available to the individual agents, either
   attained through communication or sensing, invariably defines the space
   of admissible control laws. Hence, informational restrictions impose
   constraints on achievable performance guarantees. This paper provides
   one such constraint with regard to the efficiency of the resulting
   stable solutions for a class of networked resource allocation problems
   with submodular objective functions. When the agents have full
   information regarding the mission space, the efficiency of the resulting
   stable solutions is guaranteed to be within 50\% of optimal. However,
   when the agents have only localized information about the mission space,
   which is a common feature of many well-studied control designs, the
   efficiency of the resulting stable solutions can be 1/n of optimal,
   where n is the number of agents. Consequently, in general such schemes
   cannot guarantee that systems comprised of n agents can perform any
   better than a system comprised of a single agent for identical
   environmental conditions. The last part of this paper highlights an
   algorithm that overcomes this limitation by allowing the agents to
   communicate minimally with neighboring agents.}},

Abstract = {{The framework of resource allocation games is becoming an increasingly
   popular modeling choice for distributed control and optimization. In
   recent years, this approach has evolved into the paradigm of
   game-theoretic control, which consists of first modeling the interaction
   between the distributed agents as a strategic form game, and then
   designing local utility functions for these agents such that the
   resulting game possesses a stable outcome (e.g., a pure Nash
   equilibrium) that is efficient (e.g., good ``price of anarchy{''}
   properties). One then appeals to the large, existing literature on
   learning in games for distributed algorithms for agents that guarantee
   convergence to such an equilibrium. An important first problem is to
   obtain a characterization of stable utility designs, that is, those that
   guarantee equilibrium existence for a large class of games. Recent work
   has explored this question in the general, multi-selection context, that
   is, when agents are allowed to choose more than one resource at a time,
   showing that the only stable utility designs are the so-called
   ``weighted Shapley values{''}. It remains an open problem to obtain a
   similar characterization in the single-selection context, which several
   practical problems such as vehicle target assignment, sensor coverage,
   etc. fall into. We survey recent work in the multi-selection scenario,
   and show that even though other utility designs become stable for
   specific single-selection applications, perhaps surprisingly, in a
   broader context, the limitation to ``weighted Shapley value{''} utility
   design continues to prevail.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of distributed learning literature focuses on convergence
   to Nash equilibria. Correlated equilibria, on the other hand, can often
   characterize more efficient collective behavior than even the best Nash
   equilibrium. However, there are no existing distributed learning
   algorithms that converge to specific correlated equilibria. In this
   paper, we provide one such algorithm which guarantees that the agents'
   collective joint strategy will constitute an efficient correlated
   equilibrium with high probability. The key to attaining efficient
   correlated behavior through distributed learning involves incorporating
   a common random signal into the learning environment.}},

Abstract = {{The second largest attrition rate during an undergraduate engineering
   degree occurs during the second (sophomore) year. Students who persist
   past the first year of engineering school find themselves at a
   transitional, stressful, and competitive turning point as they enter the
   final math and physics requirements for their degrees. We adopt an
   ethnographic approach to investigate the environments of critical
   engineering mathematics gateway courses in second (sophomore) year that
   serve as prerequisite barriers to subsequent coursework and eventual
   graduation. Utilizing classroom observation and semi-structured
   interviews with students and instructors, we have a rich dataset to
   analyze through three intersecting conceptual frameworks: critical
   ethnography, cultural analysis, and actor-network theory (ANT). The
   concept of a cultural norm is paramount to our analysis, basically
   anything that becomes ``normal{''} to a cultural unit such as an
   engineering classroom. This paper describes our ongoing analyses that
   aspire to uncover the processes wherein cultural norms are created,
   maintained, challenged, adjusted, and reinforced in everyday classroom
   practice. We seek to understand the powerful impact of these cultural
   norms on students' desires to remain in engineering majors past

Abstract = {{Design is widely considered to be the central or distinguishing activity
   of engineering and yet it remains an insufficiently researched and
   understood topic. From the perspective of engineering education, where a
   ``disconnect{''} between professional engineering practices and
   university-based practices is an oft-discussed limitation, the
   sparseness of research on professional engineering design is noteworthy.
   Specific representations of real engineering practices are necessary to
   inform attempts to prepare future engineers. The present study attends
   to the location of engineering design in different organizational
   settings, as a way of examining the nature of purported
   ``disconnects{''} between professional engineering design practices and
   those taking place in the undergraduate curriculum. Our core methodology
   is that of cognitive ethnography, which examines how cognitive tasks, in
   our case design, are accomplished within ``functional systems{''}
   constituted of heterogeneous elements, both human and nonhuman. Our
   focus is on ``how the work of the organization{''} gets done through the
   process of design. This work in progress (WIP) paper explores the
   spatiotemporal organization of activity as a key aspect of the
   situatedness and heterogeneity of design work, and reports preliminary
   findings regarding important differences in how design is organized in

Abstract = {{Large-scale simulations conducted on supercomputers such as
   leadership-class computing facilities allow researchers to simulate and
   study complex problems with high fidelity, and thus have become
   indispensable in diverse areas of science and engineering. These
   high-fidelity simulations generate vast amount of data which is becoming
   more and more difficult to transform into knowledge using traditional
   visual analysis approaches. For instance, there are tremendous
   challenges in analyzing big data produced by high-fidelity simulations
   in order to gain meaningful insight into complex phenomena such as
   turbulent two-phase flows. The traditional workflow, which consists in
   conducting simulations on supercomputers and recording enormous raw
   simulation data to disk for further post-processing and visualization,
   is no longer a viable approach due to prohibitive cost of disk access
   and considerable amount of time spent on data transfer. Visual Analytics
   approaches for big data have to be researched and employed to address
   the problem of knowledge discovery from such large-scale simulations.
   One approach to tackle this issue is to couple a numerical simulation
   with in-situ visualization so that the post-processing and visualization
   occurs while the simulation is running. This in-situ approach minimizes
   data storage by extracting and visualizing important features of the
   data directly within the simulation without saving the raw data to disk.
   In addition, in-situ visualization allows users to steer the simulation
   by adjusting input parameters while the simulation is ongoing. In this
   paper, we present our approach for in-situ visualization of simulation
   data generated by massively parallel finite-element computational fluid
   dynamics solver (PHASTA) instrumented and linked with ParaView Catalyst.
   We demonstrate our in-situ visualization and simulation steering
   capability with a fully resolved turbulent flow through 2 x 2 reactor
   subchannel complex geometry. In addition, we present results from our
   in-situ visualization for turbulent flow simulations conducted on the
   supercomputers Cray XK7 ``Titan{''} at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and
   IBM BlueGene/Q ``Mira{''} at Argonne National Laboratory up to 32,768
   cores and examine the overhead of insitu visualization and its effect on
   code performance.}},

   downdraft of the supercell thunderstorm as an interesting candidate for
   such a mission, and examines the potential for soaring in the region.
   This knowledge is combined with sampling techniques employed in previous
   field experiments to produce an energy efficient path at an altitude and
   location identified as an interesting area for in situ sampling. The
   path is tested using a flight through simulated storm data, and is shown
   to provide a net positive gain in energy to the vehicle. This
   encouraging result indicates the possibility of extending the sampling

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the signal-anticipating behavior in local

   game, and show that the signal-anticipating voltage control is the best
   response algorithm of the voltage control game. We further show that the
   voltage control game has a unique Nash equilibrium, characterize it as
   the optimum of a global optimization problem, and establish its
   asymptotic global stability. We then introduce the notion of the price
   of signal-anticipating (PoSA) to characterize the impact of the
   signal-anticipating in local voltage control, and use the gap in cost
   between the network equilibrium in the signal-taking voltage control and
   the Nash equilibrium in the signal-anticipating voltage control as the
   metric for PoSA. We characterize how the PoSA scales with the size,
   topology, and heterogeneity of the power network for a few special
   cases. We find that the stronger the coupling between different buses
   is, the larger the PoSA is; the linear network gives the largest PoSA
   among all possible topologies, but as the size of the network increases,
   the PoSA will saturate.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered manipulation of phonons can yield beneficial thermal
   properties in semiconducting materials. One pivotal application relates
   to thermoelectric materials, or the concept of conversion of a
   temperature difference into an electric voltage and vice-versa. The
   ability to use nanostructuring to reduce the thermal conductivity
   without negatively impacting the power factor provides a promising
   avenue for achieving high values of the thermoelectric energy conversion
   figure-of-merit, ZT. In this work, we propose a novel nanostructured
   material configuration that seeks to achieve this goal. Termed
   ``nanophononic metamaterial,{''} the configuration is based on a silicon
   thin-film with a periodic array of pillars erected on one or two of the
   free surfaces. The pillars qualitatively alter the base thin-film phonon
   spectrum due to a hybridization mechanism between their local resonances
   and the underlying atomic lattice dispersion. Using an
   experimentally-fitted lattice-dynamics- based model, we conservatively
   predict a drop in the thermal conductivity to as low as 50\% of the
   corresponding uniform thin-film value despite the fact that the pillars
   add more phonon modes to the spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Current approaches to simulate secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in
   regional and global numerical models are based on parameterizations of
   the oxidation of precursor gases in the gas-phase and subsequent
   partitioning into particles. Recent findings suggest however that
   formation in the aqueous-phase of aerosols might contribute
   substantially to ambient SOA load. In this work we investigate the
   contribution of glyoxal to SOA through chemical processes associated
   with aerosols. Both a very simple and a more explicit mechanism of SOA
   formation from glyoxal was included in the regional chemistry transport
   model WRF/Chem. We simulated the first 2 weeks of June 2010 over the
   domain of California to make use of the extensive dataset collected
   during the CARES/CalNex field campaigns to evaluate our simulations.
   Contributions to total SOA mass were found to range from 1 to 15 \% in
   the LA basin, and < 1 to 9 \% in the isoprene-rich eastern slopes of the
   Central Valley. We find that the simple approach previously used in box
   as well as global modeling studies gives the highest contributions. A
   combination of reversible partitioning and volume pathways can provide
   comparable amounts only if partitioning of glyoxal into the aerosol
   liquid-phase is instantaneous.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of estimator that incorporates optimal control and outputs a
   control policy is developed and analyzed in this study. The estimator is
   developed in a similar manner to a Kalman Algorithm with an almost
   identical form, but with additional properties for more accurate
   tracking. Unlike the Kalman Algorithm, this estimator frees up the
   initial state, which results in an algorithm that de couples a priori
   state uncertainty and dynamics uncertainty. The dynamic uncertainty
   inflates the state covariance in an automatic fashion that prevents
   filter saturation. The algorithm also outputs control estimates that may
   be used to both identify the presence of mismodeled dynamics and
   quantify those mismodeled dynamics. Simulations demonstrate the
   performance of this estimator compared to the Kalman Algorithm in
   several systems with varying types of dynamic mismodeling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of polynomial chaos for approximating the
   probability of a collision between two satellites after at least one
   performs a translation maneuver. Polynomial chaos provides a
   computationally efficient means to generate an approximate solution to a
   stochastic differential equation without introducing any assumptions on
   the a posteriori distribution. The stochastic solution then allows for
   orbit propagation uncertainty quantification. For the maneuvering
   spacecraft in the presented scenarios, the polynomial chaos expansion is
   sparse, allowing for the use of compressive sampling methods to improve
   solution tractability. This paper first demonstrates the use of these
   techniques for the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, which must
   regularly assess collision risks between the spacecraft in the
   formation. The techniques are then applied to a potential collision with
   debris in low Earth orbit. Results demonstrate that these polynomial
   chaos-based methods provide a Monte Carlo-like estimate of the collision
   probability, including adjustments for a spacecraft shape model, with
   only minutes of computation cost required.}},

   outcomes is sought to enable autonomous motion planning at close
   proximity to small bodies. A recent method, which adaptively refines a

   safety outcomes,1 is extended with a framework for tracking fulfillment
   of numerous science requirements. Runtime efficiency is greatly improved
   to facilitate the mapping of mission outcomes on 3D maneuver sets, which
   are generated for an orbiter of a uniformly rotating triaxial ellipsoid.
   Visualization tools are developed to ease access of the high-dimensional
   results, whose complex structure motivates the use of adaptive
   envisioning. In a preliminary application of these maps, an automated
   planner is demonstrated to produce mission profiles that safely satisfy
   several observation goals in a strongly perturbed orbital regime.}},

Abstract = {{The heliogyro is a spinning solar sail architecture with the sail
   membrane partitioned into extremely high aspect ratio ``blades{''}. It
   can pitch these blades to generate attitude control moments (similar to
   a helicopter) or change the direction of thrust. The heliogyro's
   performance for various Earth escape trajectories is evaluated,
   accounting for reasonable slew rates and thrust variation during
   attitude maneuvers. Additionally, several strategies are proposed that
   improve upon those in the literature. In most cases, the heliogyro's
   angular momentum is found to be too high to follow Earth escape
   trajectories that precess its spin axis. Fortunately, an improved escape
   strategy is found that is 87\% as good at the best ideal trajectory, and
   it does not precess the spin axis. This strategy would escape from
   geostationary orbit in approximately 150 days.}},

Abstract = {{An impulsive guidance scheme is presented which maintains the spacecraft
   on the stable manifold of a L-1 halo orbit in the Earth-Moon system in
   the presence of thrust errors in the manifold injection maneuver for a
   2-impulse ballistic transfer from LEO to the halo orbit. A Monte Carlo
   analysis is shown for the unguided case using Gaussian input dispersions
   in burn magnitude and direction to demonstrate the need of impulsive
   guidance. Two strategies based on the state transition matrix are
   presented, one using single burns that only target the manifold, and
   full burn pairs that target the manifold at t(1) and correct velocity
   errors at t(2). Both strategies effectively reduce the halo orbit
   insertion miss distances; however, the single burn strategy has lower
   Delta V costs for guidance. Lyapunov Exponents (Les) of the stable
   manifold are then obtained and used to determine the best locations to
   perform the TCMs, which also include similar thrust errors in the final
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the 6 degree-of-freedom motion of high
   area-to-mass ratio objects (representative of pieces of Mylar
   insulation) perturbed by solar radiation pressure (SRP) forces and
   torques. Particular emphasis is placed on the investigation of the
   attitude dynamics of these objects, as this component has typically been
   ignored in the literature associated with solar radiation pressure
   effects in favor of using the classical cannonball model which produces
   no torques. High-fidelity 6 degree-of-freedom simulations are used to
   investigate the attitude evolution of a constant shape, as well as for
   objects that flatten out as their spin rate increases. We find that
   while individual cases may vary to some degree, the main trend that
   holds is that all objects rapidly spin up about their minimum moment of
   inertia axis, whether they are allowed to deform or stay constant in
   shape.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates controlling spacecraft formations, as opposed to
   individual spacecraft in formation, with the intent to determine whether
   Leader Follower formations are error- or fuel-optimal. An formation
   optimal control problem is developed wherein formation slots and
   spacecraft barycenter weights are the formation control variables.
   Restricted formation control problems are presented which investigate
   the effect of controlling the individual spacecraft barycenter weights
   based on minimum Lyapunov formation error and also based on minimum fuel
   costs. It is shown that a Democratic formation works well with no
   a-priori knowledge of the formation state or orbit elements. Further,
   detailed simulation results suggest that Democratic formations tend to
   have lower overall fuel usage than strict Leader-Follower formations.
   Conclusions and future work are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A spacecraft hovering scheme over a uniformly rotating asteroid in the
   asteroid body-fixed frame using geometric mechanics is presented. The
   configuration space for the spacecraft is the Lie group SE(3), which is
   the set of positions and orientations of the rigid spacecraft in
   three-dimensional Euclidean space. The asteroid trajectory, in the form
   of natural attitude and translational (orbital) motion of a satellite,
   is assumed to be available through a spacecraft on-board navigation. The
   spacecraft tracks a desired relative configuration with respect to the
   asteroid in an autonomous manner. The relative configuration between the
   spacecraft and the asteroid is described in terms of exponential
   coordinates on the Lie group of rigid body motions. A continuous-time
   feedback tracking control using these exponential coordinates and the
   relative velocities is employed. A Lyapunov analysis guarantees that the
   spacecraft asymptotically converges to the desired trajectory. Numerical
   simulation results demonstrate the successful spacecraft hovering
   control in the asteroid body-fixed frame for a selected uniformly
   rotating asteroid.}},

   is zero, so that the orbits are frozen. We explore the dynamics and

Abstract = {{Most approximations for stochastic differential equations with
   high-dimensional, non-Gaussian inputs suffer from the curse of
   dimensionality, thereby increasing uncertainty propagation computation
   costs. In astrodynamics, this results in reduced probability density
   function propagation accuracy. This paper considers the application of
   separated representations for orbit uncertainty propagation, discusses
   the theory behind their generation, and presents results quantifying
   their benefits in astrodynamics. The computation cost of a separated
   representation varies quadratically with dimension, thereby improving
   tractability. Generation of a separated representation requires the
   propagation of a small number of samples and yields an approximate
   solution to a given stochastic differential equation. This paper
   examines two test cases of an Earth orbiting satellite using the two
   body problem. In the first case, la deviations in the initial conditions
   are relatively benign, while the second case considers larger
   deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Rigid body attitude estimation algorithms have been previously
   formulated using Modified Rodrigues Parameter (MRP) attitude sets. MRP
   attitude estimation algorithms are attractive because they have been
   shown to have equal accuracy to and faster initial convergence than
   similar quaternion based filters and they avoid the quaternion
   constraint problem. These algorithms make use of the fact that MRP sets
   are not unique. Two possible MRP sets can describe a particular
   orientation, and singularity avoidance can be performed by switching
   between the original MRP set and the alternate set, known as the shadow
   set. Unfortunately, the non-uniqueness of MRPs can lead to significant
   attitude estimation errors through improper calculation of the
   measurement residual. The present work examines the details required for
   proper implementation of a MRP attitude estimation algorithm,
   specifically the technical details of when and how to switch to and from
   the MRP shadow set when calculating the measurement residual.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of two different methods to estimate the sun direction
   vector using an underdetennined set of cosine-type coarse sun sensors is
   presented. These methods are used in conjunction with a control law to
   reorient a spacecraft to a power positive orientation. Coarse sun
   sensors are commonly used to perform coarse attitude determination and
   accurately point a spacecraft's solar arrays at the Sun. These sensors
   are attractive due to their relative inexpensiveness, small size, and
   reduced power consumption. This paper presents two methods for
   accurately solving for the sun direction vector with decreased sensor
   requirements, the first is a simple weighted average method and the
   second leverages an extended Kalman filter approach. Both methods are
   combined with a control law and shown through numerical simulation to be
   capable of reorienting the spacecraft from any initially unknown
   attitude to a power positive state in a matter of minutes. While the EKF
   provides a more accurate sun heading estimate, the weighted average
   approach is simpler to implement and insensitive to common coarse sun
   sensor output calibration errors.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to gain insight into age-related muscular limitations that may
   restrict the uphill walking ability of old adults. We hypothesized that:
   (1) old adults would exhibit smaller peak ankle joint kinetics and
   larger peak hip joint kinetics than young adults during both level and
   uphill walking and (2) these age-related differences in ankle and hip
   joint kinetics would be greatest during uphill vs. level walking. We
   quantified the sagittal plane ankle, knee, and hip joint kinetics of 10
   old adults (mean +/- SD, age: 72 +/- 5 yrs) and 8 young adults (age: 27
   +/- 5 yrs) walking at 1.25 m/s on a dual-belt, force-measuring treadmill
   at four grades (0 degrees, +3 degrees, +6 degrees, +9 degrees). As
   hypothesized, old adults walked with smaller peak ankle joint kinetics
   (e.g., power generation: -18\% at +9 degrees) and larger peak hip joint
   kinetics (e.g., power generation: +119\% at +9 degrees) than young
   adults, most evident during the late stance phase of both level and
   uphill conditions. Old adults performed two to three times more single
   support positive work than young adults via muscles crossing the knee.
   In partial support of our second hypothesis, the age-related reduction
   in peak ankle joint moments was greater during uphill (-0.41 Nm/kg) vs.
   level (-0.30 Nm/kg) walking. However, old adults that exhibited reduced
   propulsive ankle function during level walking could perform 44\% more
   trailing leg positive ankle joint work to walk uphill. Our findings
   indicate that maintaining ankle power generation and trailing leg
   propulsive function should be the primary focus of ``prehabilitation{''}
   strategies for old adults to preserve their uphill walking ability. (C)

Abstract = {{Economist Dr. E.F. Schumacher posited the concept of ``Intermediate
   Technology{''} in his 1973 book Small is Beautiful, catalyzing the
   explosion of the appropriate technology (AT) movement. But how does one
   gauge the ``appropriateness{''} of a technology? Quantitative assessment
   of AT can benefit sustainable community development (SCD) practitioners
   by way of decision-support and risk mitigation. The following research
   constructs a generalizable metric for quantitative assessment of AT, and
   develops a systematic process for its deployment. Forty-nine
   independent, emergent indicators of appropriateness were identified from
   a literature meta-analysis. The most prevalent indicators were as
   follows: community input, affordability, autonomy, transferability,
   community control, scalability, local availability of raw materials, and
   adaptability. Using these, a quantitative assessment tool was developed,
   called the Appropriate Technology Assessment Tool (ATAT). ATAT employs
   multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to rank AT alternatives.
   In this way, inputs are aggregated using a weightedsum method, giving
   the composite Appropriateness Index, (AI(i)). Using VBA coding, the
   author built ATAT via a simple form populated by the identified
   indicators. The form automates all necessary calculations, facilitating
   empirically rigorous quantitative assessment of AT by non-technical SCD
   workers. AT is only as appropriate as beneficiaries deem. A
   participatory research approach requires community stakeholders to rank
   preferred criteria for AT, and rate alternatives against the chosen
   criteria. This approach makes the tool customizable to local conditions.
   Using the Mini-Delphi Method, stakeholder opinions translate to ATAT
   inputs. A local case in the Westwood neighborhood of Denver, Colorado is
   examined to test ATAT efficacy and process viability. Prior to this
   research, University of Colorado graduate students partnered with local
   501(c)3 Revision International to reduce winter heating costs in
   Westwood using a solar furnace that locals dubbed ``EZ Heat{''}. ATAT
   quantified the appropriateness of EZ Heat as AI(i) = 4.2. This score
   lends empirical support to the AT's a priori deterministic selection.
   ATAT is designed to be free and accessible via Internet, and the author
   is investigating the potential of a mobile application. SCD and other
   community development practitioners often work in remote areas, and a
   mobile ATAT application will make the tool more useful. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Inorganic membranes play an important role in the development of
   economical processes for pre-combustion and/or post-combustion capture
   of carbon dioxide (CO2) at high temperatures. Mesoporous silica, due to
   its chemical and mechanical properties, is considered as a candidate for
   the capture of CO2 at high temperatures. Bare silica membranes exhibit
   Knudsen diffusion behavior for most gases but also exhibit the
   contribution of surface diffusion for heavier or interacting gases such
   as CO2 and CH4. The CO2/N-2 selectivity of mesoporous silica membranes
   can be enhanced by surface modification using aminosilanes such as APTS
   (3-aminopropyl-triethoxy silane). The important aspect of such modified
   membranes is that they can be operated at high temperatures typically
   encountered in post-combustion gas streams (flue gas). For modified
   silica membranes, mixed gas separation factors as high as 10 for CO2
   over N-2 were observed. The transport mechanism in such membranes is the
   reaction of CO2 with the amine groups (in aminosilanes) to form a
   carbamate species and subsequent surface ``hopping{''} of carbon
   dioxide. Under ambient conditions, CO2 is strongly bounded to the amine
   groups and thus greatly inhibits the surface diffusion of CO2; however,
   as the temperature increases, the CO2 permeance increases and selective
   transport of CO2 is observed. Thus, in surface-modified facilitated
   transport membranes, economical CO2 separation is achieved through the
   combination of the chemical reaction of CO2 associated with amine
   absorption along with the simplicity and low operating costs of membrane
   processes.}},

   through social media, analyze organizational messaging and determine key
   actors. A content analysis of tweets further examined emergent themes in
   the distribution of information through Twitter. This network

   can leverage social media as a means of sustained coordination for
   long-term, on the ground efforts extending past initial emergency relief

Abstract = {{An intermittent or non-existent power grid currently plagues most of
   Haiti. Haitians, therefore, use diesel and/or other forms of power to
   supplement or replace the grid, often a costly expense. Batteries that
   charge when power is available are the only option for around-the-clock
   power on demand. Lead acid battery packs that are environmentally
   harmful, wastefully large and unreliable are currently the only
   economically viable battery pack option. The Green Energy Storage
   Technology (GEST) team has made a preliminary demonstration of a
   rechargeable lithium ion battery unit that is more environmentally
   aware, smaller and potentially more reliable than lead acid battery
   storage units. The parts for such units could be imported to Haiti for
   local assembly owned and directed by Haitian entrepreneurs while
   providing much needed local employment. GEST is in the process of
   determining what type of lithium ion battery will provide acceptable
   metrics for weight, lifetime, and environmental footprint at acceptable
   cost. To achieve this goal, GEST is considering a number of emerging
   battery technologies including lithium iron phosphate and lithium
   manganese iron phosphate. The GEST team will spend the summer of 2014
   validating a value proposition to determine a minimum viable product for
   the Haitian marketplace.}},

   stratified boundary layers. Furthermore, the proposed DMA is based on
   the original rescaling-recycling method by Lund et al. {[}12]. The two
   major improvements are: (i) the utilization of different scaling laws in
   the inner and outer parts of the boundary layer to better absorb
   external conditions such as inlet Reynolds numbers, streamwise pressure
   gradients, buoyancy effects, etc. ({[}4]), (ii) the implementation of a
   dynamic approach ({[}3]) to compute scaling parameters from the flow

   differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic coefficients and source
   terms. We use it as a method for generating accurate coarse-scale
   solutions while accounting for the effect of the unresolved fine scales
   through a model term that contains a fine-scale stochastic Green's
   function. For a natural choice of an ``optimal{''} coarse-scale solution
   and L-2-orthogonal stochastic basis functions, we demonstrate that the
   fine-scale stochastic Green's function is intimately linked to its
   deterministic counterpart. In particular, (i) we demonstrate that
   whenever the deterministic fine-scale function vanishes, the stochastic
   fine-scale function satisfies a weaker and discrete notion of vanishing
   stochastic coefficients, and (ii) we derive an explicit formula for the
   fine-scale stochastic Green's function that only involves quantities
   needed to evaluate the fine-scale deterministic Green's function. We
   present numerical results that support our claims about the physical
   support of the stochastic fine-scale function and demonstrate the
   benefit of using the VMS method when the fine-scale Green's function is
   approximated by an easier to implement element Green's function.}},

   bonds. When the concentration of O-(a) is large compared to
   1,2-propanedioxy, no H-2 is produced and the dialkoxide reacts to form
   H2O, CO through decarbonylation, and CO2 through decarboxylation.
   Unreacted oxygen also desorbs as O-2 at high temperature. Conversely,
   when the concentration of O-(a) is small relative to 1,2-propanedioxy,
   the dialkoxide reacts to form decomposition products (H-2, CO),
   oxidation products (H2O, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, formaldehyde) and
   deoxygenation products (ethylene, propylene). Co-adsorbed oxygen
   increases the overall coverage of PDO that can undergo decomposition,
   which in turn strongly influences decomposition activation barriers and
   products. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The low temperature reaction sequence of ethanol adsorption and
   decomposition on Pd(111) has been studied using temperature programmed
   desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. The
   goal of these studies was to experimentally determine whether O-H or C-H
   bond scission occurs first. This was accomplished by examining the
   reaction of two partially deuterated ethanol molecules (only the fully
   deuterated version has been studied previously): a deuterium atom at the
   hydroxyl (CH3CH2OD) or two deuterium atoms at the a-carbon (CH3CD2OH).
   To support the experiment, density functional theory was used to
   calculate vibrational spectra for the respective adsorbed alcohols,
   alkoxides and hydroxyethyl intermediates. Based on the thermal evolution
   of vibrational spectra together with the sequence of desorption of D2O
   and H2O during TPD, we conclude that the decomposition of adsorbed
   ethanol proceeds directly to ethoxide (not hydroxyethyl) on Pd(111). (C)

Abstract = {{Single-particle optical sizing techniques are being used to determine
   the size distributions of microbubble ultrasound contrast agents and to

   obscuration and scattering measurements of microbubble size
   distributions with predictions from generalized Lorenz-Mie scattering
   theory (GLMT). First, we illustrate that a mono-modal size distribution
   can be misrepresented by single-particle light obscuration measurements
   as multi-modal peaks because of non-linearities in the extinction cross
   section-versus-diameter curve. Next, polymer bead standards are measured
   to provide conversion factors between GLMT calculations and experimental
   flow cytometry scatter plots. GLMT calculations with these conversion
   factors accurately predict the characteristic Lissajous-like serpentine
   scattering plot measured by flow cytometry for microbubbles. We conclude
   that GLMT calculations can be combined with optical forward and side
   scatter measurements to accurately determine microbubble size. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Natural materials and structures are increasingly becoming a source of
   inspiration for the design novel of engineering systems. In this
   context, the structure of fish skin, made of an intricate arrangement of
   flexible plates growing out of the dermis of a majority of fish, can be
   of particular interest for materials such as protective layers or
   flexible electronics. To better understand the mechanics of these
   composite shells, we introduce here a general computational framework
   that aims at establishing a relationship between their structure and
   their overall mechanical response. Taking advantage of the periodicity
   of the scale arrangement, it is shown that a representative periodic
   cell can be introduced as the basic element to carry out a
   homogenization procedure based on the Hill-Mendel condition. The
   proposed procedure is applied to the specific case of the fish skin
   structure of the Morone saxatilis, using a computational finite element
   approach. Our numerical study shows that fish skin possesses a highly
   anisotropic response, with a softer bending stiffness in the
   longitudinal direction of the fish. This softer response arises from
   significant scale rotations during bending, which induce a stiffening of
   the response under large bending curvature. Interestingly, this
   mechanism can be suppressed or magnified by tuning the rotational
   stiffness of the scale-dermis attachment but is not activated in the
   lateral direction. These results are not only valuable to the
   engineering design of flexible and protective shells, but also have
   implications on the mechanics of fish swimming. Published by Elsevier

   network formation}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{227-233}},
Abstract = {{Photo-reactive nanogels with an integrated photoinitiator-based
   functionality were synthesized via a Reversible Addition-Fragmentation
   chain Transfer (RAFT) process. Without additional free initiators, these
   nanogels are capable of radical generation and initiating polymerization
   of a secondary monomer (i.e. dimethacrylate) that infiltrates and
   disperses the nanogel particles. Due to the presence of a RAFT
   functionality and the fact that all initiating sites are initially
   located within the nanogel structure, gelation can be delayed by
   sequencing the polymerization from the nanogel to the bulk matrix.
   During polymerization of a nanogel-filled resin system, a progressive
   delay of gelation conversion from about 2\% for conventional chain
   growth polymerization to 18\% for the same monomer containing 20 wt\%
   nanogel additive was achieved. A significant delay of stress development
   was also observed with much lower final stress achieved with the
   nanogel-modified systems due to the change in network formation
   mechanics. Compared with the nanogel-free dimethacrylate control, which
   contained a uniformly distributed free initiator, the flexural modulus
   and mechanical strength results were maintained for the photopolymers
   with nanogel contents greater than 10 wt\%. There appears to be a
   critical interparticle spacing for the photo-reactive nanogel that
   provides effective photopolymerization while providing delayed gelation
   and substantial stress reduction.}},

Pages = {{13-38}},
Abstract = {{Polymer nanocomposites are a class of materials that consist of a
   polymer matrix filled with inorganic/organic nanoscale additives that
   enhance the inherent macroscopic (mechanical, optical and electronic)
   properties of the polymer matrix. Over the past few decades such
   materials have received tremendous attention from experimentalists,
   theoreticians, and computational scientists. These studies have revealed
   that the macroscopic properties of polymer nanocomposites depend
   strongly on the (microscopic) morphology of the constituent nanoscale
   additives in the polymer matrix. As a consequence, intense research
   efforts have been directed to understand the relationships between
   interactions, morphology, and the phase behavior of polymer
   nanocomposites. Theory and simulations have proven to be useful tools in
   this regard due to their ability to link molecular level features of the
   polymer and nanoparticle additives to the resulting morphology within
   the composite. In this article we review recent theory and simulation
   studies, presenting briefly the methodological developments underlying
   PRISM theories, density functional theory, self-consistent field theory
   approaches, and atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulations. We
   first discuss the studies on polymer nanocomposites with bare or
   un-functionalized nanoparticles as additives, followed by a review of
   recent work on composites containing polymer grafted or functionalized
   nanoparticles as additives. We conclude each section with a brief
   outlook on some potential future directions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Volume = {{245}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the effect of a high anodic potential treatment
   protocol on the performance of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). DMFC
   membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with PtRu/C (Hi-spec 5000) anode
   catalyst are subjected to anodic treatment (AT) at 0.8 V vs. DHE using
   potentiostatic method. Despite causing a slight decrease in the
   electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the anode, associated with
   ruthenium dissolution, AT results in significant improvement in DMFC
   performance in the ohmic and mass transfer regions and increases the
   maximum power density by similar to 15\%. Furthermore, AT improves the
   long-term DMFC stability by reducing the degradation of the anode
   catalyst. From XPS investigation, it is hypothesized that the improved
   performance of AT-treated MEAs is related to an improved interface
   between the catalyst and Nafion ionomer. Among potential explanations,
   this improvement may be caused by incorporation of the ionomer within
   the secondary pores of PtRu/C agglomerates, which generates a
   percolating network of ionomer between PtRu/C agglomerates in the
   catalyst layer. Furthermore, the decreased concentration of hydrophobic
   CF2 groups may help to enhance the hydrophilicity of the catalyst layer,
   thereby increasing the accessibility of methanol and resulting in better
   performance in the high current density region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The efficiency of linear power amplifiers can be improved by modulating
   its supply voltage according to the peak value of the signal that is
   being amplified in a technique usually known as envelope tracking. High
   bandwidth dc/dc converters called envelope amplifiers (EAs) are used to
   carry out the supply modulation in an efficient manner. In the case of
   linear RF power amplifiers, the bandwidth requirements over the EA
   strongly depend on the signal being amplified: in modern
   telecommunication applications it can range from several hundred
   kilohhertzs to a few tens of megahertz. The path to achieve such
   bandwidths usually goes through increased switching frequencies and/or
   reduced ratio of switching frequency to converter bandwidth. However,
   these may lead to lower converter efficiency and increased distortion,
   making the design of EAs a challenging task. This paper addresses the
   analysis and design of the output filter for Buck converters operating
   as EA. The output filter must provide enough attenuation at the
   switching frequency and harmonics to guarantee a desired level of
   distortion while enabling tracking of wide-bandwidth envelope signals
   with high converter efficiency. This paper focuses on the use of
   high-order filters (up to sixth-order Bessel-Thomson, Butterworth, and
   Legendre-Papoulis filters) in a buck dc/dc converter working as an EA.
   The filters are analytically described and characterized, and a design
   procedure that takes into account the major design constraints is
   proposed, allowing the selection of the appropriate filter for a given
   application. The proposed analysis and design method are supported by
   simulation results, as well as by experiments obtained using a 1 MHz
   buck converter operating as an EA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a complete formulation for three-dimensional
   hydrodynamic analysis of floating flexible structures subjected to
   surface regular waves, as well as other excitation forces, by employing
   a direct tight coupling method. The continuum mechanics-based finite
   element method is employed to model floating structures with arbitrary
   geometries, which can account for the geometric nonlinearities and
   initial stress effects that result from the hydrostatic analysis,
   whereas the boundary element method is used for the fluid via total
   potential formulation. The simplicity and generality of the present
   formulation are revealed as compared with the conventional formulation.
   Numerical examples demonstrate the general capability of the formulation
   proposed. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Many fields of research have adopted self-assembly of colloidal spheres
   as an easy and reliable method to produce macroscopic structures with
   nanoscale periodicity. The field of soft lithography in particular has
   used colloidal self-assembly to fabricate lithographic masks and
   templates. We developed a colloidal lithography method that uses the
   colloidal assembly directly to produce submicrometer topographic and
   chemical surface patterns. The method does not require any specialized
   equipment, making it particularly useful in biological and chemical
   laboratories without lithography expertise. The technique involves the
   curing and solvent removal of a self-assembled colloidal crystal from an
   inorganic surface. The result is a triangular array of polymer features
   with submicrometer periodicity that covers square centimeters of surface
   area. The feature size and spacing is easily controlled, and the
   features serve as reactive sites for biomolecule immobilization.}},

Abstract = {{The in-plane connectivity and continuity of lamellar-forming
   polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymer domains in thin
   films depend on the density and relative population of defects in the
   self-assembled morphology. Here we varied film thickness, degree of
   polymerization, thermal annealing time, and annealing temperature in
   order to engineer the defect densities and topology of the lamellar
   morphology. Assembly in thicker films leads to lower defect densities
   and thus reduced connectivity of the lamellar domains, which is
   considered in the context of the activation energies and driving forces
   for defect annihilation. Systems with smaller degrees of polymerization
   were also found to achieve lower defect densities and reduced domain
   connectivity. Most importantly, the relative populations of each type of
   defect were unaffected by the defect density, and these morphologies had
   similar long-range continuities. Controlling processing conditions such
   as thermal annealing time and temperature, in comparison, was
   ineffective at tuning the defect density of block copolymer lamellae
   because quasi-equilibrium morphologies were rapidly achieved and
   subsequently remained quasi-static. These results provide a framework
   for selecting the composition, degree of polymerization, and processing
   parameters for lamellar-forming block copolymers in thin films for
   applications that either require low defect densities (e.g., in the
   directed assembly of microelectronic architectures) or benefit from high
   defect densities (e.g., in network structures for transport).}},

Abstract = {{The CMS silicon pixel detector is the tracking device closest to the LHC
   p-p collisions, which precisely reconstructs the charged particle
   trajectories. The planar technology used in the current innermost layer
   of the pixel detector will reach the design limit for radiation hardness
   at the end of Phase I upgrade and will need to be replaced before the
   Phase II upgrade in 2020. Due to its unprecedented performance in harsh
   radiation environments, 3D silicon technology is under consideration as
   a possible replacement of planar technology for the High Luminosity-LHC
   or HL-LHC. 3D silicon detectors are fabricated by the Deep
   Reactive-Ion-Etching (DRIE) technique which allows p- and n-type
   electrodes to be processed through the silicon substrate as opposed to
   being implanted through the silicon surface. The 3D CMS pixel devices
   presented in this paper were processed at FBK. They were bump bonded to
   the current CMS pixel readout chip, tested in the laboratory, and
   testbeams carried out at FNAL with the proton beam of 120 GeV/c. In this
   paper we present the laboratory and beam test results for the irradiated
   3D CMS pixel devices. (C) 2013 CERN. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Azimuthal anisotropy of pi(0) and eta mesons in Au plus Au collisions at
   root s(NN)=200 GeV}},

Abstract = {{The azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v2 and v4 of p 0 and. mesons are
   measured in Au + Au collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV as a function of
   transverse momentum p(T) (1-14 GeV/c) and centrality. The extracted v(2)
   coefficients are found to be consistent between the two meson species
   over the measured p(T) range. The ratio of v(4)/v(2)(2) for pi(0) mesons
   is found to be independent of p(T) for 1- 9 GeV/c, implying a lack of
   sensitivity of the ratio to the change of underlying physics with p(T).
   Furthermore, the ratio of v(4)/v(2)(2) is systematically larger in
   central collisions, which may reflect the combined effects of
   fluctuations in the initial collision geometry and finite viscosity in
   the evolving medium.}},

Abstract = {{Modification of Pt group catalysts by molybdenum is known to improve
   catalyst performance in a number of important chemical reactions. To
   investigate fundamental mechanisms responsible for the promoting effect
   of Mo, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and low energy electron
   diffraction (LEED) experiments were performed to examine the adsorption
   of O-2, D-2, CO, and water on Pt(111) modified with submonolayer
   quantities of molybdenum. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) was used to
   detect and quantify the Mo coverage and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) was employed in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations to identify Mo species present following various surface
   treatments. The state of Mo on the surface was found to vary depending
   on prior surface treatment. Treatment with oxygen resulted in a surface
   molybdenum oxide, whereas treatment with hydrogen resulted in a reduced
   bimetallic surface. XPS results indicate that high pressures of oxygen
   create a higher valent oxide than what is created under ultrahigh
   vacuum. Oxidized Mo appeared to block Pt surface sites without
   significantly altering the behavior of species adsorbed on Pt. Reduced
   surfaces, on the other hand, were shown to decrease yield and desorption
   temperature for both D-2 and CO. Isotopic TPD studies provided evidence
   of water dissociation on the reduced Mo modified surface, with a maximum
   extent of water dissociation occurring at intermediate Mo coverages.}},

Title = {{Impact of Halides on the Photoproduction of Reactive Intermediates from
   Organic Matter}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{13949-13956}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{The excitation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from sunlight produces
   a range of reactive intermediates, including triplet-excited state
   dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3{*}), hydroxyl radical (HO center
   dot), and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). These intermediates are important for
   the inactivation of pathogens and for the degradation of trace organic
   contaminants (OC) within natural and engineered systems. However,
   halides found in the background matrix can alter the photoproduction
   rates by promoting or quenching the formation of these intermediates.
   Apparent quantum yields (Phi(a)) for O-1(2), HO center dot, and steady
   state (DOM)-D-3{*} concentrations photoproduced from DOM isolates were
   determined with varying concentrations of chloride and bromide.
   Fluorescence quantum yields were measured as well to probe the
   photophysics of the system. The maximum fluorescence quantum yield
   (Phi(F)) decreased with the addition of halides, representing a
   quenching of the excited singlet state of DOM. In contrast, the steady
   state concentrations for (DOM)-D-3{*} were enhanced, suggesting
   intersystem crossing from the singlet state to the triplet state was
   increased by the presence of halides. The (Phi(a)) for O-1(2) was
   increased with the addition of halides, which was expected following the
   (DOM)-D-3{*} results because the mechanism for O-1(2) production occurs
   through the inactivation of (DOM)-D-3{*} by dissolved oxygen. Although
   HO center dot production would be expected to follow O-1(2), the
   opposite trend was seen, which suggests the formation of HO center dot
   does not occur through the same precursor. Understanding the impact of
   specific quenchers on DOM could be a key to understanding the true
   formation potential for reactive intermediates and is especially
   important in estuaries and wastewater impacted aquatic systems.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy enables subdiffraction
   resolution in the imaging plane. However, STED's lateral improvement in
   resolution is generally better than the enhancement in the axial

   with Double Helix Point Spread Function (PSF) modulation for axial
   localization with a precision better than the classical Rayleigh limit.
   To demonstrate the capability of the method we resolve in a STED
   microscope sub-diffraction fluorescent bead assemblies, and localize
   them axially with better than 25nm precision. We also show that the same
   setup allows straightforward implementation of wide field phase contrast
   by imaging larger beads with spiral and dark field phase filtering. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{We study translational and rotational diffusion of anisotropic gold
   nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in the bulk of a nematic liquid crystal
   fluid host. Experimental data reveal strong anisotropy of translational
   diffusion with respect to the uniform far-field director, which is
   dependent on shape and surface functionalization of colloids as well as
   on their ground-state alignment. For example, elongated NPs aligned
   parallel to the far-field director translationally diffuse more rapidly
   along the director whereas diffusion of NPs oriented normal to the
   director is faster in the direction perpendicular to it while they are
   also undergoing elasticity-constrained rotational diffusion. To
   understand physical origins of these rich diffusion properties of
   anisotropic nanocolloids in uniaxially anisotropic nematic fluid media,
   we compare them to diffusion of prolate and oblate ellipsoidal particles
   in isotropic fluids as well as to diffusion of shape-isotropic particles
   in nematic fluids. We also show that surface functionalization of NPs
   with photosensitive azobenzene groups allows for in situ control of
   their diffusivity through trans-cis isomerization that changes surface
   anchoring.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental question connecting terrestrial ecology and global climate
   change is the sensitivity of key terrestrial biomes to climatic
   variability and change. The Amazon region is such a key biome: it
   contains unparalleled biological diversity, a globally significant store
   of organic carbon, and it is a potent engine driving global cycles of
   water and energy. The importance of understanding how land surface
   dynamics of the Amazon region respond to climatic variability and change
   is widely appreciated, but despite significant recent advances, large
   gaps in our understanding remain. Understanding of energy and carbon
   exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere can be
   improved through direct observations and experiments, as well as through
   modeling activities. Land surface/ecosystem models have become important
   tools for extrapolating local observations and understanding to much
   larger terrestrial regions. They are also valuable tools to test
   hypothesis on ecosystem functioning. Funded by NASA under the auspices
   of the LBA (the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in
   Amazonia), the LBA Data Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-DMIP) uses a
   comprehensive data set from an observational network of flux towers
   across the Amazon, and an ecosystem modeling community engaged in
   ongoing studies using a suite of different land surface and terrestrial
   ecosystem models to understand Amazon forest function. Here an overview
   of this project is presented accompanied by a description of the
   measurement sites, data, models and protocol. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the inter-annual variability (IAV) of simulations of
   21 different land surface model formulations, driven by meteorological
   conditions measured at 8 flux towers, located in rain forest,
   forest-savanna ecotone and pasture sites in Amazonia, and one in savanna
   site in Southeastern Brazil. Annual totals of net ecosystem exchange
   (NEE) of carbon and evapotranspiration (ET), measured and simulated by
   each model for each site-year, were compared in terms of year-to-year
   variability and possible relation to climate drivers. Results have shown
   that most of models simulations for annual totals of NEE and ET, and IAV
   of these fluxes, are frequently different from measurements. The average
   of the model simulations of annual fluxes tend to respond to climatic
   drivers similarly to the observations, but with noticeable
   discrepancies. Annual measurements of NEE are negatively correlated to
   annual rainfall in the forest sites group. Although the ensemble of all
   models yields a similar result, only three model formulations reproduce
   a significant negative correlation of simulated NEE with rainfall. For
   the IAV of ET, tower measurements are controlled by annual variations of
   radiation and this feature is captured by the ensemble of the models,
   both at individual sites and when all forest sites are grouped. However,
   simulated ET values are also significantly correlated to the amount of
   precipitation in many models and in the model ensemble, while there is
   no significant correlation in the observations. In general, the surface
   models are able to reproduce the responses of fluxes to climatic
   drivers, but improvements are still needed to better capture their
   inter-annual variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{448}},

Abstract = {{In this paper RO colloidal fouling was predicted using an on-line Feed
   Fouling Monitor (FFM) combined with a monitor based On ultrasonic time
   domain retlectometry (UTDR) under constant flux filtration. The FFM
   incorporated the relevant cross-flow hydrodynamics and detected the
   development of foulant load and resistance from a continuous sample
   passing over a small UF membrane. A UF membrane was used in the FFM,
   rather than a RO membrane, because it was more sensitive to fouling
   resistance and this decreased monitoring time and increased accuracy.
   The UTDR was coupled to a RO membrane cell to monitor the rate of cake
   thickness increase, which is the required information for the estimation
   of cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP). A model was developed to
   predict fouling in RO using data from the two monitors and combined both
   the cake resistance and the CEOP effect due to cake formation.
   RO and FFM fouling experiments were performed at different constant
   fluxes using the same feed solutions (200 mg/l SiO2, 2000 mg/l NaCl) and
   the same cross-flow velocity (0.1 m/s). The results showed that higher
   fluxes caused an increased fouling rate for both RO and the FEM. The
   foulant layer thickness measured by UTDR in the RO experiments increased
   faster at higher applied fluxes and the estimated CEOP effect was also
   strongly influenced by the flux.
   The results show that the model, combined with the FFM and UTDR
   measurements, can provide a good estimation of the RO fouling profile
   over a range of applied fluxes. This study also underscores the
   importance of CEOP in contributing to the increase in transmembrane
   pressure due to colloidal fouling in RO of saline feeds. (C) 2013

   nanometer spatial resolution and chemical specificity. We perform full
   spatio-spectral imaging of dried purple membrane patches purified from
   Halobacterium salinarum with infrared vibrational scattering-type
   scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). Using near-field
   spectral phase contrast based on the Amide I resonance of the protein
   backbone, we identify the protein distribution with 20 nm spatial
   resolution and few-protein sensitivity. This demonstrates the general
   applicability of s-SNOM vibrational nanospectroscopy, with potential
   extension to a wide range of biomolecular systems.}},

Abstract = {{We present a point-source catalog from 771 deg(2) of the South Pole
   Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We detect
   1545 sources above 4.5 sigma significance in at least one band. Based on
   their relative brightness between survey bands, we classify the sources
   into two populations, one dominated by synchrotron emission from active
   galactic nuclei, and one dominated by thermal emission from
   dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. We find 1238 synchrotron and 307
   dusty sources. We cross-match all sources against external catalogs and
   find 189 unidentified synchrotron sources and 189 unidentified dusty
   sources. The dusty sources without counterparts are good candidates for
   high-redshift, strongly lensed submillimeter galaxies. We derive number
   counts for each population from 1 Jy down to roughly 11, 4, and 11 mJy
   at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We compare these counts with galaxy population
   models and find that none of the models we consider for either
   population provide a good fit to the measured counts in all three bands.
   The disparities imply that these measurements will be an important input
   to the next generation of millimeter-wave extragalactic source
   population models.}},

Abstract = {{We show how atomic force microscopy techniques based on contact
   resonance (CR) can be used to measure the viscoelastic loss tangent tan
   delta of polymeric materials. The method does not require intermediate
   calculation of loss and storage moduli, calibration measurements, or use
   of the conventional CR tip shape parameter. We present the method's
   physical concepts and sensitivity calculations for typical experimental
   parameters. In addition, CR experiments were performed on four
   homogeneous polymer samples (polystyrene, high-density polyethylene, and
   two commercial photostress polymers) with tan (5 in the range from
   approximately 0.02 to 0.2. Results compare favorably to those obtained
   by microscale dynamic nanoindentation and macroscale dynamic mechanical
   analysis. These results show the potential of CR modes for nanoscale
   viscoelastic measurements of polymers and biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of elastostatics, a mathematical treatment is presented
   for the boundary value problem of the interaction of a flexible
   cylindrical pile embedded in a transversely isotropic half-space under
   transverse loadings. Taking the pile region as a stiffened subdomain of
   an extended half-space, the formulation of the interaction problem is
   reduced to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The
   necessary set of Green's functions for the transversely isotropic
   half-space is obtained by means of a method of potentials. The resulting
   Green's functions are incorporated into a numerical procedure for the
   solution of the integral equation. The theoretical response of the pile
   is presented in terms of bending moment, displacement and slope profiles
   for a variety of transversely isotropic materials so that the effect of
   different anisotropy parameters can be meaningfully discussed. Copyright

Abstract = {{The Moho is not always a sharp interface: but seismic phase SsPmp yields
   robust, physically averaged estimates of crustal thickness (virtual deep
   seismic sounding, VDSS). In S. Tibet where the Moho is as deep as 75 km,
   bimodal distribution of earthquake depths, with one peak in the upper
   crust and the other below the Moho, generated much interest in how
   lithological contrast affects seismicity and rheology. Generally
   seismicity is limited by distinct temperatures (Tc): 350 +/- 50 degrees
   C in the crust and 700 +/- 100 degrees C in the mantle (Earthquake
   Thermometry). Laboratory experiments show that distinct Tc reflect the
   onset of substantial crystal plasticity in major crustal and mantle
   minerals, respectively. Above these Tc, frictional instability ends due
   to velocity weakening of slip. So the seismic to aseismic transition is
   closely linked with brittle-ductile transitions in the crust and in the
   uppermost mantle, where the strength of the continental lithosphere is
   expected to peak ({''}Jelly Sandwich{''}). Plasticity depends
   exponentially on temperature (which evolves overtime), so interplay
   between the geotherm and crustal thickness could result in concentrated
   seismicity in the upper crust the only portion of a very warm
   lithosphere where temperature is below similar to 350 degrees C
   ({''}Creme Brulee{''}). Conversely, where the entire crust is below
   similar to 350 degrees C (and the uppermost mantle is also below similar
   to 700 degrees C), then earthquakes could occur over a wide range of
   depths, including the entire crust and the uppermost mantle ({''}Caramel
   Slab{''}). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Certain salts in aqueous solution are known to significantly increase
   the affinity of molecules with hydrophobic moieties for a hydrophobic
   interface, but the mechanism of this effect is poorly understood. We
   used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy
   to directly observe the underlying dynamic interfacial phenomena for a
   fluorescent fatty acid probe molecule at a self-assembled monolayer
   surface. Both NaF and NaSCN increased the surface affinity of the probe
   from that observed in pure water, and consistent with expectations, the
   surface affinity was greater in the presence of NaF than that with
   NaSCN. Notably, the primary cause of the increase in surface affinity

Abstract = {{Remotely reporting electronic sensors offer the potential to reduce bias
   in monitoring use of environmental health interventions. In the context
   of a five-month randomized controlled trial of household water filters
   and improved cookstoves in rural Rwanda, we collected data from
   intervention households on product compliance using (i) monthly surveys
   and direct observations by community health workers and environmental
   health officers, and (ii) sensor-equipped filters and cookstoves
   deployed for about two weeks in each household. The adoption rate
   interpreted by the sensors varied from the household reporting: 90.5\%
   of households reported primarily using the intervention stove, while the
   sensors interpreted 73.2\% use, and 96.5\% of households reported using
   the intervention filter regularly, while the sensors interpreted no more
   than 90.2\%. The sensor-collected data estimated use to be lower than
   conventionally collected data both for water filters (approximately 36\%
   less water volume per day) and cookstoves (approximately 40\% fewer uses
   per week). An evaluation of intrahousehold consistency in use suggests
   that households are not using their filters or stoves on an exclusive
   basis, and may be both drinking untreated water at times and using other
   stoves ({''}stove-stacking{''}). These results provide additional
   evidence that surveys and direct observation may exaggerate compliance
   with household-based environmental interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe an engineering approach to quantitatively compare
   migration, morphologies, and adhesion for tumorigenic human fibrosarcoma
   cells (HT-1080s) and primary human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) with the
   aim of identifying distinguishing properties of the transformed
   phenotype. Relative adhesiveness was quantified using self-assembled
   monolayer (SAM) arrays and proteolytic 3-dimensional (3D) migration was
   investigated using matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels ({''}synthetic extracellular
   matrix{''} or ``synthetic ECM{''}). In synthetic ECM, hDFs were
   characterized by vinculin-containing features on the tips of
   protrusions, multipolar morphologies, and organized actomyosin
   filaments. In contrast, HT-1080s were characterized by diffuse vinculin
   expression, pronounced beta 1-integrin on the tips of protrusions, a
   cortically-organized F-actin cytoskeleton, and quantitatively more
   rounded morphologies, decreased adhesiveness, and increased directional
   motility compared to hDFs. Further, HT-1080s were characterized by
   contractility-dependent motility, pronounced blebbing, and cortical
   contraction waves or constriction rings, while quantified 3D motility
   was similar in matrices with a wide range of biochemical and biophysical
   properties (including collagen) despite substantial morphological
   changes. While HT-1080s were distinct from hDFs for each of the 2D and
   3D properties investigated, several features were similar to WM239a
   melanoma cells, including rounded, proteolytic migration modes, cortical
   F-actin organization, and prominent uropod-like structures enriched with
   beta 1-integrin, F-actin, and melanoma cell adhesion molecule
   (MCAM/CD146/MUC18). Importantly, many of the features observed for
   HT-1080s were analogous to cellular changes induced by transformation,
   including cell rounding, a disorganized F-actin cytoskeleton, altered
   organization of focal adhesion proteins, and a weakly adherent
   phenotype. Based on our results, we propose that HT-1080s migrate in
   synthetic ECM with functional properties that are a direct consequence
   of their transformed phenotype.}},

Title = {{Errors in coarse particulate matter mass concentrations and
   spatiotemporal characteristics when using subtraction estimation methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1386-1398}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In studies of coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5), mass concentrations
   are often estimated through the subtraction of PM2.5 from collocated
   PM10 tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) measurements.
   Though all field instruments have yet to be updated, the Filter Dynamic
   Measurement System (FDMS) was introduced to account for the loss of
   semivolatile material from heated TEOM filters. To assess errors in
   PM10-2.5 estimation when using the possible combinations of PM10 and
   PM2.5 TEOM units with and without FDMS, data from three monitoring sites
   of the Colorado Coarse Rural-Urban Sources and Health (CCRUSH) study
   were used to simulate four possible subtraction methods for estimating
   PM10-2.5 mass concentrations. Assuming all mass is accounted for using
   collocated TEOMs with FDMS, the three other subtraction methods were
   assessed for biases in absolute mass concentration, temporal
   variability, spatial correlation, and homogeneity. Results show
   collocated units without FDMS closely estimate actual PM10-2.5 mass and
   spatial characteristics due to the very low semivolatile PM10-2.5
   concentrations in Colorado. Estimation using either a PM2.5 or PM10
   monitor without FDMS introduced absolute biases of 2.4 mu g/m(3) (25\%)
   to -2.3 mu g/m(3) (-24\%), respectively. Such errors are directly
   related to the unmeasured semivolatile mass and alter measures of
   spatiotemporal variability and homogeneity, all of which have
   implications for the regulatory and epidemiology communities concerned
   about PM10-2.5. Two monitoring sites operated by the state of Colorado
   were considered for inclusion in the CCRUSH acute health effects study,
   but concentrations were biased due to sampling with an FDMS-equipped
   PM2.5 TEOM and PM10 TEOM not corrected for semivolatile mass loss. A
   regression-based model was developed for removing the error in these
   measurements by estimating the semivolatile concentration of PM2.5 from
   total PM2.5 concentrations. By estimating nonvolatile PM2.5
   concentrations from this relationship, PM10-2.5 was calculated as the
   difference between nonvolatile PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations.
   Implications: Errors in the estimation of PM10-2.5 concentrations using
   subtraction methods were shown to be related to the unmeasured
   semivolatile mass when using certain combinations of TEOM instruments.
   For the northeastern Colorado region, the absolute bias associated with
   this error significantly affects mean and 95th percentile values, which
   would affect assessment of compliance if PM10-2.5 is regulated in the
   future. Estimating PM10-2.5 mass concentrations using nonvolatile mass
   concentrations from collocated PM10 and PM2.5 TEOM monitors closely
   estimates the total PM10-2.5 mass concentrations. A corrective model
   that removes the described error was developed and applied to data from
   two sites in Denver. Supplemental Materials: Supplemental materials are
   available for this paper. Go to the publisher's online edition of the

Abstract = {{The deposition of dielectric materials onto graphene without introducing
   atomic defects is challenging owing to the unavoidable exposure of
   carbon-carbon bonds to plasma, energetic ions, or high-energy photons
   that are present during deposition. Here, we report a simple and
   nondegradative method of depositing a silicon oxide layer on graphene
   based on the thermal evaporation of silicon monoxide (SiO). Raman
   spectroscopy and mapping showed that this method does not form defects
   in graphene, whereas depositing silicon oxide by e-beam evaporation
   severely damages graphene. The SiO-coated graphene also showed excellent
   resistance to ozone and hot air. Since SiO is transparent to visible
   light and infrared light, the coating may serve as a protective layer
   for graphene optical devices such as photodetectors and electro-optic
   modulators. Also noted that the present method is much simpler than
   atomic layer deposition, which requires additional functionalization of
   graphene. (C) 2013 The Japan Society of Applied Physics}},

Abstract = {{One of the methods in limiting tensile stresses in arch dams and
   removing stress concentrations at the dam-foundation interface is
   setting the dam body on a concrete saddle called a Pulvino. In the
   present study, the effects of Pulvino and peripheral joints on the
   static behavior and seismic performance of arch dams are investigated.
   Dez Dam with a height of 203 m was selected as a case study and all
   contraction joints of the dam body were modeled using the discrete crack
   approach based on as-built drawings. Also, the surrounding rock was
   modeled as a mass-less medium tied to Pulvino. The
   dam-reservoir-foundation system was analyzed under static loads
   accounting for stage construction effects, hydrostatic and thermal
   loads. The provided numerical model was then excited using near- and
   far-field earthquake ground motion. It was found that modeling the
   peripheral joint between the saddle and the main dam body changes the
   direction of principal stresses and their distribution patterns, and the
   safety of the system is improved. In addition, over stressed surfaces on
   the faces of the dam body decreased in comparison with the model without
   a peripheral joint. (C) 2013 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Devices are increasingly being
   considered for deployment in sensor networks, due to their demonstrated
   advantages of prolonged lifetime and autonomous operation. However,
   irreversible degradation mechanisms jeopardize battery lifetime, calling
   for intelligent management policies, which minimize the impact of these
   phenomena while guaranteeing a minimum Quality of Service (QoS). This
   paper explores a mathematical characterization of these devices,
   focusing on the interplay between the battery discharge policy and the
   irreversible degradation of the storage capacity. We propose a
   stochastic Markov chain framework, suitable for policy optimization,
   which captures the degradation status of the battery. We present a
   general result of Markov chains, which exploits the timescale separation
   between the communication time-slot of the device and the battery
   degradation process, and enables an efficient optimization. We show that
   this model fits well the behavior of real batteries for what concerns
   their storage capacity degradation over time. We demonstrate that a
   degradation-aware policy significantly improves the lifetime of the
   sensor compared to ``greedy{''} policies, while guaranteeing the minimum
   required QoS. Finally, a simple heuristic policy, which never discharges
   the battery below a given threshold, is shown to achieve near-optimal
   performance in terms of battery lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial electrochemical systems (MESs) use microorganisms to covert
   the chemical energy stored in biodegradable materials to direct electric
   current and chemicals. Compared to traditional treatment-focused,
   energy-intensive environmental technologies, this emerging technology
   offers a new and transformative solution for integrated waste treatment
   and energy and resource recovery, because it offers a flexible platform
   for both oxidation and reduction reaction oriented processes. All MESs
   share one common principle in the anode chamber, in which biodegradable
   substrates, such as waste materials, are oxidized and generate
   electrical current. In contrast, a great variety of applications have
   been developed by utilizing this in situ current, such as direct power
   generation (microbial fuel cells, MFCs), chemical production (microbial
   electrolysis cells, MECs; microbial electrosynthesis, MES), or water
   desalination (microbial desalination cells, MDCs). Different from
   previous reviews that either focus on one function or a specific
   application aspect, this article provides a comprehensive and
   quantitative review of all the different functions or system
   constructions with different acronyms developed so far from the MES
   platform and summarizes nearly 50 corresponding systems to date. It also
   provides discussions on the future development of this promising yet
   early-stage technology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have compiled information on the fundamentals of open-pit
   glacier ice excavation from a variety of sources. These sources
   primarily include U.S. Army technical and scientific studies and
   peer-reviewed research on glacier ice-excavation activities and the
   properties and mechanical behavior of ice, but also the relatively few
   publicly available feasibility studies and environmental impact
   assessments published by private mining companies. While ice is
   technically a non-Newtonian fluid over long timescales, the authors
   suggest that it may be regarded as a low-density and low-strength rock,
   analogous to coal, for the practical purpose of ice excavation over
   short timescales. Three distinct ice-excavation techniques are reviewed:
   blasting, melting, and mechanical excavation, providing a case study of
   each. The authors summarize the unique advantages and disadvantages of
   each technique and conclude that an optimal open-ice-pit mining
   operation would most likely rely primarily on mechanical excavation and
   secondarily on blasting.}},

Abstract = {{To better plan for potential changes to stream water quality under
   climate change, an integrated approach to simulate paired streamflow and
   water quality under a range of climate scenarios is developed. Several
   stochastic nonparametric simulation techniques are integrated to create
   an end-to-end approach for comprehensive planning, with three steps:
   (1)develop a relationship between streamflow and water quality,
   (2)simulate streamflow ensembles under climate change scenarios, and
   (3)simulate water quality ensembles using the streamflow ensembles in
   conjunction with the developed relationship. The framework is
   demonstrated on a municipal water provider developing a new water supply
   sourcebut variations of salinity concentrations with streamflow pose
   limits to its use. For the current climate, the simulations accurately
   reproduce all of the relevant distributional and threshold statistics of
   flow and water quality, providing confidence in their use in long-term
   planning. Under climate change, reduced streamflow scenarios result in
   ensembles with higher salinity concentrations, which can be used in risk
   management and impact assessments. The approach is general and extends
   to other water quality variables associated with hydroclimate.}},

Abstract = {{Impact physics plays an important role in a variety of fields such as
   investigation of matter at extreme pressures and temperatures, shock
   waves in solid bodies or planetology and cosmic dust research. The
   processes of interest are the generation of impact plasma, neutrals,
   secondary ejecta, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The generation of
   charge during impacts provides one of the most sensitive methods for the
   detection and characterization of dust particles in space. To relate the
   measured values resulting from hypervelocity impact experiments with the
   impact parameters (speed, mass, composition) a comprehensive set of
   experiments is needed with well known experimental conditions, and a
   wide variety of diagnostic tools. For such experiments dust particles
   are accelerated to hypervelocity speeds in the laboratory with an
   electrostatic accelerator.
   In the present contribution, linear time-of flight (TOF) mass
   spectrometry is used to investigate the thermodynamical properties, e.g.
   the velocity distribution, of the ions within an impact plasma.
   Furthermore, the dependence of the plasma properties on the impact
   parameters is studied for different dust and target material
   combinations to investigate the constraints for the validity of impact
   ionization models. These studies provide new insights into the physics
   of hypervelocity impacts and the short timescale high-pressure states of
   matter, they also lead to the development of new and optimization of
   existing instrument concepts for the detection and characterization of
   cosmic dust in space. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the advance development of the Electrostatic Lunar Dust
   Analyzer (ELDA) instrument for the detection of individual low-velocity
   micron-size dust particles mobilized near the lunar surface, and the
   measurement of the dust charge, velocity vector, and mass. The first
   article (N. Duncan et al., Planet. Space Sc., 2011) described the
   measurement principle, optimized instrument geometry, and the initial
   testing performed on air. The full laboratory prototype of ELDA has now
   been completed and tested under vacuum. The numerical data analysis is
   improved to include gravitation and the calculation of the particles
   mass. The ELDA operation principle is based on sensing a charged dust
   particle by an array of wire electrodes as it is passing though the
   instrument. Each wire electrode is connected to a charge sensitive
   amplifier and the velocity vector is reconstructed from the signal
   shapes and amplitudes. Within the instrument, a strong electrostatic
   field is used to deflect the trajectories of the particles. The dust
   mass is determined from the change in velocity measured before and after
   deflection. The instrument is tested using particles with 54 mu m mean
   radius and a narrow size distribution. The experimental results and the
   error analyses show that ELDA can measure the mass of individual
   particle with a factor of two even for very low signal to noise ratio.

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography
   (EIM) to serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and secondarily as an
   indicator of bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceflight
   or hind limb unloading. Methods: In the first experiment, 6 mice were
   flown aboard the space shuttle (STS-135) for 13 days and 8 earthbound
   mice served as controls. In the second experiment, 14 mice underwent
   hind limb unloading (HLU) for 13 days; 13 additional mice served as
   controls. EIM measurements were made on ex vivo gastrocnemius muscle.
   Quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density (aBMD)
   measurements of the hindlimb were also performed. Results: Reductions in
   the multifrequency phase-slope parameter were observed for both the
   space flight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. For
   ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7 +/- 1.3
   degrees/MHz and 14.1 +/- 1.6 degrees/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013); for
   control and HLU groups, the values were 23.9 +/- 1.6 degrees/MHz and
   19.0 +/- 1.0 degrees/MHz, respectively (p=0.014). This parameter also
   correlated with muscle fiber size (rho=0.65, p=0.011) for spaceflight
   and hind limb aBMD (rho=0.65, p=0.0063) for both groups. Conclusions:
   These data support the concept that EIM may serve as a useful tool for
   assessment of muscle disuse secondary to immobilization or microgravity.}},

Title = {{Magnesium in the atmosphere of the planet HD209458 b: observations of
   the thermosphere-exosphere transition region}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{560}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The planet HD209458 b is one of the most well studied hot-Jupiter
   exoplanets. The upper atmosphere of this planet has been observed
   through ultraviolet/optical transit observations with Hi observation of
   the exosphere revealing atmospheric escape. At lower altitudes just
   below the thermosphere, detailed observations of the Na I absorption
   line has revealed an atmospheric thermal inversion. This thermal
   structure is rising toward high temperatures at high altitudes, as
   predicted by models of the thermosphere, and could reach similar to 10
   000 K at the exobase level. Here, we report new near ultraviolet Hubble
   Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS)
   observations of atmospheric absorptions during the planetary transit of
   HD209458 b.
   We report absorption in atomic magnesium (Mg I), while no signal has
   been detected in the lines of singly ionized magnesium (Mg II). We
   measure the Mg I atmospheric absorption to be 6.2 +/- 2.9\% in the
   velocity range from -62 to -19 km s(-1). The detection of atomic
   magnesium in the planetary upper atmosphere at a distance of several
   planetary radii gives a first view into the transition region between
   the thermosphere and the exobase, where atmospheric escape takes place.
   We estimate the electronic densities needed to compensate for the
   photo-ionization by dielectronic recombination of Mg+ to be in the range
   of 10(8)-10(9) cm(-3). Our finding is in excellent agreement with model
   predictions at altitudes of several planetary radii.
   We observe Mg I atoms escaping the planet, with a maximum radial
   velocity (in the stellar rest frame) of -60 km s(-1). Because magnesium
   is much heavier than hydrogen, the escape of this species confirms
   previous studies that the planet's atmosphere is undergoing hydrodynamic
   escape. We compare our observations to a numerical model that takes the
   stellar radiation pressure on the Mg I atoms into account. We find that
   the Mg I atoms must be present at up to similar to 7.5 planetari radii
   altitude and estimate an Mg I escape rate of similar to 3 x 10(7) g
   s(-1). Compared to previous evaluations of the escape rate of Hi atoms,
   this evaluation is compatible with a magnesium abundance roughly solar.
   A hint of absorption, detected at low level of significance, during the
   post-transit observations, could be interpreted as a Mg I cometary-like
   tail. If true, the estimate of the absorption by Mg I would be increased
   to a higher value of about 8.8 +/- 2.1\%.}},

Abstract = {{Protein engineering has traditionally relied on random mutagenesis
   strategies to generate diverse libraries, which require high-throughput
   screening or selection methods to identify rare variants. Alternatively,
   approaches to semi-rational library construction can be used to minimize
   the screening load and enhance the efficiency by which improved mutants
   may be identified. Such methods are typically limited to
   characterization of relatively few variants due to the difficulties in
   generating large rational libraries. New tools from synthetic biology,
   namely multiplexed DNA synthesis and homologous recombination, provide a
   promising avenue to rapidly construct large, rational libraries. These
   technologies also enable incorporation of synthetically encoded features
   that permit efficient characterization of the fitness of each mutant.
   Extension of these tools to protein library design could complement
   rational protein design cycles in an effort to more systematically
   search complex fitness landscapes. The highly parallelized nature with
   which such libraries can be generated also has the potential to expand
   directed protein evolution from single protein targets to protein
   networks whose concerted activities are required for the biological
   function of interest.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to explicitly compute the day-to-day variability of the
   migrating diurnal tide (DWI) between 20 km and 80 km on a global scale
   is presented and analyzed. Our method employs temperature data from two
   satellite instruments: the MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) instrument on
   the EOS (Earth Observing System) Aura spacecraft and the SABER (Sounding
   of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) instrument on the
   TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics)
   spacecraft. By taking advantage of the four daily solar local time
   measurements from the two instruments, a least squares fit representing
   the DW1 is constructed. Consequently, the daily zonal mean, DWI
   amplitude and phase are all estimated on a daily basis. Before the
   implementation of our technique, a comparative analysis between the
   instrument data sets is conducted. The analysis reveals temperature
   biases of up to 10 K, which are removed to improve our estimates. To
   evaluate performance, our method is applied to a model atmosphere
   constructed from tidal fields obtained from the Global Scale Wave Model
   (GSWM). Performance results indicate that the DWI is most effectively
   extracted from the background atmosphere and other tidal components when
   each latitude circle is well sampled and the local time sampling is
   evenly spaced. A comparison of our results to the GSWM and past
   observations support the conclusion that our method produces daily
   estimates of the DW1 that can be utilized for scientifically useful
   investigations of short term tidal variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Interpretation of the vertical structure and seasonal variation of the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The latitudinal-vertical structure and the seasonal variation of the
   diurnal migrating tide (DW1) from the troposphere to the lower
   mesosphere are investigated, using reanalysis data from the Modern Era
   Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and a
   linear tidal model. For the latitudinal-vertical structure, the observed
   feature is well represented by the four lowest-order classical Hough
   modes each of which shows its own unique vertical propagation
   characteristics. The tropospheric profile of DW1 temperature in the
   tropics is found to be mainly controlled by the first symmetric
   propagating Hough mode. The constant phase in the troposphere is due to
   the small static stability in the troposphere. For the seasonal
   variation, the amplitude from the stratosphere to the lower mesosphere
   maximizes at solstices. This is caused by a major contribution from the
   anti-symmetric propagating Hough mode. It is found that this seasonal
   variation is not explained by that of diabatic heating. Using a linear
   model, we found that background zonal wind is important for the
   seasonality. Also, using a modified mode-coupling approach, we interpret
   that in addition to primary tides generated by diabatic heating,
   secondary tides generated by meridional advection of background zonal
   momentum have a large contribution to the DW1, creating the
   above-mentioned seasonal variation from the stratosphere to the lower
   mesosphere in the tropics. It is suggested that both excitation and
   propagation characteristics can be physically interpreted in terms of
   the superposition of independent classical Hough modes. That is, each
   Hough mode is not only primarily excited by diabatic heating but also
   secondarily by mechanical forcing, and then propagates by following its
   own vertical propagation characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a high current, low voltage process.
   Nevertheless, the system voltage (3-10V) can be large enough to produce
   significant fields across a thin, insulating sample. A lumped circuit
   model is analyzed to estimate the magnitude of this field in terms of
   the die geometry. Normalizing the sample voltage with respect to the
   system voltage, and the die wall thickness to the punch radius preserves
   generality of the results. It is predicted that if the latter ranges
   from 0.15 to 0.25, then 30\% of the system voltage may be expressed
   across the sample. Thus, a sample thickness of about 1-2mm may
   experience a field of 10-30V/cm, which would be large enough to induce
   field-assisted sintering in yttria-stabilized zirconia. The results are
   corroborated with finite element analysis. The contact resistance is
   assumed to be negligible; finite values of the contact resistance would
   lead to fields that are higher than predicted.}},

Abstract = {{The defect chemistry-modulated dielectric properties of dense
   yttria-doped zirconia ceramics prepared by conventional sintering (at
   1350 degrees C-1500 degrees C) and electric field-assisted flash
   sintering (55V/cm at 900 degrees C) were studied by impedance
   spectroscopy. While the bulk dielectric properties from both sets of
   samples showed only small and insignificant changes in conductivity and
   permittivity, respectively, a huge increase of these properties was
   measured for the grain boundaries in the flash sintered specimens. A
   close analysis of these results suggests that flash sintering reduced
   grain-boundary thickness (by about 30\%), while increasing the
   concentration of oxygen vacancies near these interfaces (by about 49\%).
   The underlying mechanism proposed is electric field-assisted generation
   and accommodation of defects in the space-charge layers adjacent to the
   grain surface. The changes in measured permittivity are attributed to
   the boundary thickness effect on capacitance, while conductivity
   involved variations in its defect density-dependent intrinsic value,
   accounting for changes also observed in grain-boundary relaxation
   frequencies. Therefore, in terms of modifications to the specific
   dielectric properties of these materials, the overall consequence of
   flash sintering was to considerably lower the semi-blocking character of
   the grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of polynomial chaos (PC) to
   estimating the probability of collision between two spacecraft. Common
   methods of quantifying this probability for conjunction assessment use
   either Monte Carlo analyses or include simplifying assumptions to
   improve tractability. A PC expansion, or PCE, provides a means for
   approximating the solution to a large set of stochastic ordinary
   differential equations, which includes orbit propagation. When compared
   to Monte Carlo methods, non-intrusive, i.e., sampling-based, PCE
   generation techniques may greatly reduce the number of orbit
   propagations required to approximate the possibly non-Gaussian, a
   posteriori probability density function. The presented PC-based method
   of computing collision probability requires no fundamental simplifying
   assumptions, and reduces the computation time compared to Monte Carlo.
   This paper considers two cases where the common conjunction assessment
   assumptions are no longer valid. The results indeed demonstrate a
   reduction in computation time when compared to Monte Carlo, and improved
   accuracy when compared to simplified techniques. (C) 2013 COSPAR.

Abstract = {{We created graphene blisters that cover and seal an annular
   cylinder-shaped microcavity in a SiO2 substrate filled with a gas. By
   controlling the pressure difference between the gas inside and outside
   of the microcavity, we switch the graphene membrane between multiple
   stable equilibrium configurations. We carried out experiments starting
   from the situation where the pressure, of the gas inside and outside of
   the microcavity is set equal to a prescribed charging pressure, p(0) and
   the graphene membrane covers the cavity like an annular drum, adhered to
   the central post and the surrounding substrate due to van der Waals
   forces. We decrease the outside pressure to a value, p(e) which causes
   it to bulge into an annular blister. We systematically increase the
   charging pressure by repeating this procedure causing the annular
   blister to continue to bulge until a critical charging pressure p(c)(i)
   is reached. At this point the graphene membrane delaminates from the
   post in an unstable manner, resulting in a switch of graphene membrane
   shape from an annular to a spherical blister. Continued increase of the
   charging pressure results in the spherical blister growing with its
   height increasing, but maintaining a constant radius until a second
   critical charging pressure p(c)(o) is reached at which point the blister
   begins to delaminate from the periphery of the cavity in a stable
   manner. Here, we report a series of experiments as well as a mechanics
   and thermodynamic model that demonstrate how the interplay among system
   parameters (geometry, graphene stiffness (number of layers), pressure,
   and adhesion energy) results in the ability to controllably switch
   graphene blisters among different shapes. Arrays of these blisters can
   be envisioned to create pressure-switchable surface properties where the
   difference between patterns of annular versus spherical blisters will
   impact functionalities such as wettability, friction, adhesion, and
   surface wave characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuations of four valley glaciers in coastal south-central Alaska are
   reconstructed for the past two millennia. Tree-ring crossdates on 216
   glacially killed stumps and logs provide the primary age control, and
   are integrated with glacial stratigraphy, ages of living trees on extant
   landforms, and historic forefield photographs to constrain former ice
   margin positions. Sheridan Glacier shows four distinct phases of
   advance: in the 530s to c.640s in the First Millennium A.D., and the
   1240s to 1280s, 1510s to 1700s, and c.1810s to 1860s during the Little
   Ice Age (LIA). The latter two LIA advances are also recorded on the
   forefields of nearby Scott, Sherman and Saddlebag glaciers. Comparison
   of the Sheridan record with other two-millennia long tree-ring
   constrained valley glacier histories from south-central Alaska and
   Switzerland shows the same four intervals of advance. These expansions
   were coeval with decreases in insolation, supporting solar irradiance as
   the primary pacemaker for centennial-scale fluctuations of mid-latitude
   valley glaciers prior to the 20th century. Volcanic aerosols, coupled
   atmospheric-oceanic systems, and local glacier-specific effects may be
   important to glacier fluctuations as supplemental forcing factors, for
   causing decadal-scale differences between regions, and as a climatic
   filter affecting the magnitude of advances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   remote alpine lakes and soils. The carbon inputs from dry deposition in
   alpine National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) collectors,
   including aeolian dust and biological material, are not well constrained
   due to difficulties in retaining particulate matter in the collectors.
   Here, we developed and tested a marble insert for dry deposition
   collection at the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Station (NWT
   LTER) Soddie site (3345 m) between 24 May and 8 November 2011. We
   conducted laboratory tests of the insert's effect on particulate matter
   (PM) mass and non-purgeable organic carbon (DOC) and found that the
   insert did not significantly change either measurement. Thus, the insert
   may enable dry deposition collection of PM and DOC at NADP sites. We
   then developed a method for enumerating the collected wet and dry
   deposition with the Flow Cytometer and Microscope (FlowCAM), a
   dynamic-image particle analysis tool. The FlowCAM has the potential to
   establish morphology, which affects particle settling and retention,
   through particle diameter and aspect ratio. Particle images were used to
   track the abundance of pollen grains over time. Qualitative image
   examination revealed that most particles were biological in nature, such
   as intact algal cells and pollen. Dry deposition loading to the Soddie
   site as determined by FlowCAM measurements was highly variable, ranging
   from 100 to >230 g ha(-1) d(-1) in June August 2011 and peaking in late
   June. No significant difference in diameter or aspect ratio was found
   between wet and dry deposition, suggesting fundamental similarities
   between those deposition types. Although FlowCAM statistics and
   identification of particle types proved insightful, our total-particle
   enumeration method had a high variance and underestimated the total
   number of particles when compared to imaging of relatively large volumes
   (60-125 mL) from a single sample. We recommend use of the FlowCAM,
   especially for subclasses of particles, but in light of uncertainty in
   particle counts, believe that it should be paired with traditional
   methods such as microscopy in this stage of the technique's development.
   Analysis of well-mixed samples produced lower variability than settling
   methods used for algae samples. Use of the marble inserts in the dry
   deposition collector in the NADP context is recommended, and the
   implications of various particle counting and identification methods are
   explored. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When designing hydrogels for tissue regeneration, differences in
   polymerization mechanism and network structure have the potential to
   impact cellular behavior. Poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels were formed by
   free-radical photopolymerization of acrylates (chain-growth) or
   thiol-norbornenes (step-growth) to investigate the impact of hydrogel
   system (polymerization mechanism and network structure) on the
   development of engineered tissue. Bovine chondrocytes were encapsulated
   in hydrogels and cultured under free swelling or dynamic compressive
   loading. In the acrylate system immediately after encapsulation
   chondrocytes exhibited high levels of intracellular ROS concomitant with
   a reduction in hydrogel compressive modulus and higher variability in
   cell deformation upon compressive strain; findings that were not
   observed in the thiol-norbornene system. Long-term the quantity of
   sulfated glycosaminoglycans and total collagen was greater in the
   acrylate system, but the quality resembled that of hypertrophic
   cartilage with positive staining for aggrecan, collagens I, II, and X
   and collagen catabolism. The thiol-norbornene system led to hyaline-like
   cartilage production especially under mechanical loading with positive
   staining for aggrecan and collagen II and minimal staining for collagens
   I and X and collagen catabolism. Findings from this study confirm that
   the polymerization mechanism and network structure have long-term
   effects on the quality of engineered cartilage, especially under
   mechanical loading. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complete set of low-temperature second-order elastic constants C-ij of

   At ambient temperature, the obtained C-ij show excellent agreement with
   those reported by Gladden et al. Our C-14 exhibit monotonic elastic
   softening upon cooling, but stay positive over the entire temperature
   range considered. From a lattice-dynamics analysis, the softening can be
   attributed to an internal displacement that has two-dimensional E-g
   symmetry. The acoustic Debye temperature and Gruneisen parameter are
   calculated to be Theta(D) = 1040 K and gamma = 1.66, respectively. The
   Einstein temperatures, estimated from C-ij (T) curves, are relatively
   small compared to Theta(D) indicating that low-frequency modes are
   dominant in the zone-centred mode lattice vibrations. Also C-12 is
   essentially temperature independent.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes weighted dilution of precision (WDOP) as an
   indicator of the accuracy of position and attitude in vision-based
   navigation. WDOP accurately represents the tendencies of navigational
   errors. It is obtained by weighted least squares. The weight is
   determined by the deployment of feature points and the geometrical
   distortion of the vision sensor. The performance of WDOP was verified by
   simulation. The values of the dilution of precision (DOP) and WDOP were
   computed and analyzed by comparison with the navigational errors.
   Additionally, a correlation test was used to determine how well they
   reflect the trends of the navigational errors. Simulation results showed
   that WDOP was strongly correlated with navigational errors, which makes
   it a parameter that can be used to determine the quality of a
   vision-based navigation system. The proposed WDOP can be used as a
   practical indicator of navigation performance.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic properties of organic semiconductors are often critically
   dependent upon their ability to order from the molecular level to the
   macro-scale, as is true for many other materials attributes of
   macromolecular matter such as mechanical characteristics. Therefore,
   understanding of the molecular assembly process and the resulting
   solid-state short- and long-range order is critical to further advance
   the field of organic electronics. Here, we will discuss the structure
   development as a function of molecular weight in thin films of a model
   conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), when processed from
   solution and the melt. While focus is on the microstructural
   manipulation and characterization, we also treat the influence of
   molecular arrangement and order on electronic processes such as charge
   transport and show, based on classical polymer science arguments, how
   accounting for the structural complexity of polymers can provide a basis
   for establishing relevant
   processing/structure/property-interrelationships to explain some of

Abstract = {{We present the extensive characterization of Antarctic Pony Lake (PL)
   dissolved organic matter (DOM), an International Humic Substance Society
   (IHSS) fulvic acid (FA) reference standard, using electrospray
   ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
   (ESI FT-ICR MS) and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy
   (EEMS). PLFA is the first reference standard available through IHSS
   derived solely from a microbial source. A number of factors
   differentiate PLFA from other IHSS standards, including source material,
   geographic location, sunlight exposure, freeze-thaw conditions, and
   other in situ environmental influences. ESI FT-ICR MS and EEMS were used
   to compare the PLFA microbial DOM compositional signature with the IHSS
   Suwannee River (SR) FA, a standard frequently studied for environmental
   DOM analysis. Although CcHhOoNnSs (n = 0, 1, or 2 and s = 0 or 1)
   constituents were present in both IHSS samples, PLFA contained more N
   and S molecular species, whereas SRFA was dominated by CcHhOo compounds.
   Proteinaceous character was detected with both methods, in greater
   abundance for PLFA, which we attributed to its microbial source material
   and labile, potentially more reactive nature than SRFA. Characterization
   from both analytical techniques resulted in complementary data that
   reinforce the importance of PLFA as an IHSS reference standard that
   should be utilized for other microbiological environmental DOM
   comparisons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of microbubbles as ultrasound contrast agents is one of the
   primary methods to diagnose deep venous thrombosis. However, current
   microbubble imaging strategies require either a clot sufficiently large
   to produce a circulation filling defect or a clot with sufficient
   vascularization to allow for targeted accumulation of contrast agents.
   Previously, we reported the design of a microbubble formulation that
   modulated its ability to generate ultrasound contrast from interaction
   with thrombin through incorporation of aptamer-containing DNA crosslinks
   in the encapsulating shell, enabling the measurement of a local chemical
   environment by changes in acoustic activity. However, this contrast
   agent lacked sufficient stability and lifetime in blood to be used as a
   diagnostic tool. Here we describe a PEG-stabilized, thrombin-activated
   microbubble (PSTA-MB) with sufficient stability to be used in vivo in
   circulation with no change in biomarker sensitivity. In the presence of
   actively clotting blood, PSTA-MBs showed a 5-fold increase in acoustic
   activity. Specificity for the presence of thrombin and stability under
   constant shear flow were demonstrated in a home-built in vitro model.
   Finally, PSTA-MBs were able to detect the presence of an active clot
   within the vena cava of a rabbit sufficiently small as to not be visible
   by current non-specific contrast agents. By activating in non-occlusive
   environments, these contrast agents will be able to detect clots not
   diagnosable by current contrast agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This is the first part of a three-part paper on North American climate
   in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that
   evaluates the historical simulations of continental and regional
   climatology with a focus on a core set of 17 models. The authors
   evaluate the models for a set of basic surface climate and hydrological
   variables and their extremes for the continent. This is supplemented by
   evaluations for selected regional climate processes relevant to North
   American climate, including cool season western Atlantic cyclones, the
   North American monsoon, the U.S. Great Plains low-level jet, and Arctic
   sea ice. In general, the multimodel ensemble mean represents the
   observed spatial patterns of basic climate and hydrological variables
   but with large variability across models and regions in the magnitude
   and sign of errors. No single model stands out as being particularly
   better or worse across all analyses, although some models consistently
   outperform the others for certain variables across most regions and
   seasons and higher-resolution models tend to perform better for regional
   processes. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble shows a slight improvement
   relative to CMIP3 models in representing basic climate variables, in
   terms of the mean and spread, although performance has decreased for
   some models. Improvements in CMIP5 model performance are noticeable for
   some regional climate processes analyzed, such as the timing of the
   North American monsoon. The results of this paper have implications for
   the robustness of future projections of climate and its associated
   impacts, which are examined in the third part of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second part of a three-part paper on North American climate
   in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that
   evaluates the twentieth-century simulations of intraseasonal to
   multidecadal variability and teleconnections with North American
   climate. Overall, the multimodel ensemble does reasonably well at
   reproducing observed variability in several aspects, but it does less
   well at capturing observed teleconnections, with implications for future
   projections examined in part three of this paper. In terms of
   intraseasonal variability, almost half of the models examined can
   reproduce observed variability in the eastern Pacific and most models
   capture the midsummer drought over Central America. The multimodel mean
   replicates the density of traveling tropical synoptic-scale disturbances
   but with large spread among the models. On the other hand, the coarse
   resolution of the models means that tropical cyclone frequencies are
   underpredicted in the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific. The frequency
   and mean amplitude of ENSO are generally well reproduced, although
   teleconnections with North American climate are widely varying among
   models and only a few models can reproduce the east and central Pacific
   types of ENSO and connections with U.S. winter temperatures. The models
   capture the spatial pattern of Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)
   variability and its influence on continental temperature and West Coast
   precipitation but less well for the wintertime precipitation. The
   spatial representation of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is
   reasonable, but the magnitude of SST anomalies and teleconnections are
   poorly reproduced. Multidecadal trends such as the warming hole over the
   central-southeastern United States and precipitation increases are not
   replicated by the models, suggesting that observed changes are linked to
   natural variability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a publicly available, long-term (1915-2011),
   hydrologically consistent dataset for the conterminous United States,
   intended to aid in studies of water and energy exchanges at the land
   surface. These data are gridded at a spatial resolution of 1/16 degrees
   latitude/longitude and are derived from daily temperature and
   precipitation observations from approximately 20 000 NOAA Cooperative
   Observer (COOP) stations. The available meteorological data include
   temperature, precipitation, and wind, as well as derived humidity and
   downwelling solar and infrared radiation estimated via algorithms that
   index these quantities to the daily mean temperature, temperature range,
   and precipitation, and disaggregate them to 3-hourly time steps.
   Furthermore, the authors employ the variable infiltration capacity (VIC)
   model to produce 3-hourly estimates of soil moisture, snow water
   equivalent, discharge, and surface heat fluxes. Relative to an earlier
   similar dataset by Maurer and others, the improved dataset has 1)
   extended the period of analysis (1915-2011 versus 1950-2000), 2)
   increased the spatial resolution from 1/8 degrees to 1/16 degrees, and
   3) used an updated version of VIC. The previous dataset has been widely
   used in water and energy budget studies, climate change assessments,
   drought reconstructions, and for many other purposes. It is anticipated
   that the spatial refinement and temporal extension will be of interest
   to a wide cross section of the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of and typical
   results from a new field-monitoring system to evaluate changes in matric
   suction and temperature profiles in subgrade soil layers beneath
   constructed pavement systems over an extended period of time. This
   monitoring system involves the placement of sensors capable of inferring
   the volumetric water content and temperature of soils into a borehole in
   the shoulder of an existing pavement. High-permeability silica flour is
   used to backfill the borehole around the sensors so that changes in
   matric suction with depth in the subgrade can be inferred through the
   soil-water retention curve of the silica flour. The monitoring results
   from a pavement site in Arkansas with low-permeability clay subgrade are
   compared with predictions from the Enhanced Integrated Climatic Model
   (EICM). The measured and predicted temperature distributions match well,
   but the EICM did not capture the fluctuations in matric suction inferred
   from the monitoring system. This can be attributed not only to the fact
   that the monitoring system captured the two-dimensional water flow near
   the pavement shoulder but also to the possibility that the EICM may not
   have adequately represented the water-flow process through the asphalt
   and base-course layers. Profiles of matric suction and temperature
   obtained using the monitoring system provide real-time, site-specific
   feedback on interactions between the atmosphere and pavement systems.
   Comparison of results from multiple pavement sites with clay subgrades
   across Arkansas demonstrates the variability in matric suction and
   temperature changes in different climatic settings.}},

Abstract = {{The relative attitude is studied between two charge controlled
   spacecraft being held at a fixed separation distance. While one body has
   a spherical shape, the 2nd body is assumed to be non-spherical and
   tumbling. The attitude control goal is to arrest the rotation of the 2nd
   body. While prior work has identified the existence of torques between
   charged bodies, this is the first analytical study on a charged feedback
   attitude control. Using the recently developed multi-sphere method to
   provide a simplified electrostatic force and torque model between
   non-spherical shapes, Lyapunov theory is used to develop a stabilizing
   attitude control using spacecraft potential as the control variable.
   Zero and non-zero equilibrium potentials are considered, with the later
   suitable for the electrostatic tug concept. With a pulling
   configuration, the cylinder will come to rest with the long axis aligned
   with the inter-vehicle axis in a stable configuration. For a pusher, the
   cylinder will settle 90 degrees rotated from this axis. Numerical
   simulations illustrate the control performance.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of methane steam reforming were studied on a Ni/Mg/K/Al2O3
   catalyst that was developed for conditioning of biomass-derived syngas.
   Reactions were conducted in a packed-bed reactor while the
   concentrations of reactants (methane and steam) and products (hydrogen,
   carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide) were varied at atmospheric
   pressure, with the effects of temperature (525-700 A degrees C) and
   residence time also being investigated. A power law rate model was
   developed using nonlinear regression to provide a predictive capability
   for the rate of methane conversion over this catalyst, to be used for
   reactor design and technoeconomic analysis of process designs. In order
   to provide some mechanistic insight, and to compare this catalyst to
   other non-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts reported in the literature, a
   reaction mechanism consisting of five elementary steps, using a
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood type approach, was also considered. These five
   steps included: (i) CH4 adsorption, (ii) H2O adsorption, (iii) surface
   reaction of adsorbed CH4 and H2O to form CO and H-2, (iv) CO desorption,
   and (v) H-2 desorption. Nonlinear regression was then used to fit each
   of the rate laws to the experimental data. From these results, the model
   that assumed CH4 adsorption to be the rate determining step provided the
   best fit of the experimental data. This finding is consistent with
   literature studies on non-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, in which methane
   adsorption has been proposed to be the rate determining step during
   catalytic methane steam reforming. Both the power rate laws and the rate
   law assuming CH4 adsorption to be the rate determining step can be used
   as predictive tools for determining methane conversion for a given set
   of process conditions. Additionally, a rate expression that assumed the
   rate was only a function of methane partial pressure was considered,
   namely, , where , with P-CH4 in units of Torr. This first-order-methane
   rate expression fit the data well, yielding an apparent activation
   energy over this catalyst of E-a = 93 kJ/mol and the pre-exponential
   rate constant of k(0) = 7.67 x 10(5) mol/(g-cat s Torr CH4).}},

Title = {{The impact of yaw error on aeroelastic characteristics of a horizontal
   axis wind turbine blade}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{256-268}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Horizontal axis wind turbines operate under yawed conditions for a
   considerable period of time due to the power control mechanism or sudden
   changes in the wind direction. This in turn can alter the dynamic
   characteristics of a turbine blade because the flow over the rotor plane
   may trigger complicated induced velocity patterns. In this study, an
   aeroelastic analysis under yawed flow conditions is carried out to
   investigate the effects of yaw error on the blade behaviors and dynamic
   stability. A beam model including geometric nonlinearity coupled with
   unsteady aerodynamics based on a free-vortex wake method with the blade
   element theory is employed in the present study. The aerodynamic
   approach for a horizontal axis wind turbine blade under yawed flow
   conditions is verified through comparison with measurements. It is also
   shown that the present method gives slightly better results at high yaw
   angles than does the method previously published in the literature. The
   dynamic instabilities of a National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW
   reference wind turbine have subsequently been investigated for various
   wind speeds and yaw angles. Observations are made that yaw effects
   induce considerable changes in airloads and blade structural behavior.
   Also, the aeroelastic damping values for this particular blade under
   yawed flow conditions can be reduced by up to approximately 33\% in the
   worst case. Therefore, it is concluded that the impacts of yaw
   misalignments adversely influenced the dynamic aeroelastic stability of
   the horizontal axis wind turbine blade. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Relativistic electron precipitation into the atmosphere can contribute
   significant losses to the outer radiation belt. In particular, rapid
   narrow precipitation features termed precipitation bands have been
   hypothesized to be an integral contributor to relativistic electron
   precipitation loss, but quantification of their net effect is still
   needed. Here we investigate precipitation bands as measured at low earth
   orbit by the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) CubeSat.
   Two precipitation bands of MeV electrons were observed on 18-19 January
   2013, concurrent with precipitation seen by the 2013 Balloon Array for
   Radiation belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) campaign. The newly
   available conjugate measurements allow for a detailed estimate of the
   temporal and spatial features of precipitation bands for the first time.
   We estimate the net electron loss due to the precipitation bands and
   find that similar to 20 such events could empty the entire outer belt.
   This study suggests that precipitation bands play a critical role in
   radiation belt losses.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in the thermoelectric (TE) properties of
   hybrid organic-inorganic structures, such as molecular junctions,
   organic-inorganic multilayers, and nanocomposites, owing to the recent
   success in nanostructuring of inorganic materials for high-efficiency
   thermoelectrics and the ability to synthesize hybrid materials in close
   analog to inorganic counterparts with much lower cost and greater
   flexibility. Compared to inorganic counterparts, the development of
   hybrid inorganic-polymer structures for TE applications are in a nascent
   stage, where theoretical understanding is very much needed and many
   potential nanoscale structures are yet to be explored. In this work, we
   study quasi-one-dimensional TE transport in a nanoscale
   polymer-semiconductor-polymer (PSP) junction, where a semiconductor
   quantum dot (QD) is trapped between two bulk polymers with aligned
   polymer chains. The Holstein small polaron model, which can be used for
   strong electron-phonon interaction in polymers beyond the perturbation
   theory, is used to model the transport in such a nanoscale PSP junction.
   We then use the Green's function method along with the Landauer formula
   to calculate the TE properties of a nanoscale PSP junction, including
   the electrical conductance G, the Seebeck coefficient S, and the power
   factor GS(2). Due to the sharp distribution of electron density of
   states in the polymer leads and the discrete energy levels in a QD,
   simultaneous enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical
   conductance in nanoscale PSP junctions can be achieved when the energy
   levels are appropriately aligned, compared to metal-molecule-metal
   junctions. The theoretical approach to study nanoscale PSP junctions can
   be readily extended to the study of QD-polymer nanocomposites. The
   quantitative results obtained in this work can shed some light in
   material selection for the synthesis of hybrid inorganic-polymer
   nanocomposites, where theoretical guidance is much in need.}},

Abstract = {{Connectionist models that capture developmental change over time have
   much to offer in the field of language development research. Several
   models in the literature have made good contact with developmental data,
   effectively captured behavioral tasks, and accurately represented
   linguistic input available to young children. However, fewer models of
   language development have truly captured the process of developmental
   change over time. In this review paper, we discuss several prominent
   connectionist models of early word learning, focusing on semantic
   development, as well as our recent work modeling the emergence of word
   learning biases in different populations. We also discuss the potential
   of these kinds of models to capture children's language development at
   the individual level. We argue that a modeling approach that truly
   captures change over time has the potential to inform theory, guide
   research, and lead to innovations in early language intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Layering is found and exploited in a variety of soft material systems,
   ranging from complex macromolecular self-assemblies to block copolymer
   and small-molecule liquid crystals. Because the control of layer
   structure is required for applications and characterization, and because
   defects reveal key features of the symmetries of layered phases, a
   variety of techniques have been developed for the study of soft-layer
   structure and defects, including X-ray diffraction and visualization
   using optical transmission and fluorescence confocal polarizing
   microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and SEM and transmission electron
   microscopy, including freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy.
   Here, it is shown that thermal sublimation can be usefully combined with
   such techniques to enable visualization of the 3D structure of soft
   materials. Sequential sublimation removes material in a stepwise
   fashion, leaving a remnant layer structure largely unchanged and
   viewable using SEM, as demonstrated here using a lamellar smectic liquid
   crystal.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix elasticity regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and
   differentiation of many cell types across various tissues. In
   particular, stiffened matrix in fibrotic lesions has been shown to
   promote pathogenic myofibroblast activation. To better understand the
   underlying pathways by which fibroblasts mechano-sense matrix
   elasticity, we cultured primary valvular interstitial cells (VICs)
   isolated from porcine aortic valves on poly(ethylene glycol)-based
   hydrogels with physiologically relevant and tunable elasticities. We
   show that soft hydrogels preserve the quiescent fibroblast phenotype of
   VICs much better than stiff plastic plates. We demonstrate that the
   PI3K/AKT pathway is significantly up-regulated when VICs are cultured on
   stiff gels or tissue culture polystyrene compared with freshly isolated
   VICs. In contrast, myofibroblasts de-activate and pAKT/AKT decreases as
   early as 2 h after reducing the substrate modulus. When PI3K or AKT is
   inhibited on stiff substrates, myofibroblast activation is blocked. When
   constitutively active PI3K is overexpressed, the myofibroblast phenotype
   is promoted even on soft substrates. These data suggest that valvular
   fibroblasts are sensing the changes in matrix elasticity through the
   PI3K/AKT pathway. This mechanism may be used by other mechano-sensitive
   cells in response to substrate modulus, and this pathway may be a
   worthwhile target for treating matrix stiffness-associated diseases.
   Furthermore, hydrogels can be designed to recapitulate important
   mechanical cues in native tissues to preserve aspects of the native
   phenotype of primary cells for understanding basic cellular responses to
   biophysical and biochemical signals, and for tissue-engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A method was developed to monitor dynamic changes in protein structure
   and interfacial behavior on surfaces by single-molecule Forster
   resonance energy transfer. This method entails the incorporation of
   unnatural amino acids to site-specifically label proteins with
   single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer probes for
   high-throughput dynamic fluorescence tracking microscopy on surfaces.
   Structural changes in the enzyme organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) were
   monitored upon adsorption to fused silica (FS) surfaces in the presence
   of BSA on a molecule-by-molecule basis. Analysis of >30,000 individual
   trajectories enabled the observation of heterogeneities in the kinetics
   of surface-induced OPH unfolding with unprecedented resolution. In
   particular, two distinct pathways were observed: a majority population
   (similar to 85\%) unfolded with a characteristic time scale of 0.10 s,
   and the remainder unfolded more slowly with a time scale of 0.7 s.
   Importantly, even after unfolding, OPH readily desorbed from FS
   surfaces, challenging the common notion that surface-induced unfolding
   leads to irreversible protein binding. This suggests that protein
   fouling of surfaces is a highly dynamic process because of subtle
   differences in the adsorption/desorption rates of folded and unfolded
   species. Moreover, such observations imply that surfaces may act as a
   source of unfolded (i.e., aggregation-prone) protein back into solution.
   Continuing study of other proteins and surfaces will examine whether
   these conclusions are general or specific to OPH in contact with FS.
   Ultimately, this method, which is widely applicable to virtually any
   protein, provides the framework to develop surfaces and surface
   modifications with improved biocompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate, using theory and simulations, the role of the short and
   long grafted chains in polydisperse polymer grafted nanoparticles in
   stabilizing particle dispersion in a chemically similar polymer matrix
   in the presence of particle-particle attractions. The effect of the
   short and long chains in a polydisperse or bidisperse graft length
   distribution on the potential of mean force between the polymer grafted
   nanoparticles is coupled and distinct from their role in the
   corresponding deconstructed short and long monodisperse distributions.
   At high grafting density, the increased monomer crowding near the
   particle surface from both short and long chains maximizes shielding of
   particle-particle attraction, while the length and crowding of long
   chains away from the particle surface determine the location, range, and
   strength of the steric repulsion and midrange attraction. We find that
   to maximize grafted nanoparticle dispersion, it is best to synthesize
   grafted particles at high grafting density with polymer graft length
   distributions that maximize monomer crowding near the particle surface
   to shield particle-particle attraction and minimize crowding at farther
   distances from the particle to increase wetting of the grafted layer by
   matrix chains. Polydisperse (log-normal) graft length distributions and
   bidisperse graft length distributions with few long chains among many
   short chains satisfy this criterion and better disperse grafted
   particles in a chemically identical matrix than monodisperse grafts or
   bidisperse graft length distributions with equal number of short and
   long chains, with equivalent average graft length.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical Ca test was used to measure H2O vapor transmission
   through polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) polymer with a thickness of 200
   mu m. On the basis of the time required for the normalized conductance
   of the Ca film to reach zero, the H2O vapor transmission rate was
   determined versus H2O flux, temperature, and saturation of the PEN
   polymer with H2O. The H2O vapor transmission rate was proportional to
   the H2O flux and only weakly dependent on temperature at constant H2O
   flux. The transmission coefficient, Gamma, for H2O through the PEN
   polymer at 70 degrees C was Gamma similar to 3.2 x 10(-10). The
   corresponding water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) at 70 degrees C/80\%
   RH was 0.65 g/(m(2) day). The temperature dependence of the H2O vapor
   transmission rate through PEN at constant H2O flux yielded an activation
   barrier of E = 12.4 kJ/mol. There was no observable reservoir effect for
   H2O in the PEN polymer. The H2O vapor transmission rates for initially
   dry or H2O-saturated PEN polymer substrates were nearly identical at
   various temperatures. Although the time required for the normalized
   conductance of the Ca film to reach zero was inversely proportional to
   the H2O flux, the Ca film conductance did not decrease linearly versus
   H2O exposure. The Ca film conductance changed very little during initial
   H2O exposure. This behavior may be caused by the nonlinear oxidation
   kinetics of the Ca film.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) has
   evolved to an established, powerful technique to study photoactive
   layers. With this feature paper, we aim to fulfill two goals: (1) give a
   full description of the photoinduced TRMC technique, including
   experimental details and data analysis, and discuss to what extent the
   TRMC technique differs from more conventional DC techniques and (2)
   illustrate the potential of this technique for probing charge carrier
   dynamics in photoactive materials. For these reasons recent studies on
   conjugated polymer:fullerene blends will be presented and discussed. The
   findings from these studies have advanced the insight into the mechanism
   of charge carrier generation and decay in polymer:fullerene blends,
   which allows us to improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells
   based on this active layer architecture. In short, it is shown how the
   TRMC technique can be used as a versatile method to screen the potential
   of new photovoltaic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The PHENIX collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
   reports measurements of azimuthal dihadron correlations near midrapidity
   in d + Au collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV. These measurements
   complement recent analyses by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider
   (LHC) involving central p + Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 5.02 TeV,
   which have indicated strong anisotropic long-range correlations in
   angular distributions of hadron pairs. The origin of these anisotropies
   is currently unknown. Various competing explanations include parton
   saturation and hydrodynamic flow. We observe qualitatively similar, but
   larger, anisotropies in d + Au collisions at RHIC compared to those seen
   in p + Pb collisions at the LHC. The larger extracted upsilon(2) values
   in d + Au are consistent with expectations from hydrodynamic
   calculations owing to the larger expected initial-state eccentricity
   compared with that from p + Pb collisions. When both are divided by an
   estimate of the initial-state eccentricity the scaled anisotropies
   follow a common trend with multiplicity that may extend to heavy ion
   data at RHIC and the LHC, where the anisotropies are widely thought to
   arise from hydrodynamic flow.}},

Abstract = {{To accelerate the design and discovery of novel functional materials,
   here, p-type transparent conducting oxides, an inverse design approach
   is formulated, integrating three steps: i) articulating the target
   properties and selecting an initial pool of candidates based on design
   principles, ii) screening this initial pool by calculating the selection
   metrics for each member, and iii) laboratory realization and
   more-detailed theoretical validation of the remaining best-of-class
   materials. Following a design principle that suggests using d5(5)
   cations for good p-type conductivity in oxides, the Inverse Design
   approach is applied to the class of ternary Mn(II) oxides, which are
   usually considered to be insulating materials. As a result, Cr2MnO4 is
   identified as an oxide closely following selection metrics of
   thermodynamic stability, wide-gap, p-type dopability, and
   band-conduction mechanism for holes (no hole self-trapping). Lacking an
   intrinsic hole-producing acceptor defect, Li is further identified as a
   suitable dopant. Bulk synthesis of Li-doped Cr2MnO4 exhibits at least
   five orders of magnitude enhancement of the hole conductivity compared
   to undoped samples. This novel approach of stating functionality first,
   then theoretically searching for candidates that merits synthesis and
   characterization, promises to replace the more traditional
   non-systematic approach for the discovery of advanced functional
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{We present results for three charmonia states (psi' chi(c), and J/ psi)
   in d + Au collisions at vertical bar y vertical bar < 0.35 and root
   s(NN) = 200 GeV. We find that the modification of the psi' yield
   relative to that of the J/ psi scales approximately with charged
   particle multiplicity at midrapidity across p + A, d + Au, and A + A
   results from the Super Proton Synchrotron and the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider. In large-impact-parameter collisions we observe a similar
   suppression for the psi' and J/ psi, while in small-impact-parameter
   collisions the more weakly bound psi' is more strongly suppressed. Owing
   to the short time spent traversing the Au nucleus, the larger psi'
   suppression in central events is not explained by an increase of the
   nuclear absorption owing to meson formation time effects.}},

   inactivation of E. coli by XeBr excilamp (282nm) was assessed using
   direct and integrating sphere spectroscopy for absorbance measurements
   in the calculations of UV doses. Complete disinfection (no quantifiable
   E. coli colonies) was observed at 30 (0.25g/L of TiO2) and 40mJ/cm(2)
   (0.1g/L of TiO2), whereas UV alone and the treatment in the presence of
   0.5g/L of TiO2 produced tailing in the dose-response curves. The optimum
   concentration of TiO2 was found to be 0.25g/L, which correlates with the
   highest center dot OH exposure (CT value) and steady state concentration
   of center dot OH. This study demonstrates the importance of proper
   calculation of UV dose and inclusion of center dot OH exposure effects
   when reporting results from disinfection studies using technologies with
   multiple modes of inactivation such as with UV/TiO2.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous TiO2 thin films were conformally coated onto the surface of
   both graphene (G) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) samples using
   atomic layer deposition (ALD). An ultrathin Al2O3 adhesion layer was
   employed to obtain the conformal TiO2 ALD films. Using 1 M KOH as the
   electrolyte, the electrochemical characteristics of TiO2 ALD films grown
   using 25 and SO TiO2 ALD cycles were then determined using cyclic
   voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. Because the TiO2 ALD films were ultrathin, the
   poor electrical conductivity and low ionic diffusivity of TiO2 did not
   limit the ability of the TiO2 ALD films to display high specific
   capacitance. The specific capacitances of the TiO2 ALD-coated G and CNT
   samples after 50 TiO2 ALD cycles were 97.5 and 135 F/g, respectively, at
   1 A/g. The pseudocapacitance of the TiO2 ALD films greatly exceeded the
   electric double layer capacitance of the uncoated G and CNT samples. The
   galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments also revealed that the charge
   storage was dependent on the thickness of the TiO2 ALD film. This
   observation argues that the pseudocapacitance is derived largely from
   the TiO2 bulk and is not limited to the TiO2 surface. The molar ratio of
   stored charge to TiO2 was estimated to be in the range of 0.03-0.08 (mol
   stored charge/mol TiO2) for the various TiO2 ALD-coated G and CNT
   samples. An optimized asymmetric cell was also developed based on TiO2
   ALD-coated CNT as the positive electrode and uncoated CNT as the
   negative electrode. This energy storage device could be reversibly
   operated over a wide voltage range of 0-1.5 V in the aqueous 1 M KOH
   electrolyte. An energy density of 4.47 W.h/kg was achieved on the basis
   of the total weight of both electrodes. This energy density was similar
   to 4 times higher than the symmetric CNT cell. The TiO2 ALD-coated G and
   CNT electrodes and the asymmetric cell based on the TiO2 ALD-coated
   electrode exhibited excellent stability over >1000 cycles. The results
   of this study demonstrate that metal oxide ALD on high surface area
   conducting carbon substrates can be used to fabricate high energy
   storage supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Multiphoton photoelectron emission from individual SiO2 core-Au shell
   nanoparticles supported on an ITO substrate is studied with ultrafast
   scanning photoemission imaging microscopy. Higher than expected
   photoemission yields (similar to 10(5)-fold) and a strong sensitivity to
   excitation laser polarization direction indicate the presence of
   anomalously high electromagnetic field enhancement areas (i.e., ``hot
   spots{''}) on the surface of Au nanoshells. The measured magnitude of
   the photoelectron current is consistent with 1-2 localized hot spots on
   each nanoparticle exhibiting electric near-field enhancement factors of
   nominally vertical bar E vertical bar/vertical bar E-0 vertical bar
   similar to 50-100. Secondary electron microscopy (SEM) studies reveal
   asperities on the surface of each nanoparticle that most likely arise
   due to postsynthetic Ostwald ripening of the Au shell layer. However, no
   correlation is found between these features and the laser polarization
   that yields the maximum photoelectron emissivity, indicating that the
   hot spots responsible for the observed high electron emission rates are
   smaller than our SEM resolution of similar to 3-5 nm. Numerical
   electrodynamics simulations of near-field enhancements (vertical bar E
   vertical bar/vertical bar E-0 vertical bar similar to 20) for the two
   most commonly observed defect geometries (i.e., asperities and pinholes)
   can account for <20-50\% of the experimentally inferred values. The
   larger near-field enhancements observed experimentally thus provide
   indirect evidence for sharp asperities and crevices in Au nanoshells
   considerably below the optical diffraction limit.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical formation of hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) from
   effluent organic matter (EfOM) depends upon the chemical properties of
   this heterogeneous mixture. In this study, two EfOM samples collected
   from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP A and B) were fractionated by
   both hydrophobicity (bulk and non-humic) and apparent molecular weight
   (A/v1W). The apparent quantum yield for HO center dot formation
   ((Phi(center dot)(HO)) and the maximum fluorescence quantum yield
   (Phi(F)) were subsequently measured for each subfraction. The formation
   rates of HO center dot (considering only the 10
   hydrogen-peroxide-independent pathways) for the bulk waters were 4.8 X
   10(-10) and 9.6 X M s(-1) for WVVTP A and B, respectively. For the AMW
   fractions, the values of Phi(center dot)(HO) increased as the AIVIVV of
   the material decreased. For the W1NTP A sample, the Phi(center dot)(HO)
   increased from 2.54 x 10(-4) (bulk water) to 6.29 X 10(-4) for the <I
   kDa fraction, and for the WVVTP B sample, the value of Phi(center
   dot)(HO) increased from 6.50 x 10(-5) for bulk water to 3.45 X 10(-4)
   for the <1 kDa fraction. In the case of fluorescence, the values of
   Phi(F) ranged from 2.37 X 10(-4) (bulk water) to 3.48 X 10(-4) (<1 kDa
   fraction) for WVVTP A and 3.19 X 10(-4) (bulk water) to 5.75 X 10(-4)
   (<1 kDa fraction) for WWTP B. There was a linear correlation between
   Phi(center dot)(HO) and Phi(F), suggesting that different photophysical
   processes occur in the chemical components of the fractions.
   Understanding the formation of HO' from EfOM is essential for
   understanding wastewater-impacted aquatic systems because these results
   influence the photochemical degradation and mineralization of trace
   organic contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria and fungi are ubiquitous throughout the Earth's lower
   atmosphere where they often represent an important component of
   atmospheric aerosols with the potential to impact human health and
   atmospheric dynamics. However, the diversity, composition, and
   spatiotemporal dynamics of these airborne microbes remain poorly
   understood. We performed a comprehensive analysis of airborne microbes
   across two aerosol size fractions at urban and rural sites in the
   Colorado Front Range over a 14-month period. Coarse (PM10-2.5) and fine
   (PM2.5) particulate matter samples were collected at weekly intervals
   with both bacterial and fungal diversity assessed via high-throughput
   sequencing. The diversity and composition of the airborne communities
   varied across the sites, between the two size fractions, and over time.
   Bacteria were the dominant type of bioaerosol in the collected air
   samples, while fungi and plants (pollen) made up the remainder, with the
   relative abundances of fungi peaking during the spring and summer
   months. As bacteria made up the majority of bioaerosol particles, we
   analyzed the bacterial communities in greater detail using a
   bacterial-specific 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach. Overall, bacterial
   taxonomic richness and the relative abundances of specific bacterial
   taxa exhibited significant patterns of seasonality. Likewise, airborne
   bacterial communities varied significantly between sites and across
   aerosol size fractions. Source-tracking analyses indicate that soils and
   leaves represented important sources of bacteria to the near-surface
   atmosphere across all locations with cow fecal bacteria also
   representing an important source of bioaerosols at the more rural sites
   during early fall and early spring. Together, these data suggest that a
   complex set of environmental factors, including changes in atmospheric
   conditions and shifts in the relative importance of available microbial
   sources, act to control the composition of microbial bioaerosols in
   rural and urban environments.}},

   breccia zones, and interiors of unfractured core. The U-series approach
   relies on the disruption of radioactive secular equilibrium between
   isotopes in the uranium-series decay chain due to preferential
   mobilization of U-234 relative to U-238, and U relative to Th. Samples
   from discrete fractures were obtained by milling fracture surfaces
   containing thin secondary mineral coatings of clays, silica, Fe-Mn
   oxyhydroxides, and zeolite. Intact core interiors and breccia fragments
   were sampled in bulk. In addition, profiles of rock matrix extending 15
   to 44 mm away from several fractures that show evidence of recent flow
   were analyzed to investigate the extent of fracture/matrix water
   exchange. Samples of rock matrix have U-234/U-238 and Th-230/U-238
   activity ratios (AR) closest to radioactive secular equilibrium
   indicating only small amounts of groundwater penetrated unfractured
   matrix. Greater U mobility was observed in welded-tuff matrix with
   elevated porosity and in zeolitized bedded tuff. Samples of brecciated
   core were also in secular equilibrium implying a lack of long-range
   hydraulic connectivity in these cases. Samples of discrete fracture
   surfaces typically, but not always, were in radioactive disequilibrium.
   Many fractures had isotopic compositions plotting near the Th-230-U-234
   1: 1 line indicating a steady-state balance between U input and removal
   along with radioactive decay. Numerical simulations of U-series isotope
   evolution indicate that 0.5 to 1 million years are required to reach
   steady-state compositions. Once attained, disequilibrium U-234/U-238 and
   Th-230/U-238 AR values can be maintained indefinitely as long as
   hydrological and geochemical processes remain stable. Therefore, many
   Pahute Mesa fractures represent stable hydrologic pathways over
   million-year timescales. A smaller number of samples have
   non-steady-state compositions indicating transient conditions in the
   last several hundred thousand years. In these cases, Umobility is
   dominated by overall gains rather than losses of U. Published by

   maneuver. At this time, the satellite flew at a mean altitude of 407 km.
   Two types of gas-surface interaction are considered in the analysis. The
   first is a cosine (fully diffuse) reflection model with incomplete
   energy accommodation. The second is a blended cosine reflection model
   having full accommodation combined with a fraction of quasi-specular
   reflection having an accommodation coefficient dependent on the surface
   material. It is found that the fully diffuse model best reproduces the
   satellite data during the yaw maneuver, and that the accommodation
   coefficient is approximately 0.89 during this time.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, network operators have used simple flat-rate broadband

   the popularity of mobile devices and exponential growth of apps, videos,

   a major change in the ways in which network resources are managed, and
   the role of economics in allocating these resources. This survey reviews
   some of the well-known past broadband pricing proposals (both static and
   dynamic), including their current realizations in various consumer data
   plans around the world, and discusses several research problems and open
   questions. By exploring the benefits and challenges of pricing data,
   this article attempts to facilitate both the industrial and the academic

Abstract = {{This paper reports the use of many-objective optimization for water
   distribution system (WDS) design or rehabilitation problems. The term
   many-objective optimization refers to optimization with four or more
   objectives. The increase in the number of objectives brings new
   challenges for both optimization and visualization. This study uses a
   multiobjective evolutionary algorithm termed the epsilon Nondominated
   Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (epsilon-NSGAII) and interactive visual
   analytics to reveal and explore the tradeoffs for the Anytown network
   problem. The many-objective formulation focuses on a suite of six
   objectives, as follows: (1) capital cost, (2) operating cost, (3)
   hydraulic failure, (4) leakage, (5) water age, and (6) fire-fighting
   capacity. These six objectives are optimized based on decisions related
   to pipe sizing, tank siting, tank sizing, and pump scheduling under five
   different loading conditions. Solving the many-objective formulation
   reveals complex tradeoffs that would not be revealed in a
   lower-dimensional optimization problem. Visual analytics are used to
   explore these complex tradeoffs and identify solutions that
   simultaneously improve the overall WDS performance but with reduced
   capital and operating costs. This paper demonstrates that a
   many-objective visual analytics approach has clear advantages and
   benefits in supporting more informed, transparent decision-making in the
   WDS design process. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1391-1411}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cost-benefit assessment is used to evaluate the effectiveness of various
   seismic retrofit strategies to address concerns about earthquake safety
   and damage to older concrete frame buildings. The benefits of mitigation
   are quantified in monetary terms by assessing the reductions in risk of
   building damage (repairs) and occupant fatalities. When evaluated
   considering repair costs only, the maximum cost of retrofitting that
   offers a positive rate of return is 10\% to 30\% of the building
   replacement value. Since seismic retrofits generally cost more than
   this, this result suggests that reduced risk of damage and repairs alone
   does not warrant the expense of retrofitting. However, the added
   benefits of reduced fatality risks would make retrofitting
   cost-effective if it costs as much as 60\% of the building replacement
   cost. The cost-benefit approach provides an important tool to evaluate
   the merits of seismic mitigation in light of competing demands for
   finite public and private resources.}},

Abstract = {{The inner radiation belt is thought to be quite stable, and only the
   most intense geomagnetic storms can cause energetic electron variations
   in the slot region and inner belt. In this paper, using energetic
   electron flux data from Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions
   Transmitted from Earthquake Regions (DEMETER) satellite, we show that
   100s keV electron flux enhancements in the slot region and inner belt
   are seen quite often and can occur even during moderate geomagnetic
   storms. In addition, by transforming the energetic electron flux data
   into the phase space density (PSD), we model the inward radial transport
   of two different electron populations, =30 MeV/G (K=0) and =15MeV/G
   (K=0), using a 1-D radial diffusion model in which the radial diffusion
   coefficient is directly associated with solar wind parameters and L
   shell. The model results reproduce the PSD data well in the slot region
   and inner belt, indicating that the flux enhancement in the inner belt
   and slot region can be well explained by inward radial transport. The
   radial diffusion coefficients used in our model are much larger than the
   widely used Kp-dependent electromagnetic radial diffusion coefficient
   but are smaller than the Kp-dependent electrostatic radial diffusion
   coefficient (Brautigam and Albert, 2000), suggesting that the
   Kp-dependent diffusion coefficient cannot be simply extended to lower L
   region to account for the observed enhancements of energetic electrons
   in the slot region and inner belt.}},

   Using the amplitude ratio and phase differences between ground stations

Abstract = {{Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 10-120nm) and soft X-ray (XUV; 0-10nm)
   radiation are major heat sources for the Mars thermosphere as well as
   the primary source of ionization that creates the ionosphere. In
   investigations of Mars thermospheric chemistry and dynamics, solar
   irradiance models are used to account for variations in this radiation.
   Because of limited proxies, irradiance models do a poor job of tracking
   the significant variations in irradiance intensity in the EUV and XUV
   ranges over solar rotation time scales when the Mars-Sun-Earth angle is
   large. Recent results from Earth observations show that variations in
   photoelectron energy spectra are useful monitors of EUV and XUV
   irradiance variability. Here we investigate photoelectron energy spectra
   observed by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Electron Reflectometer (ER)
   and the FAST satellite during the interval in 2005 when Earth, Mars, and
   the Sun were aligned. The Earth photoelectron data in selected bands
   correlate well with calculations based on 1nm resolution observations
   above 27nm supplemented by broadband observations and a solar model in
   the 0-27nm range. At Mars, we find that instrumental and orbital
   limitations to the identifications of photoelectron energy spectra in
   MGS/ER data preclude their use as a monitor of solar EUV and XUV
   variability. However, observations with higher temporal and energy
   resolution obtained at lower altitudes on Mars might allow the
   separation of the solar wind and ionospheric components of electron
   energy spectra so that they could be used as reliable monitors of
   variations in solar EUV and XUV irradiance than the time shifted,
   Earth-based, F-10.7 index currently used.}},

Abstract = {{Using the multiple-scales homogenization method, we derive generalized
   sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) for electromagnetic fields at the
   interface between two media, one of which is free-space and the other a
   certain type of composite material. The parameters in these new boundary
   conditions are interpreted as effective electric and magnetic surface
   susceptibilities, which themselves are related to the geometry of the
   scatterers that constitute the composite. We show that the effective
   tangential E and H fields are not continuous across the interface except
   in the limit when the lattice constant (the spacing between the
   scatterers-atoms, molecules or inclusions in the case of a composite
   material) of the composite medium is very small compared to a
   wavelength. We derive first-order corrections to the classical
   continuity conditions. For naturally occurring materials whose lattice
   constants are on an atomic scale, these effects are shown to be
   negligible for waves at optical frequencies or lower. However, once the
   lattice constant becomes a significant fraction of a wavelength (which
   is the case for many artificial dielectrics and metamaterials), the
   corrections can be important. In previous work we have alluded to the
   fact that such a GSTC is needed to correctly account for the surface
   effects when extracting the effective material properties of a
   metamaterial. The results of this current paper justify the assumptions
   made in that previous work. In general, these GSTCs will result in
   corrections to the classical Fresnel reflection and transmission
   coefficients (which are themselves merely zeroth-order approximations to
   the actual reflection and transmission coefficients), and in a separate
   publication we will use these GSTCs to address this issue. Published by
   Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Reynolds number scaling of coherent vortex simulation and stochastic
   coherent adaptive large eddy simulation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In view of the ongoing longtime pursuit of numerical approaches that can
   capture important flow physics of high Reynolds number flows with fewest
   degrees of freedom, two important wavelet-based multi-resolution schemes
   are thoroughly examined, namely, the Coherent Vortex Simulation (CVS)
   and the Stochastic Coherent Adaptive Large Eddy Simulation (SCALES) with
   constant and spatially/temporarily variable thresholding. Reynolds
   number scaling of active spatial modes for CVS and SCALES of linearly
   forced homogeneous turbulence at high Reynolds numbers is investigated
   in dynamic study for the first time. This dynamic computational
   complexity study demonstrates that wavelet-based methods can capture
   flow-physics while using substantially fewer degrees of freedom than
   both direct numerical simulation and marginally resolved LES with the
   same level of fidelity or turbulence resolution, defined as ratio of
   subgrid scale and the total dissipations. The study provides four
   important observations: (1) the linear Reynolds number scaling of energy
   containing structures at a fixed level of kinetic energy, (2) small,
   close to unity, fractal dimension for constant-threshold CVS and SCALES
   simulations, (3) constant, close to two, fractal dimension for
   constant-dissipation SCALES that is insensitive to the level of
   fidelity, and (4) faster than quadratic decay of the compression ratio
   as a function of turbulence resolution. The very promising slope for
   Reynolds number scaling of CVS and SCALES demonstrates the potential of
   the wavelet-based methodologies for hierarchical multiscale space/time
   adaptive variable fidelity simulations of high Reynolds number turbulent
   flows. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH) and 1,2-propanediol
   (HOCH(CH3)CH2OH) was investigated over Pd/C, Au/C, and a series of
   bimetallic catalysts prepared by electroless deposition of Au onto Pd/C.
   In order to explain the enhanced activity of the bimetallic catalysts,
   the oxidation kinetics of selectively deuterated reagents were
   investigated. On Au/C and 0.61Au-Pd/C, a primary kinetic isotope effect
   was observed for d(4)-ethylene glycol (HOCD2CD2OH), indicating that C-H
   bond scission is the rate-limiting step. Density functional theory and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments show a correlation between
   an increased electron density in Au core orbitals and more favorable
   thermodynamics for C-H scission as Au is added to Pd. Computational
   studies suggest that the rate enhancement on the bimetallic surfaces
   compared to Pd is likely due to a decrease in coverage of strongly bound
   adsorbates, while the enhancement over Au is likely due to a decrease in
   the barrier for C-H scission. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1948-1956}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dimer formation was observed during ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the
   anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, and confirmed with mass spectrometry,
   NMR and fluorescence analysis. The dimers were combinations of the two
   parent molecules or of the parent and the product of photolysis, and had
   visible color. Radical formation during UV exposure and dissolved oxygen
   photosensitized reactions played a role in dimer formation. Singlet
   oxygen formed via photosensitization by photolysis products of
   diclofenac. It reacted with diclofenac to form an epoxide which is an
   intermediate in some dimer formation pathways. Quantum yield of
   photolysis for diclofenac was 0.21 +/- 0.02 and 0.19 +/- 0.02 for UV
   irradiation from medium pressure and low pressure mercury vapor lamps,
   respectively. Band pass filter experiments revealed that the quantum
   yield is constant at wavelengths >200 nm. The same dimers formed in
   laboratory grade water when either of the two UV sources was used.
   Dimers did not form in wastewater effluent matrix, and diclofenac
   epoxide molecules may have formed bonds with organic matter rather than
   each other Implications for the importance of dimer formation in NOM are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) were used in concrete to
   improve thermal properties of the concrete, called PCM-concrete. This
   paper presents the predictions of the effective thermal conductivity of
   PCM-concrete using different composite models, such as the parallel, the
   series models, Maxwell model and Generalized Self-Consistent (GSC)
   model. Multi-phase, multi-scale internal structural models were
   developed and combined with GSC model to predict the effective thermal
   conductivity of PCM-concrete. It was found that the configuration of the
   internal structure for the PCM phase is very important. The PCM phase
   needs to be considered as a matrix (a thin shell), which can effectively
   block the heat flow and thus reduce the thermal conductivity of
   PCM-concrete. The GSC model with the suggested internal structure model
   can predict the effective thermal conductivity of PCM-concrete. The
   prediction agreed with test data quite well, and the prediction is
   within the upper and lower bounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{531-540}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Failure of a component in BCHP (building cooling, heating and power)
   system may result in failure of a sub-system or of the whole system. The
   reliability and availability analysis of BCHP system is helpful to the
   designer to decide the redundancy in case of equipment failure. This
   paper presents the redundant design of BCHP system and its operation
   mode. The SSM (state-space method) combined to the probabilistic
   analysis of Markov model, is employed to analyze the reliabilities of
   three forms of energy supply including electricity, heat and cool in
   BCHP system. The failure rate, the repair rate, the availability and the
   MTBF (mean time to failure) of the redundant and non-redundant BCHP
   systems are deduced and analyzed respectively. Then, a numerical case
   for the reliability analysis of the redundant and non-redundant BCHP
   systems is compared to the SP (separation production) system. Finally,
   the calculation results indicate that the reliability of the redundant
   BCHP system compared to the SP system obviously increases, and the
   failure rates of the electricity, heat and cool supplies decrease
   99.63\%, 94.30\% and 99.97\% respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument has been in
   operation on the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite
   since May 2007. CIPS is a multi-camera UV imager that makes
   unprecedented hemispheric-scale measurements of polar mesospheric clouds
   (PMC). The primary CIPS data products are cloud frequency, albedo, mean
   particle radius, ice water content and vertical column particle density.
   These quantities are retrieved at 25 km(2) resolution at latitudes
   between similar to 55 degrees and 84 degrees over a range of local times
   in the summer hemisphere. CIPS has obtained data for six Northern
   Hemisphere and five Southern Hemisphere PMC seasons to date and is still
   in operation and performing flawlessly. The CIPS data are made available
   to the scientific community in a variety of formats and spatial and
   temporal resolution, including full-resolution single-orbit level 2 data
   files and images, daily (hemispheric) albedo maps and images, and
   full-season latitude-binned summary files. In this paper we describe the
   CIPS measurement strategy and sampling characteristics, calibration and
   the Version 4.20 processing algorithms and retrievals. We also provide a
   quantitative evaluation of the CIPS cloud detection sensitivity and
   estimated random and systematic errors of the V4.20 cloud data products.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework for understanding and quantifying the
   leverage available for inverting the radiance signal in order to
   retrieve particle size distribution mode radius and albedo from polar
   mesospheric clouds (PMC) observations using the cloud imaging and
   particle size (CIPS) instrument on board the aeronomy of ice in the

   the scattering angle dependence of the cloud albedo and the Rayleigh
   scattered albedo controlled by ozone at the stratopause. The leverage as
   is defined in the paper is a way to quantify how much the net scattering
   angle dependence changes as a function of mode radius. The leverage is
   determined by decomposing the observed signal into orthogonal components
   which isolate the parts of the signal that are unique to changes in mode
   radius from those that could be due to changes in the background. This
   leverage is considered along with instrument noise performance to
   determine retrieval uncertainties and to understand minimum thresholds
   in the cloud retrieval parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument aboard the
   Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) mission produces detailed images
   of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) from space and has revealed several
   distinct types of cloud structures. One such commonly observed structure
   is an `ice void'-a nearly circular ice-free region with diameter varying
   from tens to thousands of kilometers. We document the morphology of
   large ice voids (diameter of similar to 500-1000 km) as seen by CIPS in
   the northern hemisphere 2007 PMC season. The meteorology of the
   mesosphere when these voids occur is described by the Navy Operational
   Global Atmospheric Prediction System-Advanced Level Physics High
   Altitude (NOGAPS-ALPHA) forecast/assimilation system. A comprehensive
   study of dynamics and transport in the mesosphere using NOGAPS-ALPHA
   during the occurrence of a large ice void observed by CIPS on 19 July
   2007 indicates that warmer temperatures (warmer than the frost point
   temperature of similar to 144K) at the location of the void may be
   related to increased tidal activity and transport of warm air from low
   latitudes. However, a detailed analysis of all identified voids is
   necessary to generalize the factors that could be responsible for the
   formation of an ice void. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) mission was launched in
   April 2007 and has completed observation of five northern hemisphere and
   four southern hemisphere seasons. One of the instruments aboard AIM, the
   Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) Experiment produces high
   resolution images of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) from space that
   reveal several interesting cloud structures in finer detail compared to
   previous space-based observations and on a larger scale than is commonly
   seen from ground based observations. We present the first classification
   of PMC structures as seen from space. Apart from Veils, Bands, and
   Whirls (Type I, II, and IV structures as identified in ground-based
   observations of noctilucent clouds (NLCs)) we also identify several
   structures that we denote as ``Voids{''}, ``Ice Rings{''}, ``Fronts{''},
   and ``Vortex-like structures{''}. These structures are larger in scale
   compared to similar structures observed in ground-based NLC images. The
   structural similarity of several of the identified features in these
   space-based PMC images to those seen in tropospheric clouds and
   wintertime mesospheric airglow images suggests that similar processes
   (e.g., gravity waves, convective instability, Kelvin Helmholtz
   instability, turbulence etc.) influence the summer mesosphere. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We report on the first observation of a descending layer of atomic
   potassium (K) in the thermosphere. This observation was made with the K
   Doppler lidar at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (18.35 degrees
   N; 66.75 degrees W) on 12 March 2005. The layer was first observed
   before 08:00 UT (04:00 AST) centered near 145 km with the vertical
   extent up to similar to 155 km, and then it descended to near 126 km
   just over 2 h later at dawn. The descent rate of 2.56 +/- 0.38 m/s
   matches the vertical phase speed of the GSWM09-computed semidiurnal tide
   between 120 and 150 km. This also matches the descent rates of the
   thermospheric semidiurnal tides measured at Arecibo. Although the K
   density above 120 km remains less than 1 cm(-3), its presence is
   unequivocal and has strong similarities to the neutral iron (Fe) layers
   in the thermosphere over 155 km recently discovered by lidar
   observations at McMurdo, Antarctica. The thermospheric K layer is
   plausibly explained by radiative electron recombination with K+ within a
   tidal ion layer, which descends with the downward phase progression of
   the semidiurnal tide. Based on the production rate of K atoms and using
   current knowledge of tidal ion layer composition, we calculate an
   electron density of near 5x10(4) cm(-3) and K+ concentration of 650
   cm(-3) at 135 km immediately prior to the layer formation. This
   discovery of a thermospheric K layer, coupled with the McMurdo discovery
   of similar Fe layers, may lead to a new approach to studying the
   thermosphere in the altitude range of similar to 100-150 km with
   resonance fluorescence lidars. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD)
   techniques with atomic level control enable a new class of hybrid
   organic inorganic materials with improved functionality. In this work,
   the cross-plane thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of
   three types of hybrid organic inorganic zincone thin films enabled by
   MLD processes and alternate AID MILD processes were measured using the
   frequency-dependent time-domain thermoreflectance method. We revealed
   the critical role of backbone flexibility in the structural morphology
   and thermal conductivity of MLD zincone thin films by comparing the
   thermal conductivity of MILD zincone films with an aliphatic backbone to
   that with aromatic backbone. Much lower thermal conductivity values were
   obtained in ALD/MLD-enabled hybrid organic inorganic zincone thin films
   compared to that of the ALD-enabled W/Al2O3 nanolaminates reported by
   Costescu et al. {[}Science 2004, 303, 989-990], which suggests that the
   dramatic material difference between organic and inorganic materials may
   provide a route for producing materials with ultralow thermal

Abstract = {{The human vertebral body and intervertebral disc interface forms the
   region where the cartilaginous endplate, annulus fibrosis and bone of
   the vertebral body are connected through an intermediate calcified
   cartilage layer. While properties of both the vertebral body and
   components of the disc have been extensively studied, limited
   quantitative data exists describing the microstructure of the vertebral
   body-intervertebral disc interface in the spine throughout development
   and degeneration. Quantitative backscattered scanning electron and
   second harmonic generation confocal imaging were used to collect
   quantitative data describing the mineral content and collagen fiber
   orientation across the interface, respectively. Specimens spanned ages
   56 days to 84 years and measurements were taken across the vertebral
   endplate at the outer annulus, inner annulus and nucleus pulposis. In
   mature and healthy endplates, collagen fibers span the calcified
   cartilage layer in all regions, including the endplate adjacent to the
   central nucleus pulposis. We also observed an abrupt transition from
   high mineral volume fractions (35-50\%) to 0\% over short distances
   measuring 3-15 microns in width across the transition from calcified
   cartilage to unmineralized cartilage. The alignment of collagen fibers
   at the outer annulus and thickness of the CC layer indicated that
   collagen fiber mineralization adjacent to the bone may serve to anchor
   the soft tissue without a gradual change in material properties.
   Combining backscattered scanning electron microscopy and second harmonic
   generation imaging on the same sections thus enable a novel assessment
   of morphology and properties in both mineralized and soft tissues at the
   vertebral body-intervertebral disc throughout development and aging. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil moisture is an essential climate variable influencing
   land-atmosphere interactions, an essential hydrologic variable impacting
   rainfall-runoff processes, an essential ecological variable regulating
   net ecosystem exchange, and an essential agricultural variable
   constraining food security. Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has
   advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific
   understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are
   being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this
   complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications,
   the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly
   developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in
   large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs
   for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture
   data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and
   proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing
   missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications
   of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term
   progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for
   drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for
   meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but
   significant challenges related to spatial variability and model
   structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of
   large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological
   or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science
   and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of
   improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Substance-dependent individuals make poor decisions on the
   Iowa Gambling Task, a reward-related decision-making task that involves
   risk and uncertainty. Task performance depends on several factors,
   including how sensitive individuals are to feedback and how well they
   learn based on such feedback. A physiological signal that guides
   decision making based on feedback is prediction error. The authors
   investigated whether disruptions in the neural systems underlying
   prediction error processing in substance-dependent individuals could
   account for decision-making performance on a modified Iowa Gambling
   Task.
   Methods: Thirty-two substance-dependent individuals and 30 healthy
   comparison subjects played a modified version of the Iowa Gambling Task
   during MR scanning. Trial-to-trial behavior and functional MRI (fMRI)
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal were analyzed using a
   computational model of prediction error based on internal expectancies.
   The authors investigated how well BOLD signal tracked prediction error
   in the striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex as well as over the whole
   brain in patients relative to comparison subjects.
   Results: Compared with healthy subjects, substance-dependent patients
   were less sensitive to loss compared with gain, made less consistent
   choices, and performed worse on the modified Iowa Gambling Task. The
   ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex did not track
   prediction error as strongly in patients as in healthy subjects.
   Conclusions: Weaker tracking of prediction error in substance-dependent
   relative to healthy individuals suggests that altered frontal-striatal
   error learning signals may underlie decision-making impairments in drug
   abusers. Computational fMRI may help bridge the knowledge gap between
   physiology and behavior to inform research aimed at substance abuse
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{An array of passive silicon-on-insulator optical devices is laid out in
   repeating patterns on four foundry-fabricated wafers. The physical and
   optical characterization of these microrings, racetrack resonators, and
   directional couplers are found to exhibit significant variation in
   optical response. A device-heating experiment carried out on a number of
   different devices demonstrates that thermal effects are independent of
   the device's location on the wafer. An analysis of the variation of the
   optical responses of the room-temperature devices is used to determine
   the process variation. We find that if we form successive arrays of the
   values of a quantity of interest (the peak wavelength of a transfer
   function) at a single device at some point on the wafer, and then
   increase the size of the array by including the values of the devices at
   ever greater distances from the original, then the variance of the
   values of the successive arrays increases linearly with the linear
   extent of the sample. That is, the process variation exhibits ``random
   walk{''} pattern with spatial extent. We express the process variation

Abstract = {{Previous pedestal turbulence measurements in the National Spherical
   Torus Experiment assessed the spatial and temporal properties of
   turbulence in the steep gradient region of H-mode pedestals during edge
   localized mode (ELM)-free, MHD-quiescent periods. Here, we extend the
   analysis to fluctuation amplitudes and compare observations to pedestal
   turbulence simulations. Measurements indicate normalized fluctuation
   amplitudes are about 1-5\% in the steep gradient region. Regression
   analysis indicates fluctuation amplitudes scale positively with electron
   density gradient, collisionality, and poloidal beta, and scale
   negatively with magnetic shear, electron density, ion temperature
   gradient (ITG), toroidal flow and radial electric field. The scalings
   are most consistent with trapped electron mode, kinetic ballooning mode,
   or microtearing instabilities, but, notably, least consistent with ITG
   turbulence. Gyrokinetic simulations of pedestal turbulence with
   realistic pedestal profiles show collisional instabilities with growth
   rates that increase at higher density gradient and decrease at higher
   ITG, in qualitative agreement with observed scalings. Finally,
   Braginskii fluid simulations of pedestal turbulence do not reproduce
   scalings from measurements and gyrokinetic simulations, and suggest
   electron dynamics can be a critical factor for accurate pedestal
   turbulence simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A tunable hemispherical imaging system with zoom capability was recently

   results provide analytical expressions for the strain distributions,

   important design tools for advanced cameras that combine hard and soft
   materials into nonplanar layouts with adjustable geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal and cost-effective energy efficiency design and operation
   options are evaluated for office buildings in Tunisia. In the analysis,
   several design and operation features are considered including
   orientation, window location and size, high performance glazing types,
   wall and roof insulation levels, energy efficient lighting systems,
   daylighting controls, temperature settings, and energy efficient heating
   and cooling systems. First, the results of the optimization results from
   a sequential search technique are compared against those obtained by a
   more time consuming brute-force optimization approach. Then, the optimal
   design features for a prototypical office building are determined for
   selected locations in Tunisia. The optimization results indicate that
   utilizing daylighting controls, energy efficient lighting fixtures, and
   low-e double glazing, and roof insulation are required energy efficiency
   measures to design high energy performance office buildings throughout
   climatic zones in Tunisia. In particular, it is found that implementing
   these measures can cost-effectively reduce the annual energy use by 50\%
   compared to the current design practices of office buildings in Tunisia.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A transient three-dimensional numerical solution is developed to analyze
   the thermal performance of thermo-active foundations used to heat and
   cool commercial buildings. Using laboratory testing data, the numerical
   solution is validated and used to carry out a sensitivity analysis to
   assess the most important design and operating parameters that affect
   the thermal performance of thermo-active foundations. It is found that
   the foundation depth, the shank space, the fluid flow rate, and the
   number of U-tube loops in each foundation pile are the main parameters
   that affect the thermal performance of a thermoactive foundation system.
   Based on the validated numerical solution, thermal response factors for
   a thermo-active foundation are developed, and implemented into a
   detailed building energy simulation program. These thermal response
   factors are then used to estimate the impact of installing thermo-active
   foundations on the total energy use of typical office buildings in
   representative US climates.}},

Abstract = {{The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region is the
   formal fungal barcode and in most cases the marker of choice for the
   exploration of fungal diversity in environmental samples. Two problems
   are particularly acute in the pursuit of satisfactory taxonomic
   assignment of newly generated ITS sequences: (i) the lack of an
   inclusive, reliable public reference data set and (ii) the lack of means
   to refer to fungal species, for which no Latin name is available in a
   standardized stable way. Here, we report on progress in these regards
   through further development of the UNITE database (http://unite.ut.ee)
   for molecular identification of fungi. All fungal species represented by
   at least two ITS sequences in the international nucleotide sequence
   databases are now given a unique, stable name of the accession number
   type (e.g. Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus|GU586904|SH133781.05FU), and
   their taxonomic and ecological annotations were corrected as far as
   possible through a distributed, third-party annotation effort. We
   introduce the term species hypothesis' (SH) for the taxa discovered in
   clustering on different similarity thresholds (97-99\%). An
   automatically or manually designated sequence is chosen to represent
   each such SH. These reference sequences are released
   (http://unite.ut.ee/repository.php) for use by the scientific community
   in, for example, local sequence similarity searches and in the QIIME
   pipeline. The system and the data will be updated automatically as the
   number of public fungal ITS sequences grows. We invite everybody in the
   position to improve the annotation or metadata associated with their
   particular fungal lineages of expertise to do so through the new
   Web-based sequence management system in UNITE.}},

Title = {{Case Study on the Effect of 690 mpa (100 ksi) Steel Reinforcement on

Abstract = {{High-strength steel reinforcement in buildings had previously been
   limited to specialized applications, but recently published design
   guidance allows expanded use. A case study, conducted to investigate
   productivity benefits of using 690mpa (100ksi) versus 414mpa (60ksi)
   reinforcement, found that there was little to no benefit in using 690mpa
   (100ksi) steel in slabs, post-tensioned girders, and columns, but the
   beam reinforcement weight was reduced by 36\%. The 2010 material cost
   ratio of 690mpa (100ksi) to 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement was two,
   outstripping the weight reduction. However, labor cost is a function of
   weight, bringing the overall cost of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement to
   within 35\% of 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement cost. The material cost
   ratio will presumably decrease over time; if it drops by 30\% or more,
   690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement will be more economical. Labor costs,
   which vary by location, strongly influence the productivity benefits of
   690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement. The use of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement
   is more favorable in expensive labor markets and it appears to be
   currently competitive in some. The paper's primary contribution to the
   overall body of knowledge is the quantitative understanding of the
   economic factors that influence the ability of 690mpa (100ksi) steel
   reinforcement to have a productivity advantage over the use of
   conventional 414mpa (60ksi) steel reinforcement. Practitioners,
   designers, and researchers can use this information to understand the
   cost and productivity impact of high-strength reinforcing steel.}},

Abstract = {{Demand surge is understood to be a socioeconomic phenomenon associated
   with large-scale natural disasters. It is most commonly explained as
   higher repair costs resulting from higher labor wages and material
   prices after a large- versus small-scale disaster. This paper explores
   this explanation by developing quantitative models for the relative cost
   change of sets of repairs to residential and commercial properties
   damaged by Atlantic hurricanes in the southeast mainland United States.
   Cost data from 2002-2010 show that changes in the labor component drive
   the changes in total repair costs and that cost changes can vary notably
   by year and less so by geographic region. A series of multilevel
   regression models is then proposed to predict the relative cost changes
   by considering several combinations of the following explanatory
   variables: the largest wind speed at a city in a hurricane season; the
   number of tropical storms passing near a city in a hurricane season; and
   relative cost changes in the first two quarters of the year. For
   commercial properties in Florida, the data are sufficient to develop
   models with only linear and interacting explanatory variables. These
   models, however, show a large uncertainty in expected cost changes and a
   systematic underprediction for larger cost changes. For residential
   properties in Florida and both residential and commercial properties in
   other states on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, either the data
   are insufficient to develop robust models or a more complex model must
   be proposed for relative cost changes at these property types.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial resolution of a sonic anemometer is limited by the distance
   between its transducers, and for studies of small-scale turbulence and
   theories of turbulence, it is desirable to increase this spatial
   resolution. We here consider resolution improvements obtainable by
   treating the sonic anemometer as a small tomography array, with
   application of appropriate inverse algorithms for the reconstruction of
   temperature and velocity. A particular modification of the sonic
   anemometer is considered when the number of its transducers is doubled
   and the time-dependent stochastic inversion algorithm is used for
   reconstruction. Numerical simulations of the sonic anemometer and its
   suggested modification are implemented with the temperature and velocity
   fields modelled as discrete eddies moving through the sonic's volume.
   The tomographic approach is shown to provide better reconstructions of
   the temperature and velocity fields, with spatial resolution increased
   by as much as a factor of ten. The spatial resolution depends on the
   inverse algorithm and also improves by increasing the number of
   transducers.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a thermodynamics and mechanics theory for polymers that when
   irradiated with light, undergo photochemical reactions that alter their
   macromolecular structure, e. g., by bond breaking and/or reformation,
   and in turn affect their mechanical and physical behavior. This emerging
   class of highly-engineered active materials shows great promise for
   myriad applications and is a subset of a broader class of polymers with
   covalent bonds that can be dynamically tuned with various environmental
   stimuli. We formulate a general thermodynamic and kinetic framework to
   model the complex photochemical-thermal-mechanical coupling in these
   materials. Our theory considers the behavior of a polymer that is
   subjected to the combination of mechanical and thermal loading while
   simultaneously irradiated by light with multiple frequency components
   and directions. We introduce an approach to model the photochemical
   reactions that can change the network topology, resulting chemical
   species transport, heat conduction and finite deformation. We describe
   the interaction of the material with light via a radiometric description
   and show how it can be linked to a full electromagnetic treatment when
   appropriate and if desired. Our approach is sufficiently general to
   permit the modeling of various materials that operate via different
   photochemical reaction mechanisms. After formulating the general theory,
   we specialize it to a polymer that when irradiated with light undergoes
   a series of photochemical reactions that cause chain scission and
   reformation which continuously rearrange the polymer network into a
   stress-free configuration. Based on the operant physical mechanisms we
   develop a constitutive model using a polymer chain decomposition and
   evolution approach to track the molecular structure changes during
   simultaneous irradiation and mechanical loading. In the special case of
   isothermal conditions with monochromatic and unidirectional irradiation,
   we recover a previous model based on intuitive ad-hoc assumptions and
   thus put it on strong thermodynamic footing. Finally we use our model to
   simulate the behavior of a polymer that is biaxially stretched and then
   irradiated with light from one side. We simulate the process and
   emphasize the spontaneous bending that occurs due to inhomogeneous
   photoinduced stress relaxation. From our theory, we obtain an analytical
   expression of a characteristic time for photo-induced stress relaxation
   in terms of the dominating system parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1080-1093}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{As demonstrated in past research, decisions regarding maintenance and
   rehabilitation strategies for a portfolio of bridges should be based on
   the analysis of both costs and benefits over their life cycle. Such
   decisions involve the priority and timing of expenditure. This is
   particularly important in the current era that is characterised by
   limited funding for infrastructure preservation in most countries. This
   article presents a probabilistic life-cycle-based investment framework
   to develop decisions for bridge maintenance and rehabilitation. The
   framework ranks different projects by priority, using the
   savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) as a measure of cost-effectiveness.
   The SIR computation includes the initial investment; annual operation,
   maintenance and repair/rehabilitation costs; and failure costs. These
   future costs are linked to probable events, such as natural hazards,
   vehicle and boat crashes, and user time delay. Since life-cycle analysis
   is sensitive to the analysis period, this article introduces the concept
   of infinite lifetime or perpetuity. A case study involving 37 bridges
   across the Seine River in the City of Paris is used to illustrate the
   framework application. The application considers pile protections and
   avoidance of traffic disturbance, and it is especially interesting
   because the examined bridges have a wide variation with regard to their
   dates of construction, material type and dimensions. Results of the
   study prove that this approach enables the decision maker to select the
   most cost-effective project, and to convey it to the public by
   incorporating social and political issues that represent practical
   considerations. In addition, the results seem to be relatively
   insensitive to the analysis period and the discount rate.}},

   similar to 86.2 degrees E that indicates a velocity of 9.0(-3.2)/(+4.4)
   mm/yr, in close agreement with geomorphologic estimates at the same
   location. Our estimated geodetic slip rate is consistent with recent
   geological slip rates based on terrace offsets. The resulting mean
   combined geological and geodetic slip rate (9.0 +/- 4.0 mm/yr) is
   remarkably uniform for the central similar to 800 km of the Altyn Tagh

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit TiO2 anode material on
   high surface area graphene (reduced graphene oxide) sheets for Li-ion
   batteries. An Al2O3 ALD ultrathin layer was used as an adhesion layer
   for conformal deposition of the TiO2 ALD films at 120 degrees C onto the
   conducting graphene sheets. The TiO2 ALD films on the Al2O3 ALD adhesion
   layer were nearly amorphous and conformal to the graphene sheets. These
   nanoscale TiO2 coatings minimized the effect of the low diffusion
   coefficient of lithium ions in bulk TiO2. The TiO2 ALD films exhibited
   stable capacities of similar to 120 mAh g(-1) and similar to 100 mAh
   g(-1) at high cycling rates of 1 A g(-1) and 2 A g(-1), respectively.
   The TiO2 ALD films also displayed excellent cycling stability with
   similar to 95\% of the initial capacity remaining after 500 cycles.
   These results illustrate that ALD can provide a useful method to deposit
   electrode materials on high surface area substrates for Li-ion
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Movement of fluids in the unsaturated zone plays an important role in
   many geoenvironrnental engineering problems. Examples include cover and
   basal liner systems for waste containment facilities where geosynthetics
   are widely used, amongst many other examples. This paper highlights the
   importance of assessing the unsaturated characteristics of geosynthetics
   and their influence on the behaviour of engineered systems where soils
   and geosynthetics interact under unsaturated conditions. It includes
   information on the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity
   function of geosynthetics such as geotextiles and geosynthetic clay
   liners (GCLs) with particular focus on capillary barriers, liner
   performance under elevated temperatures, and interface friction
   respectively. Mechanisms involved in the development of capillary
   barriers are evaluated to explain the storage of water at the interface
   between materials with contrasting hydraulic conductivity (e.g. a
   fine-grained soil and a nonwoven geotextile). Potential desiccation of
   GCLs is explained in the light of an application in a liquid waste
   impoundment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling Spatial Correlation of DNA Deformation: DNA Allostery in

Abstract = {{We report a study of DNA deformations using a coarse-grained mechanical
   model and quantitatively interpret the allosteric effects in protein DNA
   binding affinity. A recent single-molecule study (Kim et al. Science
   2013, 339, 816) showed that when a DNA molecule is deformed by specific
   binding of a protein, the binding affinity of a second protein separated
   from the first protein is altered. Experimental observations together
   with molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the origin of the DNA
   allostery is related to the observed deformation of DNA's structure, in
   particular, the major groove width. To unveil and quantify the
   underlying mechanism for the observed major groove deformation behavior
   related to the DNA allostery, here we provide a simple but effective
   analytical model where DNA deformations upon protein binding are
   analyzed and spatial correlations of local deformations along the DNA
   are examined. The deformation of the DNA base orientations, which
   directly affect the major groove width, is found in both an analytical
   derivation and coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. This deformation
   oscillates with a period of 10 base pairs with an amplitude decaying
   exponentially from the binding site with a decay length l(D) approximate
   to 10 base pairs as a result of the balance between two competing terms
   in DNA base-stacking energy. This length scale is in agreement with that
   reported from the single-molecule experiment. Our model can be reduced
   to the worm-like chain form at length scales larger than l(P) but is
   able to explain DNA's mechanical properties on shorter length scales, in
   particular, the DNA allostery of protein - DNA interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a model for the prediction of cell attachment to
   engineered microtopographies based on two previous models: the
   attachment point theory and the engineered roughness index (ER!) model.
   The new surface energetic attachment (SEA) model is based on both the
   properties of the cell material interface and the size and configuration
   of the topography relative to the organism. We have used Monte Carlo
   simulation to examine the SEA model's ability to predict relative
   attachment of the green alga Ulva linza to different locations within a
   unit cell. We have also compared the predicted relative attachment for
   Ulva linza, the diatom Navicula incerta, the marine bacterium Cobetia
   marina, and the barnacle cyprid Balanus amphitrite to a wide variety of
   microtopographies. We demonstrate good correlation between the
   experimental results and the model results for all tested experimental
   data and thus show the SEA model may be used as a powerful indicator of
   the efficacy for antifouling topographies.}},

Abstract = {{In the (salen)Co(III)-catalyzed hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of
   terminal epoxides, the rate- and stereoselectivity-determining epoxide
   ring-opening step occurs by a cooperative bimetallic mechanism with one
   Co(III) complex acting as a Lewis acid and another serving to deliver
   the hydroxide nucleophile. In this paper, we analyze the basis for the
   extraordinarily high stereoselectivity and broad substrate scope
   observed in the HKR We demonstrate that the stereochemistry of each of
   the two (salen)Co(III) complexes in the rate-determining transition
   structure is important for productive catalysis: a measurable rate of
   hydrolysis occurs only if the absolute stereochemistry of each of these
   (salen)Co(III) complexes is the same. Experimental and computational
   studies provide strong evidence that stereochemical communication in the
   HKR is mediated by the stepped conformation of the salen ligand, and not
   the shape of the chiral diamine backbone of the ligand. A detailed
   computational analysis reveals that the epoxide binds the Lewis acidic
   Co(III) complex in a well-defined geometry imposed by stereoelectronic
   rather than steric effects. This insight serves as the basis of a
   complete stereochemical and transition structure model that sheds light
   on the reasons for the broad substrate generality of the HKR.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing the time since death is critical in every death
   investigation, yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of
   errors and biases. For example, forensic entomology is widely used to
   assess the postmortem interval (PMI), but errors can range from days to
   months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that
   avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial
   community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse
   model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days
   over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial
   and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and
   suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic
   tool for estimating PMI.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric photooxidation of isoprene is an important source of
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and there is increasing evidence that
   anthropogenic oxidant emissions can enhance this SOA formation. In this
   work, we use ambient observations of organosulfates formed from isoprene
   epoxydiols (IEPOX) and methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE) and a broad suite
   of chemical measurements to investigate the relative importance of
   nitrogen oxide (NO/NO2) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) SOA formation pathways
   from isoprene at a forested site in California. In contrast to IEPOX,
   the calculated production rate of MAE was observed to be independent of
   temperature. This is the result of the very fast thermolysis of MPAN at
   high temperatures that affects the distribution of the MPAN reservoir
   (MPAN / MPA radical) reducing the fraction that can react with OH to
   form MAE and subsequently SOA (F-MAE (formation)). The strong
   temperature dependence of F-MAE (formation) helps to explain our
   observations of similar concentrations of LEPDX-derived organosulfates
   (IEPOX-OS; similar to 1 ng m(-3)) and MAE-derived organosulfates
   (MAE-OS; similar to 1 ng m(-3)) under cooler conditions (lower isoprene
   concentrations) and much higher IEPOX-OS (similar to 20 ng m(-3))
   relative to MAE-OS (<0.0005 ng m(-3)) at higher temperatures (higher
   isoprene concentrations). A kinetic model of IEPOX and MAE loss showed
   that MAE forms 10-100 times more ring-opening products than IEPOX and
   that both are strongly dependent on aerosol water content when aerosol
   pH is constant. However, the higher fraction of MAE ring opening
   products does not compensate for the lower MAE production under warmer
   conditions (higher isoprene concentrations) resulting in lower formation
   of MAE-derived products relative to IEPOX at the surface. In regions of
   high NOx high isoprene emissions and strong vertical mixing the slower
   MPAN thermolysis rate aloft could increase the fraction of MPAN that
   forms MAE resulting in a vertically varying isoprene SOA source.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) irradiated by sunlight generates
   photo-oxidants that can accelerate organic contaminant degradation in
   surface waters. However, the significance of this process to contaminant
   removal during engineered UV water treatment has not been demonstrated,
   partly due to a lack of suitable methods in the deep UV range. This work
   expands methods previously established to detect O-1(2), HO center dot,
   H2O2, and DOM triplet states ((DOM)-D-3{*}) at solar wavelengths to
   irradiation at 254 nm, typical of UV water treatment. For transient
   intermediates, the methods include a photostable probe combined with
   selective scavengers. Quantum yields for O-1(2), (DOM)-D-3{*} and H2O2
   were in the same range as for solar-driven reactions but were an order
   of magnitude higher for HO center dot, which other experiments indicate
   is due to H2O2 reduction. With the quantum yields, the degradation of
   metoxuron was successfully predicted in a DOM solution irradiated at 254
   nm. Further modeling showed that the contribution of DOM sensitization
   to organic contaminant removal during UV treatment should be significant
   only at high UV fluence, characteristic of advanced oxidation processes.
   Of the reactive species studied, (DOM)-D-3{*} is predicted to have the
   greatest general influence on UV degradation of contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed evaluation of two liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
   techniques, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF-MS)
   and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), was carried out in
   terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and ionization mode for the detection
   of sucralose in environmental water samples, which is an important
   environmental topic in water analysis. Interesting findings were made in
   regards to fragmentation and sensitivity when both techniques and both
   ionization modes of operation were compared. In positive ion mode,
   sucralose was detected by its sodium adduct {[}M + Na](+) at m/z
   419.0038. Fragmentation by MS-MS of the sodiated molecule was possible
   using either LC/MS-MS or LC/Q-TOF-MS under positive ionization. Accurate
   mass measurements provided exact structural confirmation of the sodiated
   fragments obtained (m/z 221.0187 and m/z 238.9848). In negative ion
   mode, the deprotonated molecule was observed ({[}M - H](-) at m/z
   395.0073), and fragmentation by MS-MS yielded two characteristic
   fragment ions (m/z 359.0306 and m/z 34.9694). Because sucralose contains
   three chlorine atoms, time-of-flight analyses provided a valuable amount
   of isotopic accurate mass information for its detection. With LC/MS-MS,
   the sensitivity was 10 times higher in positive ion mode than in
   negative ion mode, with limits of detection of 15 ng/L. Similarly, when
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used, the sensitivity was slightly
   better in positive ion mode, with limits of detection of 400 ng/L.
   Matrix effects were observed for surface and wastewater samples; thus
   the use of a deuterated standard (sucralose-d(6)) was crucial for
   precise quantitation. The most sensitive analytical methodology for the
   analysis of sucralose in water samples was LC/MS-MS using triple
   quadrupole under positive ion mode.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of high area-to-mass ratio (HAMR) objects has been studied
   extensively since the discovery of this debris population in near GEO
   orbits. A sound understanding of their nature, orbital evolution, and
   possible origin is critical for space situational awareness. In this
   paper, a new averaged formulation of HAMR object orbit evolution that
   accounts for solar radiation pressure, Earth oblateness, and lunisolar
   perturbations is explored. The first-order averaged model, explicitly
   given in terms of the Milankovitch orbital elements, is several hundred
   times faster to numerically integrate than the non-averaged counterpart,
   and provides a very accurate description of the long-term behavior. This
   model is derived and presented along with comparisons with explicit
   long-term numerical integrations of HAMR objects in GEO. The dynamical
   configuration of the Earth Moon Sun system was found to have a
   significant resonance effect with HAMR objects leading to complex
   evolutionary behavior. The properties of this resonant population may
   serve as important constraints for models of HAMR debris origin and
   evolution. A systematic structure associated with their distribution in
   inclination and ascending node phase space is identified. Given that
   these objects are difficult to target and correlate, this has many
   implications for the space surveillance community and will allow
   observers to implement better search strategies for this class of
   debris. (C) 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) region is organized into distinct
   subregions that coordinate survival-related responses during threat and
   stress {[}Bandler R, Keay KA, Floyd N, Price J (2000) Brain Res 53
   (1):95-104]. To examine PAG function in humans, researchers have relied
   primarily on functional MRI (fMRI), but technological and methodological
   limitations have prevented researchers from localizing responses to
   different PAG subregions. We used high-field strength (7-T) fMRI
   techniques to image the PAG at high resolution (0.75 mm isotropic),
   which was critical for dissociating the PAG from the greater signal
   variability in the aqueduct. Activation while participants were exposed
   to emotionally aversive images segregated into subregions of the PAG
   along both dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal axes. In the rostral PAG,
   activity was localized to lateral and dorsomedial subregions. In caudal
   PAG, activity was localized to the ventrolateral region. This shifting
   pattern of activity from dorsal to ventral PAG along the rostrocaudal
   axis mirrors structural and functional neurobiological observations in
   nonhuman animals. Activity in lateral and ventrolateral subregions also
   grouped with distinct emotional experiences (e. g., anger and sadness)
   in a factor analysis, suggesting that each subregion participates in
   distinct functional circuitry. This study establishes the use of
   high-field strength fMRI as a promising technique for revealing the
   functional architecture of the PAG. The techniques developed here also
   may be extended to investigate the functional roles of other brainstem
   nuclei.}},

Abstract = {{Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are known to limit the
   performance of electronic devices. We study TLS using millikelvin
   microwave (6.4GHz) loss measurements of three atomic layer deposited
   (ALD) oxide films-crystalline BeO (c-BeO), amorphous Al2O3 (a-Al2O3),
   and amorphous LaAlO3 (a-LaAlO3)-and interpret them with room temperature
   characterization measurements. We find that the bulk loss tangent in the
   crystalline film is 6 times higher than in the amorphous films. In
   addition, its power saturation agrees with an amorphous distribution of
   TLS. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) impurity analysis of the
   c-BeO film showed excess surface carbon (C) impurities and a uniform
   hydrogen (H) impurity distribution, which coupled with the analysis of
   loss tangent strongly suggests H limited loss. Impurity analysis of the
   amorphous films reveals that they have excess H impurities at the
   ambient-exposed surface, and we extract the associated H-based surface
   loss tangent. We compare two a-Al2O3 films with drastically different C
   impurity concentrations and similar H impurity concentrations and
   conclude that H rather than C is the likely source of loss in the
   amorphous films and we find the loss per H concentration in a-Al2O3 to
   be K-H = 3 x 10(-24) cm(3). (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Gene therapy relies on the delivery of DNA into cells, and polycations
   are one class of vectors enabling efficient DNA delivery. Nuclear
   localization sequences (NLS), cationic oligopeptides that target
   molecules for nuclear entry, can be incorporated into polycations to
   improve their gene delivery efficiency. We use simulations to study the
   effect of peptide chemistry and sequence on the DNA-binding behavior of
   NLS-grafted polycations by systematically mutating the residues in the
   grafts, which are based on the SV40 NLS (peptide sequence PKKKRKV).
   Replacing arginine (R) with lysine (K) reduces binding strength by
   eliminating arginine-DNA interactions, but placing R in a less hindered
   location (e.g., farther from the grafting point to the polycation
   backbone) has surprisingly little effect on polycation-DNA binding
   strength. Changing the positions of the hydrophobic proline (P) and
   valine (V) residues relative to the polycation backbone changes
   hydrophobic aggregation within the polycation and, consequently, changes
   the conformational entropy loss that occurs upon polycation-DNA binding.
   Since conformational entropy loss affects the free energy of binding,
   the positions of P and V in the grafts affect DNA binding affinity. The
   insight from this work guides synthesis of polycations with tailored DNA
   binding affinity and, in turn, efficient DNA delivery.}},

   cracking or crushing of concrete taking into account the fracture energy
   effects. The model was utilized on Koyna Dam using finite element
   technique. Dam-water and dam-foundation interactions were considered in
   dynamic analysis. The behavior of dam was studied for different shear
   transfer coefficients considering/neglecting fracture energy effects.
   The results were extracted at crest displacement and crack profile
   within the dam body. The results show the importance of both shear

Abstract = {{An analytical investigation of a half-space containing transversely
   isotropic material under forced vertical and horizontal displacements
   applied on a rectangular rigid foundation is presented in this paper.
   With the goal of a rigorous solution to the shape- and rigidity- induced
   singular mixed boundary value problem, the formulation employs scalar
   potential representation, the Fourier expansion and the Hankel integral
   transforms method to obtain the surface arbitrary point-load solution in
   cylindrical coordinate system. The obtained Green's functions are
   rewritten in rectangular coordinate system, allowing the response of the
   half-space because of an arbitrary distributed load on a rectangular
   surface area be given in terms of a double integral. The numerical
   evaluations of stresses are done with the use of an element, which is
   singular at the edge and the corner of the rectangle. Upon the
   imposition of the rigidity displacement boundary condition for a rigid
   foundation and the use of a set of two-dimensional adaptive-gradient
   elements, which can capture the singular behavior in the contact stress
   effectively, a set of new numerical results are presented to illustrate
   the effect of transverse isotropy on the foundation response. Copyright

Abstract = {{Background: Evolutionary change in individual species has been
   hypothesized to have far-reaching consequences for entire ecological
   communities {[}1-3], and such coupling of ecological and evolutionary
   dynamics ({''}eco-evolutionary dynamics{''}) has been demonstrated for a
   variety systems {[}4-7]. However, the general importance of evolutionary
   dynamics for ecological dynamics remains unclear. Here, we investigate
   how spatial patterns of local adaptation in the stick insect Timema
   cristinae, driven by the interaction between multiple evolutionary
   processes, structure metapopulations, communities, and multitrophic
   interactions.
   Results: Observations of a wild T. cristinae nnetapopulation show that
   locally imperfect camouflage reduces population size and that the effect
   of such maladaptation is comparable to the effects of more traditional
   ecological factors, including habitat patch size and host-plant species
   identity. Field manipulations of local adaptation and bird predation
   support the hypothesis that maladaptation reduces population size
   through an increase in bird predation. Furthermore, these field
   experiments show that maladaptation in T. cristinae and consequent
   increase in bird predation reduce the pooled abundance and species
   richness of the co-occurring arthropod community, and ultimately cascade
   to decrease herbivory on host plants. An eco-evolutionary model of the
   observational data demonstrates that the demographic cost of
   maladaptation decreases habitat patch occupancy by T. cristinae but
   enhances metapopulation-level adaptation.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate a pervasive effect of ongoing
   evolution in a spatial context on population and community dynamics. The
   eco-evolutionary model makes testable predictions about the influence of
   the spatial configuration of the patch network on metapopulation size
   and the spatial scale of adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Screening a large number of surfaces for their catalytic performance
   remains a challenge, leading to the need for simple models to predict
   adsorption properties. To facilitate rapid prediction of hydrocarbon
   adsorption energies, scaling relations that allow for calculation of the
   adsorption energy of any intermediate attached to any symmetric site on
   any hexagonal metal surface through a carbon atom were developed. For
   input, these relations require only simple electronic properties of the
   surface and of the gas phase reactant molecules Determining adsorption
   energies consists of up to four steps: (i) calculating the adsorption
   energy of methyl in the top site using density functional theory or by
   simple relations based on the electronic structure of the surface; (ii)
   using modified versions of classical scaling relations to scale between
   methyl in the top site and C-1 species with more metal-surface bonds
   (i.e., C, CH, CH2) in sites that complete adsorbate tetravalency; (iii)
   using gas phase bond energies to predict adsorption energies of longer
   hydrocarbons (i.e., CR, CR2, CR3); and (iv) expressing energetic changes
   upon translation of hydrocarbons to various sites in terms of the number
   of agostic interactions and the change in the number of carbon-metal
   bonds. Combining all of these relations allows accurate scaling over a
   wide range of adsorbates and surfaces, resulting in efficient screening
   of catalytic surfaces and a clear elucidation of adsorption trends. The
   relations are used to explain trends in methane reforming, hydrocarbon
   chain growth, and propane dehydrogenation.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane proteins embedded in bilayer lipids of cell membrane have
   unique functions including inter-cell communication and ionic/molecular
   transport. To understand the structure and function of the membrane
   protein embedded in a native biological bilayer lipid environment is a
   major research area in biology. A reconstitution/crystallisation process
   of membrane proteins and lipids can form virus-like nanoparticles, and
   have important potential applications in drug design and drug delivery.
   Earlier studies used a standard dialysis process that is inherently
   low-throughput, time consuming (days to weeks) and costly in protein
   materials. In this reported work a new microfluidic device is
   demonstrated to rapidly form membrane protein lipid nanoparticles in an
   extremely short period (seconds). The reconstitution process occurs
   using a continuous flow dominated by convection-diffusion phenomena in
   the microfluidic channel, which can form protein/lipid nanoparticles
   using only nanolitres or picolitres of protein sample. Moreover, a
   controllable syringe pump is used to test a combination of conditions,
   rather than using inefficient hand pipetting. Therefore this novel
   microfluidic device has an ability to rapidly form uniform membrane
   protein/lipid nanoparticles, and the authors believe that this new
   method will make a transformative impact on commercial applications in a
   variety of areas from biology to pharmacology.}},

Abstract = {{The DataHawk small airborne measurement system provides in situ

   articulating five key challenges that any practical measurement system

   support components of the DataHawk system are outlined, along with its
   deployment, operating, and recovery modes. Typical results are presented
   to illustrate the types and quality of data provided by the current
   system, as well as the need for more of these finescale measurements.
   Particular focus is given to the DataHawk's ability to make
   very-high-resolution measurements of a variety of atmospheric variables
   simultaneously, with emphasis given to the measurement of two important
   finescale turbulence parameters, C-T(2) (the temperature turbulence

Abstract = {{Measurements from the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope
   integrated little experiment (REPTile) on board the Colorado Student
   Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) CubeSat mission, which was launched
   into a highly inclined (65 degrees) low Earth orbit, are analyzed along
   with measurements from the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope
   (REPT) and the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) instruments
   aboard the Van Allen Probes, which are in a low inclination (10 degrees)
   geo-transfer-like orbit. Both REPT and MagEIS measure the full
   distribution of energetic electrons as they traverse the heart of the
   outer radiation belt. However, due to the small equatorial loss cone
   (only a few degrees), it is difficult for REPT and MagEIS to directly
   determine which electrons will precipitate into the atmosphere, a major
   radiation belt loss process. REPTile, a miniaturized version of REPT,
   measures the fraction of the total electron population that has small
   enough equatorial pitch angles to reach the altitude of CSSWE, 480km x
   780km, thus measuring the precipitating population as well as the

Abstract = {{Inclined settlers may be used to improve algal-harvesting economics by
   enhancing the clarification rate for a fixed sedimentation velocity and
   areal footprint. For a fixed plate area, smaller inclination angles from
   horizontal result in increased settling area and clarification rate. To
   ensure flow of the settled-cell sediment for continuous operation,
   standard designs utilize a minimum angle of 55 degrees from horizontal.
   If reliable, shallow-angle flow of sedimented algae is achieved,
   increased clarification rates may be realized (e. g., 63\% enhancement
   at 20 degrees versus 55 degrees from horizontal). To study the critical
   sediment-flow angle, we use an angle-of-repose model, which includes an
   additional normal-force term to account for adhesion. The inclusion of
   this term is supported by observations that the critical sliding angle
   decreases with the sediment mass/thickness. To reduce the critical
   sliding angle, we evaluated the sediment flow of settled, green alga
   Chlorella vulgaris on several low-adhesion surfaces described in the
   biofouling literature and demonstrated sediment flow at angles as low as
   10 inverted perpendicular using a negatively-charged surface. This
   surface fouled after immersion for 24 h in spent culture medium,
   presumably due to the deposition of residual organic matter.
   Additionally, applied vibration is demonstrated to achieve sediment flow
   at angles as shallow as 20 degrees. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dissolved humic material (HDOM) is ubiquitous to all natural waters and
   its source material influences its chemical structure, reactivity, and
   bioavailability. While terrestrially derived HDOM reference materials
   distributed by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) have
   been readily available to engineering and scientific communities, a
   microbially derived reference HDOM was not, despite the
   well-characterized differences in the chemistry and reactivity of HDOM
   derived from terrestrial versus microbial sources. To address this gap,
   we collected a microbial reference fulvic acid from Pony Lake (PLFA) for
   distribution through the IHSS. Pony Lake is a saline coastal pond on
   Ross Island, Antarctica, where the landscape is devoid of terrestrial
   plants. Sample collection occurred over a 17-day period in the summer
   season at Pony Lake. During this time, the dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentrations increased nearly two-fold, and the fulvic acid
   fraction (collected using the XAD-8 method) accounted for 14.6\% of the
   DOC. During the re-concentration and desalting procedures we isolated
   two other chemically distinct fulvic acid fractions: (1) PLFA-2, which
   was high in carbohydrates and (2) PLFA-CER, which was high in nitrogen.
   The chemical characteristics (elemental analysis, optical
   characterization with UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and C-13 NMR
   spectroscopy) of the three fulvic acid fractions helped to explain their
   behavior during isolation.}},

Title = {{Mantle lithosphere as a source of postsubduction magmatism, northern
   Sierra Nevada, California}},
Journal = {{GEOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1102-1124}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Age, chemical, and isotopic data from late Cenozoic volcanic rocks in
   the northern Sierra Nevada, California (USA), from Lake Tahoe north to
   the southern end of the modern Cascades volcanic arc, were obtained to
   investigate the evolution of the upper mantle beneath this continental
   margin during the transition from active subduction to the opening of a
   slabless window, and to test the possibility that the foundering of
   mantle lithosphere proposed for the southern Sierra Nevada extended to
   the northern reaches of the mountain range. Our data are consistent with
   previous work in the region and illustrate that volcanism shifted from
   widespread intermediate composition magmatism to small volume, localized
   trachybasalts to trachyandesites ca. 3 Ma. Similar to southern Cascades
   volcanism, Sr-87/Sr-86 and Pb-206/Pb-204 decrease, and epsilon(Nd)
   increase in the older (older than 3 Ma) volcanic rocks with increasing
   proportions of a slab component, as measured by increasing (Sr/P)(N),
   where N is primitive-mantle normalized. We interpret these observations
   as evidence that the older volcanic rocks are subduction related and
   represent the products of basaltic melts derived from flux melting of
   mantle wedge that interacted to varying degrees during ascent with lower
   epsilon(Nd) and higher Sr-87/Sr-86 sub-Sierra Nevada continental mantle
   lithosphere. The younger volcanic rocks lack evidence for the
   involvement of a slab component in their generation, but have ranges of
   Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic compositions similar to those of older volcanic
   rocks interpreted to have interacted to the greatest extent with the
   continental mantle lithosphere. However, the younger volcanic rocks have
   higher high field strength element (HFSE) and higher phosphorus
   abundances, and higher (La/Yb)(N), than their older counterparts,
   suggesting that they are not simply the products of smaller degrees of
   partial melting of the same mantle lithosphere involved in the older
   magmatism. The high HFSE and P contents were more likely controlled by
   metasomatic accessory carrier phases such as rutile and apatite, the
   stabilities of which control the abundance of these elements in melts
   produced from the lithospheric mantle after 3 Ma. One possibility is
   that the accessory phases were introduced to lithosphere during
   melt-wall-rock interaction associated with the older magmatic episode.
   These phases were then purged as a result of conductive heating of the
   remaining lithospheric mantle triggered by postsubduction upwelling of
   the sublithospheric mantle. Our data are consistent with lithospheric
   mantle serving as a melt reactor during the earlier subduction-related
   magmatism that was baked out during later conductive heating, a process
   that may be relevant to the production of immediately postsubduction
   magmatism along other continental margins.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The civil and environmental engineering disciplines have identified the
   levels of knowledge about sustainability that are desirable for students
   to achieve as they graduate with a bachelor's degree, as well as
   sustainability-related competencies to be obtained during a master's
   degree, and on-the-job, prior to professional licensure. Different
   pedagogies are better suited to help students attain these levels of
   cognitive ability, while also developing affective outcomes. This paper
   provides examples of different methods that have been used at one
   institution to educate engineering students about sustainability,
   supported with data that indicates whether the method successfully
   achieved the targeted learning outcomes. Lectures, in-class active
   learning, readings, and appropriately targeted homework assignments can
   achieve basic sustainability knowledge and comprehension by requiring
   students to define, identify, and explain aspects of sustainability.
   Case studies and the application of software tools are good methods to
   achieve application and analysis competencies. Project-based learning
   (PBL) and project-based service-learning (PBSL) design projects can
   reach the synthesis level and may also develop affective outcomes
   related to sustainability. The results provide examples that may apply
   to a wider range of disciplines and suggest sustainability outcomes that
   are particularly difficult to teach and/or assess.}},

Abstract = {{The anomalously snowy winter season of 2010/2011 in the Sierra Nevada is
   analyzed in terms of snow water equivalent (SWE) anomalies and the role
   of atmospheric rivers (ARs)narrow channels of enhanced meridional water
   vapor transport between the tropics and extratropics. Mean April 1 SWE
   was 0.44 m (56\%) above normal averaged over 100 snow sensors. AR
   occurrence was anomalously high during the period, with 20 AR dates
   during the season and 14 in the month of December 2010, compared to the
   mean occurrence of nine dates per season. Fifteen out of the 20 AR dates
   were associated with the negative phases of the Arctic Oscillation (AO)
   and the Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern. Analysis of
   all winter ARs in California during water years 1998-2011 indicates more
   ARs occur during the negative phase of AO and PNA, with the increase
   between positive and negative phases being approximate to 90\% for AO,
   and approximate to 50\% for PNA. The circulation pattern associated with
   concurrent negative phases of AO and PNA, characterized by cyclonic
   anomalies centered northwest of California, provides a favorable
   dynamical condition for ARs. The analysis suggests that the massive
   Sierra Nevada snowpack during the 2010/2011 winter season is primarily
   related to anomalously high frequency of ARs favored by the joint
   phasing of -AO and -PNA, and that a secondary contribution is from
   increased snow accumulation during these ARs favored by colder air
   temperatures associated with -AO, -PNA, and La Nina.}},

   lysozyme, bovine plasma immunoglobulin G, or a humanized IgG1k
   monoclonal antibody) and a non-reducing disaccharide (e.g., sucrose or
   trehalose) showed single thermal transitions of the solute mixtures
   (glass transition temperature of maximally freeze-concentrated solutes:
   T'(g)) in their first heating scans. Heat treatment (e.g., -5 degrees C,
   30 min) of some disaccharide-rich mixture frozen solutions at
   temperatures far above their T'(g) induced two-step T'(g), transitions
   in the subsequent scans, suggesting the separation of the solutes into
   concentrated protein-disaccharide mixture phase and disaccharide phase.
   Other frozen solutions showed a single transition of the concentrated
   solute mixture both before and after heat treatment. The apparent
   effects of the heat treatment temperature and time on the changes in
   thermal properties suggest molecular reordering of the concentrated
   solutes from a kinetically fixed mixture state to a more
   thermodynamically favorable state as a result of increased mobility. The
   implications of these phenomena on the quality of protein formulations
   are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lyophilization was used to prepare dry, glassy solid vaccine
   formulations of recombinant ricin toxin Achain containing suspensions of
   colloidal aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Four lyophilized formulations
   were prepared by using combinations of rapid or slow cooling during
   lyophilization and one of two buffers, histidine or ammonium acetate.
   Trehalose was used as the stabilizing excipient. Aggregation of the
   colloidal aluminum hydroxide suspension was reduced in formulations
   processed with a rapid cooling rate. Aluminum hydroxide particle size
   distributions, glass transition temperatures, water contents, and
   immunogenicities of lyophilized vaccines were independent of incubation
   time at 40 degrees C for up to 15 weeks. Mice immunized with
   reconstituted ricin toxin subunit A (RTA) vaccines produced RTA-specific
   antibodies and toxin-neutralizing antibodies (TNAs) regardless of the
   length of high temperature vaccine storage or the degree of aluminum
   adjuvant aggregation that occurred during lyophilization. In murine
   studies, lyophilized formulations of vaccines conferred protection
   against exposure to lethal doses of ricin, even after the lyophilized
   formulations had been stored at 40 degrees C for 4 weeks. A
   corresponding liquid formulation of vaccine stored at 40 degrees C
   elicited RTA-specific antibody titers but failed to confer immunity
   during a ricin challenge. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As liquid liposomal formulations are prone to chemical degradation and
   aggregation, these formulations often require freeze drying (e.g.,
   lyophilization) to achieve sufficient shelf-life. However, liposomal
   formulations may undergo oxidation during lyophilization and/or during
   prolonged storage. The goal of the current study was to characterize the
   degradation of 1,2-dilinolenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC)
   during lyophilization and to also probe the influence of metal
   contaminants in promoting the observed degradation. Aqueous sugar
   formulations containing DLPC (0.01 mg/ml) were lyophilized, and DLPC
   degradation was monitored using HPLC/UV and GC/MS methods. The effect of
   ferrous ion and sucrose concentration, as well as lyophilization stage
   promoting lipid degradation; was investigated. DLPC degradation
   increased with higher levels of ferrous ion. After lyophilization, 103.1
   +/- 1.1\%, 66.9 +/- 0.8\%, and 28.7 +/- 0.7\% DLPC remained in the
   sucrose samples spiked with 0.0 ppm, 0.2 ppm, and 1.0 ppm ferrous ion,
   respectively. Lipid degradation predominantly occurs during the freezing
   stage of lyophilization. Sugar concentration and buffer ionic strength
   also influence the extent of lipid degradation, and DLPC loss correlated
   with degradation product formation. We conclude that DLPC oxidation
   during the freezing stage of lyophilization dramatically compromises the
   stability of lipid-based formulations. In addition, we demonstrate that
   metal contaminants in sugars can become highly active when lyophilized
   in the presence of a reducing agent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent advances in molecular imaging and nanotechnology are providing
   new opportunities for biomedical imaging with great promise for the
   development of novel imaging agents. The unique optical, magnetic, and
   chemical properties of materials at the scale of nanometers allow the
   creation of imaging probes with better contrast enhancement, increased
   sensitivity, controlled biodistribution, better spatial and temporal
   information, multi-functionality and multi-modal imaging across MRI,
   PET, SPECT, and ultrasound. These features could ultimately translate to
   clinical advantages such as earlier detection, real time assessment of
   disease progression and personalized medicine. However, several years of
   investigation into the application of these materials to cancer research
   has revealed challenges that have delayed the successful application of
   these agents to the field of biomedical imaging. Understanding these
   challenges is critical to take full advantage of the benefits offered by
   nano-sized imaging agents. Therefore, this article presents the lessons
   learned and challenges encountered by a group of leading researchers in
   this field, and suggests ways forward to develop nanoparticle probes for
   cancer imaging. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rangeland degradation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is a growing
   concern, often attributed to climate change and overgrazing. A minority
   of researchers have suggested instead that degradation may be caused by
   changes in land management, particularly enclosures and the contracting
   of long-term rangeland use rights to households. However, these claims
   have been hampered by a lack of empirical evidence. This field
   experiment is the first to compare rangeland conditions over time in the
   case of different management regimes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
   specifically single-household versus multi-household management. A
   survey of vegetation properties in Maqu County, Gansu province in 2009,
   and repeated in 2011, examined the differences between single- and
   multi-household management in terms of vegetation biomass, cover, and
   species richness. In 2009, the biomass of the sedge group under
   multi-household management was significantly higher than that under
   single-household management. In 2011, biomass, vegetation cover, and
   species richness were all significantly higher under multi-household
   management than single-household management. These data suggest the
   flaws of the tragedy of the commons assumptions underlying
   single-household management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solvent annealing produces ordered assemblies in thin films of block
   copolymers and, in contrast to uniform thermal annealing, can be used to
   tune the self-assembled morphology, control the domain orientation with
   respect to the substrate, and, as demonstrated here, reduce the defect
   density. The two-dimensional network topology of lamellae self-assembled
   by polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) block copolymers in thin
   films was compared when processed by solvent and thermal annealing
   techniques. The mixed solvent annealing method described here reduced
   the overall defect density (e.g., dislocations with PMMA or PS cores)
   and thus the connectivity of the lamellar domains compared to thermal
   annealing; however, the long-range continuity of the networks was
   maintained and depended primarily on the copolymer composition. In
   addition, the persistence length of the lamellar domains for solvent
   annealed films was found to be 2-3 times that of the corresponding
   thermally annealed systems.}},

Abstract = {{Micro cryogenic coolers can provide low temperatures with a smaller
   volumetric footprint and smaller power draw than their
   conventional-scale counterparts. However, they can exhibit
   lower-than-desired cooling power. We measure the specific cooling power
   of a refrigerant expanding from a high pressure of 0.6 MPa to a low
   pressure of 0.1 MPa, while undergoing pulsating flow in a micro
   cryogenic cooler with pre-cooling. We further observe that the pulses in
   the flow-rate occur due to a volume of liquid forming in the
   high-pressure coupling mini-channel. The composition of the flowing
   refrigerant is analyzed with gas chromatography and thermal conductivity
   detection (GC/TCD), showing that there is no overall composition change
   in the refrigerant after it enters the pre-cooling lines. A model of the
   cooling power under such a pulsating flow regime is developed with good
   agreement to measured values. An improved refrigerant mixture is
   designed with this model, and subsequently tested, showing increased
   specific cooling power. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese Himalayas (CH) is highly sensitive to global climate change.
   The analyses of monthly mean air temperature and monthly precipitation
   data during the 1971-2007 from 24 meteorological stations show a
   significant increase of 0.31 degrees C per decade or about 1.15 degrees
   C for annual mean air temperature over the entire region. The
   temperature rise occurs primarily during the period of 1991-2007, up to
   0.73 degrees C per decade. Climate warming is characterized by all-year
   temperature increase in particular during winters with the maximum value
   of 0.38 degrees C per decade during the 1971-2007, up to 1.24 degrees C
   per decade during 1991-2007. Distributions of annual temperature trends
   show significant south-to-north, low-to-high and east-to-west warming
   trends to increase with the latitude and elevation while to decrease
   with the longitude in the CH, respectively. Annual precipitation
   increases, but not significantly during the 1971-2007. Seasonal
   precipitation has no significant trend during the same period, either.
   Spatial discrepancy of the variations in precipitation is particularly
   great. It is evident that the climate was significantly warming and
   drying in the western CH over the past 37 years.}},

Abstract = {{When constructing and updating the built environment, ensuring the
   safety of all parties involved is of utmost importance. Traditionally,
   safety has been measured and managed reactively, where actions are taken
   in response to adverse trends in injuries. Alternatively, safety-related
   practices can be measured during the construction phase to trigger
   positive responses before an injury occurs. Despite the potential
   benefits of such strategies, few have been identified in the literature
   and there has yet to be an organized effort to codify and investigate
   these methods. A mixed-methods research approach was used to (1)clearly
   identify and define elements of the safety management process that can
   be measured and monitored during the construction phase, (2)describe
   resource requirements for measurement, monitoring, and response, and
   (3)describe specific management actions required when any indicator
   fails to satisfy a desired value. To produce internally and externally
   valid and reliable results, data were triangulated from case studies,
   content analysis of award-winning projects, and focused discussions
   among construction safety experts. In total, over 50 proactive metrics
   were identified, 13 of which were selected as top priority by expert
   professionals. Use of these indicators has been connected to exceptional
   safety performance in industry-leading organizations. The implication of
   the findings is that very strong safety outcomes can be expected if
   contractors build upon a robust safety management foundation with the
   use of these methods of project safety control.}},

Abstract = {{The construction industry has experienced a great deal of safety
   improvement after the Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health
   Act in 1970. In the last twenty years, improvements have been made
   largely due to safety interventions that exceed compliance with
   government regulations. Researchers have long attempted to identify the
   most effective safety programs. However, studies in the past focused
   only on a small subset of potential injury-prevention options. In
   addition, to date, there has yet to be a study that documents a
   comprehensive list of safety strategies implemented by industry-leading
   companies. This research addresses this knowledge gap by creating a
   comprehensive list of construction-safety strategies from relevant
   literature and supplementing it with input from an expert panel. Once
   the strategies were identified (n=104), the research team conducted
   interviews with representatives from 57 projects in the United States to
   determine which strategies were implemented on each project and the
   project's recordable injury rate (RIR). The data were then analyzed to
   determine the total proportion of potential strategies implemented and
   examine the relationship between each strategy and the RIR. The results
   reveal that 14 strategies differentiate safety performance (P>0.05) and
   that 22 strategies were implemented by 100\% of the sample projects. The
   implications are that the 22 practices implemented in all projects can
   now be considered a foundation of a safety program, and the 14
   differentiators are the keys to improved safety performance.}},

Title = {{Relationship between Construction Safety and Quality Performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that the project cost, quality, safety, and
   duration are the four critical elements that contribute to project
   success. Past literature has established theoretical relationships
   between construction safety and quality on the basis of opinions of
   industry experts. This is the first empirical inquiry into the
   relationship between safety and quality, testing the null hypothesis
   that there is no statistical relationship among quality performance
   indicators and safety performance indicators. To test this hypothesis,
   empirical data were collected from 32 building construction projects,
   ranging in scope from \$50,000 to \$300million dollars. Several quality
   metrics (e.g.,cost of rework per \$1M project scope and rate of rework
   per 200,000 worker-hours) were used as predictor variables and first aid
   and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable
   injury rates were used as response variables. Linear regressions among
   the predictor and response variables showed that there are two
   statistically significant relationships: the OSHA recordable injury rate
   is positively correlated to rework (r2=0.968; p-value=0.032) and the
   first aid rate is positively correlated to number of defects (r2=0.548;
   p-value=0.009). To understand why these relationships exist and to
   identify specific strategies that promote both safety and quality,
   open-ended interviews were conducted with project managers. These
   individuals indicated that the most compelling reason for the strong
   positive correlation between rework and injuries is the fact that rework
   involves demolition, schedule pressure, and unstable work processes.
   They also noted that devoting resources to preplanning, allowing the
   necessary time to complete tasks correctly the first time, encouraging
   leadership at the workface, and encouraging workers to take pride in
   their work are all strategies that promote both safety and quality.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the National Spherical Torus Experiment, NSTX, targets
   physics understanding needed for extrapolation to a steady-state ST
   Fusion Nuclear Science Facility, pilot plant, or DEMO. The unique ST
   operational space is leveraged to test physics theories for next-step
   tokamak operation, including ITER. Present research also examines
   implications for the coming device upgrade, NSTX-U. An energy
   confinement time, tau(E), scaling unified for varied wall conditions
   exhibits a strong improvement of B-T tau(E) with decreased electron
   collisionality, accentuated by lithium (Li) wall conditioning. This
   result is consistent with nonlinear microtearing simulations that match
   the experimental electron diffusivity quantitatively and predict reduced
   electron heat transport at lower collisionality. Beam-emission
   spectroscopy measurements in the steep gradient region of the pedestal
   indicate the poloidal correlation length of turbulence of about ten ion
   gyroradii increases at higher electron density gradient and lower T-i
   gradient, consistent with turbulence caused by trapped electron
   instabilities. Density fluctuations in the pedestal top region indicate
   ion-scale microturbulence compatible with ion temperature gradient
   and/or kinetic ballooning mode instabilities. Plasma characteristics
   change nearly continuously with increasing Li evaporation and edge
   localized modes (ELMs) stabilize due to edge density gradient
   alteration. Global mode stability studies show stabilizing resonant
   kinetic effects are enhanced at lower collisionality, but in stark
   contrast have almost no dependence on collisionality when the plasma is
   off-resonance. Combined resistive wall mode radial and poloidal field
   sensor feedback was used to control n = 1 perturbations and improve
   stability. The disruption probability due to unstable resistive wall
   modes (RWMs) was surprisingly reduced at very high beta(N)/l(i) > 10
   consistent with low frequency magnetohydrodynamic spectroscopy
   measurements of mode stability. Greater instability seen at intermediate
   beta(N) is consistent with decreased kinetic RWM stabilization. A
   model-based RWM state-space controller produced long-pulse discharges
   exceeding beta(N) = 6.4 and beta(N)/l(i) = 13. Precursor analysis shows
   96.3\% of disruptions can be predicted with 10 ms warning and a false
   positive rate of only 2.8\%. Disruption halo currents rotate toroidally
   and can have significant toroidal asymmetry. Global kinks cause measured
   fast ion redistribution, with full-orbit calculations showing
   redistribution from the core outward and towards V-parallel to/V = 1
   where destabilizing compressional Alfven eigenmode resonances are
   expected. Applied 3D fields altered global Alfven eigenmode
   characteristics. High-harmonic fast-wave (HHFW) power couples to field
   lines across the entire width of the scrape-off layer, showing the
   importance of the inclusion of this phenomenon in designing future RF
   systems. The snowflake divertor configuration enhanced by radiative
   detachment showed large reductions in both steady-state and ELM heat
   fluxes (ELMing peak values down from 19 MW m(-2) to less than 1.5 MW
   m(-2)). Toroidal asymmetry of heat deposition was observed during ELMs
   or by 3D fields.
   The heating power required for accessing H-mode decreased by 30\% as the
   triangularity was decreased by moving the X-point to larger radius,
   consistent with calculations of the dependence of E x B shear in the
   edge region on ion heat flux and X-point radius. Co-axial helicity
   injection reduced the inductive start-up flux, with plasmas ramped to 1
   MA requiring 35\% less inductive flux. Non-inductive current fraction
   (NICF) up to 65\% is reached experimentally with neutral beam injection
   at plasma current I-p = 0.7 MA and between 70-100\% with HHFW
   application at I-p = 0.3 MA. NSTX-U scenario development calculations
   project 100\% NICF for a large range of 0.6 < I-p(MA) < 1.35.}},

Abstract = {{Pony Lake, at Cape Royds, Antarctica, is a shallow, eutrophic, coastal
   lake that freezes solid in the winter. Changes in Pony Lake's
   physicochemical parameters and microbial community were studied during
   the transition from ice to open water. Due to rising water temperatures,
   the progressive melt of the ice column and the gradual mixing of basal
   brines into the remaining water column, Pony Lake evolved physically and
   chemically over the course of the summer, thereby affecting the
   microbial community composition. Temperature, pH, conductivity,
   nutrients and major ion concentrations reached their maximum in January.
   Pony Lake was colonized by bacteria, viruses, phytoflagellates,
   ciliates, and a small number of rotifers. Primary and bacterial
   production were highest in mid-December (2.66 mg C l(-1) d(-1) and 30.5
   mu g C l(-1) d(-1), respectively). A 16S rRNA gene analysis of the
   bacterioplankton revealed 34 unique sequences dominated by members of
   the beta-and gamma-proteobacteria lineages. Cluster analyses on
   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) banding patterns and
   community structure indicated a shift in the dominant members of the
   microbial community during the transition from winter ice, to early, and
   late summer lakewater. Our data demonstrate that temporal changes in
   physicochemical parameters during the summer months determine community
   dynamics and mediate changes in microbial species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Boundary layer conditions in polar regions have been shown to have a
   significant impact on the levels of trace gases in the lower atmosphere.
   The ability to properly describe boundary layer characteristics (e.g.,
   stability, depth, and variations on diurnal and seasonal scales) is
   essential to understanding the processes that control chemical budgets
   and surface fluxes in these regions. Surface turbulence data measured
   from 3D sonic anemometers on an 8-m tower at Summit Station, Greenland,
   were used for estimating boundary layer depths (BLD) in stable to weakly
   stable conditions. The turbulence-derived BLD estimates were evaluated
   for June 2010 using direct BLD measurements from an acoustic sounder
   located approximately 50 m away from the tower. BLDs during this period
   varied diurnally; minimum values were less than 10 m, and maximum values
   were greater than 150 m. BLD estimates provided a better comparison with
   sodar observations during stable conditions. Ozone and nitrogen oxides
   were also measured at the meteorological tower and investigated for
   their dependency on boundary layer structure. These analyses, in
   contrast to observations from South Pole, Antarctica, did not show a
   clear relation between surface-layer atmospheric trace-gas levels and
   the stable boundary layer.}},

Abstract = {{A transparent Flexible Shear Beam (FSB) container was designed and
   constructed to simulate the dynamic response of a stratum of soil under
   horizontal, one-dimensional (1-D) earthquake shaking in a geotechnical
   centrifuge. A stack of four rectangular, acrylic frames separated by
   layers of flexible, high-strength rubber was used to form the
   transparent container. The fundamental natural frequency of the
   container was estimated to be similar to a layer of sand in its softened
   or liquefied state. The suitability of the container in simulating 1-D
   site response with minimal boundary effects was evaluated by monitoring
   the uniformity of the induced accelerations and settlements across the
   soil specimen. Further, the measured lateral displacements were compared
   with equivalent-linear site response analyses. The new FSB container was
   found to provide satisfactory boundary conditions for studying complex
   Soil-Structure-Interaction problems, while simultaneously enabling
   researchers to visualize deformations of the soil and buried structures
   during shaking. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Emissions estimation from satellite retrievals: A review of current
   capability}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{1011-1042}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Since the mid-1990s a new generation of Earth-observing satellites has
   been able to detect tropospheric air pollution at increasingly high
   spatial and temporal resolution. Most primary emitted species can be
   measured by one or more of the instruments. This review article
   addresses the question of how well we can relate the satellite
   measurements to quantification of primary emissions and what advances
   are needed to improve the usability of the measurements by U.S. air
   quality managers. Built on a comprehensive literature review and
   comprising input by both satellite experts and emission inventory
   specialists, the review identifies several targets that seem promising:
   large point sources of NOx and SO2, species that are difficult to
   measure by other means (NH3 and CH4, for example), area sources that
   cannot easily be quantified by traditional bottom-up methods (such as
   unconventional oil and gas extraction, shipping, biomass burning, and
   biogenic sources), and the temporal variation of emissions (seasonal,
   diurnal, episodic). Techniques that enhance the usefulness of current
   retrievals (data assimilation, oversampling, multi-species retrievals,
   improved vertical profiles, etc.) are discussed. Finally, we point out
   the value of having new geostationary satellites like CEO-CAPE and TEMPO
   over North America that could provide measurements at high spatial (few
   km) and temporal (hourly) resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy study of the nanoscale
   structure of the so-called ``twist-bend{''} nematic phase of the
   cyanobiphenyl (CB) dimer molecule CB(CH2)(7)CB reveals stripe-textured
   fracture planes that indicate fluid layers periodically arrayed in the
   bulk with a spacing of d similar to 8.3 nm. Fluidity and a rigorously
   maintained spacing result in long-range-ordered 3D focal conic domains.
   Absence of a lamellar X-ray reflection at wavevector q similar to 2 pi/d
   or its harmonics in synchrotron-based scattering experiments indicates
   that this periodic structure is achieved with no detectable associated
   modulation of the electron density, and thus has nematic rather than
   smectic molecular ordering. A search for periodic ordering with d
   similar to in CB(CH2) 7CB using atomistic molecular dynamic computer
   simulation yields an equilibrium heliconical ground state, exhibiting
   nematic twist and bend, of the sort first proposed by Meyer, and
   envisioned in systems of bent molecules by Dozov and Memmer. We measure
   the director cone angle to be 0(TB) similar to 25 degrees and the full
   pitch of the director helix to be p(TB) similar to 8.3 nm, a very small
   value indicating the strong coupling of molecular bend to director bend.}},

   and SiO1.54C0.26H0.12 (1100 degrees C). The oxidation process of
   individual Si-O-C(-H) was investigated by thermogravimetric/mass
   spectrometry. Ceramics with high H/C ratios exhibited sudden weight
   gains at 400-600 degrees C, which were accompanied by CO2-H2O evolution.
   Ceramics with low H/C ratios, oxidation and CO2 evolution proceeded
   moderately beyond 800 degrees C. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{We apply an in situ approach, whereby a polymer is incorporated into
   copper and evolves within the metal into the ceramic phase, to create a
   dispersion of hard particles in a metal. All constituents for the
   ceramic phase are contained within the organic polymer. The temperature
   for this polymer to ceramic conversion lies in the 1073 K to 1273 K (800
   A degrees C to 1000 A degrees C) range. The process produces a nanoscale
   dispersion of the ceramic, which leads to high microhardness that
   remains unaltered at temperatures up to 1223 K (950 A degrees C) (0.9T
   (M)). Apparently, the introduction of the ceramic phase leads to the
   retention of copper crystallite size of a few hundred nm, despite
   exposure to heat treatments at these very high temperatures. We call
   these materials polymer-derived metal-matrix composites. (C) The

Abstract = {{The high water content of hydrogels allows these materials to closely
   mimic the native biological extracellular conditions, but it also makes
   difficult the histological preparation of hydrogel-based bioengineered
   tissue. Paraffin-embedding techniques require dehydration of hydrogels,
   resulting in substantial collapse and deformation, whereas
   cryosectioning is hampered by the formation of ice crystals within the
   hydrogel material. Here, we sought to develop a method to obtain
   good-quality cryosections for the microscopic evaluation of
   hydrogel-based tissue-engineered constructs, using polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) as a test hydrogel. Conventional sucrose solutions, which
   dehydrate cells while leaving extracellular water in place, produce a
   hydrogel block that is brittle and difficult to section. We therefore
   replaced sucrose with multiple protein-based and nonprotein-based
   solutions as cryoprotectants. Our analysis demonstrated that overnight
   incubation in bovine serum albumin (BSA), fetal bovine serum (FBS),
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), optimum cutting temperature (OCT (R)) compound,
   and Fisher HistoPrep frozen tissue-embedding media work well to improve
   the cryosectioning of hydrogels. The protein-based solutions give
   background staining with routine hematoxylin and eosin, but the use of
   nonprotein-based solutions PVA and OCT reduces this background by 50\%.
   These methods preserve the tissue architecture and cellular details with
   both in vitro PEG constructs and in constructs that have been implanted
   in vivo. This simple hydrogel cryosectioning technique improves the
   methodology for creation of good-quality histological sections from
   hydrogels in multiple applications.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporation of degradable moieties into synthetic hydrogels has
   greatly increased the utility of these three-dimensional matrices for in
   vitro cell culture as well as tissue engineering applications. A common
   method for introducing degradability is the inclusion of oligopeptides
   sensitive to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enabling
   cell-mediated remodeling and migration within the material. While this
   strategy has been effective, characterization and measurement of
   cell-mediated degradation in these materials has remained challenging.
   There are 20+ MMP family members whose activity is regulated in space
   and time by a number of biochemical and biophysical cues. Thus, the
   typical approach of characterizing cleavage of degradable moieties in
   solution with recombinant enzymes does not easily translate to
   three-dimensional cell-mediated matrix remodeling. To address this
   challenge, we report here the synthesis of a cell-laden hydrogel matrix
   functionalized with a fluorogenic peptide substrate to provide
   real-time, quantitative monitoring of global MMP activity. Using this
   system, stimulation of MMP activity was observed with growth factor
   treatment in mammary epithelial cells and compared to classical
   zymography results. Further, the effect of biophysical cues on MMP
   activity of human mesenchymal stem cells was also investigated where
   more rigid hydrogels were observed to increase MMP activity. The
   regulation of MMP activity by these biochemical and biophysical cues
   highlights the need for in situ, real-time measurement of hydrogel
   degradation, and use of these functionalized hydrogels will aid in
   future rational design of degradable synthetic hydrogels for in vitro
   cell studies and tissue engineering applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Previously, SAPO-34 membranes prepared using aluminum isopropoxide
   (Al(O-i-Pr)(3)) and two templates (tetraethylammoniumhydroxide (TEAOH);
   dipropylamine (DPA)) were shown to separate CO2/CH4 mixtures with high
   fluxes at high pressures and room temperature. In this study, the
   synthesis was simplified, made safer, and modified to create less toxic
   waste by using only one template (TEAOH), but at twice the
   concentration, and Al(OH)(3) instead of Al(O-i-Pr)(3). However, some
   membranes prepared with the new procedure had low fluxes because they
   had impermeable regions. The impermeable regions were determined to be
   due to synthesis gel that remained in the support following a 15-min,
   post-synthesis rinse with water. Rinsing the membranes for at least 24 h
   in deionized water before calcination removed most of the residual gel
   and formed spatially-uniform membranes with high permeances (maximum of
   1.2 x 10(-6) mol/(m(2) s Pa)) and high CO2/CH4 separation selectivities
   (70) for 46-bar feed pressure. Additional benefits of these changes in
   membrane preparation include a 200-K increase in the temperature at
   which template could be removed, increased stability of calcined
   membranes contacted with liquid water, and better long-term stability
   during storage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of sub-micron surface patterns on the deposition of model
   proteins during active filtration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{444}},
Pages = {{420-428}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of sub-micron surface patterns on the fouling
   of a model protein solution (bovine serum albumin (BSA)), was
   investigated during active filtration and simple adsorption conditions.
   Surface patterns were created directly onto a commercial
   polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane using nanoimprint lithography,
   which resulted in a moderately reduced molecular mass cut-off (MWCO) but
   similar permeance as its non-imprinted counterpart as well as
   significantly improved resistance to BSA fouling. Staged filtration
   experiments, with backwash cleaning, revealed that the permeate flux of
   the imprinted membrane was considerably higher than that of the
   non-imprinted membrane, consistent with UV-vis measurements showing less
   protein deposition on the imprinted membranes. This improvement in
   anti-fouling characteristics for the imprinted membrane was universally
   observed for varying feed-solution chemistry including changes in both
   pH and ionic strength. From controlled protein-adsorption experiments
   under non-filtration conditions, it appears that the observed decrease
   in protein adsorption on the imprinted membranes is likely associated
   with altered hydrodynamics due to the presence of the sub-micron
   patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wnt5a directs the assembly of the Wnt-receptor-actin-myosin-polarity
   (WRAMP) structure, which integrates cell-adhesion receptors with F-actin
   and myosin to form a microfilament array associated with multivesicular
   bodies (MVBs). The WRAMP structure is polarized to the cell posterior,
   where it directs tail-end membrane retraction, driving forward
   translocation of the cell body. Here we define constituents of the WRAMP
   proteome, including regulators of microfilament and microtubule
   dynamics, protein interactions, and enzymatic activity. IQGAP1, a
   scaffold for F-actin nucleation and crosslinking, is necessary for WRAMP
   structure formation, potentially bridging microfilaments and MVBs.
   Vesicle coat proteins, including coatomer-I subunits, localize to and
   are required for the WRAMP structure. Electron microscopy and live
   imaging demonstrate movement of the ER to the WRAMP structure and plasma
   membrane, followed by elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Thus, Wnt5a
   controls directional movement by recruiting cortical ER to mobilize a
   rear-directed, localized Ca2+ signal, activating actomyosin contraction
   and adhesion disassembly for membrane retraction.}},

Abstract = {{Using a generalized form of Bloch's theorem, we derive the dispersion
   relation of a viscously damped locally resonant metamaterial modeled as
   an infinite mass-in-mass lumped parameter chain. For comparison, we
   obtain the dispersion relation for a statically equivalent
   Bragg-scattering mass-spring chain that is also viscously damped. For
   the two chains, we prescribe identical damping levels in the dashpots
   and compare the damping ratio associated with all propagating Bloch
   modes. We find that the locally resonant metamaterial exhibits higher
   dissipation throughout the spectrum which indicates a damping emergence
   phenomena due to the presence of local resonance. This phenomenon, which
   we define as ``metadamping{''}, provides a new paradigm for the design
   of material systems that display both high damping and high stiffness.
   We conclude our investigation by quantifying the degree of metadamping
   as a function of the long-wave speed of sound in the medium or the
   static stiffness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{A silicon carbide microtubular reactor has been used to measure
   branching ratios in the thermal decomposition of furan, C4H4O. The
   pyrolysis experiments are carried out by passing a dilute mixture of
   furan (approximately 0.01\%) entrained in a stream of helium through the
   heated reactor. The SiC reactor (0.66 mm i.d., 2 mm o.d., 2.5 cm long)
   operates with continuous flow. Experiments were performed with a reactor
   inlet pressure of 100-300 Torr and a wall temperature between 1200 and
   1600 K; characteristic residence times in the reactor are 60-150 mu s.
   The unimolecular decomposition pathway of furan is confirmed to be:
   furan (+ M) (sic) a-carbene or alpha-carbene. The alpha-carbene
   fragments to CH2=C=O + HC  CH while the beta-carbene isomerizes to
   CH2=C=CHCHO. The formyl allene can isomerize to CO + CH3C  CH or it can
   fragment to H + CO + HCCCH2. Tunable synchrotron radiation
   photoionization mass spectrometry is used to monitor the products and to
   measure the branching ratio of the two carbenes as well as the ratio of
   {[}HCCCH2]/{[}CH3C  CH]. The results of these pyrolysis experiments
   demonstrate a preference for 80\%-90\% of furan decomposition to occur
   via the beta-carbene. For reactor temperatures of 1200-1400 K, no
   propargyl radicals are formed. As the temperature rises to 1500-1600 K,
   at most 10\% of the decomposition of CH2=C=CHCHO produces H + CO +
   HCCCH2 radicals. Thermodynamic conditions in the reactor have been
   modeled by computational fluid dynamics and the experimental results are
   compared to the predictions of three furan pyrolysis mechanisms.
   Uncertainty in the pressure-dependency of the initiation reaction rates
   is a possible a source of discrepancy between experimental results and
   theoretical predictions. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Environmental influences on neural systems of relational complexity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Constructivist learning theory contends that we construct knowledge by
   experience and that environmental context influences learning. To
   explore this principle, we examined the cognitive process relational
   complexity (RC), defined as the number of visual dimensions considered
   during problem solving on a matrix reasoning task and a well-documented
   measure of mature reasoning capacity. We sought to determine how the
   visual environment influences RC by examining the influence of color and
   visual contrast on RC in a neuroimaging task. To specify the
   contributions of sensory demand and relational integration to reasoning,
   our participants performed a non-verbal matrix task comprised of color,
   no-color line, or black-white visual contrast conditions parametrically
   varied by complexity (relations 0, 1, 2). The use of matrix reasoning is
   ecologically valid for its psychometric relevance and for its potential
   to link the processing of psychophysically specific visual properties
   with various levels of RC during reasoning. The role of these elements
   is important because matrix tests assess intellectual aptitude based on
   these seemingly context-less exercises. This experiment is a first step
   toward examining the psychophysical underpinnings of performance on
   these types of problems. The importance of this is increased in light of
   recent evidence that intelligence can be linked to visual
   discrimination. We submit three main findings. First, color and
   black-white visual contrast (BWVC) add demand at a basic sensory level,
   but contributions from color and from BWVC are dissociable in cortex
   such that color engages a ``reasoning heuristic{''} and BWVC engages a
   ``sensory heuristic.{''} Second, color supports contextual sense-making
   by boosting salience resulting in faster problem solving. Lastly, when
   visual complexity reaches 2-relations, color and visual contrast
   relinquish salience to other dimensions of problem solving.}},

Abstract = {{We advance a paradigm of printed active composite materials realized by
   directly printing glassy shape memory polymer fibers in an elastomeric
   matrix. We imbue the active composites with intelligence via a
   programmed lamina and laminate architecture and a subsequent
   thermomechanical training process. The initial configuration is created
   by three-dimension (3D) printing, and then the programmed action of the
   shape memory fibers creates time dependence of the configuration-the
   four-dimension (4D) aspect. We design and print laminates in thin plate
   form that can be thermomechanically programmed to assume complex
   three-dimensional configurations including bent, coiled, and twisted
   strips, folded shapes, and complex contoured shapes with nonuniform,
   spatially varying curvature. The original flat plate shape can be
   recovered by heating the material again. We also show how the printed
   active composites can be directly integrated with other printed
   functionalities to create devices; here we demonstrate this by creating
   a structure that can assemble itself. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous results with flight (FLT) mice showed abnormalities in
   thymuses and spleens that have potential to compromise immune defense
   mechanisms. In this study, the organs were further evaluated in C57BL/6
   mice after Space Shuttle Atlantis returned from a 13-day mission.
   Thymuses and spleens were harvested from FLT mice and ground controls
   housed in similar animal enclosure modules (AEM). Organ and body mass,
   DNA fragmentation and expression of genes related to T cells and cancer
   were determined. Although significance was not obtained for thymus mass,
   DNA fragmentation was greater in the FLT group (P<0.01). Spleen mass
   alone and relative to body mass was significantly decreased in FLT mice
   (P<0.05). In FLT thymuses, 6/84 T cell-related genes were affected
   versus the AEM control group (P<0.05; up: IL10, Il18bp, Il18r1, Spp1;
   down: Ccl7, IL6); 15/84 cancer-related genes had altered expression
   (P<0.05; up: Casp8, FGFR2, Figf, Hgf, IGF1, Itga4, Ncam1, Pdgfa, Pik3r1,
   Serpinb2, Sykb; down: Cdc25a, E2F1, Mmp9, Myc). In the spleen, 8/84
   cancer-related genes were affected in FLT mice compared to AEM controls
   (P<0.05; up: Cdkn2a; down: Birc5, Casp8, Ctnnb1, Map2k1, Mdm2, NFkB1,
   Pdgfa). Pathway analysis (apoptosis signaling and checkpoint regulation)
   was used to map relationships among the cancer-related genes. The
   results showed that a relatively short mission in space had a
   significant impact on both organs. The findings also indicate that
   immune system aberrations due to stressors associated with space travel
   should be included when estimating risk for pathologies such as cancer
   and infection and in designing appropriate countermeasures. Although
   this was the historic last flight of NASA's Space Shuttle Program,
   exploration of space will undoubtedly continue.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the first report of planetary wave (PW) influences
   on significant temperature perturbations (10-20 K) within a course of
   one day detected by an Fe lidar from 35 to 51 km in the austral winter
   of 2011 at McMurdo (77.8 degrees S, 166.7 degrees E), Antarctica. Such
   large temperature perturbations are captured in the Modern Era
   Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data and
   correspond to various phases of eastward propagating PWs with periods of
   1-5days as revealed in MERRA. The strongest PW dominating the
   temperature perturbations has a period of 4-5days with wavenumber -1. A
   2-day wave with wavenumber -2 and a 1.25-day wave with wavenumber -3
   also have significant influences. We find that these eastward
   propagating PWs are highly confined to winter high latitudes, likely
   because negative refractive indices equatorward of similar to 45 degrees
   S result in evanescent wave characteristics and prevent the PWs from
   propagating to lower latitudes. The Eliassen-Palm flux divergence and
   instability analyses suggest that barotropic/baroclinic instability at
   50 degrees S-60 degrees S induced by the stratospheric polar night jet
   and/or the double-jet structure is the most likely wave source. Such
   instability in the region poleward of 70 degrees S is a complementary
   source for the 4-day wave, where we find that the heat flux of the 4-day
   wave is large and transported from similar to 70 degrees S toward the
   pole above 40km. This transport direction is likely linked to the
   meridional gradient of background temperature. The migrating diurnal
   tide near 78 degrees S in the upper stratosphere is discernable, but
   significantly smaller than that of the dominant 4-day wave.}},

Abstract = {{In any data assimilation framework, the background error covariance
   statistics play the critical role of filtering the observed information
   and determining the quality of the analysis. For atmospheric CO2 data
   assimilation, however, the background errors cannot be prescribed via
   traditional forecast or ensemble-based techniques as these fail to
   account for the uncertainties in the carbon emissions and uptake, or for
   the errors associated with the CO2 transport model. We propose an
   approach where the differences between two modeled CO2 concentration
   fields, based on different but plausible CO2 flux distributions and
   atmospheric transport models, are used as a proxy for the statistics of
   the background errors. The resulting error statistics: (1) vary
   regionally and seasonally to better capture the uncertainty in the
   background CO2 field, and (2) have a positive impact on the analysis
   estimates by allowing observations to adjust predictions over large
   areas. A state-of-the-art four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) system
   developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   (ECMWF) is used to illustrate the impact of the proposed approach for
   characterizing background error statistics on atmospheric CO2
   concentration estimates. Observations from the Greenhouse gases
   Observing SATellite IBUKI (GOSAT) are assimilated into the ECMWF 4D-VAR
   system along with meteorological variables, using both the new error
   statistics and those based on a traditional forecast-based technique.
   Evaluation of the four-dimensional CO2 fields against independent CO2
   observations confirms that the performance of the data assimilation
   system improves substantially in the summer, when significant
   variability and uncertainty in the fluxes are present.}},

Abstract = {{A negative-ion proton-transfer chemical ionization mass spectrometer was
   deployed on a mobile tower-mounted platform during Nitrogen, Aerosol
   Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower (NACHTT) to measure nitrous
   acid (HONO) in the winter of 2011. High resolution vertical profiles
   revealed (i) HONO gradients in nocturnal boundary layers, (ii) ground
   surface dominates HONO production by heterogeneous uptake of NO2, (iii)
   significant quantities of HONO may be deposited to the ground surface at
   night, (iv) daytime gradients indicative of ground HONO production or
   emission, and (v) an estimated surface HONO reservoir comparable or
   larger than integrated daytime HONO surface production. Nocturnal
   integrated column observations of HONO and NO2 allowed direct evaluation
   of nocturnal ground surface uptake coefficients for these species
   (gamma(NO2, surf)=2x10(-6) to 1.6x10(-5) and gamma(HONO, surf)=2x10(-5)
   to 2x10(-4)). A chemical model showed that the unknown source of HONO
   was highest in the morning, 4x10(6)moleculescm(-3)s(-1) (600pptvh(-1)),
   declined throughout the day, and minimized near
   1x10(6)moleculescm(-3)s(-1) (165pptvh(-1)). The quantity of
   surface-deposited HONO was also modeled, showing that HONO deposited to
   the surface at night was at least 25\%, and likely in excess of 100\%,
   of the calculated unknown daytime HONO source. These results suggest
   that if nocturnally deposited HONO forms a conservative surface
   reservoir, which can be released the following day, a significant
   fraction of the daytime HONO source can be explained for the NACHTT
   observations.}},

Title = {{Identification of imidacloprid metabolites in onion (Allium cepa L.)
   using high-resolution mass spectrometry and accurate mass tools}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE: Imidacloprid is a potent and widely used insecticide on
   vegetable crops, such as onion (Allium cepa L.). Because of possible
   toxicity to beneficial insects, imidacloprid and several metabolites
   have raised safety concerns for pollenating insects, such as honey bees.
   Thus, imidacloprid metabolites continue to be an important subject for
   new methods that better understand its dissipation and fate in plants,
   such as onions.
   METHODS: One month after a single addition of imidacloprid to soil
   containing onion plants, imidacloprid and its metabolites were extracted
   from pulverized onion with a methanol/water-buffer mixture and analyzed
   by liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (LC/QTOF-MS) using a labeled imidacloprid internal standard and tandem
   mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis.
   RESULTS: Accurate mass tools were developed and applied to detect seven
   new metabolites of imidacloprid with the goal to better understand its
   fate in onion. The accurate mass tools include: database searching,
   diagnostic ions, chlorine mass filters, Mass Profiler software, and
   manual use of metabolic analogy. The new metabolites discovered included
   an amine reduction product (m/z 226.0854), and its methylated analogue
   (m/z 240.1010), and five other metabolites, all of unknown toxicity to
   insects.
   CONCLUSIONS: The accurate mass tools were combined with LC/QTOF-MS and
   were able to detect both known and new metabolites of imidacloprid using
   fragmentation studies of both parent and labeled standards. New
   metabolites and their structures were inferred from these MS/MS studies
   with accurate mass, which makes it possible to better understand
   imidacloprid metabolism in onion as well as new metabolite targets for
   toxicity studies. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Biomass pyrolysis: Thermal decomposition mechanisms of furfural and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{The thermal decompositions of furfural and benzaldehyde have been
   studied in a heated microtubular flow reactor. The pyrolysis experiments
   were carried out by passing a dilute mixture of the aromatic aldehydes
   (roughly 0.1\%-1\%) entrained in a stream of buffer gas (either He or
   Ar) through a pulsed, heated SiC reactor that is 2-3 cm long and 1 mm in
   diameter. Typical pressures in the reactor are 75-150 Torr with the SiC
   tube wall temperature in the range of 1200-1800 K. Characteristic
   residence times in the reactor are 100-200 mu sec after which the gas
   mixture emerges as a skimmed molecular beam at a pressure of
   approximately 10 mu Torr. Products were detected using matrix infrared
   absorption spectroscopy, 118.2 nm (10.487 eV) photoionization mass
   spectroscopy and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization. The initial
   steps in the thermal decomposition of furfural and benzaldehyde have
   been identified. Furfural undergoes unimolecular decomposition to furan
   + CO: C4H3O-CHO (+ M) -> CO + C4H4O. Sequential decomposition of furan
   leads to the production of HC  CH, CH2CO, CH3C=CH, CO, HCCCH2, and H
   atoms. In contrast, benzaldehyde resists decomposition until higher
   temperatures when it fragments to phenyl radical plus H atoms and CO:
   C6H5CHO (+ M) -> C6H5CO + H -> C6H5 + CO + H. The H atoms trigger a
   chain reaction by attacking C6H5CHO: H + C6H5CHO -> {[}C6H6CHO]{*} ->
   C6H6 + CO + H. The net result is the decomposition of benzaldehyde to
   produce benzene and CO. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the dispersion characteristics of locally resonant
   elastic metamaterials formed by the erection of pillars on the solid
   regions in a plate patterned by a periodic array of holes. We show that
   these solid regions effectively act as springboards leading to an
   enhanced resonance behavior by the pillars when compared to the nominal
   case of pillars with no holes. This local resonance amplification
   phenomenon, which we define as the trampoline effect, is shown to cause
   subwavelength bandgaps to increase in size by up to a factor of 4. This
   outcome facilitates the utilization of subwavelength metamaterial
   properties over exceedingly broad frequency ranges. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{In-stream attenuation was determined for 14 neuro-active pharmaceuticals
   and associated metabolites. Lagrangian sampling, which follows a parcel
   of water as it moves downstream, was used to link hydrological and
   chemical transformation processes. Wastewater loading of neuro-active
   compounds varied considerably over a span of several hours, and thus a
   sampling regime was used to verify that the Lagrangian parcel was being
   sampled and a mechanism was developed to correct measured concentrations
   if it was not. In-stream attenuation over the 5.4-km evaluated reach
   could be modeled as pseudo-first-order decay for 11 of the 14 evaluated
   neuro-active pharmaceutical compounds, illustrating the capacity of
   streams to reduce conveyance of neuro-active compounds downstream.
   Fluoxetine and N-desmethyl citalopram were the most rapidly attenuated
   compounds (t(1/2) = 3.6 +/- 0.3 h, 4.0 +/- 0.2 h, respectively).
   Lamotrigine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, and
   carbamazepine were the most persistent (t(1/2) = 12 +/- 2.0 h, 12 +/-
   2.6 h, 21 +/- 4.5 h, respectively). Parent compounds (e.g., buproprion,
   carbamazepine, lamotrigine) generally were more persistent relative to
   their metabolites. Several compounds (citalopram, venlafaxine,
   O-desmethyl-venlafaxine) were not attenuated. It was postulated that the
   primary mechanism of removal for these compounds was interaction with
   bed sediments and stream biofilms, based on measured concentrations in
   stream biofilms and a column experiment using stream sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Plant cell-wall polysaccharides represent a vast source of food in
   nature. To depolymerize polysaccharides to soluble sugars, many
   organisms use multifunctional enzyme mixtures consisting of glycoside
   hydrolases, lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases, polysaccharide lyases,
   and carbohydrate esterases, as well as accessory, redox-active enzymes
   for lignin depolymerization. Many of these enzymes that degrade
   lignocellulose are multimodular with carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs)
   and catalytic domains connected by flexible, glycosylated linkers. These
   linkers have long been thought to simply serve as a tether between
   structured domains or to act in an inchworm-like fashion during
   catalytic action. To examine linker function, we performed molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations of the Trichoderma reesei Family 6 and Family
   7 cellobiohydrolases (TrCel6A and TrCel7A, respectively) bound to
   cellulose. During these simulations, the glycosylated linkers bind
   directly to cellulose, suggesting a previously unknown role in enzyme
   action. The prediction from the MD simulations was examined
   experimentally by measuring the binding affinity of the Cel7A CBM and
   the natively glycosylated Cel7A CBM-linker. On crystalline cellulose,
   the glycosylated linker enhances the binding affinity over the CBM alone
   by an order of magnitude. The MD simulations before and after binding of
   the linker also suggest that the bound linker may affect enzyme action
   due to significant damping in the enzyme fluctuations. Together, these
   results suggest that glycosylated linkers in carbohydrate-active
   enzymes, which are intrinsically disordered proteins in solution, aid in
   dynamic binding during the enzymatic deconstruction of plant cell walls.}},

Abstract = {{We employ quantum chemical calculations to discover how `frustrated
   Lewis pairs (FLP) catalyze the reduction of CO, by ammonia borane (AB);
   specifically, we examine how the Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) of
   an FLP activate CO, for reduction. We find that the LA
   (trichloroaluminum, AlCl3) alone catalyzes hydride transfer (HT) to CO,
   while the LB (trimesitylenephosphine, PMes(3)) actually hinders HT;
   inclusion of the LB increases the HT barrier by 8 kcal/mol relative to
   the reaction catalyzed by LAs only The LB hinders HT by donating its
   lone pair to the WMO of CO,,, increasing the electron density on the C
   atom and thus lowering its hydride affinity. Althbugh. the LB hinders
   HT, it nonetheless plays a crucial role by stabilizing `the active
   FLP-CO, complex relative to the LA dinner, free CO2, and free LB. This
   greatly increases the concentration of the reactive complex in the form
   FLP-CO, and thus increases the rate of reaction. We. expect that the
   principles we describe will aid in understanding other catalytic CO,
   reductions.}},

Abstract = {{About 600,000 hernia repair surgeries are performed each year; recently,
   the use of laparoscopic minimally invasive techniques has become
   increasingly popular in these operations. Use of surgical mesh in hernia
   repair has shown lower recurrence rates compared to other repair
   methods. However in many procedures, placement of surgical mesh can be
   challenging and even complicate the procedure, potentially leading to
   lengthy operating times. Various techniques have been attempted to
   improve mesh placement, including use of specialized systems to orient
   the mesh into a specific shape, with limited success and acceptance. In
   this study, a programmed novel Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) was integrated
   into commercially available polyester surgical meshes to add automatic
   unrolling and tissue conforming functionalities, while preserving the
   intrinsic structural properties of the original surgical mesh. Tensile
   testing and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis was performed on four different
   SMP formulas to identify appropriate mechanical properties for surgical
   mesh integration. In vitro testing involved monitoring the time required
   for a modified surgical mesh to deploy in a 37 degrees C water bath. An
   acute porcine model was used to test the in vivo unrolling of SMP
   integrated surgical meshes. The SMP-integrated surgical meshes produced
   an automated, temperature activated, controlled deployment of surgical
   mesh on the order of several seconds, via laparoscopy in the animal
   model. Results indicate surgical mesh modified with SMP is capable of
   laparoscopic deployment in vivo, activated by body temperature. This
   suggests a reduction in surgical operating time and improved mesh
   placement characteristics is possible with SMP-integrated surgical
   meshes. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A:

Abstract = {{In designing targeted contrast agent materials for imaging, the need to
   present a targeting ligand for recognition and binding by the target is
   counterbalanced by the need to minimize interactions with plasma
   components and to avoid recognition by the immune system. We have
   previously reported on a microbubble imaging probe for ultrasound
   molecular imaging that uses a buried-ligand surface architecture to
   minimize unwanted interactions and immunogenicity. Here we examine for
   the first time the utility of this approach for in vivo molecular
   imaging. In accordance with previous results, we showed a threefold
   increase in circulation persistence through the tumor of a fibrosarcoma
   model in comparison with controls. The buried-ligand microbubbles were
   then activated for targeted adhesion through the application of
   noninvasive ultrasound radiation forces applied specifically to the
   tumor region. Using a clinical ultrasound scanner, microbubbles were
   activated, imaged, and silenced. The results showed visually conspicuous
   images of tumor neovasculature and a twofold increase in ultrasound
   radiation force enhancement of acoustic contrast intensity for
   buried-ligand microbubbles, whereas no such increase was found for
   exposed-ligand microbubbles. We therefore conclude that the use of
   acoustically active buried-ligand microbubbles for ultrasound molecular
   imaging bridges the demand for low immunogenicity with the necessity of
   maintaining targeting efficacy and imaging conspicuity in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Pd/Al2O3 catalysts coated with various thiolate self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs) were used to direct the partial hydrogenation of
   18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, yielding a product stream
   enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (with low saturated fatty acid
   content), a favorable result for increasing the oxidative stability of
   biodiesel. The uncoated Pd/Al2O3 catalyst quickly saturated all fatty
   acid reactants under hydrogenation conditions, but the addition of
   alkanethiol SAMs markedly increased the reaction selectivity to the
   monounsaturated product oleic acid to a level of 80-90\%, even at
   conversions >70\%. This effect, which is attributed to steric effects
   between the SAMs and reactants, was consistent with the relative
   consumption rates of linoleic and oleic acid using alkanethiol-coated
   and uncoated Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. With an uncoated Pd/Al2O3 catalyst,
   each fatty acid, regardless of its degree of saturation had a reaction
   rate of similar to 0.2 mol reactant consumed per mole of surface
   palladium per second. Using alkanethiol-coated Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, the
   activity was reduced by a factor of 4 for polyunsaturated reactants and
   by a factor of 100 for the monounsaturated reactants. In contrast to the
   hydrophobic alkanethiol modifiers, hydrophilic were found to strongly
   inhibit reaction kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular layer deposition (MID) techniques were used to deposit

   Several metalcone MID chemistries were employed, including alucone

   metalcone MID films grew directly on the CNTs and MLD initiation did not
   require atomic layer deposition (ALD) of an adhesion layer. Transmission
   electron microscopy revealed that MLD formed three-dimensional conformal
   deposits throughout a CNT scaffold. Mechanical testing was also
   performed on sheets of (CNT networks coated by MID. Young's Modulus
   values improved from an initial value of 510 MPa for uncoated CNT sheet

   reconstruct the temperature and wind velocity fields given the
   transducers' locations and the measured travel times of sound

   aims at assessing the errors simultaneously with the mean field
   reconstruction. The second algorithm uses the results of the first
   algorithm to identify the ray paths corrupted by the systematic errors
   and then estimates these errors more accurately. Numerical simulations
   show that the first algorithm can improve the reconstruction when
   relatively small systematic errors are present in all paths. The second
   algorithm significantly improves the reconstruction when systematic
   errors are present in a few, but not all, ray paths. The developed
   algorithms were applied to experimental data obtained at the Boulder

Abstract = {{Due to the propensity of ionic liquids (ILs) to inactivate enzymes, the
   development of strategies to improve enzyme utility in these solvents is
   critical to fully exploit ILs for biocatalysis. We have developed a
   strategy to broadly improve enzyme utility in ILs based on elucidating
   the effect of charge modifications on the function of enzymes in IL
   environments. Results of stability studies in aqueous-IL mixtures
   indicated a clear connection between the ratio of enzyme-containing
   positive-to-negative sites and enzyme stability in ILs. Stability
   studies of the effect of {[}BMIM]{[}Cl] and {[}EMIM]{[}EtSO4] on
   chymotrypsin specifically found an optimum ratio of positively-charged
   amine-to-negatively-charged acid groups (0.39). At this ratio, the
   half-life of chymotrypsin was increased 1.6- and 4.3-fold relative to
   wild-type chymotrypsin in {[}BMIM]{[}Cl] and {[}EMIM]{[}EtSO4],
   respectively. The half-lives of lipase and papain were similarly
   increased as much as 4.0 and 2.4-fold, respectively, in {[}BMIM]{[}Cl]
   by modifying the ratio of positive-to-negative sites of each enzyme.
   More generally, the results of stability studies found that
   modifications that reduce the ratio of enzyme-containing
   positive-to-negative sites improve enzyme stability in ILs.
   Understanding the impact of charge modification on enzyme stability in
   ILs may ultimately be exploited to rationally engineer enzymes for
   improved function in IL environments. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013;

Abstract = {{An inverse metabolic engineering strategy was used to select for
   Escherichia coli cells with an increased capability to N-glycosylate a
   specific target protein. We developed a screen for E. coli cells
   containing extra-chromosomal DNA fragments for improved ability to add
   precise sugar groups onto the AcrA protein using the glycosylation
   system from Campylobacter jejuni. Four different sized (1, 2, 4, and
   8kb) genomic DNA libraries were screened, and the sequences that
   conferred a yield advantage were determined. These advantageous genomic
   fragments were mapped onto the E. coli W3110 chromosome. Five candidate
   genes (identified across two or more libraries) were subsequently
   selected for forward engineering verification in E. coli CLM24 cells,
   utilizing a combination of internal standards for absolute quantitation
   and pseudo-selective reaction monitoring (pSRM) and Western blotting
   validation. An increase in glycosylated protein was quantified in cells
   overexpressing 4--glucantransferase and a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent
   sugar phosphotransferase system, amounting to a 3.8-fold (engineered
   cells total=5.3mgL(-1)) and 6.7-fold (engineered cells total=9.4mgL(-1))
   improvement compared to control cells, respectively. Furthermore,
   increased glycosylation efficiency was observed in cells overexpressing
   enzymes involved with glycosylation precursor synthesis, enzymes
   1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (1.3-fold) and
   UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (1.6-fold). To evaluate the
   wider implications of the engineering, we tested a modified Fc fragment
   of an IgG antibody as the target glycoprotein with two of our engineered
   cells, and achieved a ca. 75\% improved glycosylation efficiency.

Abstract = {{A time-dependent decomposition parameter is added to the classic
   Langmuir adsorption model to derive an expression for the growth of CVD
   films where chemical precursors are converted into the solid state upon
   arrival on a hot substrate. Three regimes of behavior emerge from the
   model; at low temperatures decomposition occurs faster than desorption,
   at intermediate temperatures the decomposition is slower than
   desorption, and at high temperatures the growth becomes flux-limited
   such that all arriving vapor molecules convert to the solid phase. The
   relative dominance of these regimes varies with the impingement rate. In
   an Arrhenius plot, the asymptotic predictions from the model are matched
   with published experimental measurements for the growth of titania films
   from an alkoxide precursor; this exercise yields 135kJmol(-1) as the
   activation energy for the decomposition reaction, and approximate to
   92kJmol(-1) for desorption. A molecular vibration frequency for
   decomposition of adsorbed vapor molecules is calculated to be
   approximately 6x10(11) s(-1). The middle regime, which is more prominent
   at low impingement rates and intermediate temperatures, is expected to
   promote step coverage.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionHindlimb unloading-induced muscle atrophy is often assessed
   after a homeostatic state is established, thus overlooking the early
   adaptations that are critical to developing this pattern of atrophy.
   MethodsMuscle function and physiology were characterized at 0, 1, 3, 7,
   and 14 days of hindlimb suspension (HS).
   ResultsReductions in muscle mass were maximal by Day 14 of HS.
   Functional strength and isolated muscle strength were reduced. MyHC-I
   and -IIa expressing fibers were reduced in size by Day 7 in the soleus
   and by Day 14 in the gastrocnemius (MyHC-I fibers only). Atrogin-1 and
   MuRF1 expression was increased by Day 1 in both the calf and tibialis
   anterior while IGF-1 expression was significantly reduced on Day 3.
   Phosphorylation of Akt was reduced on Day 14.
   ConclusionsInsight into these early changes in response to HS improves
   understanding of the molecular and functional changes that lead to
   muscle atrophy. Muscle Nerve48: 393-402, 2013}},

Abstract = {{Wintertime satellite-derived ice surface velocities, from 2001 through
   2007, suggest an increase in ice velocity in the wet snow zone of
   Southwest Greenland. We present a thermomechanical model to evaluate the
   influence of surface meltwater runoff on englacial temperatures, via
   cryo-hydrologic warming (CHW), as a possible mechanism to explain this
   velocity increase at Sermeq Avannarleq. The model incorporates CHW
   through a previously published dual-column parameterization. We compare
   model simulations with (i) CHW active over the entire ice thickness
   (base case CHW), (ii) CHW active only in the surface 80m of the ice
   sheet (surface CHW), and (iii) no CHW to represent a traditional
   thermomechanical model. The horizontal extent of CHW is prescribed based
   on equilibrium line altitude position and thus incorporates the upstream
   expansion of the ablation zone over the past decade. The base case CHW
   simulations reproduce the observed increase in inland ice velocity
   between 2001 and 2007 reasonably well. The no CHW and surface CHW
   simulations significantly underestimate observed ice surface velocities
   in both epochs. The higher ice velocities in the base case CHW
   simulations are attributable to both decreased basal ice viscosities
   associated with increased basal ice temperatures and an increase in the
   extent of basal sliding permitted by temperate bed conditions. Only the
   temperate bed extent predicted by the base case CHW simulation is
   consistent with independent observations of basal sliding. Based on our
   sensitivity analysis of CHW, we evaluate alternative explanations for an
   increase in inland ice velocity and suggest CHW is the most plausible
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional (3-D) nano-architectures have attracted tremendous
   attention for applications in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries due to
   their unique structural advantages. In this work, we developed a facile
   approach to fabricate 3-D Silicon (Si) nanowire networks. By
   precipitation, Si nanowires spontaneously interwove with one another to
   form 3-D nanowire networks with large amount of micro/nano gaps, which
   can not only facilitate Li-ion transport but also effectively
   accommodate the volume change. Carbon coating was then applied on Si
   nanowire networks through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process,
   which not only mechanically strengthens the structure but also helps the
   formation of 3-D electrical conducting network. A Si/C nanowire network
   with a wire diameter of 75 nm and 12 wt\% of carbon coating exhibits a
   very high specific capacity of 2300 mAh g(-1) at a rate of C/5 and a
   high specific capacity of around 600 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 4.5C.
   Our experimental investigations showed that the cycle life of such Si/C
   nanowire network can be further prolonged by increasing the carbon
   coating content, decreasing the diameters of Si nanowires, or reducing
   the testing voltage window. A Si/C nanowire network with a wire diameter
   of 37 nm and 17 wt\% carbon coating can retain 78\% of the initial
   capacity after 60 cycles in a testing voltage window of 0.1-2 V. (C)

Abstract = {{We address the growing need for accurate water temperature predictions
   in regulated rivers to inform decision support systems and protect
   aquatic habitats. Although many suitable river temperature models exist,
   few simultaneously model water temperature dynamics while considering
   uncertainty of predictions and assimilating observations. Here, we
   employ a stochastic dynamics approach to water temperature modeling that
   estimates both the water temperature state and its uncertainty by
   propagating error through a physically based dynamical system. This
   method involves converting the governing hydrodynamic and heat transport
   equations into a state space form and assimilating observations via the
   Kalman Filter. This model, called the River Assessment for Forecasting
   Temperature (RAFT), closes the heat budget by tracking heat movement
   using a robust semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme. RAFT considers key
   thermodynamic processes, including advection, longitudinal dispersion,
   atmospheric heat fluxes, lateral inflows, streambed heat exchange, and
   unsteady nonuniform flow. Inputs include gridded meteorological
   forecasts from a numerical weather prediction model, bathymetric
   cross-sectional geometry, and temperature and flow measurements at the
   upstream boundary and tributaries. We applied RAFT to an approximate to
   100 km portion of the Sacramento River in California, downstream of
   Keswick Dam (a regulatory dam below Shasta Dam), at a spatial resolution
   of 2 km and a temporal resolution of 15 min. Model prediction error over
   a 6 month calibration period was on the order of 0.5 degrees C. When
   temperature and flow gage data were assimilated, the mean prediction
   error was significantly less (0.25 degrees C). The model accurately
   predicts the magnitude and timing of diel temperature fluctuations and
   can provide 72 h water temperature forecasts when linked with
   meteorological forecasts and real-time flow/temperature monitoring
   networks. RAFT is potentially scalable to model and forecast
   fine-grained one-dimensional temperature dynamics covering a broad
   extent in a variety of regulated rivers provided that adequate input
   data are available.}},

Abstract = {{Given projected increases in stream temperatures attributable to global
   change, improved understanding of relationships between stream
   temperatures and hyporheic exchange would be useful. We conducted two
   conservative tracer injection experiments in a glacial meltwater stream,
   to evaluate the effects of hyporheic thermal gradients on exchange
   processes, including preferential flow paths (PFPs). The experiments
   were conducted on the same day, the first (a stream injection) during a
   cool, morning period and the second (dual stream and hyporheic
   injections) during a warm, afternoon period. In the morning, the
   hyporheic zone was thermally uniform at 4 degrees C, whereas by the
   afternoon the upper 10 cm had warmed to 6-12 degrees C and exhibited
   greater temperature heterogeneity. Solute transport modeling showed that
   hyporheic cross-sectional areas (A(s)) at two downstream sites were two
   and seven times lower during the warm experiment. Exchange metrics
   indicated that the hyporheic zone had less influence on downstream
   solute transport during the warm, afternoon experiment. Calculated
   hyporheic depths were less than 5 cm, contrasting with tracer detection
   at 10 and 25 cm depths. The hyporheic tracer arrival at one downstream
   site was rapid, comparable to the in-stream tracer arrival, providing
   evidence for PFPs. We thus propose a conceptual view of the hyporheic
   zone in this reach as being dominated by discrete PFPs weaving through
   hydraulically isolated areas. One explanation for the simultaneous
   increase in temperature heterogeneity and A(s) decrease in a warmer
   hyporheic zone may be a flow path preferentiality feedback mechanism
   resulting from a combination of temperature-related viscosity decreases
   and streambed heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The early stage of hypogene karstification is investigated using a
   coupled thermohydrochemical model of a mountain hydrologic system, in
   which water enters along a water table and descends to significant depth
   (approximate to 1 km) before ascending through a central
   high-permeability fracture. The model incorporates reactive alteration
   driven by dissolution/precipitation of limestone in a carbonic acid
   system, due to both temperature- and pressure-dependent solubility, and
   kinetics. Simulations were carried out for homogeneous and heterogeneous
   initial fracture aperture fields, using the FEHM (Finite Element Heat
   and Mass Transfer) code. Initially, retrograde solubility is the
   dominant mechanism of fracture aperture growth. As the fracture
   transmissivity increases, a critical Rayleigh number value is exceeded
   at some stage. Buoyant convection is then initiated and controls the
   evolution of the system thereafter. For an initially homogeneous
   fracture aperture field, deep well-organized buoyant convection rolls
   form. For initially heterogeneous aperture fields, preferential flow
   suppresses large buoyant convection rolls, although a large number of
   smaller rolls form. Even after the onset of buoyant convection,
   dissolution in the fracture is sustained along upward flow paths by
   retrograde solubility and by additional mixing corrosion effects closer
   to the surface. Aperture growth patterns in the fracture are very
   different from those observed in simulations of epigenic karst systems,
   and retain imprints of both buoyant convection and preferential flow.
   Both retrograde solubility and buoyant convection contribute to these
   differences. The paper demonstrates the potential value of coupled
   models as tools for understanding the evolution and behavior of hypogene
   karst systems.}},

Title = {{The asymmetric drift, the local standard of rest, and implications from
   RAVE data}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{557}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context. The determination of the local standard of rest (LSR), which
   corresponds to the measurement of the peculiar motion of the Sun based
   on the derivation of the asymmetric drift of stellar populations, is
   still a matter of debate. The classical value of the tangential peculiar
   motion of the Sun with respect to the LSR was challenged in recent
   years, claiming a significantly larger value.
   Aims. We present an improved Jeans analysis, which allows a better
   interpretation of the measured kinematics of stellar populations in the
   Milky Way disc. We show that the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE)
   sample of dwarf stars is an excellent data set to derive tighter
   boundary conditions to chemodynamical evolution models of the extended
   solar neighbourhood.
   Methods. We propose an improved version of the Stromberg relation with
   the radial scalelengths as the only unknown. We redetermine the
   asymmetric drift and the LSR for dwarf stars based on RAVE data.
   Additionally, we discuss the impact of adopting a different LSR value on
   the individual scalelengths of the subpopulations.
   Results. Binning RAVE stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric
   drift (corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more
   metal-rich populations. With the standard assumption of
   velocity-dispersion independent radial scalelengths in each metallicity
   bin, we redetermine the LSR. The new Stromberg equation yields a joint
   LSR value of V-circle dot = 3.06 +/- 0.68 km s(-1), which is even
   smaller than the classical value based on Hipparcos data. The
   corresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the
   metal-rich bin to 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an
   even larger scalelength for young metal-poor stars. When adopting the
   recent Schonrich value of V-circle dot = 12.24 km s(-1) for the LSR, the
   new Stromberg equation yields much larger individual radial scalelengths
   of the RAVE subpopulations, which seem unphysical in part.
   Conclusions. The new Stromberg equation allows a cleaner interpretation
   of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radial scalelengths.
   Lifting the LSR value by a few km s(-1) compared to the classical value
   results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of
   smaller values for larger velocity dispersions.}},

Abstract = {{Multinational, project-based organizations are faced with competing
   challenges of adapting to a local marketplace and integrating various
   offices globally. Case studies with 14 multi-national real estate
   development, general contracting, and engineering firms revealed types
   of knowledge required for international operations, knowledge management
   strategies, and the level of embeddedness within the local project area.
   Eighty-nine interviews were recorded, transcribed, and imported into
   qualitative coding software. Analysis of the data built propositions
   regarding different levels of local project embeddedness and the
   relationship between embeddedness and knowledge management strategies.
   The findings indicate that firms with a low level of local embeddedness
   have more formal knowledge management platforms to share local
   knowledge, whereas firms with a high level of embeddedness, which
   require the most local knowledge, lack formal knowledge management
   strategies to share their knowledge across projects.}},

Abstract = {{Systems consisting of metallic layers are commonly used in many
   applications for microelectronics, data storage, protection coatings,
   and microelectro-mechanical systems. The physical properties of such
   systems are strongly determined by the flow of the electron and phonon
   gases and their interactions. In this study, the effective thermal
   conductivity of a metal-metal bilayer system is studied using the
   two-temperature model of heat conduction. By defining the total
   interfacial thermal resistance, it is shown that the thermal
   conductivity of the bilayer system depends on the ratio between the
   thicknesses of the metallic layers and their intrinsic coupling length
   and it has a simple interpretation as the sum of thermal resistances in
   series. It is demonstrated that the total interfacial thermal resistance
   can be minimized by choosing appropriately the thermal and geometrical
   properties of the component layers. The proposed approach could be
   useful for thermally characterizing and guiding the design of novel
   metal-metal-layered systems involved in diverse technological
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report, for the first time, the observation of an incubation time for
   the onset of flash sintering in experiments carried out at isothermal
   furnace temperatures. The incubation time varies highly nonlinearly with
   the strength of the DC field, akin to a nucleation-like phenomenon. The
   setting of the maximum current at the power supply has a significant
   influence on the extent of densification. The hold time at these current
   settings has an influence on the grain size increasing it with time and
   the magnitude of the current setting. The experiments were carried out
   on 3mol\% yttria-stabilized zirconia. In all instances the specimen
   temperatures during flash sintering, estimated from a previously
   validated blackbody radiation model remain well below the temperatures
   that would be required for conventional sintering of yttria-stabilized
   zirconia. Taken together these observations imply a nucleation of defect
   avalanche as a possible mechanism for flash sintering.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional diffusion problem with prescribed boundary conditions
   for the oxygen potential at the oxygen(gas)-silica and at the
   silica-substrate interfaces is employed to obtain the parabolic rate
   constant for oxidation of Si crystals. The results, using the data for
   diffusion and solubility of molecular oxygen in silica agree reasonably
   well with the oxidation kinetics results for Si from Deal and Grove
   (1965). The measurements for SiC crystals (Costello and Tressler, 1985)
   lie below these results for Si, even though in both instances, diffusion
   through the silica overlayer is expected to have been rate controlling.
   This difference is explained in terms of the lower Si activity at the
   SiC-SiO2 interface than at the Si-SiO2 interface. The implication of the
   interface structure is discussed in an attempt to explain the higher
   activation energy for oxidation of the Si-face (0001), than the C-face
   (0001<overbar>) of SiC crystals.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{One key route for controlling reaction selectivity in heterogeneous
   catalysis is to prepare catalysts that exhibit only specific types of
   sites required for desired product formation. Here we show that
   alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers with varying surface densities
   can be used to tune selectivity to desired hydrogenation and
   hydrodeoxygenation products during the reaction of furfural on supported
   palladium catalysts. Vibrational spectroscopic studies demonstrate that
   the selectivity improvement is achieved by controlling the availability
   of specific sites for the hydrogenation of furfural on supported
   palladium catalysts through the selection of an appropriate
   alkanethiolate. Increasing self-assembled monolayer density by
   controlling the steric bulk of the organic tail ligand restricts
   adsorption on terrace sites and dramatically increases selectivity to
   desired products furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran. This technique of
   active-site selection simultaneously serves both to enhance selectivity
   and provide insight into the reaction mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows that among frequency independent (FI) conformal
   antennas, the modulated arm width (MAW) spiral has the simplest
   architecture for measuring both polarization and angle-of-arrival (AOA)
   instantaneously if frequency is known. The theory, design and
   performance of equiangular four-arm MAW spiral antennas when utilizing
   both sum modes (+/- 1) and difference mode (+/- 2) for direction-finding
   applications are discussed. It is shown that simultaneous
   dual-polarization and multi-mode capability is not achievable in more
   commonly-used four-arm spiral and sinuous antennas. While the
   co-polarizedmodes 1, 2 and 3 are well-researched with single-polarized
   four-arm equiangular spirals, they have not been utilized or controlled
   on a four-arm MAW spiral. Effects of modulation period on
   cross-polarization, pattern symmetry, gain, and impedance for all three
   pattern modes are investigated. The studies are carried out using
   full-wave modeling and a prototype MAW geometry is built and evaluated
   with a beamformer to demonstrate its wideband, dual-polarized,

Abstract = {{Biomechanical analysis of biceps tenodesis procedures has historically
   focused on load to failure models. Minimal data exists for the analysis
   of biomechanical strain properties of the biceps tendon in a
   sub-failure, physiologic cadaver model.
   Tendon strain characteristics are different between bony and soft tissue
   tenodesis surgery, and the soft tissue tenodesis procedure reproduces a
   strain pattern more similar to the native biceps tendon.
   Eight fresh frozen cadaver upper extremities were mounted onto a custom
   device that controls shoulder abduction and rotation. Strain on the
   tendon was measured using a differential variable reluctance transducer
   as the arm was moved through cycles of abduction and external rotation.
   Each arm was mounted once, and all 3 testing procedures were performed
   on each of the 8 specimens. Statistical analysis was completed using
   ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction.
   The bony tenodesis model placed higher strain on the biceps tendon than
   the soft tissue tenodesis (p = 0.025). Also, the bony tenodesis model
   increased the strain on the biceps tendon when compared to the native
   tendon (p = 0.031). In contrast, the soft tissue tenodesis did not
   significantly alter strain when compared to the native tendon (p =
   0.089).
   The soft tissue tenodesis procedure better maintained the native strain
   environment when compared to the bony tenodesis using an interference
   screw. Due to this closer approximation of native biceps tendon
   biomechanics, the soft tissue procedure may be more preferable
   clinically than the bony tenodesis.

Abstract = {{This article explores the history of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and

   describe the origin and history of ALD science in the 1960s and 1970s.
   They also report on how the science and technology of ALD progressed
   through the 1990s and 2000s and continues today. This article focuses on
   how ALD developed within the AVS and continues to evolve through
   interactions made possible by the AVS, in particular, the annual
   International AVS ALD Conference. This conference benefits students,
   academics, researchers, and industry practitioners alike who seek to
   understand the fundamentals of self-limiting, alternating binary surface
   reactions, and how they can be applied to form functional (and sometimes
   profitable) thin film materials. The flexible structure of the AVS
   allowed the AVS to quickly organize the ALD community and create a
   primary conference home. Many new research areas have grown out of the
   original concepts of ``Atomic Layer Epitaxy{''} and ``Molecular
   Layering,{''} and some of them are described in this article. The people
   and research in the ALD field continue to evolve, and the AVS ALD
   Conference is a primary example of how the AVS can help a field expand
   and flourish. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-46}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from six coniferous
   tree species, i.e. Pinus ponderosa (Ponderosa Pine), Picea pungens (Blue
   Spruce), Pseudotsuga menziesii (Rocky Mountain Douglas Fir) and Pinus
   longaeva (Bristlecone Pine), as well as from two deciduous species,
   Quercus gambelii (Gamble Oak) and Betula occidentalis (Western River
   Birch) were studied over a full annual growing cycle. Monoterpene (MT)
   and sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions rates were quantified in a total of
   1236 individual branch enclosure samples. MT dominated coniferous
   emissions, producing greater than 95\% of BVOC emissions. MT and SQT
   demonstrated short-term emission dependence with temperature. Two
   oxygenated MT, 1,8-cineol and piperitone, were both light and
   temperature dependent. Basal emission rates (BER, normalized to 1000 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1) and 30 degrees C) were generally higher in spring and
   summer than in winter; MT seasonal BER from the coniferous trees
   maximized between 1.5 and 6.0 mu g g(-1), h(-1), while seasonal lows
   were near 0.1 mu g g(-1) h(-1). The fractional contribution of
   individual MT to total emissions was found to fluctuate with season. SQT
   BER measured from the coniferous trees ranged from <0.01 to 0.15 mu g
   g(-1) h(-1). BER of up to 1.2 mu g g(-1) h(-1) of the SQT germacrene B
   were found from Q gambelii, peaking in late summer. The beta-factor,
   used to define temperature dependence in emissions modeling, was not
   found to exhibit discernible growth season trends. A seasonal correction
   factor proposed by others in previous work to account for a sinusoidal
   shaped emission pattern was applied to the data. Varying levels of
   agreement were found between the data and model results for the
   different plant species seasonal data sets using this correction.
   Consequently, the analyses on this extensive data set suggest that it is
   not feasible to apply a universal seasonal correction factor across
   different vegetation species. A modeling exercise comparing two case
   scenarios, (1) without and (2) with consideration of the seasonal
   changes in emission factors illustrated large deviations when emission
   factors are applied for other seasons than those in which they were
   experimentally determined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a rigid spacecraft with nonlinear delayed multiactuator
   feedback control are studied in this paper. It is assumed that the time
   delay occurs in one of the actuators, whereas the other actuator has a
   negligible time delay. Therefore, a nonlinear feedback controller using
   both delayed and nondelayed states is sought for the controlled system
   to have the desired linear delayed closed-loop dynamics using an inverse
   dynamics approach. The closed-loop stability is shown to be approximated
   by a second-order linear delay differential equation for the modified
   Rodriguez parameter attitude coordinates for which the
   Hsu-Bhatt-Vyshnegradskii stability chart can be used to choose the
   control gains that result in a stable closed-loop response. An
   analytical derivation of the boundaries of this chart for the case of no
   derivative feedback control is shown, whereas a numerical method is used
   to obtain the stability chart for the general case. Then, to achieve a
   specified performance, the criteria for a critically damped closed-loop
   response are studied. Further, an integral feedback control is also
   implemented, which is capable of eliminating the steady-state attitude
   error caused by any unmodeled external torque.}},

Abstract = {{Profiling phylogenetic marker genes, such as the 16S rRNA gene, is a key
   tool for studies of microbial communities but does not provide direct
   evidence of a community's functional capabilities. Here we describe
   PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of
   unobserved states), a computational approach to predict the functional
   composition of a metagenome using marker gene data and a database of
   reference genomes. PICRUSt uses an extended ancestral-state
   reconstruction algorithm to predict which gene families are present and
   then combines gene families to estimate the composite metagenome. Using
   16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human
   Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene
   families in host-associated and environmental communities, with
   quantifiable uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that phylogeny and
   function are sufficiently linked that this `predictive metagenomic'
   approach should provide useful insights into the thousands of
   uncultivated microbial communities for which only marker gene surveys
   are currently available.}},

Title = {{Improved understanding of physics processes in pedestal structure,

Journal = {{NUCLEAR FUSION}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Joint experiment/theory/modelling research has led to increased
   confidence in predictions of the pedestal height in ITER. This work was
   performed as part of a US Department of Energy Joint Research Target in
   FY11 to identify physics processes that control the H-mode pedestal
   structure. The study included experiments on C-Mod, DIII-D and NSTX as
   well as interpretation of experimental data with theory-based modelling
   codes. This work provides increased confidence in the ability of models
   for peeling-ballooning stability, bootstrap current, pedestal width and
   pedestal height scaling to make correct predictions, with some areas
   needing further work also being identified. A model for pedestal
   pressure height has made good predictions in existing machines for a
   range in pressure of a factor of 20. This provides a solid basis for
   predicting the maximum pedestal pressure height in ITER, which is found
   to be an extrapolation of a factor of 3 beyond the existing data set.
   Models were studied for a number of processes that are proposed to play
   a role in the pedestal n(e) and T-e profiles. These processes include
   neoclassical transport, paleoclassical transport, electron temperature
   gradient turbulence and neutral fuelling. All of these processes may be
   important, with the importance being dependent on the plasma regime.
   Studies with several electromagnetic gyrokinetic codes show that the
   gradients in and on top of the pedestal can drive a number of
   instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of 17 neuro-active pharmaceuticals and their major

   threo-hydrobupropion, carbamazepine,
   10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine,
   citalopram, N-desmethyl-citalopram, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine,
   gabapentin, lamotrigine, 2-N-glucuronide-lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine,
   venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine), were measured in treated
   wastewater and receiving surface waters from 24 locations across
   Minnesota, USA. The analysis of upstream and downstream sampling sites
   indicated that the wastewater treatment plants were the major source of
   the neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites in surface
   waters of Minnesota. Concentrations of parent compound and the
   associated metabolite varied substantially between treatment plants
   (concentrations +/- standard deviation of the parent compound relative
   to its major metabolite) as illustrated by the following examples;
   bupropion and hydrobupropion 700 +/- 1000 ng L-1, 2100 +/- 1700 ng L-1,
   carbamazepine and 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine 480 +/- 380 ng L-1, 360 +/-
   400 ng L-1, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine 1400 +/- 1300 ng
   L-1, 1800 +/- 2300 ng L-1. Metabolites of the neuro-active compounds
   were commonly found at higher or comparable concentrations to the parent
   compounds in wastewater effluent and the receiving surface water.
   Neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites were detected
   only sporadically in samples upstream from the effluent outfall.
   Metabolite to parent ratios were used to evaluate transformation, and we
   determined that ratios in wastewater were much lower than those reported
   in urine, indicating that the metabolites are relatively more labile
   than the parent compounds in the treatment plants and in receiving
   waters. The widespread occurrence of neuro-active pharmaceuticals and
   metabolites in Minnesota effluents and surface waters indicate that this
   is likely a global environmental issue, and further understanding of the
   environmental fate and impacts of these compounds is warranted.

Abstract = {{Characterization of the suction response and the soil water retention
   curve (SWRC) is important for geotechnical engineering applications and
   is a factor linking unsaturated soil mechanics with geotechnical
   practice. Therefore, a reliable and convenient method is needed to
   obtain parameters for models describing flow phenomena in unsaturated
   soils. Many SWRC measurement methods, including those using flow pump
   systems, have been developed. This paper describes the operation and
   limitations of an improved automated flow pump system for accurate SWRC
   measurement over drying and wetting cycles. We measured the transient
   suction response to obtain the SWRC using an equilibration method during
   both drying and wetting cycles. The system was successfully tested using
   a sand, a silt, and a silty sand. Characteristic curves for both drying
   and wetting cycles with proper flow rates were obtained within 1-3 weeks
   of testing. The proposed method is, therefore, very effective for
   routine application in engineering practice.}},

Abstract = {{Many nonlinear systems of practical interest evolve on Lie groups or on
   manifolds acted upon by Lie groups. Examples range from aircraft and
   underwater vehicles to quantum mechanical systems. In this paper, we
   develop an algorithm for solving continuous-time optimal control
   problems for systems evolving on (noncompact) Lie groups. This algorithm
   generalizes the projection operator approach for trajectory optimization
   originally developed for systems on vector spaces. Notions for
   generalizing system theoretic tools such as Riccati equations and linear
   and quadratic system approximations are developed. In this development,
   the covariant derivative of a map between two manifolds plays a key role
   in providing a chain rule for the required Lie group computations. An
   example optimal control problem on is provided to highlight
   implementation details and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The US Environmental Protection Agency air pollution monitoring data
   have been a valuable resource commonly used for investigating the
   associations between short-term exposures to PM2.5 chemical components
   and human health. However, the temporally sparse sampling on every third
   or sixth day may affect health effect estimation. We examined the impact
   of non-daily monitoring data on health effect estimates using daily data
   from the Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study. Daily
   concentrations of four PM2.5 chemical components (elemental and organic
   carbon, sulfate, and nitrate) and hospital admission counts from 2003
   through 2007 were used. Three every-third-day time series were created
   from the daily DASH monitoring data, imitating the US Speciation Trend
   Network (STN) monitoring schedule. A fourth, partly irregular,
   every-third-day time series was created by matching existing sampling
   days at a nearby STN monitor. Relative risks (RRs) of hospital
   admissions for PM2.5 components at lags 0-3 were estimated for each data
   set, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, longer term temporal
   trends, and day of week using generalized additive models, and compared
   across different sampling schedules. The estimated RRs varied somewhat
   between the non-daily and daily sampling schedules and between the four
   non-daily schedules, and in some instances could lead to different
   conclusions. It was not evident which features of the data or analysis
   were responsible for the variation in effect estimates, although seeing
   similar variability in resampled data sets with relaxation of the
   every-third-day constraint suggests that limited power may have had a
   role. The use of non-daily monitoring data can influence interpretation
   of estimated effects of PM2.5 components on hospital admissions in
   time-series studies.}},

Abstract = {{Rigid particles transported through a pinched-flow fractionation (PFF)
   device are simulated using boundary-integral methods (BIM). The PFF
   device separates particles by size using a bifurcated microfluidic

   achieve complete separation of large and small particles decreases with
   increasing diameter of the larger particles relative to the pinch
   height, and is nearly independent of the smaller particle size. A narrow
   pinch with a square exit was shown to have the lowest critical flow
   ratio and was selected as the model device to be fabricated. Experiments
   conducted using this device confirm that the larger particles exit
   further from the top wall than do the smaller particles, due to steric
   exclusion, and the final exit positions are within a few percent of the
   simulation results. It is shown that BIM is a valuable tool in the
   design of microfluidic devices. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{1101-1108}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Micromembrane-enhanced evaporating surfaces were developed to enhance
   capillary evaporation heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat
   flux (CHF). Micromembranes made of sintered single-layer copper mesh
   screen were diffusion bonded on microchannels to effectively promote
   capillary pressure and reduce flow resistance. Compared with mono-porous
   evaporating surfaces such as microchannels and copper woven mesh
   laminates in the same thickness under the similar working conditions,
   CHF was substantially increased by 83\% and 198\%, respectively, because
   of the separation of the capillary pressure generation and fluid
   transport process that was enabled by the micromembrane. The major
   features such as ``M{''}-shaped capillary evaporation heat transfer
   curves and the associated heat transfer regions were identified.
   Oscillating flows induced by the bubble growth and collapse as well as
   the capillary flows induced by the receding menisci were observed and
   believed to play imperative roles in enhancing the heat transfer by
   inducing advections and improving evaporation and nucleate boiling. (C)

Title = {{Towards comprehensive syntactic and semantic annotations of the clinical

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{922-930}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To create annotated clinical narratives with layers of syntactic and
   semantic labels to facilitate advances in clinical natural language
   processing (NLP). To develop NLP algorithms and open source components.
   Methods
   Manual annotation of a clinical narrative corpus of 127606 tokens
   following the Treebank schema for syntactic information, PropBank schema
   for predicate-argument structures, and the Unified Medical Language
   System (UMLS) schema for semantic information. NLP components were
   developed.
   Results
   The final corpus consists of 13091 sentences containing 1772 distinct
   predicate lemmas. Of the 766 newly created PropBank frames, 74 are
   verbs. There are 28539 named entity (NE) annotations spread over 15 UMLS
   semantic groups, one UMLS semantic type, and the Person semantic
   category. The most frequent annotations belong to the UMLS semantic
   groups of Procedures (15.71\%), Disorders (14.74\%), Concepts and Ideas
   (15.10\%), Anatomy (12.80\%), Chemicals and Drugs (7.49\%), and the UMLS
   semantic type of Sign or Symptom (12.46\%). Inter-annotator agreement
   results: Treebank (0.926), PropBank (0.891-0.931), NE (0.697-0.750). The
   part-of-speech tagger, constituency parser, dependency parser, and
   semantic role labeler are built from the corpus and released open
   source. A significant limitation uncovered by this project is the need
   for the NLP community to develop a widely agreed-upon schema for the
   annotation of clinical concepts and their relations.
   Conclusions
   This project takes a foundational step towards bringing the field of
   clinical NLP up to par with NLP in the general domain. The corpus
   creation and NLP components provide a resource for research and
   application development that would have been previously impossible.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1125-1134}},

Abstract = {{The construction industry employs approximately 6\% of all U.S. workers
   but accounts for over 16\% of all occupational fatalities. Recent
   statistics indicate that over 40\% of all U.S. construction laborers
   cannot speak English proficiently. To ensure strong safety performance,
   it is vital to include every individual in a construction crew in
   safety-related communications, regardless of language proficiency.
   Considering that most safety communication is delivered in English, it
   is not surprising that Spanish-speaking construction workers are fatally
   injured at a disproportionate rate. To conduct the first exploration of
   the characteristics of strong, multilingual safety networks in the
   Denver Metropolitan region of the United States, a multilingual research
   team conducted interviews with the members of 14 construction crews.
   Demographic attribute data for each individual (e.g.,language
   proficiency, years of experience, position in the company) and network
   data were collected to analyze the safety communication network for each
   crew. The units of analysis included the individual actors in the
   network and the networks as a whole. The exploratory results contribute
   to the body of knowledge by revealing that unilingual work crews have
   safety performance that is 51\% better than multilingual work crews (),
   bilingual workers play a more central role than unilingual workers when
   more than one language is spoken (), workers less than 35years of age
   have a higher degree of centrality than do workers who are older than
   35years old (), and managers play an important role in the exchange and
   diffusion of safety knowledge regardless of language proficiency ().
   Most importantly, social-network analysis metrics show that these
   language-boundary spanners often form the core of a network that
   connects disparate groups of individuals. By contrast, crews with
   relatively weak safety performance tend to have clear and disparate
   subnetworks distinguished by language and high turnover rates. Such
   characteristics are of concern because individual actors are not able to
   effectively warn one another of uncontrolled hazardous exposures or work
   in transition.}},

Abstract = {{Wheel-driven mobile in vivo robotic devices can provide an unconstrained
   platform for visualization and task performance. Careful understanding
   of the wheel-tissue interaction is necessary to predict in vivo
   performance of medical mobility systems. Here, an analytical study of
   the friction involving rolling contact of a surgical wheel, moving at
   constant velocities over soft tissue, is presented and verified. A
   quasi-static frictionless solution is first derived from existing
   theory, and newly developed theory considering frictional effects is
   later introduced. In this analysis, the effect of friction on wheel
   mobility over a viscoelastic substrate is analyzed with wheel velocity
   as the only changing variable. The analytical model is later verified by
   experiments and Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. A simple
   application of this model to help design a surgical robot is also
   presented. Additional results indicate that the resistance force, which
   arises from the tissue viscosity, approaches zero for small and very
   large wheel velocities. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A nonlinear control loop mapping has previously been designed for
   mitigating the dead zone of a noninverting buck-boost converter while
   minimizing state variable perturbation. This paper derives a new
   nonlinearity that enables a converter with fixed switching frequency to
   achieve reduced switching loss as though operating at an effective
   switching frequency lower than the actual. The new control loop
   nonlinearity accomplishes this by interleaving a specified fraction of
   pass-through and nonpass-through switching periods. The derived
   nonlinearity also reduces the increase in waveform ripple associated
   with a switching frequency reduction. Through adapting the effective
   switching frequency across the full range of conversion ratios and
   loads, reductions in loss up to 58\% are realized.}},

Abstract = {{An amino acid possessing a maleimide side chain was developed and
   synthesized in good yield. With a propensity to undergo the Michael
   addition reaction, the creation of a maleimide amino acid derivative was
   targeted for use as a highly functional tool for enabling peptide
   conjugation and structural modifications. After addressing the inherent
   potential side reactions of maleimides during solid phase peptide
   synthesis, the ability to incorporate the maleimide amino acid in an
   RGDS peptide sequence was demonstrated. H-1 NMR and mass spectroscopic
   techniques enabled thorough characterization of the peptide sequence,
   confirming the presence of the maleimide functionality. Once
   characterized, the ability to use the maleimide moiety as a peptide
   modification tool was investigated. Specifically, it was shown that the
   maleimide functional group could be exploited, given the proper reaction
   conditions, to anchor a peptide to a surface and create a cyclic
   conformation from a linear sequence. Furthermore, bioactivity of the
   peptide containing maleimide amino acid was evaluated by studying
   cellular interactions with surfaces functionalized with an integrin
   binding sequence.}},

Title = {{The effect of spatial variability on the sensitivity of passive
   microwave measurements to snow water equivalent}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{163-179}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Passive microwave (PM) remote sensing measurements are routinely
   utilized to estimate snow depth and water equivalent (SWE). Both
   vegetation and physical snowpack variables including snowpack grain
   size, snow depth, and stratigraphy influence the observed brightness
   temperature. The natural heterogeneity of snowpack and vegetation states
   within the microwave footprint occurs at spatial scales shorter than PM
   observation scales. In this study, we analyze the relationship between
   PM brightness temperature measurements and the heterogeneity of snowpack
   and vegetation. Specifically, we explore the question of whether PM
   observations are sensitive to changes in snow depth even given sub-pixel
   variability in snow and vegetation. To examine this question, densely
   sampled, spatially distributed in situ snow properties from multiple
   study areas made during the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX)
   are employed in a forward modeling scheme to study the effect of highly
   variable snow and vegetation properties on the observed PM measurement.
   In all test cases, this study finds that there exists sensitivity of
   microwave brightness temperature (T-b) to total snow depth contained
   within the measurement footprint, regardless of the heterogeneous nature
   of snow pack properties. Across three study areas, T-b decreases by
   23-35 K as depth increased up to the signal saturation depth, which
   ranged from 70 to 120 cm. With regard to vegetation sensitivity, forest
   fractions (F) as little as 0.2 can modify the PM measurement by up to 10
   K, and F greater than 0.6 mask virtually all of the microwave signal
   attributable to snow. Finally, with respect to the measurement scale,
   our results indicate that the scale at which the PM measurement is made
   does not affect the sensitivity of the T-b to mean snow depth, to the
   scale (1 km) examined herein. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The utility of airborne scanning LiDAR data to estimate solar direct
   beam canopy transmittance in complex, forested terrain was evaluated.
   Twenty-four hemispherical photos were used to produce ground-based
   estimates of solar direct beam canopy transmittance. The photo estimates
   were used to develop and evaluate two spatially distributed canopy
   transmittance models: 1) a Beer's Law-type transmittance model based on
   LiDAR-derived canopy metrics, and 2) a solar raytrace model applied to a
   three-dimensional canopy model. The models were used to estimate solar
   direct beam canopy transmittance at five-minute resolution for all days
   between the winter and summer solstices over an 800 m by 700 m domain at
   1 m horizontal grid spacing. When compared to estimates from
   hemispherical photos, the raytrace model resolved the complex seasonal
   and diurnal variability of solar direct beam canopy transmittance
   resulting from individual trees and localized canopy structure. The
   Beer's-type model was unable to resolve these detailed factors. The two
   models exhibited similar and relatively low normalized daily mean error
   values from December to early March. Later in the season (01 March-21
   June), the model differences were pronounced; the daily mean and
   standard deviation of the error values for the Beer's-type and raytrace
   models were 13\% +/- 10\% and 8\% +/- 6\%, respectively. The results
   confirm previously known limitations of Beer's Law when used to estimate
   sub-canopy solar beam irradiance under heterogeneous canopy conditions.
   Averaged over the spatial domain, the Beer's-type model estimated 21\%
   and 48\% lower canopy transmittance than the raytrace model on 01 March
   and 03 May, respectively. The Beer's-type model was unable to represent
   the seasonal increase in areal average canopy transmission contributed
   from small canopy gaps. Finally, both distributed models were used to
   simulate the cumulative solar beam irradiance during the 2010 snowmelt
   season. The raytrace model was shown to capture a high level of
   variability necessary to simulate explicit stand-scale solar irradiance
   that strongly influences spatiotemporal patterns of snowmelt, soil water
   availability, and the partition and exchange of energy within
   heterogeneous forest ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   in-plane rigidity to reduce the rate of microbubble dissolution, while
   holding constant the microbubble size, concentration and surface
   architecture. We first estimated the impact of acyl chain length of the
   main diacyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid and inter-lipid distance on
   the cohesive surface energy and, based on these results, we hypothesized
   that microbubble stability and in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence
   would increase monotonically with increasing acyl chain length. We
   therefore measured microbubble in vitro stability to dilution with and
   without ultrasound exposure, as well as in vivo ultrasound contrast
   persistence. All measurements showed a sharp rise in stability between
   DPPC (C16:0) and DSPC (C18:0), which correlates to the wrinkling
   transition, signaling the onset of significant surface shear and gas
   permeation resistance, observed in prior single-bubble dissolution
   studies. Further evidence for the effect of the wrinkling transition
   came from an in vitro and in vivo stability comparison of microbubbles
   coated with pure DPPC with those of lung surfactant extract. Microbubble
   stability against dilution without ultrasound and in vivo ultrasound
   contrast persistence showed a monotonic increase with acyl chain length
   from DSPC to DBPC (C22:0). However, we also observed that stability
   dropped precipitously for all measurements on further increasing lipid
   acyl chain length from DBPC to DLiPC (C24:0). This result suggests that
   hydrophobic mismatch between the main PC lipid and the lipopolymer
   emulsifier, DSPE-PEG5000, may drive a less stable surface
   microstructure. Overall, these results support our general hypothesis of
   the role of in-plane rigidity for increasing the lifetime of microbubble
   circulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work advances bottom-up design of bioinspired materials built from
   peptide-amphiphiles, which are a class of bioconjugates in which a
   biofunctional peptide is covalently attached to a hydrophobic moiety
   that drives self-assembly in aqueous solution. Specifically, this work
   highlights the importance of peptide contour length in determining the
   equilibrium secondary structure of the peptide as well as the
   self-assembled (i.e., micelle) geometry. Peptides used here repeat a
   seven-amino acid sequence between one and four times to vary peptide
   contour length while maintaining similar peptide-peptide interactions.
   Without a hydrophobic tail, these peptides all exhibit a combination of
   random coil and -helical structure. Upon self-assembly in the crowded
   environment of a micellar corona, however, short peptides are prone to
   -sheet structure and cylindrical micelle geometry while longer peptides
   remain helical in spheroidal micelles. The transition to -sheets in
   short peptides is rapid, whereby amphiphiles first self-assemble with
   -helical peptide structure, then transition to their equilibrium -sheet
   structure at a rate that depends on both temperature and ionic strength.
   These results identify peptide contour length as an important control
   over equilibrium peptide secondary structure and micelle geometry.
   Furthermore, the time-dependent nature of the helix-to-sheet transition
   opens the door for shape-changing bioinspired materials with tunable
   conversion rates. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 99:

Abstract = {{For the last decade, it has been known that reflected GPS signals
   observed with specialized instruments could be used to measure sea
   level. In this letter, data from an existing geodetic-quality GPS site
   near Kachemak Bay, Alaska, are analyzed for a one-year time period.
   Daily sea-level variations are more than 7 m. Tidal coefficients have
   been estimated and compared with coefficients estimated from records
   from a traditional tide gauge at Seldovia Harbor, similar to 30 km away.
   The GPS and Seldovia estimates of M-2 and S-2 coefficients agree to
   better than 2\%; much of this residual can be attributed to true
   differences in the tide over 30 km as it propagates up Kachemak Bay. For
   daily mean sea levels the agreement is 2.3 cm. Because a standard
   geodetic GPS receiver/antenna is used, this GPS instrument can measure
   long-term sea-level changes in a stable terrestrial reference frame.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium alkoxide films known as ``titanicones{''} were grown using
   molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques using the sequential
   exposure of TiCl4 and glycerol. These titanicone MLD films were then
   pyrolyzed under argon to yield conducting TiO2/carbon composite films.
   The Raman spectra of the pyrolyzed titanicone films revealed the
   characteristic ``D{''} and ``G{''} peaks associated with sp(2)-graphitic
   carbon. X-ray diffraction analysis of the pyrolyzed titanicone films
   displayed the signatures for anatase and rutile TiO2 after heating to
   600 degrees C and then only ruble TiO2 after heating to 900 degrees C.
   X-ray photoelectron depth profiling of the pyrolyzed titanicone films
   showed that the carbon was distributed throughout the film and began to
   segregate to the surface after heating to 900 degrees C. The sheet
   resistance of the pyrolyzed titanicone films dropped dramatically versus
   pyrolysis temperature and reached a minimum sheet resistance of 2.2 x
   10(4) Omega/square after heating to 800 degrees C. On the basis of the
   measured film thickness of 88 nm, the resistivity of the pyrolyzed
   titanicone film after heating to 800 degrees C was rho = 0.19 Omega cm.
   Segregation of other hybrid organic-inorganic films into sp(2)-graphitic
   carbon and metal oxide domains after pyrolysis under argon was also
   observed for alucone films and various metalcone films based on Zn, Zr,
   Hf, and Mn. The conducting TiO2/carbon composite films and other metal
   oxide/carbon composite films could have important electrochemical
   applications as electrodes for Li ion batteries or pseudocapacitance
   supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{As an important step in further modeling and understanding the global
   electric circuit, the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) has been
   extended to provide a calculation of conductivity in the troposphere and
   stratosphere. Conductivity depends on ion mobility and ion
   concentration, the latter being controlled by a number of ion production
   and loss processes. This leads to a complex dependency of conductivity
   on most importantly galactic cosmic ray flux, radon emissions from the
   Earth's surface, aerosol number concentrations, clouds, and temperature.
   To cover this variety in parameters for calculating and evaluating
   conductivity, an Earth system model is extremely useful. Here the
   extension of CESM1 to calculate conductivity is described, and the
   results are discussed with a focus on their spatial and temporal
   variabilities. The results are also compared to balloon and aircraft
   measurements, and good agreement is found for undisturbed conditions and
   during a solar proton event. The conductivity model implementation is a
   significant improvement to previous studies because of the high-quality,
   high-resolution model data input. Notably, the aerosol representation
   provided by off-line calculations of tropospheric and stratospheric
   aerosol using the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres
   as part of CESM1(WACCM) (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model)
   provides a realistic computation of the impact of the background aerosol
   distribution for the first time. In addition to the novel
   high-resolution information on conductivity, it is found that an
   intra-annual cycle exists in the total global resistance, varying
   between 220 and 245. The model shows that this cycle is driven equally
   by seasonal aerosol and cloud variations.}},

Abstract = {{Organic aerosols (OA) in Pasadena are characterized using multiple
   measurements from the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality
   and Climate Change (CalNex) campaign. Five OA components are identified
   using positive matrix factorization including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA)
   and two types of oxygenated OA (OOA). The Pasadena OA elemental
   composition when plotted as H:C versus O:C follows a line less steep
   than that observed for Riverside, CA. The OOA components from both
   locations follow a common line, however, indicating similar secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA) oxidation chemistry at the two sites such as
   fragmentation reactions leading to acid formation. In addition to the
   similar evolution of elemental composition, the dependence of SOA
   concentration on photochemical age displays quantitatively the same
   trends across several North American urban sites. First, the OA/CO
   values for Pasadena increase with photochemical age exhibiting a slope
   identical to or slightly higher than those for Mexico City and the
   northeastern United States. Second, the ratios of OOA to odd-oxygen (a
   photochemical oxidation marker) for Pasadena, Mexico City, and Riverside
   are similar, suggesting a proportional relationship between SOA and
   odd-oxygen formation rates. Weekly cycles of the OA components are
   examined as well. HOA exhibits lower concentrations on Sundays versus
   weekdays, and the decrease in HOA matches that predicted for primary
   vehicle emissions using fuel sales data, traffic counts, and vehicle
   emission ratios. OOA does not display a weekly cycleafter accounting for
   differences in photochemical aging which suggests the dominance of
   gasoline emissions in SOA formation under the assumption that most urban
   SOA precursors are from motor vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous N2O5 uptake onto aerosol is the primary nocturnal path for
   removal of NOx (= NO+NO2) from the atmosphere and can also result in
   halogen activation through production of ClNO2. The N2O5 uptake
   coefficient has been the subject of numerous laboratory studies;
   however, only a few studies have determined the uptake coefficient from
   ambient measurements, and none has been focused on winter conditions,
   when the portion of NOx removed by N2O5 uptake is the largest. In this
   work, N2O5 uptake coefficients are determined from ambient wintertime
   measurements of N2O5 and related species at the Boulder Atmospheric
   Observatory in Weld County, CO, a location that is highly impacted by
   urban pollution from Denver, as well as emissions from agricultural
   activities and oil and gas extraction. A box model is used to analyze
   the nocturnal nitrate radical chemistry and predict the N2O5
   concentration. The uptake coefficient in the model is iterated until the
   predicted N2O5 concentration matches the measured concentration. The
   results suggest that during winter, the most important influence that
   might suppress N2O5 uptake is aerosol nitrate but that this effect does
   not suppress uptake coefficients enough to limit the rate of NOx loss
   through N2O5 hydrolysis. N2O5 hydrolysis was found to dominate the
   nocturnal chemistry during this study consuming similar to 80\% of
   nocturnal gas phase nitrate radical production. Typically, less than
   15\% of the total nitrate radical production remained in the form of
   nocturnal species at sunrise when they are photolyzed and reform NO2.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Using an extended set of equations of state and a multiple-group
   multiple-code collaborative effort to generate waveforms, we improve
   numerical-relativity-based data-analysis estimates of the measurability
   of matter effects in neutron-star binaries. We vary two parameters of a
   parametrized piecewise-polytropic equation of state (EOS) to analyze the
   measurability of EOS properties, via a parameter Lambda that
   characterizes the quadrupole deformability of an isolated neutron star.
   We find that, to within the accuracy of the simulations, the departure
   of the waveform from point-particle (or spinless double black-hole
   binary) inspiral increases monotonically with Lambda and changes in the
   EOS that did not change Lambda are not measurable. We estimate with two
   methods the minimal and expected measurability of Lambda in second- and
   third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. The first estimate using
   numerical waveforms alone shows that two EOSs which vary in radius by
   1.3 km are distinguishable in mergers at 100 Mpc. The second estimate
   relies on the construction of hybrid waveforms by matching to
   post-Newtonian inspiral and estimates that the same EOSs are
   distinguishable in mergers at 300 Mpc. We calculate systematic errors
   arising from numerical uncertainties and hybrid construction, and we
   estimate the frequency at which such effects would interfere with
   template-based searches.}},

Title = {{Spectra and ratios of identified particles in Au plus Au and d plus Au

Abstract = {{The transverse momentum (p(T)) spectra and ratios of identified charged
   hadrons (pi(+/-), K-+/-, p, (p) over bar) produced in root s(NN) = 200
   GeV Au + Au and d + Au collisions are reported in five different
   centrality classes for each collision species. The measurements of pions
   and protons are reported up to p(T) = 6 GeV/c (5 GeV/c), and the
   measurements of kaons are reported up to p(T) = 4 GeV/c (3.5 GeV/c) in
   Au + Au (d + Au) collisions. In the intermediate p(T) region, between 2
   and 5 GeV/c, a significant enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios
   compared to those measured in p + p collisions is observed. This
   enhancement is present in both Au + Au and d + Au collisions and
   increases as the collisions become more central. We compare a class of
   peripheral Au + Au collisions with a class of central d + Au collisions
   which have a comparable number of participating nucleons and binary
   nucleon-nucleon collisions. The p(T)-dependent particle ratios for these
   classes display a remarkable similarity, which is then discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The cause of warming in the Southern Hemisphere during the most recent
   deglaciation remains a matter of debate(1,2). Hypotheses for a Northern
   Hemisphere trigger, through oceanic redistributions of heat, are based
   in part on the abrupt onset of warming seen in East Antarctic ice cores
   and dated to 18,000 years ago, which is several thousand years after
   high-latitude Northern Hemisphere summer insolation intensity began
   increasing from its minimum, approximately 24,000 years ago(3,4). An
   alternative explanation is that local solar insolation changes cause the
   Southern Hemisphere to warm independently(2,5). Here we present results
   from a new, annually resolved ice-core record from West Antarctica that
   reconciles these two views. The records show that 18,000 years ago snow
   accumulation in West Antarctica began increasing, coincident with
   increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, warming in East Antarctica and
   cooling in the Northern Hemisphere(6) associated with an abrupt decrease
   in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(7). However, significant
   warming in West Antarctica began at least 2,000 years earlier.
   Circum-Antarctic sea-ice decline, driven by increasing local insolation,
   is the likely cause of this warming. The marine-influenced West
   Antarctic records suggest a more active role for the Southern Ocean in
   the onset of deglaciation than is inferred from ice cores in the East
   Antarctic interior, which are largely isolated from sea-ice changes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the preparation of poly(sodium acrylate) (PSA)
   cryogels decorated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for point-of-use
   (POU) water disinfection. The PSA/Ag cryogels combine the high porosity,
   excellent mechanical and water absorption properties of cryogels, and
   uniform dispersion of fine AgNPs on the cryogel pore surface for rapid
   disinfection with minimal Ag release (<100 mu g L-1). They were used in
   a process that employed their ability to absorb water, which
   subsequently could be released via application of mild pressure. Their
   antibacterial performance was evaluated based on the disinfection
   efficacies of E. coli and B. subtilis. The PSA/Ag cryogels had excellent
   disinfection efficacies showing close to a 3 log reduction of viable
   bacteria after a brief 15 s contact time. They were highly reusable as
   there was no significant difference in the disinfection efficacies over
   five cycles of operation. The biocidal action of the PSA/Ag cryogels is
   believed to be dominated by surface-controlled mechanisms that are
   dependent on direct contact of the interface of PSA/Ag cryogels with the
   bacterial cells. The PSA/Ag cryogels are thought to offer a simpler
   approach for drinking water disinfection in disaster relief
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Remarkable reduction in thermal conductivity, by similar to 2 orders of
   magnitude compared to the bulk counterpart, is observed in a
   metal-semiconductor nanocomposite consisting of silver (Ag) and silicon
   (Si) nanostructures. The variation of thermal conductivity with
   temperature and with volume fraction of metallic inclusion exhibits
   counter-intuitive behavior. Contrary to bulk composites, thermal
   conductivity decreases with the increase in the volume fraction of Ag
   nanocrystals (at least till 0.067 experimented) and increases with
   temperature over the range of 303-473 K. This remarkable reduction in
   the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite is due to the interplay of
   size-dependent reduction in thermal conductivity of the individual
   nanostructures, increased contribution of phonon scattering at the
   interfaces between nanoparticles, and electron-phonon coupling inside
   metallic nanocrystals and across metal-semiconductor interface. Such
   hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures with reduced thermal
   conductivity offer immense potential for developing high efficiency
   thermoelectric materials. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is a chlorine atom source and reactive nitrogen
   reservoir formed during the night by heterogeneous reactions of
   dinitrogen pentoxide on chloride-containing aerosol particles. The main
   factors that influence ClNO2 production include nitrogen oxides, ozone,
   aerosol surface area, soluble chloride, and ambient relative humidity.
   Regions with strong anthropogenic activity therefore have large ClNO2
   formation potential even inland of coastal regions due to transport or
   local emissions of soluble chloride. As part of the Nitrogen, Aerosol
   Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower field study, we report
   wintertime vertically resolved ClNO2 and molecular chlorine (Cl-2)
   measurements taken on a 300 m tall tower located at NOAA's Boulder
   Atmospheric Observatory in Weld County, CO, during February and March of
   2011. Gas and particle phase measurements aboard the tower carriage
   allowed for a detailed description of the chemical state of the
   nocturnal atmosphere as a function of height. These observations show
   significant vertical structure in ClNO2 and Cl-2 mixing ratios that
   undergo dynamic changes over the course of a night. Using these
   measurements, we focus on two distinct combustion plume events where
   ClNO2 mixing ratios reached 600 and 1300 parts per trillion by volume,
   respectively, aloft of the nocturnal surface layer. We infer ClNO2
   yields from N2O5-aerosol reactions using both observational constraints
   and box modeling. The derived yields in these plumes suggest efficient
   ClNO2 production compared to the campaign average, where in-plume yields
   range from 0.3 to 1; the campaign average yield in the boundary layer is
   0.05 +/- 0.15, with substantial night-to-night and within night
   variability similar to previous measurements in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous and common-volume observations of Fe density, Na density,
   and temperatures in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere were made for
   12 nights with an Fe Boltzmann lidar and a Na Doppler lidar at the Table
   Mountain Lidar Facility (40.13 degrees N, 105.24 degrees W) near
   Boulder, Colorado, in August and September 2010. We derive the
   correlations among temporal variations of Fe/Na densities and
   temperatures, eliminating the covariance bias via computing the cross
   correlations between Fe (Na) density and Na (Fe) temperature
   perturbations. The Fe-Na density correlation is positive below the Fe
   layer peak and above the Na peak where the Fe/Na density gradients have
   the same signs but becomes negative in between the Fe and Na peaks where
   the gradients are opposite. The large correlation between temperature
   and density fluctuations is positive on the layer bottomside but
   negative on the topside with the transitions occurring near the layer
   peaks. The relative Fe/Na variances reach minimum near the layer peaks
   but rapidly increase and exceed the relative temperature variance
   significantly toward edges. These observations can be largely reproduced
   by theoretically modeling the metal layer responses to the wave-induced
   perturbations only through dynamic processes with a Gaussian stationary
   density distribution. These results suggest that the dynamic effects
   (mainly the vertical displacement) induced by gravity waves or tides
   dominate the observed short-term density and temperature variations over
   a night. We explain the Fe/Na gradient difference observed at the
   bottomside via the chemical shelf around 80km for reactive chemicals and
   the Fe/Na layer height difference.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-crustal earthquakes have been observed sporadically for similar to
   40 years in the central South Island of New Zealand. We report on 20
   events recorded between December 2008 and February 2012 near the Alpine
   Fault in the continental collision zone between the Australian and
   Pacific plates. A subset of 18 events at depths of 47-74 km occurs south
   of Mt. Cook and together with recently reported tremor locations
   indicates along-strike variations in deformation behaviour along the
   plate boundary. The sub-crustal earthquakes south of Mt. Cook increase
   in depth, frequency and size southwards towards the Puysegur subduction
   zone. Focal mechanisms could be determined for 14 earthquakes and
   exhibit predominantly strike-slip and reverse faulting solutions. Stress
   inversion analysis of the focal mechanisms yields a stress field
   favouring oblique-reverse faulting. We interpret the geographic and
   vertical distributions of these sub-crustal events in relation to a
   previously proposed tectonic model of a remnant passive margin that
   formed south of New Zealand in the Eocene and was overridden when
   dextral strike-slip motion initiated on the Alpine Fault. We infer that
   sub-crustal earthquakes occur along the leading edge of this structure,
   which is attached to the continental Australian crust. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The interaction of molecular excitons in organic thin films with surface
   plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in nanostructured metal electrodes represents
   a unique opportunity for enhancing the properties of the active layer of

   dianhydride (PTCDA) and SPP modes in silver grating nanostructures.
   Molecular and SPP absorption peaks exhibit avoided crossings in
   angle-dependent reflectivity experiments, which are verified by
   electromagnetic-field simulations of the PTCDA-grating structure.
   Photoluminescence measurements indicate that the radiative decay of the
   CTE is enhanced. Besides energetic resonance, selective coupling between
   the SPP and the exciton in this unique case may be aided by the oriented
   nature of PTCDA into 1-D ``molecular stacks{''} as well as the
   delocalized nature of the CTE.}},

Abstract = {{Space-based optical sensors for space situational awareness allow for

   Multiple measurements must be combined in order to obtain a full state

   the direct Bayesian admissible region method is applied to space-based
   observations. Simulation results for both a low-Earth (LEO) and
   geosynchronous orbit (GEO) observer are shown. For the former, the
   proposed method successfully associates 101 observations of 8
   Earth-orbiting objects taken over the span of 48 h. For the latter, lack
   of relative motion is identified as a key difficulty in the association
   process. This problem can be remediated by improved observation

   the number of random inputs. The construction of the separated
   representation is achieved via a regularized alternating least-squares
   regression, together with an error indicator to estimate model
   parameters. The computational complexity of such a construction is
   quadratic in the number of random inputs. The performance of the method
   is investigated through its application to three numerical examples

Abstract = {{The effective thermal conductivity models for particulate composites are
   usually restricted to the dilute limit, with volumetric concentrations
   of particles typically less than 15\%. By considering the particle
   interactions through a crowding factor, in this work, a new formula is
   developed to describe the thermal conductivity of composites with a
   dielectric matrix, for volume fractions of particles up to their maximum
   packing fraction. The crowding factor model is then applied to analyze
   two particulate composites with dielectric or metallic particles, where
   the effects of both interfacial thermal resistance and the
   electron-phonon coupling are taken into account. It is shown that the
   predictions of the proposed crowding factor model are larger than the
   ones predicted by the dilute-limit models, for composites with high
   volume fractions of particles, due to the particle interactions. The
   proposed crowding factor model extends the applicability of various
   thermal conductivity models for composites reported in the literature
   and its predictions are in good agreement with published experimental
   data. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond their traditional role of wrapping DNA, histones display
   antibacterial activity to Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. To
   identify bacterial components that allow survival to a histone
   challenge, we selected resistant bacteria from homologous Escherichia
   coli libraries that harbor plasmids carrying pieces of the chromosome in
   different sizes. We identified genes required for exopolysaccharide
   production and for the synthesis of the polysaccharide domain of the
   lipopolysaccharide, called O-antigen. Indeed, O-antigen and
   exopolysaccharide conferred further resistance to histones. Notably,
   O-antigen also conferred resistance to histones in the pathogens
   Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella pneumoniae.}},

Title = {{Inclusive cross section and single transverse spin asymmetry for very
   forward neutron production in polarized p plus p collisions at root
   s=200 GeV}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{The energy dependence of the single-transverse-spin asymmetry, A(N), and
   the cross section for neutron production at very forward angles were
   measured in the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
   for polarized p + p collisions at root s = 200 GeV. The neutrons were
   observed in forward detectors covering an angular range of up to 2.2
   mrad. We report results for neutrons with a momentum fraction of x(F) =
   0.45 to 1.0. The energy dependence of the measured cross sections were
   consistent with x(F) scaling, compared to measurements by an experiment
   at the Intersecting Storage Ring, which measured neutron production in
   unpolarized p + p collisions at root s = 30.6-62.7 GeV. The cross
   sections for large x(F) neutron production for p + p collisions, as well
   as those in e + p collisions measured at the Hadron-Electron Ring
   Accelerator, are described by a pion exchange mechanism. The observed
   forward neutron asymmetries were large, reaching A(N) = -0.08 +/- 0.02
   for x(F) = 0.8; the measured backward asymmetries, for negative x(F),
   were consistent with zero. The observed asymmetry for forward neutron
   production is discussed within the pion exchange framework, with
   interference between the spin-flip amplitude due to the pion exchange
   and nonflip amplitudes from all Reggeon exchanges. Within the pion
   exchange description, the measured neutron asymmetry is sensitive to the
   contribution of other Reggeon exchanges even for small amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{We perform ab initio calculations of hydrogen-based tunneling defects in
   alumina to identify deleterious two-level systems (TLS) in
   superconducting qubits. The defects analyzed include bulk hydrogenated
   Al vacancies, bulk hydrogen interstitial defects, and a surface OH
   rotor. The formation energies of the defects are first computed for an
   Al- and O-rich environment to give the likelihood of defect occurrence
   during growth. The potential energy surfaces are then computed and the
   corresponding dipole moments are evaluated to determine the coupling of
   the defects to an electric field. Finally, the tunneling energy is
   computed for the hydrogen defect and the analogous deuterium defect,
   providing an estimate of the TLS energy and the corresponding frequency
   for photon absorption. We predict that hydrogenated cation vacancy
   defects will form a significant density of GHz frequency TLSs in
   alumina.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient membrane fractionation of small, neutral organics from
   electrolytes could improve the sustainability of biofuel production from
   microorganisms, but the separations achieved are often insufficient. To
   rationally develop improved membrane materials for these fractionations,
   we need to better understand the mechanisms that govern solute transport
   through different types of materials. To this end, we have studied the
   transport properties of a variety of commercially available (that belong
   to major classes of polymeric materials) and some newly synthesized
   membranes. We determined that membranes belonging to a particular class
   have signature transport properties for example, fully aromatic
   polyamides (FA-PA) are slightly more permeable to glycerol than NaCl,
   while the converse is true for semiaromatic polyamides (SA-PA)-although
   all glycerol/NaCl separation factors are near unity. Selected membranes
   were further probed with different reduced-carbon/electrolyte
   combinations. The cellulose acetate (CA) membrane achieved the greatest
   separation between ethanol and electrolyte (NaCl, LiCl, Na2SO4), and the
   SA-PA membranes are better at fractionating larger reduced-carbons
   (glucose and sucrose) from the monovalent electrolytes. Meanwhile, an
   order-of-magnitude improvement in separation factor was found for the
   challenging glycerol/electrolyte fractionation with the SA-PA membranes
   when a divalent anion is used. The main transport mechanisms are
   interpreted based on Donnan exclusion and thermally activated transport
   through the polymer. The CA and FA-PA membranes appear to separate
   electrolytes through a predominantly steric-based mechanism, while the
   SA-PA membranes are more sensitive to anion valency. Furthermore, while
   solute size clearly plays a role in determining neutral solute
   transport, the relative roles of solubility (i.e., polymer-permeant
   interactions) versus polymer free-volume in the transport of small
   organics through the different materials remain unclear.}},

Pages = {{8179-8186}},

Abstract = {{Singlet oxygen (102) plays an important role in the inactivation of
   pathogens and the degradation of organic contaminants. The present study
   looks at the surface steady-state concentration of O-1(2) and quantum
   yields (Phi(so)) for organic matter present in or derived from
   wastewater (WVVOM), including those that are partially treated and after
   undergoing oxidation. The surface steady state concentrations of O-1(2)
   ranged from 1.23 to 1.43 x 10(-13) M for bulk wastewaters under
   simulated sunlight. The Phi(so) values for these samples varied from
   2.8\% to 4.7\% which was higher than the values observed for the natural
   organic matter isolates evaluated (1.6-2.1\%). Size fractionation of
   WWOM resulted in Phi(so) increases, with a value of up to 8.6\% for one
   of the <1 kDa fractions. Furthermore, oxidation of WWOM by hypochlorous
   acid (Hod) and molecular ozone also resulted in an increase in Phi(so),
   with the highest measured value being 9.3\%. This research further
   explores the correlations between the photosensitizing properties of
   WWOM and optical characteristics (e.g., absorbance, E2:E3 ratio). Making
   use of easily measurable absorbance values, a model for the prediction
   of O-1(2) steady-state concentrations is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Research on microbial activity in acid mine drainage (AMD) has focused
   on transformations of iron and sulfur. However, carbon cycling,
   including formation of soluble microbial products (SMP) from cell growth
   and decay, is an important biogeochemical component of the AMD
   environment. Experiments were conducted to study the interaction of SMP
   with soluble ferric iron in acidic conditions, particularly the
   formation of complexes that inhibit its effectiveness as the primary
   oxidant of pyrite during AMD generation. The rate of pyrite oxidation by
   ferric iron in sterile suspensions at pH 1.8 was reduced by 8796 in the
   presence of SMP produced from autoclaved cells at a ratio of 0.3 mg DOC
   per mg total soluble ferric iron. Inhibition of pyrite oxidation by SMP
   was shown to be comparable to, but weaker than, the effect of a
   chelating synthetic siderophore, DFAM. Two computational models
   incorporating SMP complexation were fitted to experimental results.
   Results suggest that bacterially produced organic matter can play a role
   in slowing pyrite oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Solar thermal water-splitting (STWS) cycles have long been recognized as
   a desirable means of generating hydrogen gas (H-2) from water and
   sunlight. Two-step, metal oxide-based STWS cycles generate H-2 by
   sequential high-temperature reduction and water reoxidation of a metal
   oxide. The temperature swings between reduction and oxidation steps long
   thought necessary for STWS have stifled STWS's overall efficiency
   because of thermal and time losses that occur during the frequent
   heating and cooling of the metal oxide. We show that these temperature
   swings are unnecessary and that isothermal water splitting (ITWS) at
   1350 degrees C using the ``hercynite cycle{''} exhibits H-2 production
   capacity >3 and >12 times that of hercynite and ceria, respectively, per
   mass of active material when reduced at 1350 degrees C and reoxidized at

Abstract = {{For the first time in serveral years, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   did not dominate regional climate conditions around the globe. A weak La
   Ni a dissipated to ENSOneutral conditions by spring, and while El Nino
   appeared to be emerging during summer, this phase never fully developed
   as sea surface temperatures in the eastern conditions. Nevertheless,
   other large-scale climate patterns and extreme weather events impacted
   various regions during the year. A negative phase of the Arctic
   Oscillation from mid-January to early February contributed to frigid
   conditions in parts of northern Africa, eastern Europe, and western
   Asia. A lack of rain during the 2012 wet season led to the worst drought
   in at least the past three decades for northeastern Brazil. Central
   North America also experienced one of its most severe droughts on
   record. The Caribbean observed a very wet dry season and it was the
   Sahel's wettest rainy season in 50 years.
   Overall, the 2012 average temperature across global land and ocean
   surfaces ranked among the 10 warmest years on record. The global land
   surface temperature alone was also among the 10 warmest on record. In
   the upper atmosphere, the average stratospheric temperature was record
   or near-record cold, depending on the dataset. After a 30-year warming
   trend from 1970 to 1999 for global sea surface temperatures, the period
   2000-12 had little further trend. This may be linked to the prevalence
   of La Ni a-like conditions during the 21st century. Heat content in the
   upper 700 m of the ocean remained near record high levels in 2012. Net
   increases from 2011 to 2012 were observed at 700-m to 2000-m depth and
   even in the abyssal ocean below. Following sharp decreases in to the
   effects of La Ni a, sea levels rebounded to reach records highs in 2012.
   The increased hydrological cycle seen in recent years continued, with
   more evaporation in drier locations and more precipitation in rainy
   areas. In a pattern that has held since 2004, salty areas of the ocean
   surfaces and subsurfaces were anomalously salty on average, while
   fresher areas were anomalously fresh.
   Global tropical cyclone activity during 2012 was near average, with a
   total of 84 storms compared with the 1981-2010 average of 89. Similar to
   2010 and 2011, the North Atlantic was the only hurricane basin that
   experienced above-normal activity. In this basin, Sandy brought
   devastation to Cuba and parts of the eastern North American seaboard.
   All other basins experienced either near-or below-normal tropical
   cyclone activity. Only three tropical cyclones reached Category 5
   intensity-all in Bopha became the only storm in the historical record to
   produce winds greater than 130 kt south of 7 N. It was also the
   costliest storm to affect the Philippines and killed more than 1000
   residents.
   Minimum Arctic sea ice extent in September and Northern Hemisphere snow
   cover extent in June both reached new record lows. June snow cover
   extent is now declining at a faster rate (-17.6\% per decade) than
   September sea ice extent (-13.0\% per decade). Permafrost temperatures
   reached record high values in northernmost Alaska. A new melt extent
   record occurred on 11-12 July on the Greenland ice sheet; 97\% of the
   ice sheet showed some form of melt, four times greater than the average
   melt for this time of year.
   The climate in Antarctica was relatively stable overall. The largest
   maximum sea ice extent since records begain in 1978 was observed in
   September 2012. In the stratosphere, warm air led to the second smallest
   ozone hole in the past two decades. Even so, the springtime ozone layer
   above Antarctica likely will not return to its early 1980s state until
   about 2060.
   Following a slight decline associated with the global 2 emissions from
   fossil fuel combustion and cement production reached a record 9.5 +/-
   0.5 Pg C in 2011 and a new record of 9.7 +/- 0.5 Pg C is estimated for
   2012. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by 2.1 ppm in 2012, to
   392.6 ppm. In spring 2012, 2 concentration exceeded 400 ppm at 7 of the
   13 Arctic observation sites. Globally, other greenhouse gases including
   methane and nitrous oxide also continued to rise in concentration and
   the combined effect now represents a 32\% increase in radiative forcing
   over a 1990 baseline. Concentrations of most ozone depleting substances
   continued to fall.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent paper by Abbassi and Rahimi (2009, ``Nonaxisymmetric
   Three-Dimensional Stagnation-Point Flow and Heat Transfer on a Flat
   Plate,'' ASME J. Fluids Eng, 131(7), p. 074501) the existence of a new
   nonaxisymmetric 3D stagnation-point flow has been reported. The present
   paper shows, however, that the model of Abbassis and Rahimi is fully
   equivalent to the classical 3D stagnation-point flow of Howarth (1951,
   ``The Boundary Layer in Three-Dimensional Flow-Part II: The Flow Near a
   Stagnation Point,'' Philos. Mag., 42, pp. 1433-1440) published more than
   sixty years ago. Thus their ``new'' solution can be recovered from
   Howarth's known solution by simple transformations, without any
   additional research effort. Once this flow problem is solved, the
   solution of the heat transfer problem of Abbassi and Rahimi (2009,
   ``Nonaxisymmetric Three-Dimensional Stagnation-Point Flow and Heat
   Transfer on a Flat Plate,'' ASME J. Fluids Eng, 131(7), p. 074501) can
   be calculated by a semi-analytical or by a usual numerical procedure.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Damped Bloch Waves by the Rayleigh Perturbation Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Bloch waves in viscously damped periodic material and structural systems
   are analyzed using a perturbation method originally developed by
   Rayleigh for vibration analysis of finite structures. The extended
   method, called the Bloch-Rayleigh perturbation method here, utilizes the
   Bloch waves of an undamped unit cell as basis functions to provide
   approximate closed-form expressions for the complex eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors of the damped unit cell. In doing so, we circumvent the
   solution of a quadratic Bloch eigenvalue problem and subsequent
   computationally intensive transformation to first order/state-space
   form. Dispersion curves of a one-dimensional damped spring-mass chain
   and a two-dimensional phononic crystal with square inclusions are
   calculated using the state-space method and the proposed method. They
   are compared and found to be in excellent quantitative agreement for
   both proportional and nonproportional viscous damping models. The
   perturbation method is able to capture anomalous dispersion
   phenomena-branch overtaking, branch cut-on/cut-off, and frequency
   contour transformation-in parametric ranges where state-space
   formulations encounter numerical issues. Generalization to other linear
   nonviscous damping models is permissible.}},

   inelastic dissipation only and shown that instabilities are enhanced
   with increased dissipation. The impact of frictional dissipation on the
   stability of grains in a homogeneous cooling system is studied in this
   work using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and kinetic-theory-based
   predictions. Surprisingly, both MD simulations and theory indicate that
   high levels of friction actually attenuate instabilities relative to the
   frictionless case, whereas moderate levels enhance instabilities
   compared to frictionless systems, as expected. The mechanism responsible
   for this behaviour is identified as the coupling between rotational and
   translational motion. These results have implications not only for
   granular materials, but also more generally to flows with dissipative
   interactions between constituent particles - cohesive systems with
   agglomeration, multiphase flows with viscous dissipation, etc.}},

Title = {{DNS of a turbulent boundary layer with surface roughness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{729}},
Pages = {{603-637}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A pioneer direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent boundary
   layer at Re-theta = 2077-2439, was performed, on a rough surface and
   with a zero pressure gradient (ZPG). The boundary layer was subjected to
   transitional, 24-grit sandpaper surface roughness, with a roughness
   parameter of k(+/-) similar or equal to 11. The computational method
   involves a synergy of the dynamic multi-scale approach devised by Araya
   et a l. (2011) for prescribing inlet turbulent boundary conditions and a
   new methodology for mapping high-resolution topographical surface data
   into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) environment. It is shown here
   that the dynamic multi-scale approach can be successfully extended to
   simulations which incorporate surface roughness. The DNS results
   demonstrate good agreement with the laser Doppler anemometry (LDA)
   measurements performed by Brzek et a l. (2008) and Schultz \& Flack
   (2003) under similar conditions in terms of mean velocity profiles,
   Reynolds stresses and flow parameters, such as the skin friction
   coefficient, boundary and momentum thicknesses. Further, it is
   demonstrated that the effects of the surface roughness on the Reynolds
   stresses, at the values of Re-theta = 2077-2439, are scale-dependent.
   Roughness effects were mainly manifested up to y/delta approximate to
   0.1. Generally speaking, it was observed that inner peak values of
   Reynolds stresses increased when considering outer units. However,
   decreases were seen in inner units. In the outer region, the most
   significant differences between the present DNS smooth and rough cases
   were computed in the wall-normal component < v'(2)> of the Reynolds
   stresses and in the Reynolds shear stresses < u'v'> in outer units. From
   the resulting flow fields a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
   analysis is performed and the effects of the surface roughness are
   distinctly observed in the most energetic POD modes. The POD analysis
   shows that the surface roughness causes a redistribution of the kinetic
   energy amongst the POD modes with energy being shifted from low-order to
   high-order modes in the rough case versus the smooth case. Also, the
   roughness causes a marked decrease in the characteristic wavelengths
   observed in the POD modes, particularly in the streamwise component of
   the velocity field. Low-order modes of the streamwise component
   demonstrated characteristic wavelengths of the order of 3 delta in the
   smooth case, whereas the same modes for the rough case demonstrated
   characteristic wavelengths of only delta.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines decision making for recovery and reconstruction in
   L'Aquila, Italy, over the one-year period following the 6 April 2009
   earthquake. The paper focuses on local and national perceptions of
   government response to the earthquake, community involvement in
   reconstruction decision processes, the establishment of rebuilding
   priorities, and prospects for future seismic risk reduction. Data were
   collected through 23 semi-structured, face-to-face key informant
   interviews with local leaders (including community, building industry,
   and government representatives) and 4 interviews with national leaders.
   Findings show that although local leaders were satisfied with the
   Department of Civil Protection's emergency response, there was
   frustration with funding and priorities for permanent rebuilding. Public
   involvement in decision making varied by community, but in most cases
   was limited, leading local leaders to express distrust in government and
   national leadership and their decisions. The case study also illustrates
   the importance of authority and resource coordination between the
   national and local levels.}},

Abstract = {{A new framework for simulating the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   using a generalized linear model (GLM) is provided. The GLM provides a
   versatile and computationally inexpensive method for investigating ENSO
   dynamics, by conditioning an ENSO index on an arbitrary set of input
   variables. Here the system state (El Nino/neutral/La Nina) at previous
   times is combined with the first few principal components of sea surface
   temperature (SST) and thermocline depth. Despite having relatively few
   degrees of freedom, the model accurately reproduces 20th century SST
   time series, seasonal variance, power spectra, and autocorrelation
   functions for both the eastern and western Pacific. The GLM also has
   good overall forecast skill, especially at subyearly lead times;
   performance is competitive with models currently used for operational
   ENSO forecasting. The model is then used to examine changes to El
   Nino/La Nina statistics under CO2 increases, by using the GLM to
   represent simulations run with the National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM), versions 3.5 and
   4. GLM simulations of 21st century CCSM4 changes to El Nino/La Nina
   magnitudes show insignificant results, despite a slight increase in El
   Nino persistence. GLM fits conditioned on millennial stabilized CCSM3.5
   simulations with varying CO2 levels, however, show a weakening and
   shortening of El Nino events as CO2 concentration increases, whereas La
   Nina events become markedly stronger and do not change significantly in
   length. The reduction in El Nino persistence in CCSM3.5 is consistent
   with previous results showing that at higher CO2 levels, a stronger
   seasonal cycle creates a Southern Hemisphere seasonal footprint leading
   to more efficient El Nino termination.}},

Abstract = {{Positions derived from continuously operating GPS sites are used
   throughout the world for geophysical research. These positions are
   estimated assuming that the GPS signals have not been obstructed by
   either snow or ice on the GPS antenna. Unfortunately, in many regions of
   the world, this assumption is not correct. Snow and ice attenuate and
   scatter the GPS signal in a way that leads to significant positioning
   errors. These positioning outliers are typically removed by assuming
   geophysical models of displacement. In this study an algorithm is
   developed that uses signal strength data to determine when the GPS
   signal has been impacted by snow or ice. This information is then used
   to remove outliers in GPS coordinate time series. The signal
   strength-based algorithm was tested on 6years of data from the
   EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory network. The algorithm improves
   the precision of similar to 10\% of these coordinate time series, with
   most of the improvement found for sites operating in Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{The Harang discontinuity is a longitudinally extended ionospheric
   signature near midnight of flow reversal from westward to eastward with
   decreasing latitude. Its occurrence indicates enhanced convection in the
   magnetotail that requires an upward field-aligned current from the
   ionosphere due to diamagnetic ion drift. Previous reports using event
   studies have been conflicting as to the occurrence of the Harang
   discontinuity during a mode of enhanced magnetotail response called
   steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). With a comprehensive list of SMC
   events from 1997 through 2007, we utilize data from the Super Dual
   Auroral Radar Network and a novel spatial superposition technique to
   statistically examine the occurrence of the Harang discontinuity during
   SMC events. We find that the statistical signature of the Harang
   discontinuity begins before SMC starts and strengthens as the SMC events
   progress. We also detail the typical size and strength of the Harang
   discontinuity and find that it is more pronounced during interplanetary
   magnetic field +B-y conditions.}},

Volume = {{118}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent observations and models show the considerable effects of
   upward-propagating lunar atmospheric tides on many aspects of the
   ionosphere-thermosphere system. A key aspect of atmosphere-ionosphere
   coupling is the wind field in the ionospheric E region (circa 100-150
   km), where the dynamo generation of electric fields occurs. Yet, global
   specifications of lunar tidal winds exist only in theoretical
   predictions although years of satellite observations on atmospheric
   winds exist with almost global coverage. In the present paper, we report
   on quasi-global semidiurnal lunar tidal winds up to 115km from data
   gathered by the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) on board the Upper
   Atmosphere Research Satellite during the early years from 1991 to 1999.
   The observed lunar semidiurnal tidal winds are consistent with global
   scale wave model (GSWM) simulations in both amplitude and phase, with
   maximum amplitudes located between about 40 degrees N-60 degrees N
   around the solstices. The peak amplitudes of the lunar tidal winds lie
   in the 10-15ms(-1)range, whereas those simulated by GSWM lie between 15
   and 25ms(-1). The smaller HRDI amplitudes are likely due in part to
   amplitude suppression in construction of the climatological mean
   resulting from year-to-year phase variability in the lunar tide. It is
   also possible that wave dissipation is underestimated to some degree in
   the GSWM.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater pumping may lead to reduction in surface water flows, which
   can compromise water supplies and habitat. In light of these threats,
   the need to minimize stream depletion, defined as the reduction in the
   flow rate in streams and rivers caused by groundwater pumping, becomes
   paramount. We develop adjoint equations to calculate stream depletion
   due to aquifer pumping. We consider a coupled groundwater and surface
   water system in which both the river head and river flow rate are
   impacted by drawdown in the aquifer as a result of pumping. Through an
   illustrative example, we show that the adjoint method for calculating
   stream depletion produces accurate results if the model is approximately
   linear. With only one simulation of the adjoint equations, stream
   depletion can be calculated for pumping at a well at any location in the
   model domain, which results in a substantial reduction in computational
   time as compared to the standard method of calculating stream depletion.
   Key Points <list list-type={''}bulleted{''}> Adjoint models accurately
   calculate stream depletion due to aquifer pumping. The adjoint method is
   computationally efficient in calculating stream depletion. Standard
   groundwater flow codes can be adapted to solve the adjoint model.}},

Title = {{Incorporating probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts into river
   management using a risk-based framework}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the influence of hydroclimate on river ecosystems, most efforts
   to date have focused on using climate information to predict streamflow
   for water supply. However, as water demands intensify and river systems
   are increasingly stressed, research is needed to explicitly integrate
   climate into streamflow forecasts that are relevant to river ecosystem
   management. To this end, we present a five step risk-based framework:
   (1) define risk tolerance, (2) develop a streamflow forecast model, (3)
   generate climate forecast ensembles, (4) estimate streamflow ensembles
   and associated risk, and (5) manage for climate risk. The framework is
   successfully demonstrated for an unregulated watershed in southwest
   Montana, where the combination of recent drought and water withdrawals
   has made it challenging to maintain flows needed for healthy fisheries.
   We put forth a generalized linear modeling (GLM) approach to develop a
   suite of tools that skillfully model decision-relevant low flow
   characteristics in terms of climate predictors. Probabilistic
   precipitation forecasts are used in conjunction with the GLMs, resulting
   in season-ahead prediction ensembles that provide the full risk profile.
   These tools are embedded in an end-to-end risk management framework that
   directly supports proactive fish conservation efforts. Results show that
   the use of forecasts can be beneficial to planning, especially in wet
   years, but historical precipitation forecasts are quite conservative
   (i.e., not very sharp). Synthetic forecasts show that a modest
   sharpening can strongly impact risk and improve skill. We emphasize that
   use in management depends on defining relevant environmental flows and
   risk tolerance, requiring local stakeholder involvement.

Abstract = {{We estimate the spatial distribution of daily melt-season snow water
   equivalent (SWE) over the Sierra Nevada for March to August, 2000-2012,
   by two methods: reconstruction by combining remotely sensed snow cover
   images with a spatially distributed snowmelt model and a blended method
   in which the reconstruction is combined with in situ snow sensor
   observations. We validate the methods with 17 snow surveys at six
   locations with spatial sampling and with the operational snow sensor
   network. We also compare the methods with NOAA's operational Snow Data
   Assimilation System (SNODAS). Mean biases of the methods compared to the
   snow surveys are -0.193 m (reconstruction), 0.001 m (blended), and
   -0.181 m (SNODAS). Corresponding root-mean-square errors are 0.252,
   0.205, and 0.254 m. Comparison between blended and snow sensor SWE
   suggests that the current sensor network inadequately represents SWE in
   the Sierra Nevada because of the low spatial density of sensors in the
   lower/higher elevations. Mean correlation with streamflow in 19 Sierra
   Nevada watersheds is better with reconstructed SWE (r=0.91) versus
   blended SWE (r=0.81), snow sensor SWE (r=0.85), and SNODAS SWE (r=0.86).
   On the other hand, the correlation with blended SWE is generally better
   than with reconstructed, snow sensor, and SNODAS SWE late in the
   snowmelt season when snow sensors report zero SWE but snow remains in
   the higher elevations. Sensitivity tests indicate downwelling longwave
   radiation, snow albedo, forest density, and turbulent fluxes are
   potentially important sources of errors/uncertainties in reconstructed
   SWE, and domain-mean blended SWE is relatively insensitive to the number
   of snow sensors blended.
   Key Points
   <list list-type={''}bulleted{''}> The blended SWE product is more
   accurate than the NOAA SWE product Satellite-based snow cover depletion
   data improves SWE estimation Sensitivity tests suggest four key sources
   of uncertainties in reconstructed SWE}},

Abstract = {{Diamond is the stiffest known material. Here we report that
   nanopolycrystal diamond synthesized by direct-conversion method from
   graphite is stiffer than natural and synthesized monocrystal diamonds.
   This observation departs from the usual thinking that nanocrystalline
   materials are softer than their monocrystals because of a large volume
   fraction of soft grain-boundary region. The direct conversion causes the
   nondiffusional phase transformation to cubic diamond, producing many
   twins inside diamond grains. We give an ab initio-calculation twinned
   model that confirms the stiffening. We find that shorter interplane
   bonds along {[}111] are significantly strengthened near the twinned
   region, from which the superstiff structure originates. Our discovery
   provides a novel step forward in the search for superstiff materials.}},
