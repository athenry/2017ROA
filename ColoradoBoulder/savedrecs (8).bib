Abstract = {{Many global development agencies self-report their project outcomes,
   often relying on subjective data that is collected sporadically and
   communicated months later. These reports often highlight successes and
   downplay challenges. Instrumented monitoring via distributed data
   collection platforms may provide crucial evidence to help inform the
   sector and public on the effectiveness of aid, and the on-going
   challenges. This paper presents the process of designing and validating
   an integrated sensor platform with cellular-to-internet reporting
   purposely targeted at global development programs. The integrated
   hardware platform has been applied to water, sanitation, energy and
   infrastructure interventions and validated through laboratory
   calibration and field observations. Presented here are two examples: a
   water pump and a household water filter, wherein field observations
   agreed with the data algorithm with a linear fit slope of between 0.91
   and 1, and an r-squared of between 0.36 and 0.39, indicating a wide
   confidence interval but with low overall error (i.e., less than 0.5\% in
   the case of structured field observations of water volume added to a
   household water filter) and few false negatives or false positives.}},

Title = {{Light-Activated, In Situ Forming Gel for Sustained Suprachoroidal
   Delivery of Bevacizumab}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2858-2867}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A light-activated polycaprolactone dimethacrylate (PCM) and hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate (HEMA) based gel network was developed to sustain the
   release of stable, active bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF antibody used to
   treat choroidal neovascularization) and used to assess sustained ex vivo
   delivery in rabbit eyes and in vivo delivery in rat eyes following in
   situ gel formation in the suprachoroidal space. PCM was synthesized from
   polycaprolactone diol (PCD) and evaluated using NMR spectroscopy. PCM
   was used to cross-link HEMA in the presence of 365 nm UV light and
   2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) as a photoinitiator.
   Bevacizumab was entrapped in the gel using three different crosslinking
   durations of 3, 7, and 10 min. In vitro release of bevacizumab in PBS pH
   7.4 at 37 degrees C during a 4 month study was quantified using a
   VEGF-binding based ELISA. The stability of released bevacizumab was
   monitored by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and circular
   clichroism. Alexa Fluor 488 dye conjugated bevacizumab mixed with
   polymers was injected suprachoroidally in rabbit eyes to study the
   effect of different cross linking durations on the spread of the dye
   conjugated bevacizumab. In vivo delivery was assessed in Sprague Dawley
   (SD) rats by injecting Alexa Fluor 488 dye conjugated bevacizumab mixed
   with polymers followed by cross linking for 10 min. Spread in the rabbit
   eyes and in vivo delivery in rat eyes was monitored noninvasively using
   a fundus camera and Fluorotron Master. The formation of PCM was
   confirmed by the disappearance of hydroxyl peak in NMR spectra. A cross
   linking duration of 10 min resulted in a burst release of 21\% of
   bevacizumab. Other cross linking durations had >= 62\% burst release.
   Bevacizumab release from 10 min cross linked gel was sustained for 4
   months. Release samples contained >= 96.1\% of bevacizumab in the
   monomeric form as observed in SEC chromatograms. Circular dichroism
   confirmed that secondary beta-sheet structure of bevacizumab was
   maintained after release from the gel As the cross linking duration was
   increased to 10 min, the gel/antibody was better confined at the
   injection site in excised rabbit eye suprachoroidal space. Delivery of
   Alexa Fluor 488 dye conjugated bevacizumab was sustained for at least 60
   days in the suprachoroidal space of SD rats. PCM and HEMA gel sustained
   bevacizumab release for 4 months and maintained the stability and
   VEGF-binding activity of bevacizumab. Therefore, light-activated PCM and
   HEMA gel is suitable for in situ gel formation and sustained protein
   delivery in the suprachoroidal space.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral properties of coherent waves in an argon plasma column are
   examined using fluctuation data from fast imaging. Visible light from
   ArII line emission is collected at high frame rates using a high-speed
   digital camera. A cross-spectral phase technique allows direct
   visualization of dominant phase structures as a function of frequency,
   as well as identification of azimuthal asymmetries present in the
   system. Experimental dispersion estimates are constructed from imaging
   data alone. Drift-like waves are identified by comparison with
   theoretical dispersion curves, and a tentative match of a low-frequency
   spectral feature to Kelvin-Helmholtz-driven waves is presented. Imaging
   measurements are consistent with previous results, and provide
   non-invasive, single-shot measurements across the entire plasma
   cross-section. Implications of the measured spectral properties for
   imaging measurements of mode dynamics are explored. (C) 2013 AIP

   Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and
   Precipitation at Summit Project and NOAA's Earth System Research
   Laboratory's Global Monitoring Division's lidar network. Here, the
   instrument is described with particular emphasis placed upon the
   implementation of new polarization methods developed to measure particle
   orientation and improve the overall accuracy of lidar depolarization
   measurements. Initial results from the lidar are also shown to
   demonstrate the ability of the lidar to observe cloud properties.}},

Abstract = {{Transient analysis of dispersive, periodic structures in the case of
   obliquely incident plane wave is presented in this work. The Laguerre
   marching-on-in-degree (MoD) is used for the development of an
   unconditionally stable algorithm. Due to the unconditional stability,
   Courant-Freidrich-Levy (CFL) temporal discretization limit can be
   circumvented resulting in less simulation time compared to the
   conventional dispersive finite difference time domain (FDTD). This is
   particularly advantageous for multiscale, dispersive structures. The
   uniaxial perfectly matched layer (UPML) is implemented in the Laguerre
   domain. By virtue of the Laguerre decomposition, the presented method
   can simulate general dispersive media compared to conventional
   dispersive FDTD which can simulate only standard dispersion models such
   as Debye, Lorentz and Drude. The formulations are validated by
   estimating the transmission spectra of an infinite double pole Debye
   slab and comparing the results with analytical results. Further
   confirmation is obtained by estimating the transmission spectra of
   zeroth order Floquet mode of a 1D periodic array of dispersive, square
   cylinders and comparing the results with periodic method of moments
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of excipients in solutions of keratinocyte
   growth factor 2 (KGF-2) on protein aggregation during agitation as well
   as on interfacial shear rheology at the air-water interface. Samples
   were incubated with or without agitation, and in the presence or absence
   of the excipients heparin, sucrose, or polysorbate 80 (PS80). The effect
   of excipients on the extent of protein aggregation was determined by
   UV-visible spectroscopy and micro-flow imaging. Interfacial shear
   rheology was used to detect the gelation time and strength of protein
   gels at the air-water interface. During incubation, protein particles of
   size 1m and insoluble aggregates formed faster for KGF-2 solutions
   subjected to agitation. Addition of either heparin or sucrose promoted
   protein aggregation during agitation. In contrast, PS80 substantially
   inhibited agitation-induced KGF-2 aggregation but facilitated protein
   particulate formation in quiescent solutions. The combination of PS80
   and heparin or sucrose completely prevented protein aggregation during
   both nonagitated and agitated incubations. Interfacial rheological
   measurements showed that KGF-2 in buffer alone formed an interfacial gel
   within a few minutes. In the presence of heparin, KGF-2 interfacial gels
   formed too quickly for gelation time to be determined. KGF-2 formed gels
   in about 10min in the presence of sucrose. The presence of PS80 in the
   formulation inhibited gelation of KGF-2. Furthermore, the interfacial
   gels formed by the protein in the absence of PS80 were reversible when
   PS80 was added to the samples after gelation. Therefore, there is a
   correspondence between formulations that exhibited interfacial gelation
   and formulations that exhibited agitation-induced aggregation. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We have recently developed a general approach to improve the utility of
   enzymes in ionic liquids (ILs) via tuning of the ratio of
   enzyme-containing positive to negative surface charges. In this work,
   the impact of enzyme surface charge ratio on the biophysical interaction
   of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ({[}BMIM]{[}Cl]) with
   chymotrypsin and lipase was investigated to understand this approach at
   the molecular level. Results of fluorescence quenching assays indicated
   that the extent of binding of the {[}BMIM] cation decreased (7- and
   3.5-fold for chymotrypsin and lipase, respectively) as a function of
   increasing ratio of positive to negative surface charges. Conformational
   stability assays further showed a close correlation between
   thermodynamic stabilization and enzyme surface charge ratio as well as
   {[}BMIM] binding. As evidence of this correlation, succinylation and
   acetylation resulted in the stabilization of chymotrypsin in 10\% (v/v)
   {[}BMIM] {[}Cl] by 17.0 and 6.6 kJ/mol, respectively, while
   cationization destabilized chymotrypsin by 3.6 kJ/mol. Combined, these
   results indicate that altering the surface charge ratio mediates the
   organization of IL molecules, namely, {[}BMIM] and {[}Cl], around the
   enzymes. Preferential exclusion of {[}Cl], in particular, via lowering
   of the ratio of positive to negative surface charges, correlated with
   increased enzyme stability. Accordingly, these results more broadly
   provide insight into the mechanism of stabilization in ILs via charge
   modification.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first (to the best of our knowledge) depletion-mode
   carrier-plasma optical modulator fabricated in a standard advanced
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic process (45 nm node
   SOI CMOS) with no process modifications. The zero-change CMOS photonics
   approach enables this device to be monolithically integrated into
   state-of-the-art microprocessors and advanced electronics. Because these
   processes support lateral p-n junctions but not efficient ridge
   waveguides, we accommodate these constraints with a new type of resonant
   modulator. It is based on a hybrid microring/disk cavity formed entirely
   in the sub-90 nm thick monocrystalline silicon transistor body layer.
   Electrical contact of both polarities is made along the inner radius of
   the multimode ring cavity via an array of silicon spokes. The spokes
   connect to p and n regions formed using transistor well implants, which
   form radially extending lateral junctions that provide index modulation.
   We show 5 Gbps data modulation at 1265 nm wavelength with 5.2 dB
   extinction ratio and an estimated 40 fJ/bit energy consumption. Broad
   thermal tuning is demonstrated across 3.2 THz (18 nm) with an efficiency
   of 291 GHz/mW. A single postprocessing step to remove the silicon handle
   wafer was necessary to support low-loss optical confinement in the
   device layer. This modulator is an important step toward monolithically
   integrated CMOS photonic interconnects. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{We demonstrate depletion-mode carrier-plasma optical modulators
   fabricated in a bulk complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS),
   DRAM-emulation process. To the best of our knowledge, these are the
   first depletion-mode modulators demonstrated in polycrystalline silicon
   and in bulk CMOS. The modulators are based on novel optical
   microcavities that utilize periodic spatial interference of two guided
   modes to create field nulls along waveguide sidewalls. At these nulls,
   electrical contacts can be placed while preserving a high optical Q.
   These cavities enable active devices in a process with no partial
   silicon etch and with lateral p-n junctions. We demonstrate two device
   variants at 5 Gbps data modulation rate near 1610 nm wavelength. One
   design shows 3.1 dB modulation depth with 1.5 dB insertion loss and an
   estimated 160 fJ/bit energy consumption, while a more compact device
   achieves 4.2 dB modulation depth with 4.0 dB insertion loss and 60
   fJ/bit energy consumption. These modulators represent a significant
   breakthrough in enabling active photonics in bulk silicon CMOS-the
   platform of the majority of microelectronic logic and DRAM processes-and

Abstract = {{The capacity region of the two-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
   Gaussian interference channel (IC) is characterized to within a constant
   gap that is independent of the channel matrices for the general case of
   the MIMO IC with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node. An
   achievable rate region and an outer bound to the capacity region of a
   class of interference channels were obtained in previous work by Telatar
   and Tse as unions over all possible input distributions. In contrast to
   that previous work on the MIMO IC, a simple and an explicit achievable
   coding scheme are obtained here and shown to have the
   constant-gap-to-capacity property and in which the sub-rates of the
   common and private messages of each user are explicitly specified for
   each achievable rate pair. The constant-gap-to-capacity results are thus
   proved in this work by first establishing explicit upper and lower
   bounds to the capacity region. A reciprocity result is also proved which
   is that the capacity of the reciprocal MIMO IC is within a constant gap
   of the capacity region of the forward MIMO IC.}},

Abstract = {{The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fast-fading
   interference channel (IC) with an arbitrary number of antennas at each
   of the four terminals is studied under the settings of Shannon feedback
   and output feedback, wherein channel matrices and outputs, or just the
   channel outputs, respectively, are available to the transmitters with a
   delay. While for most numbers of antennas at the four terminals, the
   degree-of-freedom (DoF) regions with Shannon feedback are equal to that
   with just delayed channel state information (CSIT), it is shown that for
   the rest of the MIMO ICs, the DoF region with Shannon feedback is
   strictly larger than the DoF region with just delayed CSIT. To realize
   these DoF gains with Shannon feedback, a new interference alignment
   scheme is obtained wherein transmitter cooperation made possible by
   output feedback (in addition to delayed CSIT) is employed to effect a
   more efficient form of interference alignment than is feasible with
   previously known schemes that use just delayed CSIT. The DoF region for
   output-only feedback is also obtained for all but a class of MIMO ICs
   that satisfy one of two inequalities involving the numbers of antennas.
   Moreover, the DoF region for Shannon feedback is shown to be applicable
   to two limited Shannon feedback settings where the transmitters have

Abstract = {{The light scattering and extinction properties of mineral aerosol are
   strongly affected by dust particle shape. In this work, scattering phase
   function and polarization profiles of diatomaceous earth aerosol are
   measured at a wavelength of 550 nm, and the results are compared to
   T-matrix theory based simulations using uniform spheroid models for the
   particle shape. The particle shape distribution is determined by
   spectral fitting of the experimental infrared (IR) extinction spectral
   line profile for diatomaceous earth dust. It is found that a particle
   shape model that peaks toward both extreme rod-like and disk-like shapes
   results in the best fits to the IR spectral data. This particle shape
   model is then used as a basis for modeling the visible light scattering
   properties. While the visible simulations show only modestly good
   agreement with the data, the fits are generally better than those
   obtained using more commonly invoked particle shape distributions. (C)

   Hill-Frame, with linearized gravity, and craft position components
   assumed in the form of simple harmonic oscillators. Substitution of the
   oscillatory functions into the dynamics, further constrains these
   functions, and yields necessary potential histories, to produce the
   periodic flow. The assumed position functions, however, are not
   arbitrary, since the dynamical model restricts what oscillatory
   trajectories are allowed. Specifically, a Hill-Frame integral of motion
   is derived, and this is used to show certain candidate periodic
   functions to be inadmissible. The system dynamics are then linearized to
   expose stability properties of the solutions, and it is established that
   asymptotic stability is impossible for all orbit families. Finally, the
   degree of instability in the assumed motions, over free parameter
   ranges, is determined numerically via the Floquet multipliers of the
   associated full-cycle state-transition matrices. (c) 2013 IAA. Published

Abstract = {{The idea of deploying a lander on the secondary body of the binary
   primitive asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3 is investigated. 1996 FG3 is the
   backup target of the European sample return space mission MarcoPolo-R
   under assessment study at the European Space Agency in the framework of
   the M3 Medium-Class mission competition. The launch will take place in
   2022-2024, depending on its selection at the end of 2013. A lander is
   indicated as an optional payload, depending on mass availability on the
   spacecraft. Obviously, the possible complexity of a lander deployment is
   also an important parameter to take into account. Here we demonstrate
   that, considering worst case scenarios and low requirements on the
   spacecraft GNC and deployment mechanism, the operations are easy to
   implement and safe for the main spacecraft. The concept of operations is
   to deploy a light lander from the L-2 Lagrange point of the binary
   system, on a ballistic trajectory that will impact the secondary
   asteroid. The fundamental principles of this strategy are briefly
   presented and a detailed model of 1996 FG3 is considered, to which the
   strategy is applied. We show that the deployment is successful in
   99.94\% of cases. (c) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding regional-scale water resource systems requires
   understanding coupled hydrologic and climate interactions. The
   traditional approach in the hydrologic sciences and engineering fields
   has been to either treat the atmosphere as a forcing condition on the
   hydrologic model, or to adopt a specific hydrologic model design in
   order to be interoperable with a climate model. We propose here a
   different approach that follows a service-oriented architecture and uses
   standard interfaces and tools: the Earth System Modeling Framework
   (ESMF) from the weather and climate community and the Open Modeling
   Interface (OpenMI) from the hydrologic community. A novel technical
   challenge of this work is that the climate model runs on a high
   performance computer and the hydrologic model runs on a personal
   computer. In order to complete a two-way coupling, issues with security
   and job scheduling had to be overcome. The resulting application
   demonstrates interoperability across disciplinary boundaries and has the
   potential to address emerging questions about climate impacts on local
   water resource systems. The approach also has the potential to be
   adapted for other climate impacts applications that involve different
   communities, multiple frameworks, and models running on different
   computing platforms. We present along with the results of our coupled
   modeling system a scaling analysis that indicates how the system will
   behave as geographic extents and model resolutions are changed to
   address regional-scale water resources management problems. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The U.S. road network is one of the nation's most important capital
   assets and is vital to the functioning of the U.S. economy. Maintaining
   this asset involves approximately \$134 billion of government funds
   annually from Federal, State, and local agencies. Climate change may
   represent a risk or an opportunity to this network, as changes in
   climate stress will affect the resources necessary for both road
   maintenance and construction projects. This paper develops an approach
   for estimating climate-related changes in road maintenance and
   construction costs such that the current level of service provided by
   roads is maintained over time. We estimate these costs under a baseline
   scenario in which annual mean global temperature increases by 1.5
   degrees C in 2050 relative to the historical average and a mitigation
   scenario under which this increase in mean temperature is limited to 1.0
   degrees C. Depending on the nature of the changes in climate that occur
   in a given area, our analysis suggests that climate change may lead to a
   reduction in road maintenance and/or construction costs or an increase
   in costs. Overall, however, our analysis shows that climate change, if
   unchecked, will increase the annual costs of keeping paved and unpaved
   roads in service by \$785 million in present value terms by 2050. When
   not discounted, this figure increases to \$2.8 billion. Policies to
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to reduce these costs by
   approximately \$280 million in present value terms and by \$885 million
   when not discounted. These costs vary substantially by region and time
   period, information that should be important for transportation planners
   at the national, state, and local levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes multiple-input, multiple-output interference
   channels where each receiver knows its channels from all the
   transmitters and feeds back this information using a limited number of
   bits to all the other terminals. It is shown that as long as the
   feedback bit rate scales sufficiently fast with the signal-to-noise
   ratio, the transmitters can use an interference alignment strategy by
   treating the quantized channel estimates as being perfect to achieve the
   sum degrees of freedom of the interference channel attainable with
   perfect and global channel state information. A tradeoff between the
   feedback rate and the achievable degrees of freedom is established by
   showing that a slower scaling of feedback rate for any one user leads to
   commensurately fewer degrees of freedom for that user alone. It is then
   shown that under the same fixed transmission strategy but with random
   quantization, the above mentioned sufficient condition on the feedback
   scaling rate to attain a given sum degrees of freedom (up to the maximum
   attainable) is also necessary in this setting.}},

Abstract = {{The effective design of earthquake-resistant structures and liquefaction
   mitigation techniques requires an improved understanding of the
   development and consequences of liquefaction. In this paper, the results
   from centrifuge experiments of structures with shallow foundations on
   liquefiable sand were used to evaluate the predictive capabilities of a
   state-of-the-practice numerical tool. Fully-coupled numerical
   simulations with the UBCSAND model implemented in FLAC-2D captured
   building settlements measured in these experiments reasonably well for
   one scaled input motion, mostly within factors of 0.7 and 1.8. The soil
   model captured the overall contribution of deviatoric displacement
   mechanisms and localized volumetric strains during partially drained
   cyclic loading. The primary limitation of the model became evident for
   slower rates of earthquake energy buildup, when the extent of soil
   softening and building displacement was overestimated by up to a factor
   of 4. The observations from recent case histories, the results of the
   experiments, and the insights gained from the numerical analyses are
   combined to provide guidance on the evaluation of building response on
   liquefiable sand and the performance of liquefaction remediation

Abstract = {{DNA functionalisation is a proven route to program an assembly of
   nanoparticles into a vast array of nanostructures. In this paper, we
   used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study
   DNA-functionalised nanoparticles and demonstrate the effect of grafted
   DNA strand composition, specifically the placement and number of
   contiguous G/C bases in the grafted DNA single strands, on the
   thermodynamics and structure of nanoparticle assembly at varying
   grafting densities and particle sizes. At a constant G/C content,
   nanoparticles assemble more readily when the G/C bases are placed on the
   outer or middle portions of the strands than on the inner portion. In
   addition, the number of neighbours within the assembled cluster
   decreases as the placement of the G/C bases goes from the outer to
   middle to inner sections of the strand. As the G/C content decreases,
   the cluster dissociation temperature, T-d, decreases, as the enthalpic
   drive to assemble decreases. At a high G/C content (number of grafts and
   G/C placement are held constant), as particle size decreases, T-d
   increases. This is because the smaller particles experience a lower
   entropic loss than do larger particles upon assembly. On the other hand,
   at a low G/C content, small changes in particle size lead to negligible
   changes in T-d.</IN}},

Abstract = {{A quartz crystal microbalance was used to determine the effects of
   different water quality parameters on the detachment of silver
   nanoparticles from surfaces representative of ceramic pot filters
   (CPFs). Silver nanoparticles stabilized with casein were used in the
   experiments. The average hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles
   ranged from 20 nm to 100 nm over a pH range of 6.5-10.5. The isoelectric
   point was about 3.5 and the zeta potential was -45 mV from pH 4.5 to
   9.5. The silver nanoparticles were deposited onto silica surfaces and a
   quartz crystal microbalance was used to monitor silver release from the
   surface. At environmentally relevant ranges of pH (4.8-9.3), ionic
   strength (0 and 150 mol/m(3) NaNO3 or 150 mol/m(3) Ca(NO3)(2)), and
   turbidity (0 and 51.5 NTU kaolin clay), the rates of silver release were
   similar. A high concentration of sodium chloride and bacteria
   (Escherichia coli in 10\% tryptic soy broth) caused rapid silver
   release. Water containing sodium hypochlorite removed 85\% of the silver
   from the silica surface within 3 h. The results suggest that contact
   between CPFs and prechlorinated water or bleach CPF cleaning should be

Abstract = {{Aim To investigate the importance of autumn phenology in controlling
   interannual variability of forest net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and
   to derive new phenological metrics to explain the interannual
   variability of NEP.
   Location North America and Europe.
   Method Flux data from nine deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) and 13
   evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) across North America and Europe (212
   site-years) were used to explore the relationships between the yearly
   anomalies of annual NEP and several carbon flux based phenological
   indicators, including the onset/end of the growing season, onset/end of
   the carbon uptake period, the spring lag (time interval between the
   onset of growing season and carbon uptake period) and the autumn lag
   (time interval between the end of the carbon uptake period and the
   growing season). Meteorological variables, including global shortwave
   radiation, air temperature, soil temperature, soil water content and
   precipitation, were also used to explain the phenological variations.
   Results We found that interannual variability of NEP can be largely
   explained by autumn phenology, i.e. the autumn lag. While variation in
   neither annual gross primary productivity (GPP) nor in annual ecosystem
   respiration (R-e) alone could explain this variability, the negative
   relationship between annual NEP and autumn lag was due to a larger
   R-e/GPP ratio in years with a prolonged autumn lag. For DBF sites, a
   longer autumn lag coincided with a significant decrease in annual GPP
   but showed no correlation with annual R-e. However, annual GPP was
   insensitive to a longer autumn lag in ENF sites but annual R-e increased
   significantly.
   Main conclusions These results demonstrate that autumn phenology plays a
   more direct role than spring phenology in regulating interannual
   variability of annual NEP. In particular, the importance of respiration
   may be potentially underestimated in deriving phenological indicators.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, a direct time domain procedure is used for dynamic
   structural stability analysis of the dam-reservoir-foundation coupled
   system in 3D space considering the impact of the ground motion duration.
   The foundation medium is assumed to be massed and infinite elements are
   used for modeling the semi-infinite medium of the foundation. The
   nonlinear behavior of mass concrete is modeled using the coaxial
   rotating smeared crack approach with the ability of cracking at Gaussian
   points. The reservoir is assumed to be compressible and is modeled using
   fluid finite elements. In order to investigate the erects of the ground
   motion duration on dynamic stability of the coupled system, a set of
   artificially-generated ground motions with different duration but the
   same intensities are used to analyze the system. It is found that the
   responses of the system with the massed foundation including either
   infinite elements or viscous boundary on the far-end face of the
   foundation are the same. Using the massless foundation leads to
   conservative stresses within dam body. Implementation of the infinite
   elements leads to decreasing crack profile of the concrete dam compared
   to the massless model; however higher duration ground motions lead to
   more damage in both models.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and mechanics of fish scales display unusual and
   attractive features which could inspire new protective materials and
   systems. This natural material is therefore attracting attention over
   the past few years, and recent work demonstrated the remarkable
   performance of individual fish scales. A puncture event as would occur
   from a predator's attack however involves more than one scale, and in
   this article we therefore investigate collective mechanisms occurring
   within the scaled skin of a fish in the event of a predator's attack. We
   first demonstrate that in striped bass (Morone saxatilis), the scales
   increase by four to five times the force required to puncture the skin.
   We show that individual scales from striped bass provide a remarkable
   barrier against sharp puncture, regardless of the stiffness of the
   substrate. The scalation pattern in striped bass is such that three
   scales overlap at any point on the surface of the fish, which we show
   effectively multiplies the puncture force by three. We determined that
   the friction between scales is negligible and therefore it does not
   contribute to increasing puncture force. Likewise, we found that the
   local arrangement of the scales had little effect on the puncture
   performance. Interestingly, because the scales are several orders of
   magnitude stiffer than the substrate, indenting a few isolated scales
   results in ``sinking{''} of the scales into the substrate. The high
   local deflections and strain within the soft tissue may then result in
   blunt injury before the sharp indenter penetrates the scales.
   Stereo-imaging and image correlation performed around a puncture site in
   fish reveal that the surrounding scales collectively contribute to
   redistributing the puncture force over large volume, limiting local
   deflections and strains in the soft tissues. The structure and
   mechanisms of natural fish scales therefore offer an effective
   protection against several types of threat, and may inspire novel
   versatile protective systems with attractive flexural properties. (C)

Abstract = {{Changes to the North American snowpacks for 1979-2007 were detected from
   snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieved empirically from horizontally
   polarized brightness temperature (T-B) of a scanning multichannel
   microwave radiometer (18 and 37 GHz) and special sensor microwave imager
   (19 and 37 GHz) passive microwave data using the nonparametric Kendall's
   test. The predominant SWE trends detected agree with negative anomalies
   in snow cover observed in Northern Hemisphere since the 1980s, and both
   the SWE and snow cover results should be related to the significant
   increase in the surface temperature of North America (NA) observed since
   the 1970s. About 30\% of detected decreasing trends of SWE for 1979-2007
   are statistically significant, which is three times more than the
   significant increasing trends of SWE detected in NA. Significant
   decreasing SWE trends are more extensive in Canada than in the United
   States. The mean trend magnitudes detected for December-April are -0.4
   to -0.5 mm/yr, which means an overall reduction of snow depth of about
   5-8 cm in 29 years (assuming a snowpack density between 200 and 250
   kg/m(3)), which can impact regions relying on spring snowmelt for water
   supply. From detected increasing (decreasing) trends of gridded
   temperature (precipitation) based on the North American Regional
   Reanalysis data set and the University of Delaware data set for NA,
   their respective correlations with SWE data and other findings, such as
   global scale decline of snow cover, longer rainfall seasons, etc., it
   seems the extensive decreasing trends in SWE detected mainly in Canada
   are more caused by increasing temperatures than by decreasing
   precipitation. However, climate anomalies could also contribute to the
   detected trends, such as PC1 of NA's SWE, which is found to be
   correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index and marginally
   correlated to the Pacific North American pattern.}},

Abstract = {{The Nitrogen, Aerosol Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower (NACHTT)
   field experiment took place during late winter, 2011, at a site 33km
   north of Denver, Colorado. The study included fixed-height measurements
   of aerosols, soluble trace gases, and volatile organic compounds near
   surface level, as well as vertically resolved measurements of nitrogen
   oxides, aerosol composition, soluble gas-phase acids, and halogen
   species from 3 to 270m above ground level. There were 1928 individual
   profiles during the three-week campaign to characterize trace gas and
   aerosol distributions in the lower levels of the boundary layer. Nitrate
   and ammonium dominated the ionic composition of aerosols and originated
   primarily from local or regional sources. Sulfate and organic matter
   were also significant and were associated primarily with longer-range
   transport to the region. Aerosol chloride was associated primarily with
   supermicron size fractions and was always present in excess of gas-phase
   chlorine compounds. The nighttime radical reservoirs, nitryl chloride,
   ClNO2, and nitrous acid, HONO, were both consistently present in
   nighttime urban air. Nitryl chloride was especially pronounced in plumes
   from large point sources sampled aloft at night. Nitrous acid was
   typically most concentrated near the ground surface and was the dominant
   contributor (80\%) to diurnally averaged primary OH radical production
   in near-surface air. Large observed mixing ratios of light alkanes, both
   in near-surface air and aloft, were attributable to local emissions from
   oil and gas activities.}},

Abstract = {{The mixed metal oxides NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 are candidate materials for
   the Chemical Looping Hydrogen (CLH) process, which produces pure and
   separate streams of H-2 and CO2 without the use of complicated and
   expensive separations equipment. In the CLH process, syngas reduces a
   metal oxide, oxidizing the H-2 and CO in the syngas to H2O and CO2, and
   ``stores{''} the chemical energy of the syngas in the reduced metal
   oxide. The reduced metal oxide is then oxidized in steam to regenerate
   the original metal oxide and produce H-2. In this study, we report
   thermodynamic modeling and experimental results regarding the syngas
   reduction and H2O oxidation of NiFe2O4 and COFe2O4 to determine the
   feasibility of their use in the CLH process. Modeling predicts the
   oxidation of nearly all the CO and H-2 in syngas to H2O and CO2 during
   the reduction step for both materials, and regeneration of the mixed
   metal spinel phase during oxidation with excess H2O. Laboratory tests in
   a packed bed reactor confirmed over 99\% conversion of H-2 and CO to H2O
   and CO2 during reduction of NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4. Powder XRD analysis of
   the reduced materials showed, in accordance with thermodynamic
   predictions, the presence of a spinel phase and a metallic phase. High
   reactivity of the reduced NiFe2O4 and COFe2O4 with H2O was observed, and
   XRD analysis confirmed re-oxidation to NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 under the
   conditions tested. When compared with a conventional Fe-based CLH
   material, the mixed metal spinels showed a higher extent of reduction
   under the same conditions, and produced four times the H-2 per mass of
   active material than the Fe-based material. Analysis of the H-2 and CO
   consumed in the reduction and the H-2 produced during the oxidation
   showed over 90\% conversion of the H-2 and CO in syngas back to H-2
   during oxidation. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Title = {{Human Gender Differences in the Perception of Conspecific Alarm
   Chemosensory Cues}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{It has previously been established that, in threatening situations,
   animals use alarm pheromones to communicate danger. There is emerging
   evidence of analogous chemosensory ``stress'' cues in humans. For this
   study, we collected alarm and exercise sweat from ``donors,'' extracted
   it, pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated ``detector'' subjects
   undergoing fMRI. The fMRI protocol consisted of four stimulus runs, with
   each combination of stimulus condition and donor gender represented four
   times. Because olfactory stimuli do not follow the canonical hemodynamic
   response, we used a model-free approach. We performed minimal
   preprocessing and worked directly with block-average time series and
   step-function estimates. We found that, while male stress sweat produced
   a comparably strong emotional response in both detector genders, female
   stress sweat produced a markedly stronger arousal in female than in male
   detectors. Our statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to
   the right amygdala (strongest in the superficial nuclei). When comparing
   the olfactory bulb responses to the corresponding stimuli, we found no
   significant differences between male and female detectors. These imaging
   results complement existing behavioral evidence, by identifying whether
   gender differences in response to alarm chemosignals are initiated at
   the perceptual versus emotional level. Since we found no significant
   differences in the olfactory bulb (primary processing site for
   chemosensory signals in mammals), we infer that the specificity in
   responding to female fear is likely based on processing meaning, rather
   than strength, of chemosensory cues from each gender.}},

   Markers in Porcine Cardiac Valves}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) are the main population of cells
   found in cardiac valves. These resident fibroblastic cells play
   important roles in maintaining proper valve function, and their
   dysregulation has been linked to disease progression in humans. Despite
   the critical functions of VICs, their cellular composition is still not
   well defined for humans and other mammals. Given the limited
   availability of healthy human valves and the similarity in valve
   structure and function between humans and pigs, we characterized porcine
   VICs (pVICs) based on expression of cell surface proteins and sorted a
   specific subpopulation of pVICs to study its functions. We found that
   small percentages of pVICs express the progenitor cell markers ABCG2
   (similar to 5\%), NG2 (similar to 5\%) or SEA-4 (similar to 7\%),
   whereas another subpopulation (similar to 5\%) expresses OB-CDH, a type
   of cadherin expressed by myofibroblasts or osteo-progenitors. pVICs
   isolated from either aortic or pulmonary valves express most of these
   protein markers at similar levels. Interestingly, OB-CDH, NG2 and SSEA-4
   all label distinct valvular subpopulations relative to each other;
   however, NG2 and ABCG2 are co-expressed in the same cells. ABCG2(+)
   cells were further characterized and found to deposit more calcified
   matrix than ABCG2(-) cells upon osteogenic induction, suggesting that
   they may be involved in the development of osteogenic VICs during valve
   pathology. Cell profiling based on flow cytometry and functional studies
   with sorted primary cells provide not only new and quantitative
   information about the cellular composition of porcine cardiac valves,
   but also contribute to our understanding of how a subpopulation of
   valvular cells (ABCG2(+) cells) may participate in tissue repair and
   disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells depends strongly on
   the morphology of the electron donors (conjugated polymers) and electron
   acceptors (fullerene derivatives) in the active layer. The features of
   the donor acceptor morphology (e.g., domain shapes,
   crystalline/amorphous domains, and donor acceptor interface) can in
   principle be tuned by choosing the chemistry and architecture of the
   conjugated polymer, fullerene functional group, solvents, and processing
   conditions (e.g., annealing temperature). Here, we present a
   high-throughput coarse-grained simulation study that links
   molecular-level design parameters to features in the assembled
   morphology in neat polymers and donor-acceptor blends. These models
   reproduce neat polymer morphologies observed in experiments, such as
   lamellae, hexagonally packed cylinders, and acceptor intercalation among
   donor side chains. Furthermore, for blends of conjugated polymers and
   fullerene derivatives, this study shows how conjugated polymer
   architecture and acceptor miscibility can be tailored to obtain new
   blend morphologies, which have features that are known to be optimal for
   higher efficiency solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{An explicit integration algorithm for computations of discontinuous wave
   propagation in two-dimensional and three-dimensional solids is
   presented, which is designed to trace extensional and shear waves in
   accordance with their respective propagation speeds. This has been
   possible by an orthogonal decomposition of the total displacement into
   extensional and shear components, leading to two decoupled equations:
   one for the extensional waves and the other for shear waves. The two
   decoupled wave equations are integrated with their CFL time step sizes
   and then reconciled to a common step size by employing a previously
   developed front-shock oscillation algorithm that is proven to be
   effective in mitigating spurious oscillations. Numerical experiments
   have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm for two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional wave propagation problems traces the stress wave
   fronts with high-fidelity compared with existing conventional
   algorithms. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines organic acid and metal concentrations in northeastern
   Pacific Ocean stratocumulus cloudwater samples collected by the CIRPAS
   Twin Otter between July and August 2011. Correlations between a suite of
   various monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acid concentrations are
   consistent with documented aqueous-phase mechanistic relationships
   leading up to oxalate production. Monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids
   exhibited contrasting spatial profiles reflecting their different
   sources; the former were higher in concentration near the continent due
   to fresh organic emissions. Concentrations of sea salt crustal tracer
   species, oxalate, and malonate were positively correlated with low-level
   wind speed suggesting that an important route for oxalate and malonate
   entry in cloudwater is via some combination of association with coarse
   particles and gaseous precursors emitted from the ocean surface. Three
   case flights show that oxalate (and no other organic acid)
   concentrations drop by nearly an order of magnitude relative to samples
   in the same vicinity. A consistent feature in these cases was an inverse
   relationship between oxalate and several metals (Fe, Mn, K, Na, Mg, Ca),
   especially Fe. By means of box model studies we show that the loss of
   oxalate due to the photolysis of iron oxalato complexes is likely a
   significant oxalate sink in the study region due to the ubiquity of
   oxalate precursors, clouds, and metal emissions from ships, the ocean,
   and continental sources.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of renewed growth in the atmospheric CH4 burden since 2007
   are still poorly understood and subject of intensive scientific
   discussion. We present a reanalysis of global CH4 emissions during the
   2000s, based on the TM5-4DVAR inverse modeling system. The model is
   optimized using high-accuracy surface observations from NOAA ESRL's
   global air sampling network for 2000-2010 combined with retrievals of
   column-averaged CH4 mole fractions from SCIAMACHY onboard ENVISAT
   (starting 2003). Using climatological OH fields, derived global total
   emissions for 2007-2010 are 16-20 Tg CH4/yr higher compared to
   2003-2005. Most of the inferred emission increase was located in the
   tropics (9-14 Tg CH4/yr) and mid- latitudes of the northern hemisphere
   (6-8 Tg CH4/yr), while no significant trend was derived for Arctic
   latitudes. The atmospheric increase can be attributed mainly to
   increased anthropogenic emissions, but the derived trend is
   significantly smaller than estimated in the EDGARv4.2 emission
   inventory. Superimposed on the increasing trend in anthropogenic CH4
   emissions are significant inter-annual variations (IAV) of emissions
   from wetlands (up to +/- 10 Tg CH4/yr), and biomass burning (up to +/- 7
   Tg CH4/yr). Sensitivity experiments, which investigated the impact of
   the SCIAMACHY observations (versus inversions using only surface
   observations), of the OH fields used, and of a priori emission
   inventories, resulted in differences in the detailed latitudinal
   attribution of CH4 emissions, but the IAV and trends aggregated over
   larger latitude bands were reasonably robust. All sensitivity
   experiments show similar performance against independent shipboard and
   airborne observations used for validation, except over Amazonia where
   satellite retrievals improved agreement with observations in the free
   troposphere.}},

Abstract = {{The jet fragmentation function is measured with direct photon-hadron
   correlations in p + p and Au + Au collisions at root S-NN = 200 GeV. The
   P-T of the photon is an excellent approximation to the initial P-T of
   the jet and the ratio Z(T) = P-T(h)/P-T(gamma) is used as a proxy for
   the jet fragmentation function. A statistical subtraction is used to
   extract the direct photon-hadron yields in Au + Au collisions while a
   photon isolation cut is applied in p + p. I-AA, the ratio of hadron
   yield opposite the photon in Au + Au to that in p + p, indicates
   modification of the jet fragmentation function. Suppression, most likely
   due to energy loss in the medium, is seen at high Z(T). The associated
   hadron yield at low Z(T) is enhanced at large angles. Such a trend is
   expected from redistribution of the lost energy into increased
   production of low-momentum particles.}},

Abstract = {{Optical metamaterials have unique properties which result from geometric
   confinement of the optical conductivity. We developed a series of
   infrared metasurfaces based on an array of metallic square loop
   antennas. The far-field absorption spectrum can be designed with
   resonances across the infrared by scaling the geometric dimensions. We
   measure the amplitude and phase of the resonant mode as standing wave
   patterns within the square loops using scattering-scanning near-field
   optical microscopy (s-SNOM). Further, using a broad-band
   synchrotron-based FTIR microscope and s-SNOM at the Advanced Light
   Source, we are able to correlate far-field spectra to near-field modes
   of the metasurface as the resonance is tuned between samples. The
   results highlight the importance of multimodal imaging for the design
   and characterization of optical metamaterials. (C) 2013 Optical Society

Abstract = {{We assessed the performance of the MTCLIM scheme for estimating downward
   shortwave (SWdown) radiation and surface humidity from daily temperature
   range (DTR), as well as several schemes for estimating downward longwave
   radiation (LWdown), at 50 Baseline Solar Radiation Network stations
   globally. All of the algorithms performed reasonably well under most
   climate conditions, with biases and mean absolute errors generally less
   than 3\% and 20\%, respectively, over more than 70\% of the global land
   surface. However, estimated SWdown had a bias of -26\% at coastal sites,
   due to the ocean's moderating influence on DTR, and in continental
   interiors, SWdown had an average bias of -15\% in the presence of snow,
   which was reduced by MTCLIM 4.3's snow correction if local topography
   was taken into account. Vapor pressure (VP) and relative humidity (RH)
   had large negative biases (up to -50\%) under the most arid conditions.
   At coastal sites, LWdown had positive biases of up to 10\%, while biases
   at interior sites exhibited a weak dependence on DTR. The largest biases
   in both RH (negative) and LWdown (positive) were concentrated over the
   world's deserts, while smaller positive humidity biases were found over
   tropical and boreal forests. Evaluation of the diurnal cycle showed
   negative morning, and positive afternoon biases in vapor pressure
   deficit and LWdown related to errors in the interpolation of the diurnal
   air temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an eight-node, assumed strain, solid-shell,
   corotational element for geometrically nonlinear structural analysis.
   The locally linear kinematics of the element is separated into in-plane
   (which is further decoupled into membrane and bending), thickness and
   transverse shear components. This separation allows using any type of
   membrane quadrilateral formulation for the in-plane response. Assumed
   strain fields for the three components are constructed using different
   approaches. The Assumed Natural Deviatoric Strain approach is used for
   the in-plane response, whereas the Assumed Natural Strain approach is
   used for the thickness and transverse shear components. A strain
   enhancement based on Enhanced Assumed Strain concepts is also used for
   the thickness component. The resulting element passes well-known shell
   element patch tests and exhibits good performance in a number of
   challenging benchmark tests. The formulation is extended to the
   geometric nonlinear regime using an element-independent corotational
   approach. Some key properties of the corotational kinematic description
   are discussed. The element is tested in several well-known shell
   benchmarks and compared with other thin-shell and solid-shell elements
   available in the literature, as well as with commercial nonlinear FEM
   codes. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{4754-4768}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Supraglacial lakes are a common feature of the ablation zone of the
   Greenland Ice Sheet and have significant implications for the water
   budget of the area, because when they drain they can increase the speed
   at which ice moves to lower elevations. One valuable tool in assessing
   the water balance of ice sheets is to track the volume of lakes as they
   form, through in situ measurements or by determining lake area and depth
   from aircraft or spacecraft imagery. However, since supraglacial lakes
   drain unpredictably and rapidly, it is possible that they can form and
   drain without being observed. Therefore, it is valuable to create tools
   that can detect the previous presence of supraglacial lakes after they
   have drained. Three methods of distinguishing drained supraglacial lakes
   in Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery and
   hyperspectral airborne imagery were analysed: spectral signature
   analysis on raw data, band ratio analysis, and textural analysis. All
   three methods show promise that they could be used to detect former
   (i.e. drained) supraglacial lakes, thereby refining estimates of the
   water balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet and providing valuable data to
   climate models.}},

Abstract = {{This review highlights aspects of calcific aortic valve disease that
   encompass the entire range of aortic valve disease progression from
   initial cellular changes to aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis, which
   can be initiated by changes in blood flow (hemodynamics) and pressure
   across the aortic valve. Appropriate hemodynamics is important for
   normal valve function and maintenance, but pathological blood velocities
   and pressure can have profound consequences at the macroscopic to
   microscopic scales. At the macroscopic scale, hemodynamic forces impart
   shear stresses on the surface of the valve leaflets and cause
   deformation of the leaflet tissue. As discussed in this review, these
   macroscale forces are transduced to the microscale, where they influence
   the functions of the valvular endothelial cells that line the leaflet
   surface and the valvular interstitial cells that populate the valve
   extracellular matrix. For example, pathological changes in blood
   flow-induced shear stress can cause dysfunction, impairing their
   homeostatic functions, and pathological stretching of valve tissue
   caused by elevated transvalvular pressure can activate valvular
   interstitial cells and latent paracrine signaling cytokines (eg,
   transforming growth factor-1) to promote maladaptive tissue remodeling.
   Collectively, these coordinated and complex interactions adversely
   impact bulk valve tissue properties, feeding back to further deteriorate
   valve function and propagate valve cell pathological responses. Here, we
   review the role of hemodynamic forces in calcific aortic valve disease
   initiation and progression, with focus on cellular responses and how
   they feed back to exacerbate aortic valve dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{A novel hybrid approach for supervisory control was applied to a test
   cell with thermo-active building systems and fan-assisted natural
   ventilation. Model predictive control was first used to identify
   combined thermo-active building systems and ventilation control
   strategies that maximized cooling energy savings while preserving
   thermal comfort. A rule extraction process using classification and
   regression trees then yielded supervisory rules capable of reproducing
   nearly all of the energy and comfort benefits of the model predictive
   control solutions when simulated. An experimental test of the rules was
   conducted on the same facility, yielding 40\% average cooling energy
   savings compared to a base case, with comparable comfort. A variety of
   model input mismatches, including weather, model parameters, internal
   gains, and imperfect weather forecasts, degraded the performance of the
   rule significantly under experimental conditions, and analysis suggests
   that energy savings could have been nearly double had these factors been
   eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{An aspartame-based, low molecular-weight organic gelator (LMOG) was used
   to form melt-infused and composite membranes with two different
   imidazolium-based room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) for CO2
   separation from N-2. Previous work demonstrated that LMOGs can gel RTILs
   at low, loading levels, and this aspartame-based LMOG was selected
   because it has been reported to gel a large number of RTILs. The
   imidazolium-based RTILs were used because of their inherent good
   properties for CO2/light gas separations. Analysis of the resulting bulk
   RTIL/LMOG physical gels showed that these materials have high sol-gel
   transition temperatures (ca. 135 degrees C) suitable for flue gas
   applications. Gas permeabilities and burst pressure measurements of
   thick, melt infused membranes revealed a trade-off between high CO2
   permeabilities and good mechanical stability as a function of the LMOG
   loading. Defect-free, composite membranes of the gelled RTILs were
   successfully fabricated by choosing an appropriate porous membrane
   support (hydrophobic PTFE) using a suitable coating technique (roller
   coating). The thicknesses of the applied composite gel layers ranged
   from 10.3 to 20.7 mu m, which represents an order of magnitude decrease
   in active layer thickness, compared to the original melt-infused gel
   RTIL membranes.}},

Abstract = {{This research was conducted to evaluate the design of hospital
   ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems and to assess their
   effectiveness for inactivating airborne mycobacteria. A computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and tested by simulating
   previous experiments measuring the effectiveness of a lab-based UVGI
   system. Model testing showed reasonable agreement with experimental
   measurements. The model captured trends similar to the experiments:
   Effectiveness of an upper-room UVGI system is higher when there is no
   ventilation compared with when there is ventilation, and wintertime
   ventilation conditions can markedly decrease the performance of an
   upper-room UVGI system. The CFD model was then applied to evaluate the
   design of three hospital patient rooms. A patient and an exam room with
   upper-room UVGI systems, and a patient room with an exhaust duct system
   were studied. Results showed that one of the UVGI systems was not very
   effective, due to the very efficient ventilation design. The other two
   configurations were reasonably to very effective at inactivating
   airborne mycobacteria. The most effective application was the one in
   which the room air-exchange rate was very low. CFD modeling can be
   useful for assessing whether hospital UVGI installations and ventilation
   systems are effective for infection control.}},

Abstract = {{Background The affinity research group (ARG) model is a set of practices
   built on a cooperative team framework to support the creation and
   maintenance of dynamic and inclusive research groups in which students
   learn and apply the knowledge and skills required for research and
   cooperative work. Using situated learning theory, we conducted a
   qualitative study of current and former ARG members to understand the
   potential of the ARG for preparing students for graduate school and
   professional research careers.
   Purpose Our study investigated how the ARG model influenced students,
   particularly those from underrepresented groups, in becoming researchers
   and practicing computer scientists.
   Design/Method We employed multiple data collection methods, including
   individual and focus group interviews and participant observation, to
   investigate whether this model had lasting effects and sustainability
   beyond the time students spent in an ARG.
   Results Using themes emerging from our data analysis, we can explain how
   students become contributing members of ARGs, group identity and
   cohesiveness are formed, members learn collaboratively, members
   participate in larger professional communities, and participants'
   identities are transformed from student to researcher.
   Conclusions Findings suggest that the structural and procedural elements
   of ARGs support students' growth and development as researchers and
   their gradual socialization into broader computer science research and
   professional communities through legitimate peripheral participation and
   immersion in situated practice.}},

Abstract = {{Substituting silicon by transition metals in polymer-derived ceramics
   (PDCs) holds the potential for a new class of polymer-derived ceramics
   for ultrahigh-temperature structural applications. We present
   experiments that show that the solid solubility of HfO2 extends to Hf/Si
   ratio of <0.22. The materials are synthesized from (miscible) organic
   precursors. Similar to silicon-based materials they remain amorphous
   after pyrolysis at 1000 degrees C. Small-angle X-ray scattering and
   Raman spectra remain essentially unaltered. It is postulated that Hf,
   like Si, forms mixed-bond tetrahedra with C, O, and N. The difference in
   the enthalpy of Hf-based, and Si-centered tetrahedra is calculated using
   single-bond energies, reinforcing the feasibility of substituting Si
   with Hf or with Zr atoms. Such polymer-based HfSiCNO compounds made
   directly from liquid organics, by a simple manufacturing process, may
   also be relevant to nanoscale dielectrics with low leakage electric
   charge in microelectronics applications.}},

Abstract = {{We study the mechanics of pressurized graphene membranes using an
   experimental configuration that allows the determination of the
   elasticity of graphene and the adhesion energy between a substrate and a
   graphene (or other two-dimensional solid) membrane. The test consists of
   a monolayer graphene membrane adhered to a substrate by surface forces.
   The substrate is patterned with etched microcavities of a prescribed
   volume and, when they are covered with the graphene monolayer, it traps
   a fixed number (N) of gas molecules in the microchamber. By lowering the
   ambient pressure and thus changing the pressure difference across the
   graphene membrane, the membrane can be made to bulge and delaminate in a
   stable manner from the substrate. This is in contrast to the more common
   scenario of a constant pressure membrane blister test, where membrane
   delamination is unstable, and so this is not an appealing test to
   determine adhesion energy. Here, we describe the analysis of the
   membrane/substrate as a thermodynamic system and explore the behavior of
   the system over representative experimentally accessible geometry and
   loading parameters. We carry out companion experiments and compare them
   to the theoretical predictions and then use the theory and experiments
   together to determine the adhesion energy of graphene/SiO2 interfaces.
   We find an average adhesion energy of 0.24 J/m(2), which is lower but in
   line with our previously reported values. We assert that this test-which
   we call the constant N blister test-is a valuable approach to determine
   the adhesion energy between two-dimensional solid membranes and a
   substrate, which is an important but not well-understood aspect of
   behavior. The test also provides valuable information that can serve as
   the basis for subsequent research to understand the mechanisms
   contributing to the observed adhesion energy. Finally, we show how, in
   the limit of a large microcavity, the constant N test approaches the
   behavior observed in a constant pressure blister test, and we provide an
   experimental observation that suggests this behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Moisture diffusivity of saturated concrete varies with decreasing
   temperature. The variation depends on the amount of ice formed in pores
   and on the extent of the damage induced by the formation of ice. Ice
   crystals in the pores decrease the moisture diffusivity of concrete
   because of the low moisture diffusivity of ice, and the damage
   attributable to excessive ice formation in the pores increases the
   diffusivity. An analytical model is developed to characterize the effect
   of the two opposing processes on the diffusivity of the concrete under
   low temperatures. Three pore configurations are defined as (1) pores
   with no ice, (2) pores with ice and no damage, and (3) pores with ice
   and damage. The effective diffusivity of concrete is a combination of
   the diffusivities of the three types of porous media, each containing
   one configuration of pores. In the current study, the three types of
   porous media are combined by the composite model developed by Hashin and
   Shtrikman. The volume fraction of each configuration of pores is
   evaluated by a pore-size distribution based on the adsorption isotherm
   and a function of freezing temperature in terms of pore sizes. The
   diffusivities of the three types of porous media are evaluated by
   considering the ice-formation and damage-development mechanisms. The
   Druker-Prager plasticity model was used, and pores are assumed to be
   spherically shaped for evaluating the internal damage. The results of
   model prediction show that the moisture diffusivity in concrete
   decreases when the solution is frozen in some of the pores. If the
   temperature reduces further and causes damage attributable to excessive
   ice formation, then the diffusivity decreases at a lower rate than that
   at the same temperature without damage. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{Coastal altimeter waveforms may differ from the ones in the open ocean,
   either from rapid changes in the sea state or the presence of land
   within the satellite altimeter footprint. The optimal retracking method
   for an individual track may turn out to be a combination of several
   retrackers and may depend on the sea state. The coastal high-frequency
   radar (HFR) ocean surface currents, hourly interpolated with a
   resolution up to 2 km and an offshore range up to 150 km, are evaluated
   to validate the altimeter sea surface height (SSH) measurements. A
   method to derive HFR SSH mapped, with a varying spatial-scale optimal
   interpolation, from the HFR velocities has been implemented. Evaluated
   mainly in the regions farther than 25 km off the U.S. West Coast, the
   HFR SSH shows good agreement with Jason-1-2 altimetry products over the
   years 2008 and 2009. Three Jason-2 PISTACH retrackers and one generic
   open ocean retracker have been analyzed using the traditional 1 Hz
   sampling rate. Nearshore, an experimental reprocessing of the 20 Hz
   range measurements is also tested to check for a gain in along-track
   spatial resolution. Referencing to the HFR SSH indicate the need to have
   several retrackers available, even over the continental shelf, with Ice3
   fitting better during Bloom events and MLE-4 (or Red3) for high sea
   states. These studies demonstrate the value of HFR as a potential tool
   to correct coastal altimeter SSH, refine their spatial resolution and
   provide some insight into the altimeter behavior as a function of ocean
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Sectoral contributions to surface water stress in the coterminous United

Abstract = {{Here, we assess current stress in the freshwater system based on the
   best available data in order to understand possible risks and
   vulnerabilities to regional water resources and the sectors dependent on
   freshwater. We present watershed-scale measures of surface water supply
   stress for the coterminous United States (US) using the water supply
   stress index (WaSSI) model which considers regional trends in both water
   supply and demand. A snapshot of contemporary annual water demand is
   compared against different water supply regimes, including current
   average supplies, current extreme-year supplies, and projected future
   average surface water flows under a changing climate. In addition, we
   investigate the contributions of different water demand sectors to
   current water stress. On average, water supplies are stressed, meaning
   that demands for water outstrip natural supplies in over 9\% of the 2103
   watersheds examined. These watersheds rely on reservoir storage,
   conveyance systems, and groundwater to meet current water demands.
   Overall, agriculture is the major demand-side driver of water stress in
   the US, whereas municipal stress is isolated to southern California.
   Water stress introduced by cooling water demands for power plants is
   punctuated across the US, indicating that a single power plant has the
   potential to stress water supplies at the watershed scale. On the supply
   side, watersheds in the western US are particularly sensitive to low
   flow events and projected long-term shifts in flow driven by climate
   change. The WaSSI results imply that not only are water resources in the
   southwest in particular at risk, but that there are also potential
   vulnerabilities to specific sectors, even in the `water-rich' southeast.}},

Title = {{Microbial growth under humic-free conditions in a supraglacial stream

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{During the austral summers of 2004 and 2009, we sampled a supraglacial
   stream on the Cotton Glacier, Antarctica. The stream dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) was low (44-48 mu M C) and lacked detectable humic
   fluorescence signatures. Analysis of the excitation emissions matrices
   (EEMs) indicated that amino-acid fluorophores dominated, consistent with
   DOM of microbial origin, with little humic-like fluorescence. In most
   aquatic ecosystems, humic DOM attenuates harmful UV radiation and its
   absence may represent an additional stressor influencing the microbial
   community. Nonetheless, the stream contained an active microbial
   assemblage with bacterial cell abundances from 2.94 x 10(4) to 4.97 x
   10(5) cells ml(-1), and bacterial production ranging from 58.8 to 293.2
   ng C l(-1) d(-1). Chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 0.53
   mu g l(-1) indicating that algal phototrophs were the probable source of
   the DOM. Microbial isolates produced a rainbow of pigment colors,
   suggesting adaptation to stress, and were similar to those from other
   cryogenic systems (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes lineages).
   Supraglacial streams provide an example of contemporary microbial
   processes on the glacier surface and a natural laboratory for studying
   microbial adaptation to the absence of humics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we globally characterize the solar terdiurnal tide in the
   80-110km region of Earth's atmosphere through analysis of 10years of
   temperature measurements made by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using
   Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument on the
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics spacecraft.
   The Sun-synchronous (migrating) component (TW3), which is
   longitude-independent and achieves maximum amplitudes of order of 5K
   (10K) at 90km (110km), not too different than the 7-15K amplitudes that
   are typical of the migrating diurnal and semidiurnal tides in this
   region. Significant longitude variability (approximate to 20-25\%) in
   terdiurnal temperature amplitudes also exists, which is decomposed into
   zonal wave number components. The largest of these (TE1, TW4, and TW5)
   reveal distinct seasonal-latitudinal and height versus latitude patterns
   and interannual consistency. In addition, it is demonstrated that these
   particular components vary in ways that suggest that they originate from
   nonlinear interactions between diurnal and semidiurnal tides,
   specifically between DE3 and SW2 for TE1, between DW2 and SW2 for TW4,
   and between DW1 and SW4 for TW5. We also demonstrate that the terdiurnal
   tides derived here are not influenced to any significant degree by
   aliasing due to the presence of otherwaves.}},

Abstract = {{Fire performance and fire safety of high-rise buildings have become
   major concerns after the disasters of World Trade Center in the U. S. in
   2001 and Windsor tower in Spain in 2005. Performance based design (PBD)
   approaches have been considered as a better method for fire resistance
   design of structures because it is capable of incorporating test results
   of most recent fire resistance technologies. However, there is a
   difficulty to evaluate fireproof performance of large structures, which
   have multiple structural members such as columns, slabs, and walls. The
   difficulty is mainly due to the limitation in the testing equipment,
   such as size of furnace that can be used to carry out fire tests with
   existing criteria like ISO 834, BS 476, and KS F 2257. In the present
   research, a large scale calorie meter (10 MW) was used to conduct three
   full scale fire tests on medical modular blocks. Average fire load of
   13.99 kg/m(2) was used in the first test. In the second test, the
   weighting coefficient of 3.5 (the fire load of 50 kg/m(2)) was used to
   simulate the worst fire scenario. The flashover of the medical modular
   block occurred at 62 minutes in the first test and 12 minutes in the
   second test. The heat resistance capacity of the external wall, the
   temperatures and deformations of the structural members satisfied the
   requirements of fire resistance performance of 90 minutes burning
   period. The total heat loads and the heat values for each test are
   calculated by theoretical equations. The duration of burning was
   predicted. The predicted results were compared with the test results,
   and they agree quite well.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of ion energy distribution are performed in the accelerated
   plasma of a coaxial electromagnetic plasma gun operating in a gas-puff
   mode at relatively low discharge energy (900 J) and discharge potential
   (4 kV). The measurements are made using a Thomson-type mass and energy
   spectrometer with a gated microchannel plate and phosphor screen as the
   ion sensor. The parabolic ion trajectories are captured from the sensor
   screen with an intensified charge-coupled detector camera. The
   spectrometer was designed and calibrated using the Geant4 toolkit,
   accounting for the effects on the ion trajectories of spatial
   non-uniformities in the spectrometer magnetic and electric fields.
   Results for hydrogen gas puffs indicate the existence of a class of
   accelerated protons with energies well above the coaxial discharge
   potential (up to 24 keV). The Thomson analyzer confirms the presence of
   impurities of copper and iron, also of relatively high energies, which
   are likely erosion or sputter products from plasma-electrode

Title = {{Determination of hyperelastic properties for umbilical artery in

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{169}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Preeclampsia often results in altered hemodynamics and
   structurally remodeled umbilical arteries in the fetus - alterations
   that may be associated with arterial stiffening. We therefore
   hypothesized that the mechanical function of preeclamptic (PE) umbilical
   arteries had increased stiffness compared to control.
   Study design: Umbilical arteries were collected from control (n = 9) and
   PE (n = 6) pregnancies without any other complications. Samples were
   tested uniaxially in axial and circumferential directions for the
   passive mechanics. The umbilical artery was modeled as a fiber
   reinforced hyperelastic material in both control and PE conditions.
   Results: The PE arteries were stiffer than control arteries at stresses
   of 20-160 mmHg in the axial direction and 65-200 mmHg in the
   circumferential direction (P < 0.05). The PE umbilical arteries
   exhibited a 58\% and 48\% increase in circumferential moduli at the
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively compared to the
   controls (P < 0.05). A hyperelastic model showed a substantial increase
   in both isotropic and anisotropic contribution in the mechanical
   behavior. Collectively, the changes observed correlated to a higher
   collagen fiber density in the PE group with increased hyperelastic
   material parameters (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: PE umbilical arteries demonstrated stiffer biomechanics
   compared to the controls due to the change in collagen fiber content.
   These altered biomechanical and structural changes provide a potential
   snapshot into systemic vasculature remodeling occurring in the newborn.

Abstract = {{The High Integrity GPS program seeks to provide enhanced navigation
   performance by combining conventional GPS with a communications and
   ranging broadcast from the Iridium (R) Communications System. Through
   clock and message aiding, it would enable existing GPS receivers to
   acquire and track in more challenging environments. As is the case for
   standard GPS, accurate and precise timing is key to performance. An
   approach is presented for estimating the bias of each Iridium satellite
   clock using satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite measurements.
   The satellite clock bias estimates are based on a Kalman filter that
   incorporates code-type observations from the measurements at 10 s
   intervals. Filter parameters are set based on the expected behavior of
   the clocks, allowing for discontinuous bias and frequency adjustments
   due to ground commands. Typical results show the current filter to be
   accurate to within 200 ns while always meeting the initial system
   specification of half a microsecond.}},

Abstract = {{While the remarkable chemical and biological properties of DNA have been
   known for decades, these properties have only been imparted into
   materials with unprecedented function much more recently. The inimitable
   ability of DNA to form programmable, complex assemblies through stable,
   specific, and reversible molecular recognition has allowed the creation
   of new materials through DNA's ability to control a material's
   architecture and properties. In this review we discuss recent progress
   in how DNA has brought unmatched function to materials, focusing
   specifically on new advances in delivery agents, devices, and sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In the foreseeable future, there will be a sharp increase in the demand
   for flexible Li-ion batteries. One of the most important components of
   such batteries will be a freestanding electrode, because the traditional
   electrodes are easily damaged by repeated deformations. The mechanical
   sustainability of carbon-based freestanding electrodes subjected to
   repeated electrochemical reactions with Li ions is investigated via
   nanotensile tests of individual hollow carbon nanofibers (HCNFs).
   Surprisingly, the mechanical properties of such electrodes are improved
   by repeated electrochemical reactions with Li ions, which is contrary to
   the conventional wisdom that the mechanical sustainability of
   carbon-based electrodes should be degraded by repeated electrochemical
   reactions. Microscopic studies reveal a reinforcing mechanism behind
   this improvement, namely, that inserted Li ions form irreversible
   face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystals within HCNF cavities, which can
   reinforce the carbonaceous matrix as strong second-phase particles.
   These FCC Li crystals formed within the carbon matrix create tremendous
   potential for HCNFs as freestanding electrodes for flexible batteries,
   but they also contribute to the irreversible (and thus low) capacity of
   HCNFs.}},

   field shift in the magnetoresistance curve. Tests of the device have
   shown a noticeable response to MNPs with 30 nm nominal core diameters at
   concentrations as low as 1.2 x 10(10) +/- 4.0 x 10(9) MNP/mL at a flow
   rate of 5 mu L/min. Such a device would be beneficial for bio-medical

Abstract = {{Background To evaluate and compare the perfluorocarbon liquid, silicone
   oil, and viscoelastic against standard saline, in their ability to
   dampen the impact force of a foreign body, dropped within the eye. In an
   experimental surgical model in where cohesive and adhesive forces of the
   substances are not enough to float heavy-than-water foreign bodies.
   Methods A model of ophthalmic surgery was constructed. A BB pellet was
   dropped from 24mm onto a force transducer through four different fluids:
   balanced salt solution, perfluoro-n-octane, viscoelastic, and silicone
   oil. The impact energy (force) for each case was measured and recorded
   by the force transducer. The mean force of impact for each fluid was
   compared using the Student t-test. Results Silicone oil resulted in the
   lowest force of impact. Both silicone oil and viscoelastic dampened the
   impact an order of magnitude more than perfluoro-n-octane and balanced
   salt solution. Conclusions Silicone oil and viscoelastic cushioned the
   force from a dropped BB. They may be useful adjuncts to prevent
   iatrogenic retinal injury during vitrectomy for intraocular foreign body

Title = {{Impact of collisional versus viscous dissipation on flow instabilities
   in gas-solid systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{727}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Flow instabilities encountered in the homogeneous cooling of a gas solid
   system are considered via lattice-Boltzmann simulations. Unlike previous
   efforts, the relative contribution of the two mechanisms leading to
   instabilities is explored: viscous dissipation (fluid-phase effects) and
   collisional dissipation (particle-phase effects). The results indicate
   that the instabilities encountered in the gas solid system mimic those
   previously observed in their granular (no fluid) counterparts, namely a
   velocity vortex instability that precedes in time a clustering
   instability. We further observe that the onset of the instabilities is
   quicker in more dissipative systems, regardless of the source of the
   dissipation. Somewhat surprisingly however, a cross-over of the kinetic
   energy levels is observed during the evolution of the instability.
   Specifically, the kinetic energy of the gas solid system is seen to
   become greater than that of its granular counterpart (i.e. same
   restitution coefficient) after the vortex instability sets in. This
   cross-over of kinetic energy levels between a more dissipative system
   (gas solid) and a less dissipative system (granular) can be explained by
   the alignment of particle motion found in a vortex. Such alignment leads
   to a reduction in both collisional and viscous energy dissipation due to
   the more glancing nature of collisions.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature affects a cascade of ecological processes and functions of
   forests. With future higher global temperatures being inevitable it is
   critical to understand and predict how forest ecosystems and tree
   species will respond. This paper reviews experimental warming studies in
   boreal and temperate forests or tree species beyond the direct effects
   of higher temperature on plant ecophysiology by scaling up to forest
   level responses and considering the indirect effects of higher
   temperature. In direct response to higher temperature (1) leaves emerged
   earlier and senesced later, resulting in a longer growing season (2) the
   abundance of herbivorous insects increased and their performance was
   enhanced and (3) soil nitrogen mineralization and leaf litter
   decomposition were accelerated. Besides these generalizations across
   species, plant ecophysiological traits were highly species-specific.
   Moreover, we showed that the effect of temperature on photosynthesis is
   strongly dependent on the position of the leaf or plant within the
   forest (canopy or understory) and the time of the year. Indirect effects
   of higher temperature included among others higher carbon storage in
   trees due to increased soil nitrogen availability and changes in insect
   performance due to alterations in plant ecophysiological traits.
   Unfortunately only a few studies extrapolated results to forest
   ecosystem level and considered the indirect effects of higher
   temperature. Thus more intensive, long-term studies are needed to
   further confirm the emerging trends shown in this review. Experimental
   warming studies provide us with a useful tool to examine the cascade of
   ecological processes in forest ecosystems that will change with future
   higher temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory illnesses are a significant cause of morbidity for
   individuals who work within concentrated animal feeding operations
   (CAFOs); however, most available information about CAFO aerobiology has
   derived from culture-based studies, which may detect only a small
   fraction of microbial diversity present. In this study, we characterized
   the identity, spatial distribution, and abundance of airborne
   microorganisms present in swine and dairy CAFOs using direct microscopy,
   broad-range rRNA PCR, and sequence analysis of air samples collected
   from within and nearby swine and cattle operations in the western United
   States. We report that indoor airborne bacterial loads were not elevated
   above those measured immediately outdoors. The microbial assemblage of
   these indoor environments was considerably more diverse than reported in
   previous CAFO aerosol studies. Members of bacterial genera associated
   with animal gut microbiota, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp.,
   and Lachnospira spp., were most frequently observed. We detected no
   recognized, acute respiratory pathogens, but identified the common
   opportunistic pathogen Aerococcus viridans in several samples. Fungal
   species were not recovered in any of the indoor clone libraries.
   Specific PCR assay for porcine circovirus demonstrated that this
   pathogen is prevalent in the atmosphere of swine environments sampled,
   but was not detected in the bovine dairy facilities. Copyright 2013

Abstract = {{Chemically resolved submicron (PM1) particle mass fluxes were measured
   by eddy covariance with a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass
   spectrometer over temperate and tropical forests during the BEARPEX-07
   and AMAZE-08 campaigns. Fluxes during AMAZE-08 were small and close to
   the detection limit (<1ng m(-2) s(-1)) due to low particle mass
   concentrations (<1g m(-3)). During BEARPEX-07, concentrations were five
   times larger, with mean mid-day deposition fluxes of -4.8ng m(-2) s(-1)
   for total nonrefractory PM1 (V-ex,V-PM1 = -1mm s(-1)) and emission
   fluxes of +2.6ng m(-2) s(-1) for organic PM1 (V-ex,V-org = +1mm s(-1)).
   Biosphere-atmosphere fluxes of different chemical components are
   affected by in-canopy chemistry, vertical gradients in gas-particle
   partitioning due to canopy temperature gradients, emission of primary
   biological aerosol particles, and wet and dry deposition. As a result of
   these competing processes, individual chemical components had fluxes of
   varying magnitude and direction during both campaigns. Oxygenated
   organic components representing regionally aged aerosol deposited, while
   components of fresh secondary organic aerosol (SOA) emitted. During
   BEARPEX-07, rapid in-canopy oxidation caused rapid SOA growth on the
   timescale of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. In-canopy SOA mass yields
   were 0.5-4\%. During AMAZE-08, the net organic aerosol flux was
   influenced by deposition, in-canopy SOA formation, and thermal shifts in
   gas-particle partitioning. Wet deposition was estimated to be an order
   of magnitude larger than dry deposition during AMAZE-08. Small shifts in
   organic aerosol concentrations from anthropogenic sources such as urban
   pollution or biomass burning alters the balance between flux terms. The
   semivolatile nature of the Amazonian organic aerosol suggests a feedback
   in which warmer temperatures will partition SOA to the gas-phase,
   reducing their light scattering and thus potential to cool the region.

Abstract = {{A unified microwave radiative transfer (UMRT) model is presented for
   computing the thermal radiation emitted from any geophysical medium
   composed of planar layers of either densely or tenuously distributed
   moderately sized spherical scatterers. UMRT employs the
   discrete-ordinate eigenanalysis (DOE) method with layer adding to solve
   the differential radiative transfer equation for such multilayer
   structures. UMRT inherits the symmetrization and analytical
   diagonalization and factorization techniques of symmetric and positive
   definite matrices from the discrete-ordinate tangent linear radiative
   transfer (DOTLRT) model presented by Voronovich et al. These techniques
   ensure accuracy, numerical stability, and rapid computation for all
   matrix operations required for DOE along with a fast Jacobian
   calculation for radiance assimilation purposes. UMRT extends the
   applicability of DOTLRT by including both the Mie theory and the dense
   media radiative transfer (DMRT) theory. Other nontrivial extensions
   within UMRT are the following: 1) The vertical and horizontal radiation
   intensities are coupled within each layer by applying the reduced Mie or
   DMRT phase matrices, and 2) the physical temperature profile of a layer
   is allowed to be linear in height. The symmetry properties of both the
   reduced Mie and DMRT phase matrices are proved, and the associated
   scattering and absorption coefficients are compared and discussed. The
   UMRT slab formulation is validated by imposing energy conservation, and
   the numerical results for some nominal cases are produced and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on drinking water treatment conditions, oxidation processes
   may result in the degradation of cyanobacteria cells causing the release
   of toxic metabolites (microcystin), odorous metabolites (MIB, geosmin),
   or disinfection byproduct precursors. In this study, a digital flow
   cytometer (FlowCAM (R)) in combination with chlorophyll-a analysis was
   used to evaluate the ability of ozone, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and
   chloramine to damage or lyse cyanobacteria cells added to Colorado River
   water. Microcystis aeruginosa (MA), Oscillatoria sp. (OSC) and Lyngbya
   sp. (LYN) were selected for the study due to their occurrence in surface
   water supplies, metabolite production, and morphology. Results showed
   that cell damage was observed without complete lysis or fragmentation of
   the cell membrane under many of the conditions tested. During ozone and
   chlorine experiments, the unicellular MA was more susceptible to
   oxidation than the filamentous OSC and LYN. Rate constants were
   developed based on the loss of chlorophyll-a and oxidant exposure, which
   showed the oxidants degraded MA, OSC, and LYN according to the order of
   ozone > chlorine similar to chlorine dioxide > chloramine. Digital and
   binary images taken by the digital flow cytometer provided qualitative
   insight regarding cell damage. When applying this information, drinking
   water utilities can better understand the risk of cell damage or lysis
   during oxidation processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a study to explore new materials and a new concept for
   temperature driven quasi-continuous desalination using hydrogels as draw
   agents in forward osmosis (FO). This concept is enabled by the design
   and preparation of thermally responsive hydrogels having a
   semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) structure. Thermally responsive
   semi-IPN hydrogels were synthesized by polymerization of
   N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) in the presence of polysodium acrylate
   (PSA) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Their functions as draw agents in FO
   were systematically studied and compared with hydrogels prepared from
   the PNIPAm homopolymer or the NIPAM-SA copolymer. While the semi-IPN
   hydrogels displayed the desirable balanced thermally responsive swelling
   and dewatering behavior, the NIPAm-SA copolymer hydrogels were found to
   have poor dewatering behavior, making them unsuitable for a continuous
   temperature driven desalination process. At 40 degrees C, the semi-IPN
   hydrogels rapidly release nearly 100\% of the water absorbed during the
   FO drawing process carried out at room temperature. Results clearly
   indicate the potential of semi-IPN hydrogels as semi-solid draw agents
   in the FO process, in which quasi-continuous desalination could be
   achieved by cyclic heating and cooling within a moderate temperature
   change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geomagnetic activity depends on a variety of factors including solar
   zenith angle, solar UV, strength of the interplanetary magnetic field,
   speed and density of the solar wind, orientation of the Earth's dipole,
   distance of the Earth from Sun, occurrence of CMEs and CIRs, and
   possibly other parameters. We have investigated some of these using
   state-dependant linear prediction filters. For a given state a
   prediction filter transforms a coupling function such as rectified solar
   wind electric field (VBs) to an output like the auroral electrojet index
   (AL). The area of this filter calculated from the sum of the filter
   coefficients measures the strength of the coupling. When the input and
   output are steady for a time longer than the duration of the filter the
   ratio of output to input is equal to this area. We find coupling
   strength defined in this way for Es=VBs to AL (and AU) is weakest at
   solar maximum and strongest at solar minimum. AL coupling displays a
   semiannual variation being weakest at the solstices and strongest at the
   equinoxes. AU coupling has only an annual variation being strongest at
   summer solstice. AL and AU coupling also vary with time relative to a
   stream interface. Es coupling is weaker after the interface, but ULF
   coupling is stronger. Total prediction efficiency remains about constant
   at the interface. The change in coupling strength with the solar cycle
   can be explained as an effect of more frequent saturation of the polar
   cap potential causing a smaller ratio of AL to Es. Stronger AL coupling
   at the equinoxes possibly indicates some process that makes magnetic
   reconnection less efficient when the dipole axis is tilted along the
   Earth-Sun line. Strong AU coupling at summer solstice is likely due to
   high conductivity in northern summer. Coupling changes at a stream
   interface are correlated with the presence of strong wave activity in
   ground and satellite measurements and may be an artifact of the method
   by which solar wind data are propagated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nickel nanoparticles grown on an Al2O3 support by atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) had higher selectivity for propylene hydrogenolysis.
   The Ni was deposited in a fluidized bed reactor with
   bis(cyclopentyldienyl)Ni and H-2 reactants. Varying the number of ALD
   cycles varied the Ni loading between 4.7-16.8 wt.\% and the average Ni
   particle diameters between 2.4 and 3.3 nm. The number of surface sites
   per gram of Ni, determined from CO TPD, was at least five times higher
   on ALD-prepared catalysts than typical Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by
   incipient wetness impregnation. The fraction of CO desorbed from steps
   and kinks on the ALD-prepared catalysts was at least three times higher.
   Correspondingly, the selectivity for propylene hydrogenolysis, instead
   of hydrogenation, was above 10\% on an ALD-prepared catalyst but below
   0.4\% on the incipient wetness catalyst. Preparing catalysts by ALD
   appeared to increase the step and kink site density and thus increase
   hydrogenolysis selectivity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Controlling surface crowding on a Pd catalyst with thiolate
   self-assembled monolayers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{303}},
Pages = {{92-99}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between surface crowding and catalytic activity was
   investigated using thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Pd/Al2O3
   catalysts. The surface density of the thiolate modifier was controlled
   by varying the steric bulk of the organic substituent. A straight-chain
   alkanethiol 1-octadecanethiol (C18), with a nearest-neighbor spacing of
   similar to 4.7 angstrom on Pd(111) surfaces, created a denser SAM
   coating than 1-adamantanethiol (AT) with a nearest-neighbor spacing of
   similar to 6.4 angstrom. Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy
   revealed that CO adsorbate molecules adsorbed only on threefold hollow
   and atop sites on C18-modified surfaces. On AT-modified surfaces,
   however, access to bridging and additional linear sites was also
   observed. Analysis of adsorption isotherms suggested that CO adsorption
   energies were comparable on AT-modified and C18-modified catalysts.
   Acetylene hydrogenation, which results in uncontrolled crowding due to
   carbonaceous ``coke{''} formation on the catalyst, was found to be
   insensitive to modification by the thiols. For hydrogenation reactions
   less associated with uncontrolled coking, crowding - and therefore
   reactivity - could be controlled systematically using SAMs. In
   particular, ethylene hydrogenation was 17 times faster on AT-coated
   surfaces than on C18-coated surfaces, consistent with the additional
   accessibility to specific sites unavailable on C18-modified surfaces.
   The effect of modifier density on reactivity was found to be
   dramatically different for several mono- and bi-functional reactants in
   a manner consistent with previous literature reports, suggesting that
   controlled crowding with SAMs can be used to understand reaction
   structure sensitivity and active site requirements in catalysis. (c)

Abstract = {{Owners of water/wastewater facilities can choose from several project
   delivery methods, including the traditional design-bid-build method or
   an alternative design-build method. When choosing a project delivery
   method, the owner should consider both the project goals as well as the

   delivery performance do not currently exist for the water/wastewater

   collected on 31 design-build projects and sixty-nine design-bid-build
   projects. A statistical analysis of the data determined that schedule
   growth for design-build projects was half that of design-bid-build
   projects; more design-build projects finished at or below budget; and
   both project delivery methods produced projects of comparable quality.

Abstract = {{The characteristics of concentrations of PM10-2.5, PM2.5, and PM10 at 77
   sites in the United States are evaluated. PM10 concentrations show
   strong spatial variability, with highest levels occurring in the
   southwestern United States, driven primarily by PM10-2.5, PM10-2.5 and
   PM2.5 concentrations show different spatial patterns. The highest
   concentrations of PM10-2.5 were observed at sites in the southwestern
   US, leading to the highest PM10 concentrations there. The PM2.5
   concentrations are the major contributors to the average PM10
   concentrations at many sites in the eastern United States. Poor
   correlations were generally found between PM10-2.5 and PM2.5, suggesting
   that PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 are generally influenced by different sources.
   PM10-2.5 is generally more variable than PM2.5 because PM10-2.5 has a
   higher deposition velocity and is primarily emitted from mechanical
   processes (e.g. agricultural harvest and construction) that are more
   influenced by factors including human operation and wind speed leading
   to a strong episodic nature. As a result of its high variability,
   PM10-2.5 acts as the major driver for PM10 extremes. PM10-2.5 is
   significantly correlated with PM10 at all investigated sites, with the
   average correlation value R-2 = 0.79. Correlations of PM2.5 with PM10
   (average of 037) are overall considerably lower than those between
   PM10-2.5 and PM10. Different seasonal, weekly, and diurnal patterns were
   observed between PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 at agricultural, on-road traffic,
   quarrying, airport, and marine sites. At investigated agricultural
   sites, while the concentrations of PM25 are higher in winter when there
   are few agricultural activities, PM10-2.5 concentrations are lower in
   winter months than in summer and autumn months, with highest levels
   corresponding to harvest and planting. The harvest and planting
   signatures were not observed in PM2.5 concentrations at any of these
   sites, suggesting that agricultural activities do not have a strong
   influence on PM2.5 concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This report shows that the background magnetic field in biological
   incubators can vary by orders of magnitude within and between
   incubators. These variations can be observed within the same incubator
   in locations that are centimeters apart from each other as well as
   between incubators that are identical and located in the same
   laboratory. Additionally, the values measured were frequently outside
   the range of magnitudes found naturally on the Earth's surface or
   ordinary habitation spaces. Exposure to such altered magnetic field
   environments has been experimentally shown to be sufficient to cause
   numerous effects in cell cultures. Examples of the effects reported span
   from differential generation of free radicals and heat shock proteins to
   differences in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and death.
   Although the effects are not well established and the molecular
   mechanism of action is currently under debate, these observations alone
   support the notion that the inhomogeneity of the background magnetic
   field in incubators is a potential confounding source of the variability
   and reproducibility for studies performed on cell cultures. In this
   regard, it is recommended that special measures be adopted to control
   the background magnetic fields in incubators when investigating the
   biological effects of exposure to magnetic fields of comparable
   characteristics as the ones measured in this study, or when studying
   small biological effects in general. Bioelectromagnetics 34:337-348,

Abstract = {{This research effort studies the use of redundant induction coil gauges
   to reduce state estimation uncertainties for moving Lagrangian points
   (LPs); e.g. discrete points, moving interfaces, projectiles, etc. The
   technique embeds a small, high-strength magnet at the LP and
   simultaneously tracks the magnet continuously with five (5) or more
   induction coils along a single axis of motion. A calibrated coil gauge
   model is presented as a function of LP position and velocity. The
   optimized LP state (position and velocity) estimate based upon redundant
   LP observations allows direct solution for LP velocity; requiring only
   one differentiation step to obtain acceleration. A specific experimental
   implementation (Particulate Materials Meso-scale Diagnostics system) is
   simulated to evaluate and minimize the expected state estimation errors.
   Induction coil signals with various levels of noise are simulated based
   upon a prescribed LP state variation with time. The state optimization
   algorithm attempts to recover the truth state values. Worst-case
   position estimation errors of +/- 0.3 mm and velocity estimation errors
   of +/- 0.46 m/s are determined for LPs travelling 0-1,000 m/s at
   realistic in-lab data noise levels.}},

   Coulomb formations}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{89-97}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The results of a stability analysis focusing on the out-of-plane motion
   of collinear three-craft Coulomb formations with set charges are
   discussed. Such a formation is assumed to be spinning in deep space
   without relevant gravitational forces present. Assuming in-plane motion
   only with circular relative trajectories and initial position and
   velocity perturbations confined to the orbital plane, the previous work
   analytically proves marginal stability in the linear sense and
   numerically shows marginal stability in the short term. In this paper,
   the equations of motion are presented in the cylindrical coordinate
   frame in order to analyze the out-of-plane motion in more detail. The
   outof-plane motion is shown to decouple to first order from the
   marginally stable in-plane motion. A simple control law is developed and
   applied, which directly controls the out-of-plane motion only within
   specified deadbands. For a wide variety of out-of-plane perturbations,
   the control law succeeds in preserving the in-plane variant shape
   despite some out-of-plane motion. A trend between the settling time and
   deadband, which defines the largest out-of-plane errors allowed before
   the controller is turned on, is determined, which illustrates how large
   the deadband may be before the in-plane motion is affected. (C) 2013

Title = {{Impact of a biofouling layer on the vapor pressure driving force and
   performance of a membrane distillation process}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{438}},
Pages = {{140-152}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The heat and mass transfer resistances of fouling layers can cause a
   significant flux decline in a membrane distillation (MD) process. In
   addition, the hydrophilicity and microporous nature of a fouling layer
   can affect the driving force and correspondingly the flux in MD via
   curvature effects on the vapor pressure as described by the Kelvin
   equation. This study explores the effect of the hydrophilicity of the
   sludge on the particle size, vapor pressure and pore-size distribution
   (PSD) in the biofouling layer and on the permeation flux in cross-flow
   MD. Two sets of hydrophilic sludge cultures were selected via the
   Microbial-Adhesion-to-Hydrocarbon method. Cross-flow MD experiments
   conducted with these two sludges displayed a 60\% reduction in the flux
   relative to using a Milli-Q water feed. However, there was no
   significant difference in the fluxes for the two sludges.
   Characterization of the pore-size distribution of the two sludges using
   evapoporometry, a novel technique based on the vapor-pressure depression
   caused by small pores, indicated a vapor-pressure depression of 31\% and
   21\% for the more- and less-hydrophilic sludges, respectively. However
   the effect of the 10\% difference in vapor-pressure depression, when
   combined with the effect of the biofouling layer on the heat- and
   mass-transfer resistances, could not be detected within the experimental
   error in this study. Nevertheless, a major conclusion is that the
   vapor-pressure depression caused by a biofouling layer, or other
   foulants, could cause a significant reduction in the driving force for
   MD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic membranes are used in applications such as controlled drug
   release, artificial organs, smart sensors, and water treatment that
   require knowing the pore-size distribution (PSD). Current PSD
   characterization methods can require dedicated and/or expensive
   equipment as well as special expertise to implement. Evapoporometry (EP)
   is a novel characterization technique based on vapor pressure depression
   that can accurately determine the pore size for ultrafiltration
   membranes using a simple diffusion cell and a microbalance. A
   straightforward characterization procedure and comprehensive error
   analysis are described. EP characterization of the PSD of a 100 nm
   bilayer Anopore (TM) membrane used as a standard is shown to compare
   favorably with the nominal pore diameter, FESEM analysis, and analyses
   reported by prior investigators. In addition, EP is utilized for PSD
   characterization of commercially fabricated 20 and 50 nm polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) membranes for which the results are compared with those
   obtained via liquid displacement porometry (LDP). The mean pore
   diameters determined by EP and LDP are in good agreement for the 50 nm
   PVDF membranes, but the lower values obtained via LDP for the 20 nm PVDF
   membranes may reflect the effects of high pressures that are not
   required in EP. The advantages and limitations of EP as well as other
   potential applications of this technique are discussed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{High modulus two-stage reactive polymer systems are fabricated and
   characterized in regards to their thermomechanical properties and
   behavior. The polymer networks comprise thiol-acrylate formulations in
   which a polymer matrix is initially formed via an amine catalyzed
   thiol-Michael addition `click' reaction, eventually followed by
   photoinitiated, free radical polymerization of the excess acrylic
   functional groups to result in formation of a highly crosslinked, high
   modulus polymer material. Composites were formed and evaluated using two
   distinct polymerizable thiol-acrylate formulations, each with three
   different filler types. Here, the fillers were used primarily to improve
   the mechanical performance of the polymer material following the initial
   Michael addition reaction though improvements were also observed in some
   materials following the photopolymerization as well. The fillers used
   were 0.7 mu m methacrylated silica particles, translucent Kevlar veil
   and PET mesh. Thermomechanical analysis showed that the fillers resulted
   in a significant increase in the modulus in both the polymer networks
   formed at the end of each of the orthogonal reactions without a
   significant change in the glass transition temperatures (T-g). The
   two-stage matrix formed with a hexa-acrylate matrix and 20 volume \%
   silica particles showed a 125\% increase in the modulus at the end of
   the Michael-addition reaction and a 100\% increase in the modulus after
   photopolymerization of the acrylates, when compared with the modulus of
   the unfilled polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic loading has emerged as an important part of cartilage tissue
   engineering strategies for enhancing tissue production and producing
   cartilage with functionally competent mechanical properties. As patients
   in need of cartilage span a range of age groups, questions arise as to
   the role of age in a cell's ability to respond to dynamic loading.
   Therefore, this study's goal was to characterize age-related anabolic
   and catabolic responses of chondrocytes to dynamic compressive loading.
   Bovine chondrocytes isolated from juvenile (3-week-old) and adult (2- to
   3-year-old) donors were encapsulated in poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels
   and subjected to dynamic loading applied intermittently in a sinusoidal
   waveform at 1 or 0.3Hz with 5 or 10\% amplitude strain up to 2 weeks.
   Loading significantly enhanced total sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG)
   production by 220\% for juvenile chondrocytes with 0.3Hz/5\% loading and
   by 88\% for adult chondrocytes with 1Hz/5\% loading, while all other
   loading regimes did not affect or inhibited total sGAG production.
   Contrarily, deposition of larger matrix molecules of aggrecan and
   collagen II was either not affected or inhibited by loading. Collagen VI
   deposition was significantly upregulated by loading but only in adult
   chondrocytes and under different loading regimes (1Hz/10\% and
   0.3Hz/5\%) when compared to total sGAGs. Both cell populations displayed
   catabolic activity, which appeared to be stimulated by loading. Taken
   together, findings from this study suggest that loading differentially
   regulates matrix synthesis and the response is highly dependent on donor
   age. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 2046-2057. (c) 2013 Wiley

   to geometrically nonlinear problems is enabled by a corotational
   kinematic description, and that to material nonlinear problems by an
   optimization-based solution algorithm. The approach thus comprises three
   ingredients the development of a high performance linear finite element
   (for example, using the ANDES concept), a corotational kinematic
   description, and an optimization algorithm. The main constraint in the
   application of the corotational formulation is restriction to small
   deformational displacements. The paper illustrates the realization of
   the three ingredients on plane stress problems that exhibit
   elasto-plastic material behavior. Numerical examples are presented to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. Comparison is made with
   respect to solutions provided by the commercial nonlinear code ABAQUS as
   reference. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To improve estimates of remote contributions of dust to fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) in the western United States, new dust particle size
   distributions (PSDs) based upon scale-invariant fragmentation theory
   (Kok\_PSD) with constraints from in situ measurements (IMP\_PSD) are
   implemented in a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). Compared to
   initial simulations, this leads to reductions in the mass of emitted
   dust particles with radii <1.8 mu m by 40\%-60\%. Consequently, the
   root-mean-square error in simulated fine dust concentrations compared to
   springtime surface observations in the western United States is reduced
   by 67\%-81\%. The ratio of simulated fine to coarse PM mass is also
   improved, which is not achievable by reductions in total dust emissions.
   The IMP\_PSD best represents the PSD of dust transported from remote
   sources and reduces modeled PM2.5 concentrations up to 5 mu g/m(3) over
   the western United States, which is important when considering sources
   contributing to nonattainment of air quality standards.}},

Title = {{Detailed chemical characterization of unresolved complex mixtures in
   atmospheric organics: Insights into emission sources, atmospheric
   processing, and secondary organic aerosol formation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) are
   important precursors to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in urban
   atmospheres. However, knowledge of the chemical composition of SVOCs is
   limited by current analytical techniques, which are typically unable to
   resolve a large number of constitutional isomers. Using a combination of
   gas chromatography and soft photoionization mass spectrometry, we
   characterize the unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of semivolatile
   aliphatic hydrocarbons observed in Pasadena, California (similar to 16km
   NE of downtown Los Angeles), and Bakersfield, California, during the
   California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change 2010.
   To the authors' knowledge, this work represents the most detailed
   characterization of the UCM in atmospheric samples to date. Knowledge of
   molecular structures, including carbon number, alkyl branching, and
   number of rings, provides important constraints on the rate of
   atmospheric processing, as the relative amounts of branched and linear
   alkanes are shown to be a function of integrated exposure to hydroxyl
   radicals. Emissions of semivolatile branched alkanes from fossil
   fuel-related sources are up to an order of magnitude higher than those
   of linear alkanes, and the gas-phase OH rate constants of branched
   alkanes are similar to 30\% higher than their linear isomers. Based on a
   box model considering gas/particle partitioning, emissions, and reaction
   rates, semivolatile branched alkanes are expected to play a more
   important role than linear alkanes in the photooxidation of the UCM and
   subsequent transformations into SOA. Detailed speciation of semivolatile
   compounds therefore provides essential understanding of SOA sources and
   formation processes in urban areas.}},

Title = {{Intermittent Molecular Hopping at the Solid-Liquid Interface}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{The mobility of molecules on a solid surface plays a key role in diverse
   phenomena such as friction and self-assembly and in surface-based
   technologies like heterogeneous catalysis and molecular targeting. To
   understand and control these surface processes, a universally applicable
   model of surface transport at solid-liquid interfaces is needed.
   However, unlike diffusion at a solid-gas interface, little is known
   about the mechanisms of diffusion at a solid-liquid interface. Using
   single-molecule tracking at a solid-liquid interface, we found that a
   diverse set of molecules underwent intermittent random walks with
   non-Gaussian displacements. This contrasts with the normal random walk
   and Gaussian statistics that are commonly assumed for molecular surface
   diffusion. The molecules became temporarily immobilized for random
   waiting times between surface displacements produced by excursions
   through the bulk fluid. A common power-law distribution of waiting times
   indicated a spectrum of binding energies. We propose that intermittent
   hopping is universal to molecular surface diffusion at a solid-liquid
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{We study the role of individual reaction rates on engine performance,
   with an emphasis on the contribution of quantum tunneling. It is
   demonstrated that the effect of quantum tunneling corrections for the
   reaction HO2 + HO2 = H2O2 +O-2 can have a noticeable impact on the
   performance of a high-fidelity model of a compression-ignition (e.g.,
   diesel) engine, and that an accurate prediction of ignition delay time
   for the engine model requires an accurate estimation of the tunneling
   correction for this reaction. The three-dimensional model includes
   detailed descriptions of the chemistry of a surrogate for a biodiesel
   fuel, as well as all the features of the engine, such as the liquid fuel
   spray and turbulence. This study is part of a larger investigation of
   how the features of the dynamics and potential energy surfaces of key
   reactions, as well as their reaction rate uncertainties, affect engine
   performance, and results in these directions are also presented here.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of total organic halogen (TOX), carbonaceous disinfection
   byproducts (DBPs) (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)),
   and nitrogenous DBPs (trichloronitromethane (TCNM) or chloropicrin,
   haloacetonitriles (HANs), and nitrosamines) was examined during the
   chlorination or chloramination of intracellular organic matter (IOM)
   extracted from Microcystis aeruginosa, Oscillatoria sp. (OSC), and
   Lyngbya sp. (LYN). The percentage of unknown TOX (22-38\%) during
   chlorination indicated that the majority of DBPs were identified among
   THMs, HAAs, TCNM, and HANs. Bromide was readily incorporated into DBPs
   with speciation shifting slightly from dihalogenated species to
   trihalogenated species. During formation potential testing with
   chloramines, nitrosamine yields from IOM were measured for
   N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA, 10-52 ng/mg(C)), N-nitrosopyrrolidine
   (NPYR, 14 ng/mg(C)), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP, 3.7-5.5 ng/mg(C)), and
   N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA, 2.1-2.6 ng/mg(C)). When IOM was added
   to a natural water matrix, the nitrosamine yields were not realized
   likely due to competition from natural organic matter. Ozonation
   increased NDMA and NMEA formation and reduced NPYR and NPIP formation
   during subsequent chloramination. In addition, ozone oxidation of IOM
   formed detectable concentrations of aldehydes, which may contribute to
   DBP formation. Finally, bioluminescence-based test results showed that
   >99\% of the IOM extracted from OSC and LYN was biodegradable.
   Therefore, a biological treatment process could minimize this source of
   DBP precursor material during drinking water treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Singlet fission occurs when a single exciton splits into multiple
   electron-hole pairs, and could dramatically increase the efficiency of
   organic solar cells by converting high energy photons into multiple
   charge carriers. Scientists might exploit singlet fission to its full
   potential by first understanding the underlying mechanism of this
   quantum mechanical process. The pursuit of this fundamental mechanism
   has recently benefited from the development and application of new
   correlated wave function methods. These-methods called restricted active
   space spin flip-can capture the most important electron interactions in
   molecular materials, such as acene crystals, at low computational cost
   It is unrealistic to use previous wave function methods due to the
   excessive computational cost involved in simulating realistic molecular
   structures at a meaningful level of electron correlation.
   In this Account, we describe how we use these techniques to compute
   single exciton and multiple exciton excited states in tetracene and
   pentacene crystals in order to understand how a single exciton generated
   from photon absorption undergoes fission to generate two triplets. Our
   studies indicate that an adiabatic charge transfer intermediate is
   unlikely to contribute significantly to the fission process because it
   lies too high in energy. Instead, we propose a new mechanism that
   involves the direct coupling of an optically allowed single exciton to
   an optically dark multiexciton. This coupling is facilitated by
   intermolecular motion of two acene monomers that drives nonadiabatic
   population transfer between the two states. This transfer occurs in the
   limit of near degeneracies between adiabatic states where the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation of fixed nuclei is no longer valid.
   Existing theories for singlet fission have not considered this type of
   coupling between states and, therefore, cannot describe this mechanism.
   The direct mechanism through intermolecular motion describes many
   experimentally observed characteristics of these materials, such as the
   ultrafast time scale of photobleaching and triplet generation during
   singlet fission in pentacene. We believe this newly discovered mechanism
   provides fundamental insight to guide the creation of new solar
   materials that exhibit high efficiencies through multiple charge
   generation.}},

Title = {{Interaction of two plasmon modes in the organic photovoltaic devices
   with patterned back-electrode}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{We designed and fabricated silver grating structures on the
   back-electrodes of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices to achieve
   absorption enhancement. The observed enhancement is attributed to
   several effects, including scattering through corrugated grating surface
   and surface plasmon modes generated by periodic plasmonic structure. Two
   plasmon modes are identified in our structure: localized surface plasmon
   (LSP) and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes. The former exists near
   the absorption edge of the active material and extends the absorption
   band while the latter provides an absorption pathway in the sub-gap
   region. Also, LSP is insensitive to active layer thickness and grating
   period, while the SPP which is excited whenever the momentum matching
   condition is satisfied shows strong dependence on active layer thickness
   and grating period. The two modes also exhibit strong interaction as
   indicated by anti-crossing behavior and thus the interplay between the
   two modes must be considered for back-electrode design. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Ozone profiles in the upper mesosphere (70-100km) retrieved from nine
   instruments are compared. Ozone from the Sounding of the Atmosphere
   using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument is used as the
   basis of comparison. Other measurements are from the Halogen Occultation
   Experiment, the High Resolution Doppler Imager, the Michelson
   Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding, the Global Ozone
   Monitoring by Occultation of Stars, the Atmospheric Chemistry
   ExperimentFourier Transform Spectrometer, the Solar Occultation For Ice
   Experiment, the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System, and
   the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder.
   Comparisons of each data set with SABER using coincident profiles
   indicate agreement in the basic vertical profile of ozone but also some
   systematic differences in daytime ozone. Ozone from the SABER 9.6m
   channel is higher than the other measurements over the altitude range
   60-80km by 20-50\%. Nighttime comparisons indicate better relative
   agreement (<10\% difference). Taking all the data, not limited to
   coincidences, shows the global and seasonal distributions of ozone in
   the upper mesosphere from each instrument. The average maximum in ozone
   mixing ratio is around 90-92km during daytime and 95km at night. There
   is a maximum in ozone density at night (approximate to 90km) and during
   some hours of the day. The latitude structure of ozone has appreciable
   variations with season, particularly in the tropical upper mesosphere.
   The basic latitude-altitude structure of ozone depends on local time,
   even when the analysis is restricted to day-only observations.}},

Abstract = {{The California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change
   (CalNex) field study was conducted throughout California in May, June,
   and July of 2010. The study was organized to address issues
   simultaneously relevant to atmospheric pollution and climate change,
   including (1) emission inventory assessment, (2) atmospheric transport
   and dispersion, (3) atmospheric chemical processing, and (4)
   cloud-aerosol interactions and aerosol radiative effects. Measurements
   from networks of ground sites, a research ship, tall towers,
   balloon-borne ozonesondes, multiple aircraft, and satellites provided in
   situ and remotely sensed data on trace pollutant and greenhouse gas
   concentrations, aerosol chemical composition and microphysical
   properties, cloud microphysics, and meteorological parameters. This
   overview report provides operational information for the variety of
   sites, platforms, and measurements, their joint deployment strategy, and
   summarizes findings that have resulted from the collaborative analyses
   of the CalNex field study. Climate-relevant findings from CalNex include
   that leakage from natural gas infrastructure may account for the excess
   of observed methane over emission estimates in Los Angeles. Air-quality
   relevant findings include the following: mobile fleet VOC significantly
   declines, and NOx emissions continue to have an impact on ozone in the
   Los Angeles basin; the relative contributions of diesel and gasoline
   emission to secondary organic aerosol are not fully understood; and
   nighttime NO3 chemistry contributes significantly to secondary organic
   aerosol mass in the San Joaquin Valley. Findings simultaneously relevant
   to climate and air quality include the following: marine vessel
   emissions changes due to fuel sulfur and speed controls result in a net
   warming effect but have substantial positive impacts on local air
   quality.}},

   2km/s have been observed, which can deposit large amounts of energy into
   the high-latitude thermosphere. In this study, we analyze an interval on
   5 April 2010 where there was a strong dawnward impulse in the IMF,
   followed by a gradual decay in IMF magnitude at constant clock angle.
   Data from the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar and the Defense
   Meteorological Satellite Program spacecraft were used to investigate
   ionospheric convection during this interval, and data from the Active
   Magnetospheric and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment
   (AMPERE) were used to investigate the associated Field-Aligned Current
   (FAC) system. Additionally, data from AMPERE were used to investigate
   the time response of the dawnside FAC pair. We find there is a delay of
   approximately 1.25h between the arrival of the dawnward IMF impulse at
   the magnetopause and strength of the dawnward FAC pair, which is
   comparable to substorm growth and expansion time scales under southward
   IMF. Additionally, we find at the time of the peak FAC, there is
   evidence of a reconfiguring four-sheet FAC system in the morning local
   time sector of the ionosphere. Additionally, we find an inverse
   correlation between the dawn FAC strength and both the solar wind
   Alfvenic Mach number and the SYM-H index. No statistically significant
   correlation between the FAC strength and the solar wind dynamic pressure
   was found.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of volcanic plumes, especially ash-laden ones, is important
   both for public health and aircraft safety. A variety of geophysical
   tools and satellite data are used to monitor volcanic eruptions and to
   predict the movement of ash. However, satellite-based methods are
   restricted by time of day and weather, while radars are often
   unavailable because of cost/portability. Here a method is proposed to
   detect volcanic plumes using GPS signal strength data. The strengths and
   limitations of the method are assessed using GPS data collected during
   the 2008 and 2009 eruptions of the Okmok and Mt. Redoubt volcanoes.
   Plume detections using this GPS technique are consistent with
   independently collected seismic and radar data.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the results of over twenty laboratory granular activated carbon
   (GAC) column runs, models were developed and utilized for the prediction
   of 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) breakthrough behavior at parts per trillion
   levels and verified with pilot-scale data. The influent MIB
   concentration was found not to impact the concentration normalized
   breakthrough. Increasing influent background dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) concentration was found to systematically decrease the GAC
   adsorption capacity for MIB. A series of empirical models were developed
   that related the throughput in bed volumes for a range of MIB
   breakthrough targets to the influent DOM concentration. The proportional
   diffusivity (PD) designed rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) could be
   directly used to scale-up MIB breakthrough performance below 15\%
   breakthrough. The empirical model to predict the throughput to 50\%
   breakthrough based on the influent DOM concentration served as input to
   the pore diffusion model (PDM) and well-predicted the MIB breakthrough
   performance below a 50\% breakthrough. The PDM predictions of throughput
   to 10\% breakthrough well simulated the PD-RSSCT and pilot-scale 10\%

Abstract = {{Formation of cirrus clouds depends on the availability of ice nuclei to
   begin condensation of atmospheric water vapor. Although it is known that
   only a small fraction of atmospheric aerosols are efficient ice nuclei,
   the critical ingredients that make those aerosols so effective have not
   been established. We have determined in situ the composition of the
   residual particles within cirrus crystals after the ice was sublimated.
   Our results demonstrate that mineral dust and metallic particles are the
   dominant source of residual particles, whereas sulfate and organic
   particles are underrepresented, and elemental carbon and biological
   materials are essentially absent. Further, composition analysis combined
   with relative humidity measurements suggests that heterogeneous freezing
   was the dominant formation mechanism of these clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Topological defects that form on surfaces of ordered media, dubbed
   boojums, are ubiquitous in superfluids, liquid crystals (LCs), Langmuir
   monolayers, and Bose-Einstein condensates. They determine supercurrents
   in superfluids, impinge on electrooptical switching in polymer-dispersed
   LCs, and mediate chemical response at nematic-isotropic fluid
   interfaces, but the role of surface topology in the appearance,
   stability, and core structure of these defects remains poorly
   understood. Here, we demonstrate robust generation of boojums by
   controlling surface topology of colloidal particles that impose
   tangential boundary conditions for the alignment of LC molecules. To do
   this, we design handlebody-shaped polymer particles with different genus
   g. When introduced into a nematic LC, these particles distort the
   nematic molecular alignment field while obeying topological constraints
   and induce at least 2g - 2 boojums that allow for topological charge
   conservation. We characterize 3D textures of boojums using polarized
   nonlinear optical imaging of molecular alignment and explain our
   findings by invoking symmetry considerations and numerical modeling of
   experiment-matching director fields, order parameter variations, and
   nontrivial handle-shaped core structure of defects. Finally, we discuss
   how this interplay between the topologies of colloidal surfaces and
   boojums may lead to controlled self-assembly of colloidal particles in
   nematic and paranematic hosts, which, in turn, may enable reconfigurable
   topological composites.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic volume changes during the past 21 thousand years are smaller
   than previously thought, and here we construct an ice sheet history that
   drives a forward model prediction of the glacial isostatic adjustment
   (GIA) gravity signal. The new model, in turn, should give predictions
   that are constrained with recent uplift data. The impact of the GIA
   signal on a Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Antarctic
   mass balance estimate depends on the specific GRACE analysis method
   used. For the method described in this paper, the GIA contribution to
   the apparent surface mass change is re-evaluated to be +5513 Gt/yr by
   considering a revised ice history model and a parameter search for
   vertical motion predictions that best fit the GPS observations at 18
   high-quality stations. Although the GIA model spans a range of possible
   Earth rheological structure values, the data are not yet sufficient for
   solving for a preferred value of upper and lower mantle viscosity nor
   for a preferred lithospheric thickness. GRACE monthly solutions from the
   Center for Space Research Release 04 (CSR-RL04) release time series from
   January 2003 to the beginning of January 2012, uncorrected for GIA,
   yield an ice mass rate of +2.9 29 Gt/yr. The new GIA correction
   increases the solved-for ice mass imbalance of Antarctica to -5734
   Gt/yr. The revised GIA correction is smaller than past GRACE estimates
   by about 50 to 90 Gt/yr. The new upper bound to the sea level rise from
   the Antarctic ice sheet, averaged over the time span 2003.0-2012.0, is
   about 0.160.09 mm/yr.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal ecosystems represent a large carbon (C) reservoir and a
   substantial source of greenhouse gases. Hydrologic conditions dictate
   whether C leached from boreal soils is processed in catchments or
   flushed to less productive environments via the stream. This study
   quantified hydrologic and biogeochemical C loss from a boreal catchment
   underlain by frozen silt, where flowpaths may deepen as the active layer
   thaws over the summer. We hypothesized a decrease in the magnitude of C
   mineralization over the summer associated with changing flowpaths and
   decreasing hydrologic connectivity, organic matter lability, and
   nitrogen (N) availability. Conservative tracers were used to partition C
   and N loss between catchment export and biogeochemical processing.
   Coupling tracers with tributary and porewater chemistry indicated C and
   N cycling in soil flowpaths, with an exponential decrease over the
   summer. Nitrate was primarily reduced in hillslope flowpaths and the
   lack of N reaching the stream appeared to limit C mineralization. Stream
   export accounted for the greatest loss of C, removing 247 and 113mol
   hr(-1) in the early and late summer, respectively. Reactivity was
   related to hydrologic connectivity between the soils and stream, which
   was greatest early in the summer and following a large flood. While a
   warming climate may increase storage potential in thawed soils, the
   early-season flush of labile material and late-season runoff through
   mineral flowpaths may maintain high C export rates. Therefore, we
   highlight physical export as a dominant cause of aqueous C loss from
   silty catchments as the Arctic continues to thaw.}},

Abstract = {{Alluvial river channels are intrinsically mobile. We mapped channel
   planform extent in a series of experiments to measure instantaneous
   rates of channel motion, loss of planform overlap with the original
   positions of the channels, and reworking of the fluvial surface over
   which the channels moved. These experiments comprise two aggrading
   deltas, one subsiding delta that underwent cyclical base level changes,
   and one braided channel system that was seeded with vegetation. We find
   that the amounts of channel planform overlap and remaining unreworked
   fluvial surface area both decay exponentially with time, and that these
   metrics and the instantaneously-measured rates of channel motion scale
   predictably with one another in spite of the different time scales of
   the processes they record. Rates of channel planform change increase
   with increasing sediment flux and bed and planform irregularity, and
   decrease with the establishment of riparian vegetation. Aggradation does
   not noticeably affect channel mobility, but induces avulsions that allow
   the channels to more rapidly rework the fluvial surface. Additional
   findings include that: (1) sediment flux in the braided experiment
   equals its rate of bar migration, (2) channel widths are normally
   distributed with time, and (3) we can use our channel mobility metrics
   to connect surface processes with the resultant fluvial stratigraphy.}},

   Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE) project are applied
   to six three-dimensional thermomechanical ice-sheet models to assess
   Antarctic ice sheet sensitivity over a 500year timescale and to inform
   future modeling and field studies. Results indicate (i) growth with
   warming, except within low-latitude basins (where inland thickening is
   outpaced by marginal thinning); (ii) mass loss with enhanced sliding
   (with basins dominated by high driving stresses affected more than
   basins with low-surface-slope streaming ice); and (iii) mass loss with
   enhanced ice shelf melting (with changes in West Antarctica dominating
   the signal due to its marine setting and extensive ice shelves; cf.
   minimal impact in the Terre Adelie, George V, Oates, and Victoria Land
   region of East Antarctica). Ice loss due to dynamic changes associated
   with enhanced sliding and/or sub-shelf melting exceeds the gain due to
   increased precipitation. Furthermore, differences in results between and
   within basins as well as the controlling impact of sub-shelf melting on
   ice dynamics highlight the need for improved understanding of basal
   conditions, grounding-zone processes, ocean-ice interactions, and the
   numerical representation of all three.}},

Abstract = {{The Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE) effort explores
   the sensitivity of the current generation of ice sheet models to
   external forcing to gain insight into the potential future contribution
   to sea level from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. All
   participating models simulated the ice sheet response to three types of
   external forcings: a change in oceanic condition, a warmer atmospheric
   environment, and enhanced basal lubrication. Here an analysis of the
   spatial response of the Greenland ice sheet is presented, and the impact
   of model physics and spin-up on the projections is explored. Although
   the modeled responses are not always homogeneous, consistent spatial
   trends emerge from the ensemble analysis, indicating distinct
   vulnerabilities of the Greenland ice sheet. There are clear response
   patterns associated with each forcing, and a similar mass loss at the
   full ice sheet scale will result in different mass losses at the
   regional scale, as well as distinct thickness changes over the ice
   sheet. All forcings lead to an increased mass loss for the coming
   centuries, with increased basal lubrication and warmer ocean conditions
   affecting mainly outlet glaciers, while the impacts of atmospheric
   forcings affect the whole ice sheet.}},

Abstract = {{A recent method in the seismic assessment of structures is Endurance
   Time Analysis (ETA). ETA is a time-history-based dynamic pushover
   procedure, in which structures are subjected to gradually intensifying
   acceleration functions called Endurance Time Acceleration Functions
   (ETAFs), and their performances are evaluated based on the equivalent
   intensity level that they can endure while satisfying required
   performance goals. In this paper, the accuracy of the ETA in the seismic
   assessment of steel moment resisting frames is compared with the Time
   History Analysis (THA) and Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) methods.
   For this purpose, a set of mid-rise and high-rise frames were selected
   as a case study. Three sets of second generation ETAFs were used as
   input in the ETA method, and seven scaled ground motions were used for
   THA and IDA. It was found that ETA can estimate THA results in an
   equivalent target time, and also the general trend of IDA curves, with
   acceptable accuracy, while ETA requires considerably less computational
   effort in comparison with THA, and, especially, the IDA method. (C) 2013

Title = {{Role of strain magnitude on the deformation response of

Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{174-190}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports an investigation into the deformation response of
   geosynthetic-reinforced soil layers to evaluate the level of strain
   required to mobilize reinforcement mechanisms during surface loading.
   Specifically, an assessment of data from previous studies reporting
   surface settlements of reinforced and unreinforced soil layers during
   monotonic or cyclic loading to failure is complemented with new dynamic
   tests performed at small-and medium-strain magnitudes. A series of test
   sections with and without geosynthetic reinforcement were characterized
   using a Vibroseis shaker truck as a dynamic loading source. The behavior
   of uniform sand layers under relatively small strain magnitudes (shear
   strain magnitudes less than 0.2\%) were characterized using embedded
   geophones. Shear and normal strain distributions within the test
   sections were measured as a function of depth during application of
   surface shear loading. The presence of geosynthetic reinforcement
   (either geogrid or geotextile) at a depth of 254 mm below the surface of
   the sand layer does not significantly alter the distributions of shear
   strain or vertical normal strain relative to an unreinforced control
   section for the magnitudes of shear and compressive strains applied to
   the soil surface. The behavior of aggregate base layers overlying sand
   layers under medium strain magnitudes (surface deflections up to 25 mm)
   were characterized using an array of LVDTs on the soil surface. Surface
   deflection basins were measured during application of several thousand
   cycles of compressive loading. The presence of a geogrid within the
   aggregate base layer or a woven geotextile beneath the aggregate base
   layer were observed not to lead to a change in the surface deflection
   basins up to a maximum deflection of 25 mm. These observations, together
   with results from the literature, indicate that reinforcement mechanisms
   such as lateral restraint and the tensioned-membrane effect may not be
   mobilized until reaching relatively large displacements in some soil
   layers.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of 408 monsoon low-pressure systems (MLPSs) including 196
   monsoon depressions (MDs) that formed in the Bay of Bengal during the
   1951-2007 period, and the gridded analysis of daily rainfall fields for
   the same period, were used to identify the association of antecedent
   rainfall (1 week average rainfall prior to the genesis of MLPS) with the
   genesis of MLPS and length of inland penetration by MDs. Prestorm
   rainfall is treated as a surrogate to prestorm ground wetness conditions
   due to unavailability of historical soil-moisture data over the monsoon
   region. These observations were analyzed using self-organizing maps
   (SOMs) to group nine different prestorm monsoon rainfall patterns into
   different transition states like active, active-to-break,
   break-to-active, break, etc. The analysis indicates that MLPS are four
   times more likely to form on a day during active monsoon state compared
   to break state. Analysis of MLPSs linked to each monsoon state
   represented by SOM nodes shows that MDs with higher inland penetration
   were associated with higher antecedent rainfall. On the other hand,
   there was no significant difference in low-level atmospheric circulation
   for MDs with shortest and longest inland penetration.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3618-3625}},

Abstract = {{During in situ remediation, a treatment solution is often injected into
   a contaminated aquifer to degrade the groundwater contaminant. Since
   contaminant degradation reactions occur only at locations where the
   treatment solution and groundwater contaminant overlap, mixing of the
   treatment solution and the contaminated groundwater is necessary for
   reaction to occur. Mixing results from molecular diffusion and
   pore-scale dispersion, which operate over small length scales; thus,
   mixing during in situ remediation can only occur where the separation
   distance between the treatment solution and contaminated groundwater is
   small. To promote mixing, advection can be used to spread the treatment
   solution into the contaminated groundwater to increase the extent of the
   region where the two solutions coexist. A certain degree of passive
   spreading is the natural consequence of aquifer heterogeneity, which is
   manifested as macrodispersion. An alternative mechanism is active
   spreading, in which unsteady flows lead to stretching and folding of
   plumes. Active spreading can be accomplished by engineered injection and
   extraction (EIE), in which clean water is injected and extracted at
   wells surrounding a contaminant plume to create unsteady flow fields
   that stretch and fold the treatment solution and contaminant plumes. For
   a model system in which nested plumes of two reactants undergo scalar
   transport and instantaneous reaction, the simulation results reported
   here indicate that EIE enhances degradation of groundwater contamination
   in homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers compared to baseline models
   without EIE. Furthermore, this study shows that the amount of reaction
   provided by the spreading due to EIE is greater than the amount of
   reaction due to}},

Title = {{Comparison of kinetic and extended magnetohydrodynamics computational
   models for the linear ion temperature gradient instability in slab
   geometry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We perform linear stability studies of the ion temperature gradient
   (ITG) instability in unsheared slab geometry using kinetic and extended
   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models, in the regime k(parallel
   to)/k(perpendicular to) << 1. The ITG is a parallel (to B) sound wave
   that may be destabilized by finite ion Larmor radius (FLR) effects in
   the presence of a gradient in the equilibrium ion temperature. The ITG
   is stable in both ideal and resistive MHD; for a given temperature scale
   length L-Ti0, instability requires that either k(perpendicular to)rho(i)
   or rho(i)/L-Ti0 be sufficiently large. Kinetic models capture FLR
   effects to all orders in either parameter. In the extended MHD model,
   these effects are captured only to lowest order by means of the
   Braginskii ion gyro-viscous stress tensor and the ion diamagnetic heat
   flux. We present the linear electrostatic dispersion relations for the
   ITG for both kinetic Vlasov and extended MHD (two-fluid) models in the
   local approximation. In the low frequency fluid regime, these reduce to
   the same cubic equation for the complex eigenvalue omega = omega(r) +
   i(gamma). An explicit solution is derived for the growth rate and real
   frequency in this regime. These are found to depend on a single
   non-dimensional parameter. We also compute the eigenvalues and the
   eigenfunctions with the extended MHD code NIMROD, and a hybrid kinetic
   delta integral code that assumes six-dimensional Vlasov ions and
   isothermal fluid electrons, as functions of k(perpendicular to)rho(i)
   and rho(i)/L-Ti0 using a spatially dependent equilibrium. These
   solutions are compared with each other, and with the predictions of the
   local kinetic and fluid dispersion relations. Kinetic and fluid
   calculations agree well at and near the marginal stability point, but
   diverge as k(perpendicular to)rho(i) or rho(i)/L-Ti0 increases. There is
   good qualitative agreement between the models for the shape of the
   unstable global eigenfunction for L-Ti0/rho(i) = 30 and 20. The results
   quantify how far fluid calculations can be extended accurately into the
   kinetic regime. We conclude that for the linear ITG problem in slab
   geometry with unsheared magnetic field when k(parallel
   to)/k(perpendicular to) << 1, the extended MHD model may be a reliable
   physical model for this problem when rho(i)/L-Ti0 < 10(-2) and
   k(perpendicular to)rho(i) < 0: 2. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS) program is studying low-metallicity
   galaxies using 230 hr of farinfrared (FIR) and submillimetre (submm)
   photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Herschel Space
   Observatory and draws from this a rich database of a wide range of
   wavelengths tracing the dust, gas and stars. This sample of 50 galaxies
   includes the largest metallicity range achievable in the local Universe
   including the lowest metallicity (Z) galaxies, 1/50 Z., and spans four
   orders of magnitude in star formation rates. The survey is designed to
   get a handle on the physics of the interstellar medium (ISM) of low
   metallicity dwarf galaxies, especially their dust and gas properties and
   the ISM heating and cooling processes. The DGS produces PACS and SPIRE
   maps of low-metallicity galaxies observed at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and
   500 mu m with the highest sensitivity achievable to date in the FIR and
   submm. The FIR fine-structure lines, {[}CII] 158 mu m, {[}OI] 63 mu m,
   {[}OI] 145 mu m, {[}OIII] 88 mu m, {[}NIII] 57 mu m, and {[}NII] 122 and
   205 mu m have also been observed with the aim of studying the gas
   cooling in the neutral and ionized phases. The SPIRE FTS observations
   include many CO lines (J = 4-3 to J = 13-12), {[}NII] 205 mu m, and
   {[}CI] lines at 370 and 609 mu m. This paper describes the sample
   selection and global properties of the galaxies and the observing
   strategy as well as the vast ancillary database available to complement
   the Herschel observations. The scientific potential of the full DGS
   survey is described with some example results included.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid organic/inorganic polymer films based on zirconium are grown
   using molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques. The zirconium
   alkoxide films, known as zircones, are grown using sequential exposures
   of zirconium tert-butoxide (ZTB) and ethylene glycol (EG) as the
   reactants at temperatures from 105 to 195 degrees C. In-situ quartz
   crystal microbalance (QCM) and ex-situ X-ray reflectivity (XRR)
   experiments confirm linear growth versus the number of reaction cycles.
   The growth rates decrease versus temperature from 1.6 angstrom per cycle
   at 105 degrees C to 0.3 angstrom per cycle at 195 degrees C. The
   measured density is approximate to 2.17gcm-3 for all the growth
   temperatures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal very
   uniform and conformal zircone films. ZrO2/zircone alloys are also
   fabricated by combining ZrO2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) and zircone
   MLD at 145 degrees C. The composition of the ZrO2/zircone alloy is
   varied by adjusting the relative number of ZrO2 ALD and zircone MLD
   cycles in the reaction sequence. The ZrO2/zircone alloys display varying
   density, refractive index, elastic modulus, and hardness. The refractive
   index and elastic modulus change progressively from n=1.63 and E= 27 +/-
   0.6GPa for pure zircone MLD films, to n=1.86 and E= 97 +/- 5GPa for pure
   ZrO2 ALD films, respectively. In capacitor structures, the zircone films
   display low leakage currents and a dielectric constant of approximate to
   6.7. The zircone films are also utilized as the dielectric layer in
   pentacene-based thin film transistors (TFTs), which display a high field
   effect mobility of 2.11 cm2 V-1 s-1 operating at -3V with an on/off
   current ratio of approximate to 103. The zircone and ZrO2/zircone alloy
   films provide a new class of hybrid organic/inorganic polymer films for
   many functional film applications.}},

Abstract = {{Describing the distribution of aquatic habitats and the health of
   biological communities can be costly and time-consuming; therefore,
   simple, inexpensive methods to scale observations of aquatic biota to
   watersheds that lack data would be useful. In this study, we explored
   the potential of a simple ``hydrogeomorphic'' model to predict the
   effects of acid deposition on macroinvertebrate, fish, and diatom
   communities in 28 sub-watersheds of the 176-km(-2) Neversink River basin
   in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. The empirical model was
   originally developed to predict stream-water acid neutralizing capacity
   (ANC) using the watershed slope and drainage density. Because ANC is
   known to be strongly related to aquatic biological communities in the
   Neversink, we speculated that the model might correlate well with biotic
   indicators of ANC response. The hydrogeomorphic model was strongly
   correlated to several measures of macroinvertebrate and fish community
   richness and density, but less strongly correlated to diatom acid
   tolerance. The model was also strongly correlated to biological
   communities in 18 sub-watersheds independent of the model development,
   with the linear correlation capturing the strongly acidic nature of
   small upland watersheds (<1 km(-2)). Overall, we demonstrated the
   applicability of geospatial data sets and a simple hydrogeomorphic model
   for estimating aquatic biological communities in areas with stream-water
   acidification, allowing estimates where no direct field observations are
   available. Similar modeling approaches have the potential to complement
   or refine expensive and time-consuming measurements of aquatic biota
   populations and to aid in regional assessments of aquatic health.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative control focuses on deriving desirable collective behavior in
   multiagent systems through the design of local control algorithms. Game
   theory is beginning to emerge as a valuable set of tools for achieving
   this objective. A central component of this game theoretic approach is
   the assignment of utility functions to the individual agents. Here, the
   goal is to assign utility functions within an ``admissible{''} design
   space such that the resulting game possesses desirable properties. Our
   first set of results illustrates the complexity associated with such a
   task. In particular, we prove that if we restrict the class of utility
   functions to be local, scalable, and budget-balanced then 1) ensuring
   that the resulting game possesses a pure Nash equilibrium requires
   computing a Shapley value, which can be computationally prohibitive for
   large-scale systems, and 2) ensuring that the allocation which optimizes
   the system level objective is a pure Nash equilibrium is impossible. The
   last part of this paper demonstrates that both limitations can be
   overcome by introducing an underlying state space into the potential
   game structure.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to recent progress in the manufacturing of electrical devices, the
   detection of metal dust on/in thin films or cloths has become crucial as
   they are used for separators or insulators. This paper considers the
   detection of metal particles less than 100m in size by monitoring the
   resonance frequency of a microwave cavity. Metal particles shift the
   resonance frequency, but the shift is less than the resonance frequency
   by many orders of magnitude when the cavity consists of an X-band
   waveguide. This makes it challenging to detect small metal particles in
   industrial environments. To overcome this difficulty, a new method of
   detecting small frequency shifts is proposed. First, transmission
   measurements are performed at a fixed frequency where the resonance peak
   has the steepest slope. Second, a Mexican hat filter is applied to the
   measured signal in order to distinguish frequency shifts from background
   noise and ambient conditions. Experimental detection of a 48m stainless
   steel sphere is demonstrated. The threshold level affects the minimum
   level of the sphere's size and false positive signal. The paper also
   assesses the ability of available commercial software to accurately
   predict frequency shifts. The calculated results are compared with
   experimental data, which should be adjusted for the ambient temperature
   owing to thermal expansion of the cavity. The corrected experimental
   shifts agreed with the calculated shifts, demonstrating that the
   simulation can be used for future studies to improve this method.}},

Title = {{Inverse prediction and optimization of flow control conditions for
   confined spaces using a CFD-based genetic algorithm}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{77-84}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Optimizing an indoor flow pattern according to specific design goals
   requires systematic evaluation and prediction of the influences of
   critical flow control conditions such as flow inlet temperature and
   velocity. In order to identify the best flow control conditions,
   conventional approach simulates a large number of flow scenarios with
   different boundary conditions. This paper proposes a method that
   combines the genetic algorithm (GA) with computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) technique, which can efficiently predict and optimize the flow
   inlet conditions with various objective functions. A coupled simulation
   platform based on GenOpt (GA program) and Fluent (CFD program) was
   developed, in which the GA was improved to reduce the required CFD
   simulations. A mixing convection case in a confined space was used to
   evaluate the performance of the developed program. The study shows that
   the method can predict accurately the inlet boundary conditions, with
   given controlling variable values in the space, with fewer CFD cases.
   The results reveal that the accuracy of inverse prediction is influenced
   by the error of CFD simulation that need be controlled within 15\%. The
   study further used the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) as the cost function to
   optimize the inlet boundary conditions (e.g., supply velocity,
   temperature, and angle) of the mixing convection case as well as two
   more realistic aircraft cabin cases. It presents interesting optimal
   correlations among those controlling parameters. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{48-59}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to develop seismic response factors for the design of
   structural systems has recently been developed by the Applied Technology
   Council and published in the FEMA P-695 document The FEMA P-695
   assessment methodology provides a comprehensive and objective approach
   to evaluate the performance factors based on non-linear structural
   analysis, while considering the uncertainties in design requirements,
   supporting test data, and the non-linear model. The goal of the
   methodology is to ensure that buildings designed with the selected
   performance factor have an acceptably low likelihood of structural
   collapse under extreme (rare) earthquake ground motions. The methodology
   is based on the design and assessment of representative archetypical
   building designs, whose collapse performance is evaluated through a
   series of non-linear static and dynamic analyses using numerical models
   that are calibrated to experimental test data. This methodology is
   applied to evaluate the seismic performance factors for a newly proposed
   light-framed steel shear wall seismic force resisting system, developed
   by Tipping Mar and Associates of Berkeley, California. The system
   consists of a steel corrugated sheet shear wall for use in mid-size
   residential and commercial structures. The calibration of the non-linear
   analysis model parameters to experimental data uses genetic algorithms.
   The system archetypes evaluated in this study are shown to meet the FEMA
   P-695 acceptance criteria for a seismic response modification factor of
   R equal to 4. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Emulsion flow through a packed bed with multiple drop breakup}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{725}},
Pages = {{611-663}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Pressure-driven squeezing of a concentrated emulsion of deformable drops
   through a randomly packed granular material is studied by rigorous
   three-dimensional multidrop-multiparticle simulations at low Reynolds
   numbers. The drops are comparable in size with granular particles, so
   the drop phase and the carrier fluid have different permeabilities, and
   the emulsion cannot be treated as single phase. Squeezing requires
   significant drop deformation and can meet much resistance, depending on
   the capillary number Ca. The granular material is modelled as a random
   loose packing (RLP) of many highly-frictional rigid monodisperse spheres
   in a periodic cell in mechanical equilibrium. Flow simulations for many
   drops squeezing through the network of solid spheres are performed by an
   extension of the multipole-accelerated boundary-integral (BI) algorithm
   of Zinchenko \& Davis (J. Comput. Phys. vol. 227, 2008, pp. 7841-7888).
   A major improvement is robust mesh control on drop surfaces combined
   with a novel fragmentation algorithm, now allowing for long-time
   simulations with intricate drop shapes and multiple breakups. A major
   challenge is that up to O(10(5)) time steps are required in a simulation
   for time averaging, and O(10(4)) boundary elements per surface to
   sufficiently resolve lubrication and breakups. Such simulations are
   feasible due to multipole acceleration, with two orders-of-magnitude
   gain over the standard BI coding. For initial drop-to-particle size
   ratio 0.51-0.52, emulsion concentration 41-42\% in the available space,
   and matching viscosities, time-and ensemble-averaged permeabilities of
   the drop phase and the continuous phase are studied versus Ca for
   systems of different size (up to 36 particles and 100 drops in a
   periodic cell). An avalanche of drop breakups observed at sufficiently
   large Ca does not preclude the permeabilities from reaching a
   statistical steady state in a feasible simulation time. The critical,
   system-size-independent Ca, when the drop-phase flow effectively stops
   due to blockage in the pores by capillary forces, is estimated from
   simulations. For a sample RLP configuration, deep distinctions are found
   between the flow of concentrated emulsions and single-drop motion.}},

Abstract = {{A new quantum-voltage-calibrated Johnson noise thermometer was developed
   at the National Institute of Metrology to demonstrate the electrical
   approach that determines Boltzmann's constant k, by comparing electrical
   and thermal noise power. A measurement with an integration period of 19
   h and a bandwidth of 638 kHz results in a relative offset of 1 x 10(-6),
   from the current Committee on Data for Science and Technology value of
   k, and a type A relative standard uncertainty of 17 x 10(-6). Closely
   matched noise powers and transmission-line impedances were achieved, and
   consequently, the quadratic fitting parameters of the ratio spectrum
   show flat frequency responses with respect to the measurement bandwidth.
   This flat response produces a dramatically reduced systematic error
   compared to that of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   measurement of k, in which the relative combined uncertainty was
   dominated by this error.}},

Abstract = {{Aims An extra-long-range quantitative PCR (LR-qPCR) method was developed
   for estimating genome damage to adenovirus 2 caused by UV irradiation.
   The objective was to use LR-qPCR as a rapid method to determine
   adenovirus UV inactivation. Methods The LR-qPCR consisted of two steps:
   a long-range PCR (up to 10kb fragment) and a real-time, quantitative (q)
   PCR for quantifying the products of the first PCR. We evaluated LR-qPCR
   with adenovirus irradiated with medium-pressure (MP, polychromatic
   emission) and low-pressure (LP, 254nm) mercury vapour lamps and compared
   results with cell culture infectivity. Results Using LR-qPCR, a fragment
   of 6kb estimated DNA damage in a linear relationship to doses between 0
   and 20mJcm2, and a 1-kb fragment related linearly to doses between 20
   and 100mJcm2. The LR-qPCR results for the 6-kb fragment were similar to
   infectivity assays results for adenovirus exposed to MP UV. For
   adenovirus irradiated with LP lamps, LR-qPCR results for the shorter
   fragment size (1kb) were similar to reduction in viral infectivity. No
   difference was observed between 10 and 6kb LR-qPCR results. Conclusion
   The LR-qPCR can be used as a tool for estimating DNA damage caused by UV
   in adenovirus. The LR-qPCR results were related to reduction in viral
   infectivity. Significance and Impact of the Study The use of LR-qPCR to
   determine DNA damage and estimate inactivation of adenovirus 2 from UV
   disinfection allows for same-day results compared with >7days required
   for cell culture. This accelerates adenovirus inactivation results for
   the water industry where adenovirus is used as a representative virus
   for crediting UV systems. This PCR approach provides a framework that
   can be used for other viral viability assays using the inhibition of
   amplification of viral nucleic acid after pretreatments, such as
   propidium monoazide, and for cellular biology studies of DNA damage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses far-field wireless powering for low-power wireless
   sensors, with applications to sensing in environments where it is
   difficult or impossible to change batteries and where the exact position
   of the sensors might not be known. With expected radio-frequency (RF)
   power densities in the 20-200-mu W/cm(2) range, and desired small sensor
   overall size, low-power nondirective wireless powering is appropriate
   for sensors that transmit data at low duty cycles. The sensor platform
   is powered through an antenna which receives incident electromagnetic
   waves in the gigahertz frequency range, couples the energy to a
   rectifier circuit which charges a storage device (e.g., thin-film
   battery) through an efficient power management circuit, and the entire
   platform, including sensors and a low-power wireless transmitter, and is
   controlled through a low-power microcontroller. For low incident power
   density levels, codesign of the RF powering and the power management
   circuits is required for optimal performance. Results for hybrid and
   monolithic implementations of the power management circuitry are
   presented with integrated antenna rectifiers operating in the 1.96-GHz
   cellular and in 2.4-GHz industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) bands.}},

Title = {{Direct numerical simulation of top-down and bottom-up diffusion in the
   convective boundary layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{724}},
Pages = {{581-606}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A direct numerical simulation (DNS) of an unstably stratified convective
   boundary layer with system rotation was performed to study top-down and
   bottom-up diffusion processes. In order to better understand near-wall
   dynamics associated with scalar diffusion in the absence of surface
   roughness, direct simulation is utilized to numerically integrate the
   governing equations that model the atmospheric boundary layer. The ratio
   of the inversion height to Obukhov length scale, z(i)/L = -49.1,
   indicates moderately strong heating for the case studied. Two passive
   scalars were initialized in the flow field: the first with a zero
   gradient at the wall (q(t), top-down diffusion), and the second with a
   non-zero wall gradient and a close-to-zero gradient at the height of the
   temperature inversion (q(b), bottom-up diffusion). Scalar flux, variance
   and covariance profiles show good agreement between the DNS and
   rough-wall large-eddy simulation (LES). The top-down gradient function
   displays a slight increase in amplitude, indicating reduced mixing
   efficiency for the smooth-wall, low-Reynolds-number convective boundary
   layer. For the bottom-up process, the gradient matches other rough-wall
   simulations. The only notable difference between the smooth-wall DNS
   data and other rough-wall simulations is an increase in the gradient
   function near the wall. This indicates that the bottom-up gradient
   functions for a rough wall and a smooth wall are nearly identical except
   as the viscous sublayer is approached. Finally, a new empirical model
   for the scalar variance of a bottom-up scalar is proposed: here, a
   single function replaces two piecewise relationships to accurately
   capture the DNS results up to the viscous sublayer. The scalar
   covariance between top-down and bottom-up processes agrees with
   rough-wall and tree-canopy LES results; this indicates that the scalar
   covariance is independent of both Reynolds number and surface friction.}},

Abstract = {{We perform the first long-term (>1 year) continuous adjoint simulations
   with a global atmospheric chemistry transport model focusing on
   population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and associated
   risk of early death. Sensitivities relevant to intercontinental and
   high-altitude PM pollution are calculated with particular application to
   aircraft emissions. Specifically, the sensitivities of premature
   mortality risk in different regions to NOx, SOx, CO, VOC and primary
   PM2.5 emissions as a function of location are computed. We apply the
   resultant sensitivity matrices to aircraft emissions, finding that NOx
   emissions are responsible for 93\% of population exposure to
   aircraft-attributable PM2.5. Aircraft NOx accounts for all of
   aircraft-attributable nitrate exposure (as expected) and 53\% of
   aircraft-attributable sulfate exposure due to the strong ``oxidative
   coupling{''} between aircraft NOx emissions and non-aviation SO2
   emissions in terms of sulfate formation. Of the health risk-weighted
   human PM2.5 exposure attributable to aviation, 73\% occurs in Asia,
   followed by 18\% in Europe. 95\% of the air quality impacts of aircraft
   emissions in the US are incurred outside the US. We also assess the
   impact of uncertainty or changes in (non-aviation) ammonia emissions on
   aviation-attributable PM2.5 exposure by calculating second-order
   sensitivities. We note the potential application of the sensitivity
   matrices as a rapid policy analysis tool in aviation environmental
   policy contexts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Determining Optimal Proportion of Design in Design-Build Request for

Abstract = {{The design-build (DB) system is a popular and effective delivery method
   of construction projects worldwide. After owners decide to procure their
   projects through the DB system, they may wish to determine the optimal
   proportion of design to be provided in the DB request for proposals
   (RFP), which serves as a solicitation for design-builders and describes
   the scope of work. However, this presents difficulties to DB owners and
   there is little, if any, systematic research in this area. This paper
   reports on an empirical study in the United States entailing both an
   online questionnaire survey and Delphi survey to identify and evaluate
   the factors influencing owners' decisions in determining the proportion
   of design to include in DB RFPs. Eleven factors are identified, i.e.,
   (1) clarity of project scope, (2) applicability of performance
   specifications, (3) desire for design innovation, (4) site constraints,
   (5) availability of competent design-builders, (6) project control
   requirements, (7) user group involvement level, (8) third-party
   requirements, (9) owner experience with DB, (10) project complexity, and
   (11) schedule constraints. A statistically significant agreement on the
   11 factors was also obtained from the (mainly nonowner) Delphi experts.
   Although some of the experts hold different opinions on how these
   factors affect the proportion of design, these findings furnish various
   stakeholders with a better understanding of the delivery process of DB
   projects and the appropriate provision of project information in DB
   RFPs. Because the result is mainly industry opinion concerning the
   optimal proportion of design, in addition and for completeness future
   studies should be conducted to obtain a big picture of the optimal
   proportion of design by means of seeking owners' inputs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Because people spend a majority of their time indoors, indoor air
   quality (IAQ) can have a significant impact on human health, safety,
   productivity, and comfort. Because of the diversity and dynamics of
   people's indoor activities, it is important to monitor IAQ for each
   individual. Most existing air-quality sensing systems are stationary or
   focus on outdoor air quality In contrast, we propose MAQS, a
   user-centered mobile sensing system for IAQ monitoring. MAQS users carry
   portable, indoor location tracking and IAQ sensing devices that provide
   personalized IAQ information in real time. To improve accuracy and
   energy efficiency, MAQS incorporates three novel techniques: (I) an
   accurate temporal n-gram augmented Bayesian room localization method
   that requires few Wi-Fi fingerprints; (2) an air-exchange-rate- based
   IAQ sensing method, which measures general IAQ using only CO2 sensors;
   and (3) a zone-based proximity detection method for collaborative
   sensing, which saves energy and enables data sharing among users. MAQS
   has been deployed and evaluated through a real-world user study. This
   evaluation demonstrates that MAQS supports accurate personalized IAQ
   monitoring and quantitative analysis with high energy efficiency. We
   also found that study participants frequently experienced poor IAQ.}},

Abstract = {{A microtrap inertial impactor has been developed and characterized for
   use as an area or personal sampler. The microtrap impactor utilizes a
   high-density multijet plate to direct airflow and a matched multiwell
   plate to impact and collect particles for extraction with a reduced
   pressure drop relative to inertial impactors with fewer jets. Reported
   here is the characterization of the microtrap impactor using a fluidized
   bed aerosol generator and a small volume nebulizer to generate particles
   of Arizona Road Dust, potassium chloride, and oleic acid. Collection
   efficiency was determined by measuring particle size distributions with
   an aerodynamic particle sizer. Two geometries of the microtrap were
   tested suitable for a two-stage coarse particle sampler, with 14m and a
   410m stages. The 1m cut-point microtrap stage has a collection
   efficiency above 97\% for particles greater than 2m in diameter (at a 10
   L/min flow rate and a pressure drop of 0.12 kPa). This stage's
   collection efficiency was constant for a period of time up to 10h under
   typical ambient conditions without any coating on the impaction surface.
   The microtrap impactor provides an improvement in area sampling due to
   its high collection efficiency at a low pressure drop across the device,
   and its use of an uncoated impaction surface allowing for the extraction
   and analysis of biological samples. Copyright 2013 American Association

Abstract = {{Local maxima in the measured power curve of a photovoltaic (PV) panel,
   called traps, are caused by switching transients and other deterministic
   phenomena in PV power converters. Traps exist even in the absence of
   shading, and degrade the performance of perturb and observe (PO) maximum
   power point trackers. A generalized PO (GPO) algorithm is proposed which
   eliminates this degradation. PO/GPO algorithms in the presence of random
   noise are shown to be modeled by multidimensional Markov chains. These
   models quantify the tendency for PO at low random noise levels to become
   stuck in traps following insolation changes, thereby decreasing tracking
   performance and reducing harvested power. By contrast, GPO tracks
   insolation changes unhindered by traps. All theoretical results are
   experimentally verified using a hardware PV converter.}},

Abstract = {{Power optimizers, which perform power conversion and distributed maximum
   power point tracking (DMPPT) at the subarray level, are available to
   mitigate losses associated with nonuniform operating conditions in
   grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) arrays, yet there is not a good
   understanding of their potential to increase energy capture. This paper
   develops and demonstrates a methodology for the use of a detailed
   software tool that can accurately model both partial shading and
   electrical mismatch at the subpanel level in a PV array. Annual
   simulations are run to examine the device-independent opportunity for
   power recovery in arrays with light, moderate, and heavy shading, and
   subpanel electrical mismatch variations based on measurements from a
   monocrystalline silicon array. It is found that in unshaded arrays, the
   potential energy gain is <1\% using power optimizers, but in shaded
   arrays it increases to 3-16\% for panel-level DMPPT and 7-30\% for
   cell-level DMPPT. In the set of simulated cases, panel-level power
   optimization recovers 34-42\% of the energy that is lost to partial
   shading.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes photovoltaic (PV) module architectures with
   parallel-connected submodule-integrated dc-dc converters (subMICs) that
   improve efficiency of energy capture in the presence of partial shading
   or other mismatch conditions. The subMICs are bidirectional isolated
   dc-dc converters capable of injecting or subtracting currents to balance
   the module substring voltages. When no mismatches are present, the
   subMICs are simply shut down, resulting in zero insertion losses. It is
   shown that the objective of minimum subMIC power processing can be
   solved as a linear programming problem. A simple close-to-optimal
   distributed control approach is presented that allows autonomous subMIC
   control without the need for a central controller or any communication
   among the subMICs. Furthermore, the proposed control approach is well
   suited for an isolated-port architecture, which yields additional
   practical advantages including reduced subMIC power and voltage ratings.
   The architectures and the control approach are validated by simulations
   and experimental results using three bidirectional flyback subMICs
   attached to a standard 180-W, 72-cell PV module, yielding greater than
   98\% module-level power processing efficiency for a mismatch less than

Abstract = {{Mitigation of the variability in output power of renewable generators
   such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is a growing concern as these
   generators reach higher penetrations on electric grids. Furthermore,
   increased penetration of electric vehicle (EV) loads presents a
   challenge for distribution feeders. This paper presents a system where a
   bidirectional, highly efficient, dc-dc EV charger is placed between the
   high-voltage dc bus of a PV inverter and the EV battery. The system
   partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for
   the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable
   of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby
   reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below
   the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses sizing of
   the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating, the
   desired maximum ramp rate, and site solar irradiation characteristics,
   including geographic dispersion of PV arrays. Analysis suggests that
   small amounts of energy storage can accomplish large reductions in
   output power ramp rate. Experimental results are shown for a 10 kW, 98\%
   efficient dc-dc charger based on bidirectional four-phase
   zero-voltage-switching converter.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the resonant response of high-temperature superconducting
   YBCO split-ring resonators (SRRs) deposited on a single crystal MgO
   substrate is presented. Measurement of an array of seven SRRs inside a
   WR-90 waveguide at temperatures below the transition temperature of YBCO
   (T-c approximate to 90 K) shows a stop band centered at around 8 GHz
   with a 1.6-GHz bandwidth, which is also seen in the full wave
   simulation. An individual SRR element is measured to investigate the
   temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and quality factor.
   The single SRR measurements show a small gradual shift in the
   transmission resonance frequency as the temperature is lowered from 90.5
   to 40 K, which can be attributed to the presence of kinetic inductance.
   The behavior of the measured resonance frequency versus temperature is
   fitted to a model to study the kinetic inductance and penetration depth.
   The quality factor is then calculated from the measurements in the same
   temperature range. Finally, the permittivity and permeability are
   extracted from the measured scattering parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Infragravity waves (IGWs) play an important role in coupling wave
   processes in the ocean, ice shelves, atmosphere, and the solid Earth.
   Due to the paucity of experimental data, little quantitative information
   is available about power spectra of IGWs away from the shore. Here we
   use continuous, yearlong records of pressure at 28 locations on the
   seafloor off New Zealand's South Island to investigate spectral and
   spatial distribution of IGW energy. Dimensional analysis of diffuse IGW
   fields reveals universal properties of the power spectra observed at
   different water depths and leads to a simple, predictive model of the
   IGW spectra. While sources of IGWs off New Zealand are found to have a
   flat power spectrum, the IGW energy density has a pronounced dependence
   on frequency and local water depth as a result of the interaction of the
   waves with varying bathymetry.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a climatology of synoptic-scale disturbances in the
   upper stratosphere lower mesosphere (USLM) based on 20.5 years of
   assimilated data analyses from the U. K. Meteorological Office
   (1991-2012). USLM disturbance criteria are established, based on
   stratopause warmings at the 2 hPa level, to create climatologies in both
   hemispheres that delineate their timing, frequency, and geographic
   location. USLM disturbances occur on average 2.3 times per winter in the
   Northern Hemisphere (NH) (November through March) and 1.6 times per
   winter in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) (May through September), persist
   on average for 8 days in the NH and only 4 days in the SH, occur most
   frequently in December (July) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere, and
   are predominantly located in the longitude sector between 0(o)E and
   90(o)E in both hemispheres. This is the first work to show that all
   major Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) over the 20.5 year data
   record are preceded by USLM disturbances. One third of USLM disturbances
   evolve into a major SSW; only 22\% of minor SSWs evolve into a major
   SSW. USLM disturbances and minor SSWs illustrate, at times, similar
   occurrence statistics, but the minor warming criteria seem to include a
   more diverse range of dynamical conditions. USLM disturbances are more
   specific in their dynamical construct with strong baroclinicity being a
   necessary condition. Potential vorticity analysis indicates that all
   USLM events occur with planetary wave breaking and that subsequent
   baroclinic instability may lead to the development of USLM disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and C-2-C-5
   alkanes were measured throughout the Los Angeles (L.A.) basin in May and
   June 2010. We use these data to show that the emission ratios of CH4/CO
   and CH4/CO2 in the L.A. basin are larger than expected from
   population-apportioned bottom-up state inventories, consistent with
   previously published work. We use experimentally determined CH4/CO and
   CH4/CO2 emission ratios in combination with annual State of California
   CO and CO2 inventories to derive a yearly emission rate of CH4 to the
   L.A. basin. We further use the airborne measurements to directly derive
   CH4 emission rates from dairy operations in Chino, and from the two
   largest landfills in the L.A. basin, and show these sources are
   accurately represented in the California Air Resources Board greenhouse
   gas inventory for CH4. We then use measurements of C-2-C-5 alkanes to
   quantify the relative contribution of other CH4 sources in the L.A.
   basin, with results differing from those of previous studies. The
   atmospheric data are consistent with the majority of CH4 emissions in
   the region coming from fugitive losses from natural gas in pipelines and
   urban distribution systems and/or geologic seeps, as well as landfills
   and dairies. The local oil and gas industry also provides a significant
   source of CH4 in the area. The addition of CH4 emissions from natural
   gas pipelines and urban distribution systems and/or geologic seeps and
   from the local oil and gas industry is sufficient to account for the
   differences between the top-down and bottom-up CH4 inventories
   identified in previously published work.}},

Abstract = {{During the CalNex (California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and
   Climate Change) field study in May-June 2010, measurements of volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) were performed in the Los Angeles (LA) basin
   onboard a NOAA research aircraft and at a ground site located in
   Pasadena. A weekday-weekend effect in ozone, caused by lower NOx
   emissions due to reduced diesel truck traffic in the weekends, has been
   previously observed in Los Angeles and other cities. Measurements in the
   Caldecott tunnel show that emission ratios of VOCs do not vary with the
   day of the week, but measurements during CalNex2010 show a VOC
   weekday-weekend effect through faster photochemical processing at lower
   ambient NOx mixing ratios. Ambient VOC enhancement ratios of long-lived
   species such as benzene are the same between weekdays and weekends,
   whereas enhancement ratios of short-lived species, such as trimethyl
   benzene, are up to a factor of three lower on weekends. Based upon the
   observed differences in VOC enhancement ratios to CO, we determine that
   photochemical processing was on average 65\%-75\% faster on weekends
   during CalNex2010, which indicates that ambient OH radical
   concentrations were larger by this factor causing the observed change in
   VOC composition. A box model calculation based on the Master Chemical
   Mechanism was used to verify the increase in photochemical processing in
   the weekends.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize periodic density functional theory to study singly and triply
   N- and B-substituted graphene. We examine their doping mechanisms and
   effects on Pt atom adsorption and migration on graphene. We find a
   seemingly contradictory behavior between dopant type (n- vs p-type) and
   charge accumulation on the dopant atoms: the N atoms in both n-type
   singly N-doped graphene (NG) and p-type triply N-doped graphene (3NG)
   gain electron density while the B atoms in both singly (BG) and triply
   (3BG) B-doped graphene are p-type and lose electron density. This
   behavior arises from unequal charge sharing within C-B and C-N sp(2)
   sigma bonds and the requirement that the p(z) orbitals of N and B are
   singly occupied in order to maintain graphene's aromaticity. NG's N atom
   stabilizes Pt atom adsorption up to -0.39 eV (E-ads = -1.86 eV) and by
   -0.13 eV even at distances 12.3 angstrom away from the N dopant. The Pt
   atom hopping energy barrier is lowered in graphene rings containing an
   NG N atom relative to undoped graphene, but the migration of a Pt atom
   over the N atom is unlikely due to a 1.0 eV barrier. 3NG's most stable
   Pt adsorption site (E-ads= -2.86 eV) is the vacant C site at the center
   of 3NG's three N atoms and arises because of the formation of covalent
   bonds between Pt's d orbitals and the N atoms' three in-plane dangling
   sp(2) orbitals. When a Pt atom adsorbs at a ring containing a pyridinic
   N, the strong N-Pt bonds trap the Pt atom, limiting its diffusion over
   the graphene sheet. The BC and 3BG structures bind Pt with a maximum
   adsorption energy of E-ads= -2.16 eV and -5.30 eV, respectively. BC's
   high-lying B-C bonding orbitals allow the Pt atom to form strong sigma
   bonds directly to the graphene sheet, while 3BG's B atoms donate
   electron density to the Pt atom creating an ionic bond between the
   negative Pt atom and the positive B atoms. These bonding mechanisms
   result in only short-range Pt stabilization and the B atoms having
   little influence on Pt atom migration outside B containing C rings;
   however, the depth and short-range nature of these energy wells funnel
   Pt atoms toward the B atoms and trap them there.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an approach for background-free three-dimensional imaging
   of director fields in liquid crystals using stimulated Raman scattering
   microscopy. This imaging technique is implemented using a single
   femtosecond pulsed laser and a photonic crystal fiber, providing Stokes
   and pump frequencies needed to access Raman shifts of different chemical
   bonds of molecules and allowing for chemically selective and broadband
   imaging of both pristine liquid crystals and composite materials. Using
   examples of model three-dimensional structures of director fields, we
   show that the described technique is a powerful tool for mapping of
   long-range molecular orientation patterns in soft matter via polarized
   chemical-selective imaging. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Multimode optical fibers are attractive for biomedical and sensing
   applications because they possess a small cross section and can bend
   over small radii of curvature. However, mode phase-velocity dispersion
   and random mode coupling change with bending, temperature, and other
   perturbations, producing scrambling interference among propagating
   modes; hence preventing its use for focusing or imaging. To tackle this
   problem we introduce a system capable of re-focusing light through a
   multimode fiber in 37ms, one order of magnitude faster than demonstrated
   in previous reports. As a result, the focus spot can be maintained
   during significant bending of the fiber, opening numerous opportunities
   for endoscopic imaging and energy delivery applications. We measure the
   transmission matrix of the fiber by projecting binary-amplitude computer
   generated holograms using a digital micro-mirror device controlled by a
   field programmable gate array. The system shows two orders of magnitude
   enhancements of the focus spot relative to the background. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Direct photons have been measured in root s(NN) = 200 GeV d + Au
   collisions at midrapidity. A wide p(T) range is covered by measurements
   of nearly real virtual photons (1 < p(T) < 6 GeV/c) and real photons (5
   < p(T) < 16 GeV/c). The invariant yield of the direct photons in d + Au
   collisions over the scaled p + p cross section is consistent with unity.
   Theoretical calculations assuming standard cold-nuclear-matter effects
   describe the data well for the entire p(T) range. This indicates that
   the large enhancement of direct photons observed in Au + Au collisions
   for 1.0 < p(T) < 2.5 GeV/c is attributable to a source other than the
   initial-state nuclear effects.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the design, fabrication and characterization of a
   near-field plasmonic nanofocusing probe with a hybrid tip-plus-aperture
   design. By combining template stripping with focused ion beam
   lithography, a variety of aperture-based near-field probes can be
   fabricated with high optical performance. In particular, the combination
   of large transmission through a C-shaped aperture aligned to the sharp
   apex (<10 nm radius) of a template-stripped metallic pyramid allows the
   efficient delivery of light-via the C-shaped aperture-while providing a
   nanometric hotspot determined by the sharpness of the tip itself.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a microfluidic system enabling continuous
   characterization of specific membrane capacitance (C-specific membrane)
   and cytoplasm conductivity (sigma(cytoplasm)) of single cells in
   suspension. In this study, cells were aspirated continuously through a
   constriction channel while cell elongations and impedance profiles at
   two frequencies (1 kHz and 100 kHz) were measured simultaneously using
   microscopy imaging and a lock-in amplifier. 1 kHz impedance data were
   used to evaluate cellular sealing properties with constriction channel
   walls and 100 kHz impedance data were translated to quantify equivalent
   membrane capacitance and cytoplasm resistance of single cells, which
   were further translated to C-specific membrane and sigma(cytoplasm). Two
   model cell lines (kidney tumor cell line of 786-O (n = 302) and vascular
   smooth muscle cell line of T2 (n = 216)) were used to evaluate this
   technique, producing C-specific membrane of 3.67 +/- 1.00 and 4.53 +/-
   1.51 mu F/cm(2) and sigma(cytoplasm) of 0.47 +/- 0.09 and 0.55 +/- 0.14
   S/m, respectively. Compared to previously reported techniques which can
   only collect C-specific membrane and sigma(cytoplasm) from tens of
   cells, this new technique has a higher throughput, capable of collecting
   C-specific membrane and sigma(cytoplasm) from hundreds of cells in 30
   min immediately after cell passage. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Direct-bandgap InAlP alloy has the potential to be an active material in
   nitride-free yellow-green and amber optoelectronics with applications in
   solid-state lighting, display devices, and multi-junction solar cells.
   We report on the growth of high-quality direct-bandgap InAlP on relaxed
   InGaAs graded buffers with low threading dislocation densities.
   Structural characterization reveals phase-separated microstructures in
   these films which have an impact on the luminescence spectrum. While
   similar to InGaP in many ways, the greater tendency for phase separation
   in InAlP leads to the simultaneous occurrence of compositional
   inhomogeneity and CuPt-B ordering. Mechanisms connecting these two
   structural parameters are presented as well as results on the effect of
   silicon and zinc dopants on homogenizing the microstructure. Spontaneous
   formation of tilted planes of phase-separated material, with alternating
   degrees of ordering, is observed when InAlP is grown on vicinal
   substrates. The photoluminescence peak-widths of these films are
   actually narrower than those grown on exact (001) substrates. We find
   that, despite phase-separation, ordered direct-bandgap InAlP is a
   suitable material for optoelectronics. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The ultracold molecular conversion rate occurring in an adiabatic ramp
   through a Fano-Feshbach resonance is studied and compared in two
   statistical models. One model, the so-called stochastic phase-space
   sampling (SPSS) {[}Hodby et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 120402 (2005)]
   evaluates the overlap of two atomic distributions in phase space by
   sampling atomic pairs according to a phase-space criterion. The other
   model, the chemical equilibrium theory (ChET) {[}Watabe and Nikuni,
   Phys. Rev. A 77, 013616 (2008)] considers atomic and molecular
   distributions in the limit of the chemical and thermal equilibrium. The
   present study applies SPSS and ChET to a prototypical system of K+K ->
   K-2 in all the symmetry combinations, namely Fermi-Fermi, Bose-Bose, and
   Bose-Fermi cases. To examine implications of the phase-space criterion
   for SPSS, the behavior of molecular conversion is analyzed using four
   distinct geometrical constraints. Our comparison of the results of SPSS
   with those of ChET shows that while they appear similar in most
   situations, the two models give rise to rather dissimilar behaviors when
   the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly affects the molecule
   formation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a new thin-film graphene diode called a geometric diode
   that relies on geometric asymmetry to provide rectification at 28 THz.
   The geometric diode is coupled to an optical antenna to form a rectenna
   that rectifies incoming radiation. This is the first reported
   graphene-based antenna-coupled diode working at 28 THz, and potentially
   at optical frequencies. The planar structure of the geometric diode
   provides a low RC time constant, on the order of 10(-15) s, required for
   operation at optical frequencies, and a low impedance for efficient
   power transfer from the antenna. Fabricated geometric diodes show
   asymmetric current-voltage characteristics consistent with Monte Carlo
   simulations for the devices. Rectennas employing the geometric diode
   coupled to metal and graphene antennas rectify 10.6 mu m radiation,
   corresponding to an operating frequency of 28 THz. The graphene bowtie
   antenna is the first demonstrated functional antenna made using
   graphene. Its response indicates that graphene is a suitable terahertz
   resonator material. Applications for this terahertz diode include
   terahertz-wave and optical detection, ultra-high-speed electronics and
   optical power conversion.}},

Abstract = {{Genes encoding tetracycline resistance and the integrase of Class 1
   integrons were enumerated using quantitative PCR from aerosols collected
   from indoor and outdoor environments. Concentrated animal feeding
   operations (CAFOs) and human-occupied indoor environments (two clinics
   and a homeless shelter) were found to be a source of airborne tet(X) and
   tet(W) genes. The CAFOs had 10- to 100-times higher concentrations of
   airborne 16S rRNA, tet(X), and tet(W) genes than other environments
   sampled, and increased concentrations of aerosolized bacteria correlated
   with increased concentrations of airborne resistance genes. The two
   CAFOs studied had statistically similar concentrations of resistance
   genes in their aerosol samples, even though antibiotic use was markedly
   different between the two operations Additionally, tet(W) genes were
   recovered in outdoor air within 2 km of livestock operations, which
   suggests that antibiotic resistance genes may be transported via
   aerosols on local scales. The integrase gene (intI1) from Class 1
   integrons, which has been associated with multidrug resistance, was
   detected in CAFOs but not in human occupied indoor environments,
   suggesting that CAFO aerosols could serve as a reservoir of multidrug
   resistance. In conclusion, our results show that CAFOs and clinics are
   sources of aerosolized antibiotic resistance genes that can potentially
   be transported via air movement.}},

Abstract = {{We propose integrated photonic wavelength multiplexers based on serially
   cascaded channel add-drop filters with an asymmetric frequency response.
   By utilizing the through-port rejection of the previous channel to
   advantage, the asymmetric response provides optimal rejection of the
   adjacent channels at each wavelength channel. We show theoretically the
   basic requirements to realize an asymmetric filter response, and propose
   and evaluate the possible implementations using coupled resonators. For
   one implementation, we provide detailed design formulas based on a
   coupled-mode theory model, and more generally we provide broad
   guidelines that enumerate all structures that can provide asymmetric
   passbands in the context of a pole-zero design approach to engineering
   the device response. Using second-order microring resonator filter
   stages as an example, we show that the asymmetric multiplexer can
   provide 2.4 times higher channel packing (bandwidth) density than a
   multiplexer using the same order stages (number of resonators) using
   conventional all-pole maximally-flat designs. We also address the
   sensitivities and constraints of various implementations of our proposed
   approach, as it affects their applicability to CMOS photonic
   interconnects. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In arthropods, evolution has created a remarkably sophisticated class of
   imaging systems, with a wide-angle field of view, low aberrations, high
   acuity to motion and an infinite depth of field(1-3). A challenge in
   building digital cameras with the hemispherical, compound apposition
   layouts of arthropod eyes is that essential design requirements cannot
   be met with existing planar sensor technologies or conventional optics.
   Here we present materials, mechanics and integration schemes that afford
   scalable pathways to working, arthropod-inspired cameras with nearly
   full hemispherical shapes (about 160 degrees). Their surfaces are
   densely populated by imaging elements (artificial ommatidia), which are
   comparable in number (180) to those of the eyes of fire ants (Solenopsis
   fugax) and bark beetles(4,5) (Hylastes nigrinus). The devices combine
   elastomeric compound optical elements with deformable arrays of thin
   silicon photodetectors into integrated sheets that can be elastically
   transformed from the planar geometries in which they are fabricated to
   hemispherical shapes for integration into apposition cameras. Our
   imaging results and quantitative ray-tracing-based simulations
   illustrate key features of operation. These general strategies seem to
   be applicable to other compound eye devices, such as those inspired by
   moths and lacewings(6,7) (refracting superposition eyes), lobster and
   shrimp(8) (reflecting superposition eyes), and houseflies(9) (neural
   superposition eyes).}},

   kinetic mechanism. The butanol mechanism includes 1446 reactions, and we

   reactions. In addition, we extend our previous analysis of ignition
   delay targets to include species targets. The combination of species and
   ignition targets leads to multitarget global sensitivity analysis, which
   allows for a more complete mechanism validation procedure than we
   previously implemented. The inclusion of species sensitivity analysis
   allows for a direct comparison between reaction pathway analysis and
   global sensitivity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The ocean surface velocity field in the Cape Blanc region, off Northwest
   Africa, is investigated with the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method
   applied to channel-4 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite
   images. An initial sensitivity analysis allows us to select the four
   parameters that provide maximum area coverage and the best velocity
   resolution, while limiting the standard deviation for each velocity
   component within reasonable values. These are (m, n, MV, CT)=(22, 32,
   50, 0.6), where m and n are the number of pixels of the search window
   (SW) and reference window (RW), respectively, MV is the maximum possible
   velocity (in cm s(-1)), and CT is a correlation threshold for a feature
   to be tracked. A total of 489 images, for years 2005 and 2006, are
   analysed, and 106 velocity maps are generated with good coverage of the
   coastal transition zone (CTZ), most of them for the winter (34) and
   spring (59) seasons. We remove spurious data using the method's own
   filters (MV, CT, and a neighbour-vector comparison), requesting the
   velocity components to have Gaussian distributions and smoothing the
   resulting velocity fields with a median-vector filter. The instantaneous
   velocity maps illustrate the response of the alongshore coastal jet
   north of Cape Blanc (and its extension along the Cape Verde frontal
   region) to wind forcing, as well as the presence of numerous mesoscalar
   features (100-300 km wide) superposed on a westward offshore transport
   south of Cape Blanc. We also produce mean and standard deviation winter
   and spring velocity maps, which are compared with the corresponding mean
   sea surface temperature fields. The along-shore and offshore flow is
   better defined and is more intense in spring than in winter, in
   concordance with cross-slope sharper temperature gradients during this
   season, and brings about a cooling of the whole region. We identify five
   different ubiquitous currents: a southwestward jet north of Cape Blanc,
   a northwest-ward jet off Banc d'Argin, an offshore convergent jet, a
   spring jet-like feature at 18 degrees N, and a southward flow in the
   southwestern CTZ.}},

Abstract = {{GPS velocities measured in the Pamir and surrounding regions show a
   total of similar to 30 mm/yr of northward relative motion between stable
   Pakistan and Eurasia. The convergence budget is partitioned into
   10-15mm/yr of localized shortening across the Trans-Alai Thrust, which
   bounds the Pamir on the north, consistent with southward subduction of
   intact lithosphere. Another 10-15mm/yr of shortening is distributed
   across the Chitral Himalaya and Hindu Kush, suggesting that Hindu Kush
   seismicity might be related to northward subduction of Indian
   lithosphere. Modest shortening at <5 mm/yr occurs north of the
   Trans-Alai Thrust, across the South Tien Shan and between the Ferghana
   Valley and Eurasia. Negligible north-south shortening occurs within the
   high Pamir, but as much as 5mm/yr, and perhaps 10mm/yr, of east-west
   extension occurs within this region. This extension is matched by a
   comparable amount of east-west shortening in the Tajik Depression. The
   localization of shortening to the margins of the Pamir combined with
   observations of distributed internal extension implies that the
   east-west vertically averaged, horizontal compressive normal stress is
   smaller than the north-south compressive stress.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate how magnetic control of ion-neutral
   interactions in the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system effectively
   produces source terms for non-migrating solar tides in the neutral
   momentum equations for the thermosphere. The National Center for
   Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation
   Model (TIME-GCM) is utilized to quantify these tides, and to assess
   their importance relative to those that propagate upward from lower
   atmospheric regions. The primary diurnal tides excited in situ by the
   above mechanism include DE1, D0 and DW2, with zonal wind amplitudes on
   the order of 20 m s(-1) (5-10 m s(-1)) at approximate to 500 km
   (approximate to 350 km) under solar maximum (minimum) conditions.
   Smaller amplitude semidiurnal non-migrating tides, mainly SE1, S0, SW1,
   and SW3, are also generated under solar maximum conditions. The
   aggregate effect of these tidal components is to produce extrema ranging
   from -110 to +140 m s(-1) in a typical illustration of latitude versus
   longitude at a constant local time. The associated wind circulations
   include vertical wind perturbations that drive temperature perturbations
   through adiabatic heating and cooling effects. At high latitudes,
   hydromagnetic coupling effects generate non-migrating tidal components
   including DE1, D0, DW2, SE1, S0, and SW1, which show interhemispheric
   differences in both amplitude and latitudinal structure due to
   interhemispheric differences in the offset between the geographic and
   geomagnetic poles. Our computational results show that the in situ
   generated non-migrating tidal components dominate some parts of the
   tidal spectrum at high levels of solar activity and suggest that in situ
   generated non-migrating tides must be taken into account in order to
   reconcile differences in data-model comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{We report measurements and uncertainty analysis on a cryogenic low-noise
   amplifier (LNA) with a very low noise temperature (NT), among the lowest
   noise performances reported at microwave frequencies. The LNA consists
   of three stages of InP high electron mobility transistors with a gate
   length of 130nm. It exhibits about 44dB gain and less than 2K average NT
   in the operational band of 4GHz to 8GHz. A detailed uncertainty analysis
   is outlined to evaluate a variety of error sources in the measurement.
   The calculated uncertainty shows as low as 0.1dB on the measured gain of
   about 44dB and 0.18K on the measured NT of 1.65K, indicating excellent
   measurement accuracy. A breakdown of the uncertainty components helps
   identify the major causes of the overall uncertainty and enlightens us
   about how to further improve accuracy. It is important to know the
   actual physical temperature of the passive termination that is used as a
   cryogenic noise source in experiments. Due to its large temperature
   gradients, the commercial matched load is replaced by a custom-made
   attenuator that is isothermal and consequently provides reliable NT
   measurements of the LNA. The precision measurement technique developed
   at the National Institute of Standards and Technology is independent
   from the manufacturers' characterization method. This study marks the
   first time that such a low NT from a cryogenic LNA is verified
   independently with such a low uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Orbits of launch-vehicle upper stages and spheres were observed by U.S.
   Air Force Space Command, and the resulting observations were converted
   by the Space Analysis Office to fitted ballistic coefficients by
   comparing the observed orbit with an orbit predicted by an
   atmospheric-drag model. The ballistic coefficients contain signals that
   result from atmospheric variability not captured by the model as well as
   signals that correspond to changes in the satellite-drag coefficient.
   For objects in highly elliptical orbits with perigee altitudes below 200
   km a 50\% change in ballistic coefficient can be observed. This drastic
   change is associated with both changes in the energy accommodation
   coefficient driven by atomic-oxygen adsorption and entry into a
   transition flow region where a diffuse shock forms ahead of the
   satellite near perigee. Furthermore, the observed ballistic coefficients
   for objects in near-circular orbits (7.5 km/s speeds) do not match those
   of objects in highly eccentric orbits (10 km/s speeds near perigee).
   This difference is attributed to a decrease in adsorption efficiency
   postulated by previous researchers that is formalized in this work into
   a semi-empirical model. The model parameters suggest that the average
   binding energy of atomic oxygen on satellite surfaces is about 5.7 eV.}},

Abstract = {{We present a unique experimental configuration that allows us to
   determine the interfacial forces on nearly parallel plates made from the
   thinnest possible mechanical structures, single and few layer graphene
   membranes. Our approach consists of using a pressure difference across a
   graphene membrane to bring the membrane to within similar to 10-20 nm
   above a circular post covered with SiOx or Au until a critical point is
   reached whereby the membrane snaps into adhesive contact with the post.
   Continuous measurements of the deforming membrane with an AFM coupled
   with a theoretical model allow us to deduce the magnitude of the
   interfacial forces between graphene and SiOx and graphene and Au. The
   nature of the interfacial forces at similar to 10-20 nm separation is
   consistent with an inverse fourth power distance dependence, implying
   that the interfacial forces are dominated by van der Waals interactions.
   Furthermore, the strength of the interactions is found to increase
   linearly with the number of graphene layers. The experimental approach
   can be used to measure the strength of the interfacial forces for other
   atomically thin two-dimensional materials and help guide the development
   of nanomechanical devices such as switches, resonators, and sensors.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We used analytical and numerical techniques to investigate the effect of
   a quasi-steady-state laminar wake behind a circular cylinder on the
   second-order reaction between two initially distant scalars. The scalars
   are released continuously from locations upstream of the cylinder, and
   are separated from each other by a lateral distance that initially
   impedes the reaction. By comparing the laterally integrated reaction
   evolution for cases with and without the cylinder wake, the direct
   effect of the wake on reaction enhancement is determined. We compute the
   reaction for a range of reaction speeds, scalar diffusivities, and
   scalar release geometries. The presence of the cylinder wake generates
   significant reaction enhancement for all cases; the ratio of the
   reaction with and without the cylinder increases with the initial scalar
   separation distance. We identify the mechanism for the reaction
   enhancement, and demonstrate that the reaction rate in the cylinder wake
   can be predicted by a simple analytical model of a stretched scalar
   interface. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The stochastic Galerkin and collocation methods are used to solve an
   advection-diffusion equation with uncertain and spatially varying
   viscosity. We investigate well-posedness, monotonicity and stability for
   the extended system resulting from the Galerkin projection of the
   advection-diffusion equation onto the stochastic basis functions.
   High-order summation-by-parts operators and weak imposition of boundary
   conditions are used to prove stability of the semi-discrete system.
   It is essential that the eigenvalues of the resulting viscosity matrix
   of the stochastic Galerkin system are positive and we investigate
   conditions for this to hold. When the viscosity matrix is
   diagonalizable, stochastic Galerkin and stochastic collocation are
   similar in terms of computational cost, and for some cases the accuracy
   is higher for stochastic Galerkin provided that monotonicity
   requirements are met. We also investigate the total spatial operator of
   the semi-discretized system and its impact on the convergence to
   steady-state. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty in seasonal snow reconstruction: Relative impacts of model
   forcing and image availability}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{165-177}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{There are many areas of uncertainty when solving the inverse problems of
   snow water equivalent (SWE) reconstruction. These include (i) the
   ability to infer the Final Date of the Seasonal Snow (FDSS) cover,
   particularly from remote sensing; (ii) errors in model forcing data
   (such as air temperature or radiation fluxes); and (iii) weaknesses in
   the snow model used for the reconstruction, associated with both the
   fidelity of the equations used to simulate snow processes (structural
   uncertainty) and the parameter values selected for use in the model
   equations. We investigate the trade-offs among these sources of
   uncertainty using 10,000 station-years worth of data from the western US
   SNOTEL network. Model structural and parameter uncertainty are
   eliminated by using a perfect model scenario i. e. comparing results to
   modelled control runs. The model was calibrated for each station-year to
   ensure that the model simulations reflect reality. Results indicate that
   for a temperature index model, a +/- 5 days error in FDSS gives a median
   -25\%/+32\% error in maximum SWE. A 1 degrees C air temperature bias
   produces a SWE error larger than a 5 days error in the FDSS for 50\% of
   the 10,000 cases. Similarly, a 5 days error in FDSS could be accounted
   for by a net radiation error of 13 W m(-2) or less during the melt
   period, in 50\% of cases. Mean absolute errors of 1 degrees C or more
   are typically reported in the literature for air temperature
   interpolations at high elevations. Observed solar radiation during the
   melt season can differ by 30 W m(-2) over relatively short distances,
   while estimates from reanalysis (NARR, ERA-Interim, MERRA, CFSRR) and
   GOES satellites typically span more than 40 W m(-2). Using data from
   both MODIS sensors (Terra \& Aqua) at all snow covered points in the
   western US, a consecutive 5 days gap in imagery at time of FDSS is
   likely to occur only 5-10\% of the time. This work shows that errors in
   model forcing data are at least as important, if not more, than image
   availability when reconstructing SWE. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A simple, adaptable, and robust method for ballistic landings on the
   surface of a binary asteroid system is presented. The desire is to
   deploy a lander, from a mother spacecraft passing in the vicinity of one
   of the collinear libration point of the system, on an unpowered
   trajectory, meaning that active guidance is not needed. From the
   concepts of the circular restricted three-body problem, suitably adapted
   for the objective, the features that make such a strategy feasible for
   any asteroid binary system are detailed. Proving that this strategy is
   effective fora wide range of actual binary systems, the requirements on
   the deployment are found to be very robust to operational accuracy.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A key challenge to the commercial production of commodity chemical and
   fuels is the toxicity of such molecules to the microbial host. While a
   number of studies have attempted to engineer improved tolerance for such
   compounds, the majority of these studies have been performed in
   wild-type strains and culturing conditions that differ considerably from
   production conditions. Here we applied the multiscalar analysis of
   library enrichments (SCALEs) method and performed a growth selection in
   an ethanol production system to quantitatively map in parallel all genes
   in the genome onto ethanol tolerance and production. In order to perform
   the selection in an ethanol-producing system, we used a previously
   engineered Escherichia coli ethanol production strain (LW06; ATCC
   BAA-2466) (Woodruff et al., in press), as the host strain for the
   multiscalar genomic library analysis (> 10(6) clones for each library of
   1, 2, or 4 kb overlapping genomic fragments). By testing individually
   selected clones, we confirmed that growth selections enriched for clones
   with both improved ethanol tolerance and production phenotypes. We
   performed combinatorial testing of the top genes identified (uspC, otsA,
   otsB) to investigate their ability to confer improved ethanol tolerance
   or ethanol production. We determined that overexpression of otsA was
   required for improved tolerance and productivity phenotypes, with the
   best performing strains showing up to 75\% improvement relative to the
   parent production strain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{515-522}},

Abstract = {{Recombineering has been an essential tool for genetic engineering in
   microbes for many years and has enabled faster, more efficient
   engineering than previous techniques. There have been numerous studies
   that focus on improving recombineering efficiency, which can be divided
   into three main areas: (i) optimizing the oligo used for recombineering
   to enhance replication fork annealing and limit proofreading; (ii)
   mechanisms to modify the replisome itself, enabling an increased rate of
   annealing; and (iii) multiplexing recombineering targets and automation.
   These efforts have increased the efficiency of recombineering several
   hundred-fold. One area that has received far less attention is the
   problem of multiple chromosomes, which effectively decrease efficiency
   on a chromosomal basis, resulting in more sectored colonies, which
   require longer outgrowth to obtain clonal populations. Herein, we
   describe the problem of multiple chromosomes, discuss calculations
   predicting how many generations are needed to obtain a pure colony, and
   how changes in experimental procedure or genetic background can minimize
   the effect of multiple chromosomes.}},

Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) migration and recruitment play a
   critical role during bone fracture healing. Within the complex
   three-dimensional (3-D) in vivo microenvironment, hMSC migration is
   regulated through a myriad of extracellular cues. Here, we use a
   thiol-ene photopolymerized hydrogel to recapitulate structural and
   bioactive inputs in a tunable manner to understand their role in
   regulating 3-D hMSC migration. Specifically, peptide-functionalized
   poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels were used to encapsulate hMSC while
   varying the crosslinking density, from 0.18 +/- 0.02 to 1.60 +/- 0.04
   mM, and the adhesive ligand density, from 0.001 to 1.0 mM. Using
   live-cell videomicroscopy, migratory cell paths were tracked and fitted
   to a Persistent Random Walk model. It was shown that hMSC migrating
   through the lowest crosslinking density and highest adhesivity had more
   sustained polarization, higher migrating speeds (17.6 +/- 0.9 mu m
   h(-1)) and higher cell spreading (elliptical form factor = 3.9 +/- 0.2).
   However, manipulation of these material properties did not significantly
   affect migration persistence. Further, there was a monotonic increase in
   cell speed and spreading with increasing adhesivity that showed a lack
   of the biphasic trend seen in 2-D cell migration. Immunohistochemistry
   showed well-formed actin fibers and beta 1 integrin staining at the ends
   of stress fibers. This thiol-ene platform provides a highly tunable
   substrate to characterize 3-D hMSC migration that can be applied as an
   implantable cell carrier platform or for the recruitment of endogenous
   hMSC in vivo. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a class of smart materials that can fix
   a temporary shape and recover to their permanent (original) shape in
   response to an environmental stimulus such as heat, electricity, or
   irradiation, among others. Most SMPs developed in the past can only
   demonstrate the so-called one-way shape memory effect; i.e., one
   programming step can only yield one shape memory cycle. Recently, one of
   the authors (Mather) developed a SMP that exhibits both one-way shape
   memory (1W-SM) and two-way shape memory (2W-SM) effects (with the
   assistance of an external load). This SMP was further used to develop a
   free-standing composite actuator with a nonlinear reversible actuation
   under thermal cycling. In this paper, a theoretical model for the PCO
   SMP based composite actuator was developed to investigate its
   thermomechanical behavior and the mechanisms for the observed phenomena
   during the actuation cycles, and to provide insight into how to improve
   the design.}},

   fraction of single-nanowire LEDs produce measurable band-gap
   electroluminescence when a thin AlGaN electron blocking layer (EBL) is
   incorporated into the device structure near the junction. Similar
   devices with no EBL typically yield below-detection-limit
   electroluminescence, despite diode-like I-V characteristics and
   optically measured internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of similar to
   1\%. I-V measurements of the p-regions in p-n junction nanowires, as
   well as nanowires doped with Mg only, indicate low p-type conductivity
   and asymmetric Schottky-like p-contacts. These observations suggest that
   imbalanced carrier injection from the junction and p-contact can produce
   significant nonradiative losses.}},

Abstract = {{Villermaux \& Pomeau (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 642, 2010, p. 147) analysed
   the motion of the interface of an inviscid liquid column released from
   rest in a vertical tube whose area expands gradually downwards, with
   application to an inverted conical container for which experimental
   measurements were carried out. An error in the analysis is found and
   corrected in the present investigation, which provides the new governing
   equation for the super-accelerated interface motion down gradually
   varying tubes in general, and integrated results for interface
   trajectories, velocities and accelerations down a conical tube in
   particular. Interestingly, the error does not affect any of the
   conclusions given in the 2010 paper. Further new results are reported
   here such as the equation governing the centre of mass and proof that
   the end point acceleration is exactly that of gravity.}},

Abstract = {{Copy number variations (CNVs) can alter the DNA sequence in blocks
   ranging from kilobases to megabases, involving more total nucleotides
   than single nucleotide polymorphisms. Yet, its impact in humans is far
   from fully understood. In this study, we investigate the relationship of
   genome-wide CNVs with brain function elicited by an alcohol cue in 300
   participants with alcohol use disorders. First, we extracted refined
   neurobiological phenotypes, the brain responses to an alcohol cue versus
   a juice cue in the precuneus, thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC). Then, we correlated the CNVs with incidence frequency >1\% to the
   neurobiological phenotypes. One CNV region at 22q13.1 was identified to
   be associated with alcohol dependence severity and the brain response to
   alcohol cues. Specifically, the 22k base-pair homozygous deletion at
   22q13.1 affects genes APOBEC3a and APOBEC3b. Carriers of this homozygous
   deletion show a significantly higher score in the alcohol dependence
   severity (P<0.05) and increased response to alcohol cues in the
   precuneus (P<1012) than other participants. Tests of a mediation model
   indicate that the precuneus mediates the association between the
   homozygous deletions and alcohol dependence severity. Interestingly, the
   precuneus is not only anatomically and functionally connected to the ACC
   and thalamus (the main active regions to the alcohol cue), but also has
   the most predictive power to the alcohol dependence severity. These
   findings suggest that the homozygous deletion at 22q13.1 may have an
   important impact on the function of the precuneus with downstream
   implications for alcohol dependence.}},

Title = {{A Diels-Alder modulated approach to control and sustain the release of

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{We report a new approach to controlled drug release based upon
   exploiting the dynamic equilibrium that exists between Diels-Alder
   reactants and products, demonstrating the release of a furan containing
   dexamethasone peptide (dex-KGPQG-furan) from a maleimide containing
   hydrogel. Using a reaction-diffusion model, the release kinetics were
   tuned to achieve sustained concentrations conducive to osteogenic
   differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Efficacy was
   first demonstrated in a 2D culture model, in which dexamethasone release
   induced significant increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and
   mineral deposition in hMSCs compared to a dexamethasone-free treatment
   The results were similar to that observed with a soluble dexamethasone
   treatment. More dramatic differences were observed in 3D culture, where
   co-encapsulation of a dexamethasone releasing hydrogel depot within an
   hMSC-laden extracellular matrix mimetic poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel
   resulted in a local and robust osteogenic differentiation. ALP activity
   reached levels that were up to six times higher than the dexamethasone
   free treatment. Interestingly, at 5 and 10 day time points, the ALP
   activity exceeded the dexamethasone positive control, suggesting a
   potential benefit of sustained release in 3D culture. After 21 days,
   substantial mineralization comparable to the positive control was also
   observed in the hydrogels. Collectively, these results demonstrate
   Diels-Alder modulated release as an effective and versatile new platform
   for controlled drug delivery that may prove especially beneficial for
   sustaining the release of low molecular weight molecules in hydrogel
   systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a generalized multi-hop MIMO amplify-and-forward (AF) relay
   network with multiple sources/destinations and arbitrarily number of
   relays. We establish two dualities and the corresponding dual
   transformations between such a network and its dual, respectively, under
   single-network linear constraint and per-hop linear constraint. A
   unified optimization framework is proposed to find a stationary point
   for an important class of nonconvex optimization problems of AF relay
   networks based on a local Lagrange dual method, where the primal
   algorithm only finds a stationary point for the inner loop problem of
   maximizing the Lagrangian w.r.t. the primal variables. The input
   covariance matrices are shown to satisfy a polite water-filling
   structure at a stationary point of the inner loop problem. The duality
   and polite water-filling are exploited to design fast primal algorithms.
   Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed optimization
   framework with duality-based primal algorithms can be used to solve more
   general problems with lower computation cost.}},

Abstract = {{Rule extraction is a promising technique for developing or fine-tuning
   supervisory control strategies in buildings. Three data mining
   techniques are examined that extract rules from offline model predictive
   control (MPC) results for a mixed mode building operated during the
   cooling season: generalized linear models (GLM), classification and
   regression trees (CART), and adaptive boosting. All rules were able to
   recover approximately 90\% of the original optimizer energy savings
   under open loop tests, but the GLM-based rules saw significant
   performance degradation under simulated tests. CART and boost rules only
   degraded in performance by a few percentage points, still retaining the
   vast majority of optimizer savings (84\% and 93\% for the CART and boost
   rules, respectively). The results demonstrate that the proposed rule
   extraction techniques may allow building automation systems to achieve
   near-optimal supervisory control strategies without online MPC systems,

   more complex cases.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, a theoretical formulation is presented for the
   load-transfer analysis of an elastic cylindrical thin-walled pile
   immersed in a transversely isotropic half-space under axisymmetric
   excitations. By generating a set of weakly singular Green's functions
   for the embedding medium and using a shell theory for the pile, it is
   shown that similar to the related interaction analysis in isotropic
   medium, the soil-structure interaction problem under consideration is
   reducible to two coupled Fredholm integral equations. Regarding the
   singular nature of stress transfer, a newly developed adaptive-gradient
   elements family is employed in the development of an accurate numerical
   scheme. The effect of soil material anisotropy on the dynamic
   interaction process is explored by presenting a set of numerical results
   for various material and geometrical conditions and various excitation
   frequencies. To confirm the accuracy of the proposed analytical and
   numerical scheme, numerical results are compared with benchmark
   solutions for the corresponding isotropic problem. DOI:

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in developing dynamically responsive
   hydrogels whose material properties are modulated by environmental cues,
   including with light. These photoresponsive hydrogels afford
   spatiotemporal control of material properties through an array of
   photoaddition and photodegradation reactions. For photoresponsive
   hydrogels to be utilized most effectively in a broad range of
   applications, the photoreaction behavior should be well understood,
   enabling the design of dynamic materials with uniform or anisostropic
   material properties. Here, a general statistical-kinetic model has been
   developed to describe controlled photodegradation in hydrogel polymer
   networks containing photolabile crosslinks. The heterogeneous reaction
   rates that necessarily accompany photochemical reactions were described
   by solving a system of partial differential equations that quantify the
   photoreaction kinetics in the material. The kinetics were coupled with
   statistical descriptions of network structure in chain polymerized
   hydrogels to model material property changes and mass loss that occur
   during the photodegradation process. Finally, the physical relevance of
   the model was demonstrated by comparing model predictions with
   experimental data of mass loss and material property changes in
   photodegradable, PEG-based hydrogels. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the underlying relationship between the implicit
   level of risk accepted for natural hazards, and the level of economic,

   information is related to the seismic provisions of the building codes

   all experienced major earthquakes in 2010. The loss of life and
   devastation in Haiti, however, was much worse than in Chile and New
   Zealand, despite a somewhat smaller magnitude of the earthquake.
   Specifically, this paper compares the differences among the three
   events, and notes some of the social aspects that led to the conditions
   in each country at the time of the earthquakes. Variables evaluated are
   aspects of the social solidity, political stability, and economic
   growth. Implicit considerations include magnitude of the earthquake,
   local geological conditions, demographics of the population, and
   population at seismic risk. Damage is continuing to be investigated by
   several countries concerning the loss of life, injury, property damage,
   and how well various structures have performed in these three countries.

Abstract = {{There is always a considerable clinical need for vascular grafts.
   Considering the availability, physical and mechanical properties, and
   regenerative potential, we have developed and characterized readily
   available, strong, and compliant multilayer grafts that support cell
   culture and ingrowth. The grafts were made from heterogeneous materials
   and structures, including a thin, dense, nanofibrous core composed of
   poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL), and a thick, porous, hydrogel sleeve
   composed of genipin-crosslinked collagenchitosan (GCC). Because the
   difference in physicochemical properties between PCL and GCC caused
   layer separation, the layer adhesion was identified as a determinant to
   graft property and integrity under physiological conditions. Thus,
   strategies to modify the layer interface, including increasing porosity
   of the PCL surface, decreasing hydrophobicity, and increasing interlayer
   crosslinking, were developed. Results from microscopic images showed
   that increasing PCL porosity was characterized by improved layer
   adhesion. The resultant graft was characterized by high compliance
   (4.5\%), and desired permeability (528 mL/cm2/min), burst strength (695
   mmHg), and suture strength (2.38 N) for readily grafting. Results also
   showed that PCL mainly contributed to the graft mechanical properties,
   whereas GCC reduced the water permeability. In addition to their
   complementary contributions to physical and mechanical properties, the
   distinct graft layers also provided layer-specific structures for
   seeding and culture of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells in
   vitro. Acellular graft constructs were readily used to replace abdominal
   aorta of rabbits, resulting in rapid cell ingrowth and flow reperfusion.
   The multilayer constructs capable of sustaining physiological conditions
   and promoting cellular activities could serve as a platform for future
   development of regenerative vascular grafts. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{In the genome-engineering era, it is increasingly important that
   researchers have access to a common set of platform strains that can
   serve as debugged production chassis and the basis for applying new
   metabolic engineering strategies for modeling and characterizing flux,
   engineering complex traits, and optimizing overall performance. Here, we
   describe such a platform strain of E. coli engineered for ethanol
   production. Starting with a fully characterized host strain (BW25113),
   we site-specifically integrated the genes required for homoethanol
   production under the control of a strong inducible promoter into the
   genome and deleted the genes encoding four enzymes from competing
   pathways. This strain is capable of producing >30g/L of ethanol in
   minimal media with <2g/L produced of any fermentative byproduct. Using
   this platform strain, we tested previously identified ethanol tolerance
   genes and found that while tolerance was improved under certain
   conditions, any effect on ethanol production or tolerance was lost when
   grown under production conditions. Thus, our findings reinforce the need
   for a metabolic engineering commons that could provide a set of platform
   strains for use in more sophisticated genome-engineering strategies.
   Towards this end, we have made this production strain available to the
   scientific community. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 15201526. (c) 2013

   their spontaneous realignment and transformations of director structures

   liquid crystal solids and active colloids, may enable shape-controlled

Abstract = {{Ammonia (NH3) has significant impacts on biodiversity, eutrophication,
   and acidification. Widespread uncertainty in the magnitude and
   seasonality of NH3 emissions hinders efforts to address these issues. In
   this work, we constrain U. S. NH3 sources using observations from the
   TES satellite instrument with the GEOS-Chem model and its adjoint. The
   inversion framework is first validated using simulated observations. We
   then assimilate TES observations for April, July, and October of 2006
   through 2009. The adjoint-based inversion allows emissions to be
   adjusted heterogeneously; they are found to increase in California
   throughout the year, increase in different regions of the West depending
   upon season, and exhibit smaller increases and occasional decreases in
   the Eastern U. S. Evaluations of the inversion using independent surface
   measurements show reduced model underestimates of surface NH3 and wet
   deposited NHx in April and October; however, the constrained simulation
   in July leads to overestimates of these quantities, while TES
   observations are still under predicted. Modeled sulfate and nitrate
   aerosols concentrations do not change significantly, and persistent
   nitrate overestimation is noted, consistent with previous studies.
   Overall, while satellite-based constraints on NH3 emissions improve
   model simulations in several aspects, additional assessment at higher
   horizontal resolution of spatial sampling bias, nitric acid formation,
   and diurnal variability and bi-directionality of NH3 sources may be
   necessary to enhance year-round model performance across the full range
   of gas and aerosol evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrafast librational (hindered rotational) relaxation of a
   rotationally excited H2O molecule in pure liquid water is investigated
   by means of classical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and
   a power and work analysis. This analysis allows the mechanism of the
   energy transfer from the excited H2O to its water neighbors, which
   occurs on a sub-100 fs time scale, to be followed in molecular detail,
   i.e., to determine which water molecules receive the energy and in which
   degrees of freedom. It is found that the dominant energy flow is to the
   four hydrogen-bonded water partners in the first hydration shell,
   dominated by those partners' rotational motion, in a fairly symmetric
   fashion over the hydration shell. The minority component of the energy
   transfer, to these neighboring waters' translational motion, exhibits an
   asymmetry in energy reception between hydrogen-bond-donating and
   -accepting water molecules. The variation of the energy flow
   characteristics with rotational axis, initial rotational energy
   excitation magnitude, method of excitation, and temperature is discussed
   Finally, the relation of the nonequilibrium results to equilibrium time

Abstract = {{The three gamma states, gamma (1S + 2S + 3S), are measured in d + Au and
   p + p collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV and rapidities 1.2 < vertical
   bar y vertical bar < 2.2 by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic
   Heavy Ion Collider. Cross sections for the inclusive gamma (1S + 2S +
   3S) production are obtained. The inclusive yields per binary collision
   for d + Au collisions relative to those in p + p collisions (R-dAu) are
   found to be 0.62 +/- 0.26 (stat) +/- 0.13 (syst) in the gold-going
   direction and 0.91 +/- 0.33 (stat) +/- 0.16 (syst) in the deuteron-going
   direction. The measured results are compared to a nuclear-shadowing
   model, EPS09 {[}Eskola et al., J. High Energy Phys. 04 (2009) 065],
   combined with a final-state breakup cross section, sigma(br), and
   compared to lower energy p + A results. We also compare the results to
   the PHENIX J/psi results {[}Adare et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 142301
   (2011)]. The rapidity dependence of the observed gamma suppression is
   consistent with lower energy p + A measurements. DOI:

Title = {{Metagenomic evidence for sulfur lithotrophy by Epsilonproteobacteria as
   the major energy source for primary productivity in a sub-aerial arctic
   glacial deposit Borup Fiord Pass}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{We combined free energy calculations and metagenomic analyses of an
   elemental sulfur (S) deposit on the surface of Borup Fiord Pass Glacier
   in the Canadian High Arctic to investigate whether the energy available
   from different redox reactions in an environment predicts microbial
   metabolism. Many S, C, Fe, As, Mn, and NH4+ oxidation reactions were
   predicted to be energetically feasible in the deposit, and aerobic
   oxidation of S was the most abundant chemical energy source. Small
   subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequence data showed that the
   dominant phylotypes were Sulfurovum and Sulfuricurvum, both
   Epsilonproteobacteria known to be capable of sulfur lithotrophy. Sulfur
   redox genes were abundant in the metagenome, but sox genes were
   significantly more abundant than reverse dsr (dissimilatory sulfite
   reductase) genes. Interestingly, there appeared to be habitable niches
   that were unoccupied at the depth of genome coverage obtained.
   Photosynthesis and NH4+ oxidation should both be energetically
   favorable, but we found few or no functional genes for oxygenic or
   anoxygenic photosynthesis, or for NH4+ oxidation by either oxygen
   (nitrification) or nitrite (anammox). The free energy, SSU rRNA gene and
   quantitative functional gene data are all consistent with the hypothesis
   that sulfur-based chemolithoautotrophy by Epsilonproteobacteria
   (Sulfurovum and Sulfuricurvum) is the main form of primary productivity
   at this site, instead of photosynthesis. This is despite the presence of
   24-h sunlight, and the fact that photosynthesis is not known to be
   inhibited by any of the environmental conditions present. This is the
   first time that Sulfurovum and Sulfuricurvum have been shown to dominate
   a sub-aerial environment, rather than anoxic or sulfidic settings. We
   also found that Flavobacteria dominate the surface of the sulfur
   deposits. We hypothesize that this aerobic heterotroph uses enough
   oxygen to create a microoxic environment in the sulfur below, where the
   Epsilonproteobacteria can flourish.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate holographic optical trapping combined with
   step-and-repeat maskless projection stereolithography for fine control
   of 3D position of living cells within a 3D microstructured hydrogel.
   C2C12 myoblast cells were chosen as a demonstration platform since their
   development into multinucleated myotubes requires linear arrangements of
   myoblasts. C2C12 cells are positioned in the monomer solution with
   multiple optical traps at 1064 nm and then encapsulated by
   photopolymerization of monomer via projection of a 512x512 spatial light
   modulator illuminated at 405 nm. High 405 nm sensitivity and complete
   insensitivity to 1064 nm was enabled by a lithium acylphosphinate (LAP)
   salt photoinitiator. These wavelengths, in addition to brightfield
   imaging with a white light LED, could be simultaneously focused by a
   single oil immersion objective. Large lateral dimensions of the
   patterned gel/cell structure are achieved by x and y step-and-repeat
   process. Large thickness is achieved through multi-layer
   stereolithography, allowing fabrication of precisely-arranged 3D live
   cell scaffolds with micron-scale structure and millimeter dimensions.
   Cells are shown to retain viability after the trapping and encapsulation
   procedure. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Human-associated microbial communities vary across individuals: possible
   contributing factors include (genetic) relatedness, diet, and age.
   However, our surroundings, including individuals with whom we interact,
   also likely shape our microbial communities. To quantify this microbial
   exchange, we surveyed fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 60 families
   (spousal units with children, dogs, both, or neither). Household
   members, particularly couples, shared more of their microbiota than
   individuals from different households, with stronger effects of
   co-habitation on skin than oral or fecal microbiota. Dog ownership
   significantly increased the shared skin microbiota in cohabiting adults,
   and dog-owning adults shared more `skin' microbiota with their own dogs
   than with other dogs. Although the degree to which these shared microbes
   have a true niche on the human body, vs transient detection after direct
   contact, is unknown, these results suggest that direct and frequent
   contact with our cohabitants may significantly shape the composition of
   our microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the first coincident observation of inertia-gravity
   waves (IGWs) by lidar and radar in the Antarctic mesopause region. This
   is also the first known observation of two simultaneous IGWs at the same
   location. An Fe Boltzmann lidar at Arrival Heights (77.8 degrees S,
   166.7 degrees E) provides high-resolution temperature data, and a
   co-located MF radar provides wind data. On 29 June 2011, coherent wave
   structures are observed in both the Fe lidar temperature and MF radar
   winds. Two dominant waves are determined from the temperature data with
   apparent periods of 7.7 +/- 0.2 and 5.0 +/- 0.1 h and vertical
   wavelengths of 22 +/- 2 and 23 +/- 2 km, respectively. The simultaneous
   measurements of temperature and wind allow the intrinsic wave properties
   to be derived from hodograph analyses unambiguously. The analysis shows
   that the longer-period wave propagates northward with an azimuth of =11
   degrees +/- 5 degrees clockwise from north. This wave has a horizontal
   wavelength of h=2.2 +/- 0.2x103 km and an intrinsic period of I=7.9 +/-
   0.3 h. The intrinsic horizontal phase speed (CIh) for this wave is 80
   +/- 4 m/s, while the horizontal and vertical group velocities (Cgh and
   Cgz) are 48 +/- 3 m/s and 0.5 +/- 0.1 m/s, respectively. The
   shorter-period wave has I=4.5 +/- 0.3 h and =100 degrees +/- 4 degrees
   with h=1.1 +/- 0.1x103 km and CIh=68 +/- 5 m/s. Its group velocities are
   Cgh=58 +/- 5 m/s and Cgz=1.1 +/- 0.1 m/s. Therefore, both waves
   propagate with very shallow elevation angles from the horizon (phi=0.6
   degrees +/- 0.1 degrees and phi=1.1 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees for the
   longer- and shorter-period waves, respectively) but originate from
   different sources. Our analysis suggests that the longer-period IGW most
   likely originates from the stratosphere in a region of unbalanced flow.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to derive local sea level variations using
   data from a single geodetic-quality Global Navigation Satellite System
   (GNSS) receiver using GPS (Global Positioning System) signals. This
   method is based on multipath theory for specular reflections and the use
   of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) data. The technique could be valuable for
   altimeter calibration and validation. Data from two test sites, a
   dedicated GPS tide gauge at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) in Sweden
   and the Friday Harbor GPS site of the EarthScope Plate Boundary
   Observatory (PBO) in USA, are analyzed. The sea level results are
   compared to independently observed sea level data from nearby and in
   situ tide gauges. For OSO, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) agreement is
   better than 5 cm, while it is in the order of 10 cm for Friday Harbor.
   The correlation coefficients are better than 0.97 for both sites. For
   OSO, the SNR-based results are also compared with results from a
   geodetic analysis of GPS data of a two receivers/antennae tide gauge
   installation. The SNR-based analysis results in a slightly worse RMS
   agreement with respect to the independent tide gauge data than the
   geodetic analysis (4.8 cm and 4.0 cm, respectively). However, it
   provides results even for rough sea surface conditions when the two
   receivers/antennae installation no longer records the necessary data for
   a geodetic analysis. (C) 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Use of change-point detection for friction-velocity threshold evaluation
   in eddy-covariance studies}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},

Volume = {{171}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The eddy-covariance method often underestimates fluxes under stable,
   low-wind conditions at night when turbulence is not well developed. The
   most common approach to resolve the problem of nighttime flux
   underestimation is to identify and remove the deficit periods using
   friction-velocity (u{*}) threshold filters (u{*}(Th)). This study
   modifies an accepted method for u{*}(Th) evaluation by incorporating
   change-point-detection techniques. The original and modified methods are
   evaluated at 38 sites as part of the North American Carbon Program
   (NACP) site-level synthesis. At most sites, the modified method produced
   u{*}(Th) estimates that were higher and less variable than the original
   method. It also provided an objective method to identify sites that
   lacked a u{*}(Th) response. The modified u{*}(Th) estimates were robust
   and comparable among years. Inter-annual u{*}(Th) differences were
   small, so that a single u{*}(Th) value was warranted at most sites. No
   variation in the u{*}(Th) was observed by time of day (dusk versus mid
   or late night), however, a few sites showed significant u{*}(Th)
   variation with time of year. Among-site variation in the u{*}(Th) was
   strongly related to canopy height and the mean annual nighttime u{*}.
   The modified u{*}(Th) estimates excluded a high fraction of nighttime
   data - 61\% on average. However, the negative impact of the high
   exclusion rate on annual net ecosystem production (NEP) was small
   compared to the larger impact of underestimating the u{*}(Th). Compared
   to the original method, the higher u{*}(Th) estimates from the modified
   method caused a mean 8\% reduction in annual NEP across all site-years,
   and a mean 7\% increase in total ecosystem respiration (R-e). The
   modified method also reduced the u{*}(Th)-related uncertainties in
   annual NEP and R-e by more than 50\%. These results support the use of
   u{*}(Th) filters as a pragmatic solution to a complex problem. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Polysiloxanes are commonly used in a myriad of applications, and the
   click nature of the thiol-ene reaction is well suited for introducing
   alternative functionalities or for crosslinking these ubiquitous
   polymers. As such, understanding of the thiol-ene reaction in the
   presence of silicones is valuable and would lead to enhanced
   methodologies for modification and crosslinking. Here, the thiol-ene
   reaction kinetics were investigated in functionalized oligosiloxanes
   having varying degrees of thiol functionalization (SH), interactions
   (from diphenyls, DP), and ene types (CC). In the ene-functionalized
   oligomers, interactions were controlled through the use of dioctyl
   repeats (DO). The polymerization rate and rate-limiting steps were
   determined for all systems containing an allyl-functionalized oligomer,
   and rates ranging from 0.10 to 0.54 mol L1 min1 were seen. The
   rate-limiting step varied with the oligomer composition; examples of
   rate-limited propagation (5:3:2 CC:DP:DO/1:1 SH:DP) or chain transfer
   (5:3:2 CC:DP:DO/3:1 SH:DP) were found in addition to cases with similar
   reaction rate constants (5:2:3 CC:DP:DO/1:1 SH:DP). None of the
   siloxanes were found to exhibit autoacceleration despite their
   relatively high viscosities. Instead, the allyl-, vinyl-, and
   acrylate-functionalized siloxanes were all found to undergo unimolecular
   termination based on their high scaling values (0.98, 0.95, and 0.82,
   respectively) in the relation Rp Ri. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Title = {{Upstream satellite remote sensing for river discharge forecasting:
   Application to major rivers in South Asia}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{140-151}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work we demonstrate the utility of satellite remote sensing for
   river discharge nowcasting and forecasting for two major rivers, the
   Ganges and Brahmaputra, in southern Asia. Passive microwave sensing of
   the river and floodplain at more than twenty locations upstream of
   Hardinge Bridge (Ganges) and Bahadurabad (Brahmaputra) gauging stations
   are used to: 1) examine the capability of remotely sensed flow
   information to track the downstream propagation of river flow waves and
   2) evaluate their use in producing river flow nowcasts, and forecasts at
   1-15 days lead time. The pattern of correlation between upstream
   satellite data and in situ observations of downstream discharge is used
   to estimate wave propagation time. This pattern of correlation is
   combined with a cross-validation method to select the satellite sites
   that produce the most accurate river discharge estimates in a lagged
   regression model. The results show that the well-correlated
   satellite-derived flow (SDF) signals were able to detect the propagation
   of a river flow wave along both river channels. The daily river
   discharge (contemporaneous) nowcast produced from the upstream SDFs
   could be used to provide missing data estimates given its Nash-Sutcliffe
   coefficient of 0.8 for both rivers; and forecasts have considerably
   better skill than autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model beyond
   3-day lead time for Brahmaputra. Due to the expected better accuracy of
   the SDF for detecting large flows, the forecast error is found to be
   lower for high flows compared to low flows. Overall, we conclude that
   satellite-based flow estimates are a useful source of dynamical surface
   water information in data-scarce regions and that they could be used for
   model calibration and data assimilation purposes in near-time hydrologic
   forecast applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since their discovery more than 50 years ago, Earth's Van Allen
   radiation belts have been considered to consist of two distinct zones of
   trapped, highly energetic charged particles. The outer zone is composed
   predominantly of megaelectron volt (MeV) electrons that wax and wane in
   intensity on time scales ranging from hours to days, depending primarily
   on external forcing by the solar wind. The spatially separated inner
   zone is composed of commingled high-energy electrons and very energetic
   positive ions (mostly protons), the latter being stable in intensity
   levels over years to decades. In situ energy-specific and temporally
   resolved spacecraft observations reveal an isolated third ring, or
   torus, of high-energy (>2 MeV) electrons that formed on 2 September 2012
   and persisted largely unchanged in the geocentric radial range of 3.0 to
   similar to 3.5 Earth radii for more than 4 weeks before being disrupted
   (and virtually annihilated) by a powerful interplanetary shock wave
   passage.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between polymeric hydrogel microstructure and
   macroscopic properties is of specific interest to the materials science
   and polymer science communities for the rational design of materials for
   targeted applications. Specifically, research has focused on elucidating
   the role of network formation and connectivity on mechanical integrity
   and degradation behavior. Here, we compared the mechanical properties of
   chain- and step polymerized, photo degradable hydrogels. Increased
   ductility, tensile toughness, and shear strain to yield were observed in
   step polymerized hydrogels, as compared to the chain polymerized gels,
   indicating that increased homogeneity and network cooperativity in the
   gel backbone improves mechanical integrity. Furthermore, the ability to
   degrade the hydrogels in a controlled fashion with light was exploited
   to explore how hydrogel microstructure influences photodegradation and
   erosion. Here, the decreased network connectivity at the junction points
   in the step polymerized gels resulted in more rapid erosion. Finally, a
   relationship between the reverse gelation threshold and erosion rate was
   developed for the general class of photodegradable hydrogels. In all,
   these studies further elucidate the relationship between hydrogel
   formation and microarchitecture with macroscale behavior to facilitate
   the future design of polymer networks and degradable hydrogels, as well
   as photoresponsive materials such as cell culture templates, drug
   delivery vehicles, responsive coatings, and anisotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Melting of the world's major ice sheets can affect human and
   environmental conditions by contributing to sea-level rise. In July
   2012, an historically rare period of extended surface melting was
   observed across almost the entire Greenland ice sheet(1,2), raising
   questions about the frequency and spatial extent of such events. Here we
   show that low-level clouds consisting of liquid water droplets ('liquid
   clouds'), via their radiative effects, played a key part in this melt
   event by increasing near-surface temperatures. We used a suite of
   surface-based observations(3), remote sensing data, and a surface
   energy-balance model. At the critical surface melt time, the clouds were
   optically thick enough and low enough to enhance the down-welling
   infrared flux at the surface. At the same time they were optically thin
   enough to allow sufficient solar radiation to penetrate through them and
   raise surface temperatures above the melting point. Outside this narrow
   range in cloud optical thickness, the radiative contribution to the
   surface energy budget would have been diminished, and the spatial extent
   of this melting event would have been smaller. We further show that
   these thin, low-level liquid clouds occur frequently, both over
   Greenland and across the Arctic, being present around 30-50 per cent of
   the time(3-6). Our results may help to explain the difficulties that
   global climate models have in simulating the Arctic surface energy
   budget(7-9), particularly as models tend to under-predict the formation
   of optically thin liquid clouds at supercooled temperatures(6)-a process
   potentially necessary to account fully for temperature feedbacks in a
   warming Arctic climate.}},

Abstract = {{Optical rectennas, sub-micrometre antenna-coupled diodes, can directly
   rectify solar and thermal electromagnetic radiation, and have been
   proposed as an alternative to conventional semiconductor photovoltaics.
   We develop a comprehensive description of the operating principle of
   rectenna solar cells. In prior work classical concepts from microwave
   rectenna theory have been applied to the analysis of photovoltaic power
   generation using these ultra-high frequency rectifiers. Because of their
   high photon energy the interaction of petahertz frequency waves with
   fast-responding diodes requires a semiclassical analysis. We use the
   theory of photon-assisted transport to derive the current-voltage {[}I
   (V)] characteristics of metal/insulator/metal tunnel diodes under
   illumination. We show how power is generated in the second quadrant of
   the I (V) characteristic, derive solar cell parameters, and analyse the
   key variables that influence the performance under monochromatic
   radiation and to a first order approximation. The efficiency improves
   with reduced dark current under reverse bias and increasing incident
   electromagnetic power.}},

Abstract = {{The EPA-MARKAL model of the U.S. electricity sector is used to examine
   how imposing emissions fees based on estimated health and environmental
   damages might change electricity generation. Fees are imposed on
   life-cycle emissions of SO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter,
   and greenhouse gases (GHG) from 2015 through 2055. Changes in
   electricity production, fuel type, emissions controls, and emissions
   produced under various fees are examined. A shift in fuels used for
   electricity production results from \$30/ton CO2-equivalent GHG fees or
   from criteria pollutant fees set at the higher-end of the range of
   published damage estimates, but not from criteria pollutant fees based
   on low or midrange damage estimates. With midrange criteria pollutant
   fees assessed, SO2 and NOx emissions are lower than the business as
   usual case (by 52\% and 10\%, respectively), with larger differences in
   the western U.S. than in the eastern U.S. GHG emissions are not
   significantly impacted by midrange criteria pollutant fees alone;
   conversely, with only GHG fees, NOx emissions are reduced by up to 11\%,
   yet SO2 emissions are slightly higher than in the business as usual
   case. Therefore, fees on both GHG and criteria pollutants may be needed
   to achieve significant reductions in both sets of pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic enrichment of reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition is an
   ecological concern. We use the adjoint of a global 3-D chemical
   transport model (GEOS-Chem) to identify the sources and processes that
   control Nr deposition to an ensemble of biodiversity hotspots worldwide
   and two U.S. national parks (Cuyahoga and Rocky Mountain). We find that
   anthropogenic sources dominate deposition at all continental sites and
   are mainly regional (less than 1000 km) in origin. In Hawaii, Nr supply
   is controlled by oceanic emissions of ammonia (50\%) and anthropogenic
   sources (50\%), with important contributions from Asia and North
   America. Nr deposition is also sensitive in complicated ways to
   emissions of SO2, which affect Nr gas-aerosol partitioning, and of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which affect oxidant concentrations
   and produce organic nitrate reservoirs. For example, VOC emissions
   generally inhibit deposition of locally emitted NOx but significantly
   increase Nr deposition downwind. However, in polluted boreal regions,
   anthropogenic VOC emissions can promote Nr deposition in winter.
   Uncertainties in chemical rate constants for OH + NO2 and NO2 hydrolysis
   also complicate the determination of source-receptor relationships for
   polluted sites in winter. Application of our adjoint sensitivities to
   the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios for 2010-2050
   indicates that future decreases in Nr deposition due to NOx emission
   controls will be offset by concurrent increases in ammonia emissions
   from agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Aptamer-ligand binding events, involving small molecule targets, at a
   surfactant-laden aqueous/liquid crystal (LC) interface were found to
   trigger a LC reorientation that can be observed in real-time using
   polarized light. The response was both sensitive and selective:
   reorientation was observed at target concentrations on the order of the
   aptamer dissociation constant, but no response was observed in control
   experiments with target analogues. Circular dichroism and resonance
   energy transfer experiments suggested that the LC reorientation was due
   to a conformational change of the aptamer upon target binding.
   Specifically, under conditions where aptamer-ligand binding induced a
   conformational change from a relaxed random coil to more intricate
   secondary structures (e.g., double helix, G-quadruplex), a transition
   from planar to homeotropic LC orientation was observed. These
   observations suggest the potential for a label-free LC-based detection
   system that can simultaneously respond to the presence of both small
   molecules and nucleic acids.}},

   for a high-density, semi-quantitative approach to seismic sensing. To
   fill this void, the UC Berkeley iShake project designed a mobile
   client-backend server architecture that uses sensor-equipped mobile
   devices to measure earthquake ground shaking. iShake provides the
   general public with a service to more easily contribute more
   quantitatively significant data to earthquake research by automating the
   data collection and reporting mechanisms via the iShake mobile
   application. The devices act as distributed sensors that enable
   measurements to be taken and transmitted with a cellular network
   connection. Shaking table testing was used to assess the quality of the
   measurements obtained from the iPhones and iPods on a benchmark of 150
   ground motions. Once triggered by a shaking event, the devices transmit
   sensor data to a backend server for further processing. After a seismic
   event is verified by high-fidelity stations, filtering algorithms are
   used to detect falling phones, as well as device-specific responses to
   the event. A method was developed to determine the absolute orientation
   of a device to estimate the direction of first motion of a seismic
   event. A ``virtual earthquake{''} pilot test was conducted on the UC
   Berkeley campus to verify the operation of the iShake system. By
   designing and fully implementing a system architecture, developing
   signal processing techniques unique to mobile sensing, and conducting
   shaking table tests to confirm the validity of the sensing platform, the
   iShake project serves as foundational work for further studies in
   seismic sensing on mobile devices.
   Note to Practitioners-To try and recover ground motion measurements from
   the on-accelerometer in a smartphone, one should take into account the
   additional variables in the environment in which the measurement was
   taken. Such variables include that the device may be moved by the user
   rather than the ground, that the accelerometer may record internal phone
   vibrations rather than external effects, and that the absolute
   orientation of the device cannot be determined from the accelerometer
   readings alone. This report gives practical procedures and algorithms to
   address these newly introduced issues. We provide a three-step-loop
   procedure to only actively sense for significant ground motion when it
   is reasonably certain the phone is not in active use. We also give a
   number of filtering techniques to apply to the raw accelerometer signal,
   such as isolating frequencies relative to seismic ground motions,
   removing potential internal resonance of the device in the output
   signal, and detecting whether a device has undergone significant
   disruption from forces not pertaining to ground motion. Since the
   cardinal direction (north-south-east-west) and coordinate location are
   needed to determine fault movement properties, we give a procedure to
   recover absolute position and absolute orientation from a combination of
   accelerometer, compass, and GPS information. By comparing the
   performance of the devices' accelerometer readings against high-fidelity
   accelerometers on shaking tables, we demonstrate that the resolution of
   the devices' measurements show potential for ground motion estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used in the biological sciences.
   Despite 25 years of technical developments, two popular modes of bioAFM,
   imaging and single molecule force spectroscopy, remain hindered by
   relatively poor force precision and stability. Recently, we achieved
   both sub-pN force precision and stability under biologically useful
   conditions (in liquid at room temperature). Importantly, this sub-pN
   level of performance is routinely accessible using a commercial
   cantilever on a commercial instrument. The two critical results are that
   (i) force precision and stability were limited by the gold coating on
   the cantilevers, and (ii) smaller yet stiffer cantilevers did not lead
   to better force precision on time scales longer than 25 ms. These new
   findings complement our previous work that addressed tip-sample
   stability. In this review, we detail the methods needed to achieve this
   sub-pN force stability and demonstrate improvements in force
   spectroscopy and imaging when using uncoated cantilevers. With this
   improved cantilever performance, the widespread use of nonspecific
   biomolecular attachments becomes a limiting factor in high-precision
   studies. Thus, we conclude by briefly reviewing site-specific
   covalent-immobilization protocols for linking a biomolecule to the
   substrate and to the AFM tip. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We describe how GPS measurements of horizontal crustal motion can be
   used to augment vertical crustal motion measurements, to improve and
   extend GPS studies of surface loading. We show that the ratio of the
   vertical displacement to the horizontal displacement, combined with the
   direction of the horizontal motion, can help determine whether nearby
   loading is concentrated in a small region (for example, in a single lake
   or glacier), and where that region is. We illustrate this method by
   applying it to two specific cases: an analysis of GPS data from northern
   California to monitor the level of Lake Shasta, and the analysis of data
   from a single GPS site in southeast Greenland to determine mass
   variability of two large, nearby outlet glaciers: Helheim Glacier and
   Midgaard Glacier. The California example serves largely as a
   proof-of-concept, where the results can be assessed by comparing with
   independent observations (Lake Shasta tide gauge data, in this case).
   Our Greenland results show that both Helheim and Midgaard have
   experienced notable interannual variations in mass loss rate over the
   last decade. Helheim's mass loss accelerated rapidly in mid-2003,
   decelerated in late 2005, and increased again in 2008-2009 before
   returning to about its pre-2003 rate in late 2010. Midgaard's mass loss
   accelerated in mid-2004, and remained more-or-less constant before
   returning to its pre-2003 rate in late 2008.}},

Abstract = {{Renewed interest in lunar tidal influences on the
   ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system has emerged in connection with
   recent studies of possible connections between stratospheric warmings
   and enhanced lunar tidal perturbations of the equatorial ionosphere. By
   virtue of its gravitational force, the Moon produces perturbations in
   the temperature, density, pressure, and winds throughout Earth's
   atmosphere. Lunar tidal winds in the dynamo region (similar to
   100-150km) can furthermore generate electric fields that map into the
   F-region and redistribute ionospheric plasma. Direct penetration
   (propagation) of lunar tides to F-region heights can also transport
   ionospheric plasma. Decades-long satellite data sets now exist that can
   provide a global perspective on lunar tidal oscillations, but this
   resource has not yet been exploited for this purpose. In this paper, we
   examine the global structure of the main M2 (period=12.42h) lunar tide
   through examination of temperatures measured by the Thermosphere
   Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics SABER instrument at 110km
   and densities at 360 and 480km inferred from accelerometers on the CHAMP
   and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites, respectively.
   Ten year mean SABER M2 temperature amplitudes are of order 5-10K while
   the corresponding density perturbations during the 2007-2010 solar
   minimum period approach amplitudes of order 5\% at 360km and 10\% at
   480km. The observed amplitudes are large enough to impose non-negligible
   day-to-day variability on the IT system. Global-Scale Wave Model
   simulations provide a theoretical and modeling context for interpreting
   these data, and moreover enable estimates of E- and F-region winds.}},

Abstract = {{This article answers calls from scholars to attend to a research gap
   concerning the visual representation of climate change. We present
   results from three Q-methodology workshops held in Melbourne
   (Australia), Norwich (UK) and Boulder (USA) investigating engagement
   with climate change imagery drawn from mass media sources. Participants
   were provided with a concourse of climate change images drawn from a
   newspaper content analysis carried out across all three countries, and
   asked to carry out two Q-sorts: first, for salience ('this image makes
   me feel climate change is important') and second, for efficacy ('this
   image makes me feel I can do something about climate change'). We found
   results remarkably consistent both across and within country cohorts.
   This may indicate the presence of a dominant, mainstream discourse
   around climate imagery. We found that imagery of climate impacts
   promotes feelings of salience, but undermines self-efficacy; that
   imagery of energy futures imagery promotes self-efficacy; and that
   images of politicians and celebrities strongly undermine saliency, and
   undermine self-efficacy for the Australian cohort. These results, if
   widely replicable, have implications for climate change communication
   and engagement. Our results suggest that imagery plays a role in either
   increasing the sense of importance of the issue of climate change
   (saliency), or in promoting feelings of being able to do something about
   climate change (efficacy) - but few, if any, images seem to do both.
   Communications strategies should assess the purpose of their messages,
   considering these findings regarding salience and efficacy in this
   study, and choose to employ images accordingly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   paper focuses on achieving this goal using the field of game theory. In
   particular, we derive a systematic methodology for designing local agent
   objective functions that guarantees (i) an equivalence between the
   resulting Nash equilibria and the optimizers of the system level
   objective and (ii) that the resulting game possesses an inherent
   structure that can be exploited in distributed learning, e. g.,
   potential games. The control design can then be completed utilizing any
   distributed learning algorithm which guarantees convergence to a Nash
   equilibrium for the attained game structure. Furthermore, in many
   settings the resulting controllers will be inherently robust to a host
   of uncertainties including asynchronous clock rates, delays in
   information, and component failures.}},

Abstract = {{Viscoelastic models are generally considered a good option for modeling
   biological tissue due to tissue time-dependency. However, although
   various forms of viscoelastic models have been developed, only a few
   have shown a good balance between model mathematical simplicity and
   experimental fit accuracy. Starting from a basic Standard Linear Solid
   (SLS) model, a systematic modification of the viscoelastic model leading
   to a more accurate tissue model is presented. A five-element model
   family, with a Double Maxwell-arm Wiechert (DMW) representative model,
   is selected for its mathematical simplicity and mathematical loading
   accuracy. This DMW model is then used to fit experimental data collected
   from stress relaxation indentation tests performed on fresh porcine
   liver and spleen. The results show that this DMW model provides a closer
   fit with the experimental liver (SLS R-2=0.731, DMW R-2=0.991) and
   spleen (SLS R-2=0.720, DMW R-2=0.981) data, compared to an SLS model,
   while maintaining appreciable mathematical simplicity by using only five
   model elements, compared to seven-element models. Thus, any model from
   this five-element model family can be used as a base compressive model
   for complex soft tissue with an approximate 35\% improved model fit over
   SLS. Finally, model element parameters for in vitro fresh porcine liver
   and spleen are determined from the associated indentation tests. (C)

Title = {{Diffusion transport coefficients for granular binary mixtures at low
   density: Thermal diffusion segregation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The mass flux of a low-density granular binary mixture obtained
   previously by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the
   Chapman-Enskog method is considered further. As in the elastic case, the
   associated transport coefficients D, D-p, and D' are given in terms of
   the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are
   approximately solved by considering the first and second Sonine
   approximations. The diffusion coefficients are explicitly obtained as
   functions of the coefficients of restitution and the parameters of the
   mixture (masses, diameters, and concentration) and their expressions
   hold for an arbitrary number of dimensions. In order to check the
   accuracy of the second Sonine correction for highly inelastic
   collisions, the Boltzmann equation is also numerically solved by means
   of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to determine the
   mutual diffusion coefficient D in some special situations
   (self-diffusion problem and tracer limit). The comparison with DSMC
   results reveals that the second Sonine approximation to D improves the
   predictions made from the first Sonine approximation. We also study the
   granular segregation driven by a uni-directional thermal gradient. The
   segregation criterion is obtained from the so-called thermal diffusion
   factor Lambda, which measures the amount of segregation parallel to the
   temperature gradient. The factor Lambda is determined here by
   considering the second-order Sonine forms of the diffusion coefficients
   and its dependence on the coefficients of restitution is widely analyzed
   across the parameter space of the system. The results obtained in this
   paper extend previous works carried out in the tracer limit (vanishing
   mole fraction of one of the species) by some of the authors of the
   present paper. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Aeroelastic instability problems have become an increasingly important
   issue due to the increased use of larger horizontal axis wind turbines.
   To maintain these large structures in a stable manner, the blade design
   process should include studies on the dynamic stability of the wind
   turbine blade. Therefore, fluid-structure interaction analyses of the
   large-scaled wind turbine blade were performed with a focus on dynamic
   stability in this study. A finite element method based on the large
   deflection beam theory is used for structural analysis considering the
   geometric nonlinearities. For the stability analysis, a proposed
   aerodynamic approach based on Greenberg's extension of Theodorsen's
   strip theory and blade element momentum method were employed in
   conjunction with a structural model. The present methods proved to be
   valid for estimations of the aerodynamic responses and blade behavior
   compared with numerical results obtained in the previous studies.
   Additionally, torsional stiffness effects on the dynamic stability of
   the wind turbine blade were investigated. It is demonstrated that the
   damping is considerably influenced by variations of the torsional
   stiffness. Also, in normal operating conditions, the destabilizing
   phenomena were observed to occur with low torsional stiffness.}},

   nanoscale grains of hafnia in a necklace-like formation. The oxidation

Abstract = {{The implementation of bio-orthogonal click chemistries is a topic of
   growing importance in the field of biomaterials, as it is enabling the
   development of increasingly A complex hydrogel materials capable of
   providing dynamic, cell-instructive microenvironments. Here, we
   introduce the tetrazine norbornene inverse electron demand Diels-Alder
   reaction as a new cross-linking chemistry for the formation of cell
   laden hydrogels. The fast reaction rate and irreversible nature of this
   click reaction allowed for hydrogel formation within minutes when a
   multifunctional PEG-tetrazine macromer was reacted with a dinorbomene
   peptide. In addition, the cytocompatibility of the polymerization led to
   high postencapsulation viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, and
   the specificity of the tetrazine norbornene reaction was exploited for
   sequential modification of the network via thiol-ene photochemistry.
   These advantages, combined with the synthetic accessibility of the

Abstract = {{There has recently been an increased focus within the earth science
   community on integration of data and modeling resources. Two examples of
   projects in this area are the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System
   (CSDMS) and the Hydrologic Information System (HIS) project of the
   Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science,
   Inc. (CUAHSI). The primary focus of CSDMS is on modeling, specifically
   on approaches and tools that allow scientists to construct a simulation
   model as a configuration of linked, interchangeable model components.
   The primary focus of the HIS is on data, specifically on approaches and
   tools that allow scientists to easily access and integrate data from
   different data providers. The synergies between these two projects are
   obvious as both data and models are needed to support scientific
   analysis and natural resource management. For this reason, we have
   explored a means for providing interoperability between the CSDMS and
   the HIS. In the approach presented here, the HIS web services are used
   within the CSDMS modeling framework to search and download hydrologic
   data that can then be easily fed into CSDMS model components. The result
   of the work is a CSDMS component able to query, download, and provide
   plug-and-play access to HIS data directly within the CSDMS modeling
   framework. This approach therefore provides a means for leveraging large
   sets of scientific data within a sophisticated modeling framework. (C)

Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{374-388}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We derive exact dispersion relations for axial and flexural elastic wave
   motion in a rod and a beam under finite deformation. For axial motion we
   consider a simple rod model, and for flexural motion we employ the
   Euler-Bernoulli kinematic hypothesis and consider both a conventional
   transverse motion model and an inextensional planar motion model. The
   underlying formulation uses the Cauchy stress and the Green-Lagrange
   strain without omission of higher order terms. For all models, we
   consider linear constitutive relations in order to isolate the effect of
   finite motion. The proposed theory, however, is applicable to problems
   that also exhibit material nonlinearity. For the rod model, we obtain
   the exact analytical explicit solution of the derived finite-deformation
   dispersion relation, and compare it with data obtained via numerical
   simulation of nonlinear wave motion in a finite rod. For the beam model,
   we obtain an approximate solution by standard root finding. The results
   allow us to quantify the deviation in the dispersion curves when exact
   large deformation is considered compared to following the assumption of
   infinitesimal deformation. We show that incorporation of finite
   deformation following the chosen definitions of stress and strain raises
   the frequency branches for both axial and flexural waves and
   consequently also raises the phase and group velocities above the
   nominal values associated with linear motion. For the beam problem, only
   the inextensional planar motion model provides an accurate description
   of the finite-deformation response for both static deflection and wave
   dispersion; the conventional transverse motion model fails to do so. Our
   findings, which represent the first derivation of finite-strain,
   amplitude-dependent dispersion relations for any type of elastic media,
   draw attention to (1) the tangible effect of finite deformation on wave
   dispersion and consequently on the speed of sound in an elastic medium
   and (2) the importance of incorporating longitudinal-transverse motion
   coupling in both static and dynamic analysis of thin structures
   subjected to large nonlinear deformation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The ephemeral stream habitats of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica
   support desiccation and freeze-tolerant microbial mats that are hot
   spots of primary productivity in an otherwise inhospitable environment.
   The ecological processes that structure bacterial communities in this
   harsh environment are not known; however, insights from diatom community
   ecology may prove to be informative. We examined the relationships
   between diatoms and bacteria at the community and taxon levels. The
   diversity and community structure of stream microbial mats were
   characterized using high-throughput pyrosequencing for bacteria and
   morphological identification for diatoms. We found significant
   relationships between diatom communities and the communities of
   cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria, and co-occurrence analysis
   identified numerous correlations between the relative abundances of
   individual diatom and bacterial taxa, which may result from species
   interactions. Additionally, the strength of correlations between
   heterotrophic bacteria and diatoms varied along a hydrologic gradient,
   indicating that flow regime may influence the overall community
   structure. Phylogenetic consistency in the co-occurrence patterns
   suggests that the associations are ecologically relevant. Despite these
   community- and taxon-level relationships, diatom and bacterial alpha
   diversity were inversely correlated, which may highlight a fundamental
   difference between the processes that influence bacterial and diatom
   community assembly in these streams. Our results therefore demonstrate
   that the relationships between diatoms and bacteria are complex and may
   result from species interactions as well as niche-specific processes.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and character from eight
   locations, including rivers and managed-flow sites, within two northern
   Colorado Rocky Mountain watersheds were examined using fluorescence and
   absorbance spectroscopy to characterize changes in DOM quantity and

   higher concentrations of more aromatic DOM during spring runoff.
   Reservoir-influenced, managed sites had year-round stability and had
   less aromatic DOM compared with the river sites. Total trihalomethane
   formation potential (TTHMFP) was used as a measure of DOM chlorine
   reactivity. Fluorescence compositional metrics (fluorescence index
   {[}FI] and organic matter fluorescence characterization {[}Peak
   C]/ultraviolet absorbance at 340 nm ratios) correlated with TTHMFP
   yields. River sites showed increased TTHMFP concentrations during runoff
   but little change in TTHMFP yield. Managed sites showed little seasonal
   variation in both TTHMFP and TTHMFP yield. The results show that

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{62-72}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The reduction factors used to account for the impact of installation
   damage on the tensile strength of geogrids employed in mechanically
   stabilised earth (MSE) walls and reinforced embankments are usually
   obtained from field tests that simulate actual construction conditions.
   Although costly and time-consuming, site-specific field tests
   incorporate the damage mechanisms that may occur in geogrid
   reinforcements during installation. Several studies have developed
   empirical relationships for these reduction factors for use in design
   calculations, typically considering the effects of construction methods
   and the backfill soil gradation on the damage of geogrids having a given
   polymer type, manufacturing method, and weight per unit area. One of the
   issues with these relationships is how to quantify the backfill soil
   gradation in the empirical relationships. In this study, a series of
   field test sections were constructed using geogrids with two polymer
   types and a range of different weights per unit area to identify
   quantitative relationships that can be used to better estimate the
   impact of backfill gradation on the reduction factors for installation
   damage of geogrids. The results from the field test sections indicate
   that the reduction in tensile strength of geogrids after installation is
   non-linearly related to the maximum particle size in the backfill soil.
   Recommended upper-bound relationships for the reduction in tensile
   strength for different geogrid polymers are presented based on an
   evaluation of data sets, with a greater reduction factor observed for
   polyvinyl-chloride-coated woven polyethylene geogrids than for
   high-density uniaxially-drawn polyethylene geogrids.}},

   Neurophysiol 109: 1866-1875, 2013. First published January 16, 2013;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00826.2012.-An intriguing finding in motor control
   studies is the marked effect of risk on movement decision making.
   However, there are inconsistent reports of risk-sensitivity across
   different movements and tasks, with both risk-seeking and risk-averse
   behavior observed. This raises the question of whether risk-sensitivity
   in movement decision making is context dependent and specific to the
   movement or task being performed. We investigated whether
   risk-sensitivity transfers between dissimilar movements within a single
   task. Healthy young adults made arm-reaching movements or whole-body
   leaning movements to move a cursor as close to the edge of a virtual
   cliff as possible without moving beyond the edge. They received points
   on the basis of the cursor's final proximity to the cliff edge. Risk was
   manipulated by increasing the point penalty associated with the cliff
   region and/or adding Gaussian noise to the cursor. We compared subjects'
   movement endpoints with endpoints predicted by a subject-specific,
   risk-neutral model of movement planning. Subjects demonstrated
   risk-seeking behavior in both movements that was consistent across risk
   environments, moving closer to the cliff than the model predicted.
   However, subjects were significantly more risk-seeking in whole-body
   movements. Our results present the first evidence of risk-sensitivity in
   whole-body movements. They also demonstrate that the direction of
   risk-sensitivity (i.e., risk-seeking or risk-averse) is similar between
   arm-reaching and whole-body movements, although degree of
   risk-sensitivity did not transfer from one movement to another. This
   finding has important implications for the ability of quantitative
   descriptions of decision making to generalize across movements and,
   ultimately, decision-making contexts.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional, steady state computational model coupling radiative
   transfer with fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer, and chemical
   reaction kinetics is utilized to investigate the sensitivity of the
   solar-to-chemical efficiency of a multiple-tube solar receiver with
   either a cooled reflective or insulated absorbing cavity wall to various
   design parameters including both operating conditions and geometric tube
   configurations. Geometric parameters are defined relative to a base
   design in which all tubes are arranged in a semicircle around the back
   cavity wall and allow for variations in cavity size as well as number,
   radius, and arrangement of tubes. For reflective cavity designs,
   calculations indicate that maximizing the net absorption efficiency and
   minimizing emission losses are not an effective means of improving
   receiver performance; rather, maximizing utilization of absorbed energy
   via minimization of tube conduction losses is essential. For the
   parameter ranges examined in this study, the best reflective cavity
   designs contain three moderately sized tubes placed near the back cavity
   wall while absorbing cavity designs contain three to five large tubes
   arranged in a semicircle near the back cavity wall, though all
   calculations are more sensitive to selection of operating conditions
   than to geometric parameters. Calculations for the application of steam
   gasification of acetylene black identified reflective and absorbing
   cavity receiver designs theoretically capable of achieving,
   respectively, 8\% and 23\% solar-to-chemical efficiency when scaled to
   accept 8 kW of solar power. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed design analysis of an ambient-pressure, membrane-based heat
   pump serves as a basis for examining the applicability of a variety of
   correlations used in coupled heat and mass transfer devices that include

   studied using scaling analysis and finite-volume numerical methods.
   Commonly accepted mass and heat transfer correlations for developing
   flow were found to be adequate for the liquid streams in these designs
   without requiring additional transport phenomena. We found that an air
   gap-separating a temperature gradient up to 20 degrees C-may be as large
   as 3 mm (vertical orientation) and 5 mm (horizontal orientation) before
   natural convection becomes important. But air gaps this wide are
   unlikely to be used in these membrane devices since radiation dominates
   the total energy transfer for air gaps larger than 2 mm. We also
   introduce a selectivity-productivity tradeoff based on the
   sustained-temperature-gradient per unit vapor pressure gradient
   (selectivity) and the overall heating capacity (productivity) of a

Abstract = {{The leaders of DOTs and other public agencies that build and operate
   capital facilities manage a multitude of human, technological,
   political, technical, and natural resources in an environment that is
   fraught with uncertainty. To ensure success, these agencies must be able
   to manage risks at multiple levels. Although there is a great deal of
   literature and research relating to project risk management for public
   projects, there has yet to be a study that evaluates enterprise risk
   management (ERM) for DOTs. The objectives of this study are to describe
   the state-of-practice with respect to risk management in state DOTs and
   to identify executive strategies that may be useful to DOT leadership
   for enterprise-wide risk management. This paper presents the results of
   a comprehensive survey with responses from 43 of the 52 United States
   DOTs that identify and describe the currently implemented ERM
   strategies. The findings from the literature and survey were validated
   through interviews with top DOT management from three DOTs that have
   advanced ERM programs. The results of the survey indicate that only 39\%
   of DOTs have a formal ERM program and that over 40\% of agencies felt
   that they seldom or never implement the correct risk management
   procedures. The results also indicate that (1) DOT executives play a
   critical role in an ERM program; (2) employees must be involved at all
   stages of ERM program development; (3) the initiation of an ERM program
   must receive adequate resources to be successful; and (4) developing a
   risk management culture requires broad participation, ERM performance
   evaluations, demonstrated commitment from all upper-level managers, and
   a long-term perspective. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000136. (C)

Abstract = {{Biofilms production is a central feature of nosocomial infection of
   catheters and other medical devices used in resuscitation and critical
   care. However, the very effective biofilm forming pathogen
   Staphylococcus epidermidis often produces a modest host inflammatory
   response and few of the signs and symptoms associated with more virulent
   pathogens. To examine the impact of bacterial biofilm formation on
   provocation of an innate immune response, we studied the elaboration of
   the major complement anaphylatoxin C5a by human serum upon contact with
   S. epidermidis biofilms. Wildtype S. epidermidis and mutants of sarA (a
   regulatory protein that promotes synthesis of the biofilm-forming
   polysaccharide intercellular adhesin {[}PIA]) and icaB (responsible for
   postexport processing of PIA) were studied. C5a release, as a function
   of exposed biofilm surface area, was on the order of 1 fmol.cm(-2).s(-1)
   and was dependent on the presence of PIA. Experimental results were used
   to inform a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of C5a release
   by an infected central venous catheter, one of S. epidermidis' primary
   means of causing human disease. These simulations revealed that the
   magnitude of C5a release on a superior vena cava catheter completely
   covered with S. epidermidis would be lower than necessary to alert
   circulating leukocytes. Combined, the experimental and computational
   results are highly consistent with clinical observations in which the
   clinical signs of central line-associated bloodstream infection are
   often muted in association with this important pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{Macroscopic properties of polymer nanocomposites depend on the
   microscopic composite morphology of the constituent nanoparticles and
   polymer matrix. One way to control the spatial arrangement of the
   nanoparticles in the polymer matrix is by grafting the nanoparticle
   surfaces with polymers that can tune the effective interparticle
   interactions in the polymer matrix. A fundamental understanding of how
   graft and matrix polymer chemistries and molecular weight, grafting
   density, and nanoparticle size, and chemistry affect interparticle
   interactions is needed to design the appropriate polymer ligands to
   achieve the target morphology. Theory and simulations have proven to be
   useful tools in this regard due to their ability to link molecular level
   interactions to the morphology. In this feature article, we present our
   recent theory and simulation studies of polymer grafted nanoparticles
   with chemical and physical heterogeneity in grafts to calculate the
   effective interactions and morphology as a function of chemistry,
   molecular weights, grafting densities, and so forth. (C) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{We report results of preliminary high-resolution in situ atmospheric
   measurements through the boundary layer and lower atmosphere over the
   southern coast of PerA(0). This region of the coast is of particular
   interest because it lies adjacent to the northern coastal edge of the
   sub-tropical south-eastern Pacific, a very large area of ocean having a
   persistent stratus deck located just below the marine boundary layer
   (MBL) inversion. Typically, the boundary layer in this region during
   winter is topped by a quasi-permanent, well-defined, and very large
   temperature gradient. The data presented herein examine fine-scale
   details of the coastal atmosphere at a point where the edge of this MBL
   extends over the coastline as a result of persistent onshore flow.
   Atmospheric data were gathered using a recently-developed in-house
   constructed, GPS-controlled, micro-autonomous-vehicle aircraft (the
   DataHawk). Measured quantities include high-resolution profiles of
   temperature, wind, and turbulence structure from the surface to 1,300 m.}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Stochastic coherent adaptive large-eddy simulation is a novel approach
   to the numerical simulation of turbulence, where the coherent energetic
   eddies are solved for, while modeling the influence of the less
   energetic coherent/incoherent background flow. The formal separation
   between resolved and unresolved field is obtained by wavelet threshold
   filtering that is inherent to the adaptive wavelet collocation numerical
   method. A new explicit wavelet filtering strategy is introduced and
   tested, by considering two different filtering levels: the physical
   level, which controls the turbulence model, and the numerical level that
   is responsible for the accuracy of numerical simulations. The
   theoretical basis for wavelet-based adaptive large-eddy simulation with
   explicit filtering and consistent dynamic modeling is given. Numerical
   experiments are presented for unsteady homogeneous turbulence,
   demonstrating the existence of grid-independent solutions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{DC bus-based systems are envisioned as an enabling technology to
   integrate renewable energy sources, energy storage devices, and a
   variety of loads in a number of power management and distribution
   scenarios. The system design and integration challenges include
   accommodating heterogeneous components, the wide variability of
   operating conditions, and system stability issues arising from dynamical
   interactions between the components. This paper proposes a flexible,
   smart dc power management architecture based on identical digitally
   controlled bidirectional dc-dc modules that can be software configured
   to enable simple system design, exceptional system flexibility, and
   optimization of the use of available resources. Design of the
   reconfigurable digital control infrastructure of such versatile dc power
   system is discussed in detail from its system-level description to the
   low-level design of the digital compensators. Stability analysis of the
   dc bus voltage is also discussed, proving the robustness of the power
   architecture from a theoretical standpoint. The proposed approach is
   then demonstrated on an experimental dc power management system
   consisting of several 500W, bidirectional dc-dc modules operating from a
   24-V dc bus.}},

Abstract = {{The PHENIX experiment has measured the production of pi(0)s in Au + Au
   collisions at root S-NN = 200 GeV. The new data offer a fourfold
   increase in recorded luminosity, providing higher precision and a larger
   reach in transverse momentum, p(T), to 20 GeV/c. The production ratio of
   eta/pi(0) is 0.46 +/- 0.01(stat) +/- 0.05(syst), constant with p(T) and
   collision centrality. The observed ratio is consistent with earlier
   measurements, as well as with the p + p and d + Au values. pi(0) are
   suppressed by a factor of 5, as in earlier findings. However, with the
   improved statistical precision a small but significant rise of the
   nuclear modification factor R-AA vs p(T), with a slope of 0.0106
   +/-(0.0034)(0.0029) (Gev/c)(-1), is discernible in central collisions. A
   phenomenological extraction of the average fractional parton energy loss
   shows a decrease with increasing p(T). To study the path-length
   dependence of suppression, the pi(0) yield is measured at different
   angles with respect to the event plane; a strong azimuthal dependence of
   the pi(0) R-AA is observed. The data are compared to theoretical models
   of parton energy loss as a function of the path length L in the medium.
   Models based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics are insufficient to
   describe the data, while a hybrid model utilizing pQCD for the hard
   interactions and anti-de-Sitter space/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT)
   for the soft interactions is consistent with the data. DOI:

Abstract = {{Buckling of nanowires on elastomeric substrates shows enhanced
   stretchability for these materials, and can foster stretchable form of
   nanoelectronics and nanosystems. Since surface effects can have strong
   influence on the mechanical behaviour of nanowires, a theoretical model
   is established to study the surface effects on in-plane buckling of
   nanowires on elastomeric substrates. The buckling wavelength, amplitude
   and critical buckling strain are obtained analytically in terms of
   surface elasticity, residual surface tension, bending and tension
   stiffness of the nanowire and the elastic modulus of the substrate. The
   results show that the buckling wavelength is only dependent on the
   surface elasticity, while both surface elasticity and residual surface
   tension can have significant effects on the buckling amplitude and
   critical buckling strain.}},

Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Regimes of chemical reaction wave propagating in reactive gaseous
   mixtures, whose chemistry is governed by chain-branching kinetics, are
   studied depending on the characteristics of a transient thermal energy
   deposition localized in a finite volume of reactive gas. Different
   regimes of the reaction wave propagation are initiated depending on the
   amount of deposited thermal energy, power of the source, and the size of
   the hot spot. The main parameters which define regimes of the combustion
   waves facilitated by the transient deposition of thermal energy are
   acoustic time scale, duration of the energy deposition, ignition time
   scale, and size of the hot spot. The interplay between these parameters
   specifies the role of gasdynamical processes, the formation and
   steepness of the temperature gradient, and speed of the spontaneous
   wave. The obtained results show how ignition of one or another
   combustion regime depends on the value of energy, rate of the energy
   deposition, and size of the hot spot, which is important for the
   practical use and for risk assessment. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.033015}},

Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{DNA hybridization in the vicinity of surfaces is a fundamental process
   for self-assembled nanoarrays, nanocrystal superlattices, and
   biosensors. It is widely recognized that solid surfaces alter molecular
   forces governing hybridization relative to a bulk solution, and these
   effects can either favor or disfavor the hybridized state depending on
   the specific sequence and surface. Results presented here provide new
   insights into the dynamics of DNA hairpin-coil conformational
   transitions in the vicinity of hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG)
   and hydrophobic trimethylsilane (TMS) surfaces. Single-molecule methods
   are used to observe the forward and reverse hybridization hairpin-coil
   transition of adsorbed species while simultaneously measuring molecular
   surface diffusion in order to gain insight into surface interactions
   with individual DNA bases. At least 35 000 individual molecular
   trajectories are observed on each type of surface. It is found that
   unfolding slows and the folding rate increases on TMS relative to OEG,
   despite stronger attractions between TMS and unpaired nucleobases. These
   rate differences lead to near-complete hairpin formation on hydrophobic
   TMS and significant unfolding on hydrophilic OEG, resulting in the
   surprising conclusion that hydrophobic surface coatings are preferable
   for nanotechnology applications that rely on DNA hybridization near
   surfaces.}},

   accumulation and removal for algae harvesting}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{79-85}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{A novel technique is described that achieves particle concentration
   using inclined sedimentation via sludge accumulation and removal
   (CISSAR(1)). In contrast to a continuous inclined sedimentation process,
   in which clarification via sedimentation and recovery via sediment or
   sludge flow occur simultaneously, the CISSAR process consists of a long,
   particle-deposition and fluid-clarification step, followed by a short,
   sludge-resuspension and sludge-recovery step. The separation of the
   clarification and sludge-recovery processes removes design limitations
   necessary for sludge flow, enabling optimization of the clarification
   process. While commercial settlers are typically operated at about 55
   from the horizontal to ensure sludge flow, the CISSAR process is
   operated at a shallow angle, resulting in 70\% faster clarification per
   plate area. Using a high-aspect-ratio inclined settler (L/b=500) with
   the CISSAR process, a similar to 0.7 g/L, unflocculated algal suspension
   was concentrated over 80-fold to 59 g/L at a bulk-average clarification
   velocity of nearly 500-fold greater than the algal terminal settling
   velocity. The extent of concentration (below a maximum value) was shown
   to be proportional to the settling rate and the duration of
   clarification, inversely proportional to the plate spacing, and
   independent of settling area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Observations suggest that the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol
   layer between 20 and 30km has increased 410\% per year since 2000, which
   is significant for Earth's climate. Contributions to this increase both
   from moderate volcanic eruptions and from enhanced coal burning in Asia
   have been suggested. Current observations are insufficient to attribute
   the contribution of the different sources. Here we use a global climate
   model coupled to an aerosol microphysical model to partition the
   contribution of each. We employ model runs that include the increases in
   anthropogenic sulfur dioxide (SO2) over Asia and the moderate volcanic
   explosive injections of SO2 observed from 2000 to 2010. Comparison of
   the model results to observations reveals that moderate volcanic
   eruptions, rather than anthropogenic influences, are the primary source
   of the observed increases in stratospheric aerosol.}},

Abstract = {{We use a chemical transport model and its adjoint to examine the
   sensitivity of secondary inorganic aerosol formation to emissions of
   precursor trace gases from Asia. Sensitivity simulations indicate that
   secondary inorganic aerosol mass concentrations are most sensitive to
   ammonia (NH3) emissions in winter and to sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions
   during the rest of the year. However, in the annual mean, the
   perturbations on Asian population-weighted ground-level secondary
   inorganic aerosol concentrations of 34\% due to changing nitrogen oxide
   (NOx) emissions are comparable to those from changing either SO2 (41\%)
   or NH3 (25\%) emissions. The persistent sensitivity to NOx arises from
   the regional abundance of NH3 over Asia that promotes ammonium nitrate
   formation. IASI satellite observations corroborate the NH3 abundance.
   Projected emissions for 2020 indicate continued sensitivity to NOx
   emissions. We encourage more attention to NOx controls in addition to
   SO2 and NH3 controls to reduce ground-level East Asian aerosol.

Abstract = {{A constitutive model for a fiber reinforced hyperelastic material was
   applied to understand arterial fiber remodeling in a sheep model of
   Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR is associated altered
   hemodynamics characterized by increased resistance to blood flow in the
   placenta and elevated fetal arterial pressure and pulsatility. The
   constitutive model describes the collagen contribution to the mechanics
   within the arterial wall in both control and IUGR carotid artery through
   defining the material modulus and the orientation of the microstructure.
   A sheep model of placental insufficiency induced IUGR (PI-IUGR) was
   created by exposure of the pregnant ewe to elevated ambient
   temperatures. Experimental data was collected using pressure-diameter
   measurements to measure passive compliance in control and PI-IUGR
   carotid arteries. The constitutive model was optimized to fit the
   experimental data predicting the material parameters. Specifically, the
   collagen fiber predicted angle (gamma) in the control artery was 49.9
   degrees from the circumferential axis while the PI-IUGR was 16.6 degrees
   with a 23.5\% increase in fiber orientation (kappa). Quantitative
   assessment of collagen fiber orientation in secondary harmonic
   generation images confirmed the shift in orientation between the two
   groups. Together these suggest vascular remodeling of the ECM fiber
   orientation plays a major role in arterial stiffening in the PI-IUGR
   near-term fetal sheep. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations for the thermal conductivity
   of Si/Ge nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Various methods have been used to study the thermal conductivity of
   nanocomposites which are playing increasing roles in energy conversion
   and thermal management. However, when the size of particle inclusions is
   on the order of several nanometers, the existing macro-and meso-scale
   analytical methods cannot be used to predict the thermal conductivity of
   nanocomposites due to the existence of both phonon wave interference and
   particle scattering effects. In this study, equilibrium molecular
   dynamics (EMD) is explored to study the thermal conductivity of Si/Ge
   nanocomposites. We found that EMD can be used to study the thermal
   conductivity of nanocomposites when multiple nanoparticles are included
   to avoid the artificial effect of simulation domain sizes. We then
   calculated the thermal conductivity of Si/Ge nanocomposites with
   different volumetric ratio and particle size at 300 K. The result shows
   that the thermal conductivity of Si/Ge nanocomposites first decreases
   and then increases with decreasing particle size at fixed volumetric
   ratio. The decreasing thermal conductivity is due to the increased
   phonon scattering at high surface to volumetric ratio. When the particle
   size is further reduced, the thermal conductivity recovers due to the
   phonon wave interference effect. The effect of particle shape on the
   thermal conductivity of Si/Ge nanocomposites is also studied. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present measured J/psi production rates in d + Au collisions at root
   s(NN) = 200 GeV over broad ranges of transverse momentum (p(T) = 0-14
   GeV/c) and rapidity (-2.2 < y < 2.2). We construct the
   nuclear-modification factor R-dAu for these kinematics and as a function
   of collision centrality (related to impact parameter for the d + Au
   collision). We find that the modification is largest for collisions with
   small impact parameters and observe a suppression (R-dAu < 1) for p(T) <
   4 GeV/c at positive rapidities. At negative rapidity we observe a
   suppression for p(T) < 2 GeV/c then an enhancement (R-dAu > 1) for p(T)
   > 2 GeV/c. The observed enhancement at negative rapidity has
   implications for the interpretation of the observed modification in
   heavy-ion collisions at high p(T). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevC.87.034904}},

Title = {{Formation of Core-Shell Particles by Interfacial Radical Polymerization
   Initiated by a Glucose Oxidase-Mediated Redox System}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{761-767}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{A unique design paradigm to form core-shell particles based on
   interfacial radical polymerization is described. The interfacial
   initiation system is comprised of an enzymatic reaction between glucose
   and glucose oxidase (GOx) to generate hydrogen peroxide, which, in the
   presence of iron (Fe2+), generates hydroxyl radicals that initiate
   polymerization. Shell formation on prefabricated polymeric cores is
   achieved by localizing the initiation reaction to the interface of the
   core and a surrounding aqueous monomer formulation into which it is
   immersed. The interfacially confined initiation reaction is accomplished
   by incorporating one or more of the initiating species in the particle
   core and the remainder of the complementary initiating components in the
   surrounding media such that interactions and the resulting initiation
   reaction occur at the interface. This work is focused on engineering the
   reaction behavior and mass transport processes to promote interfacially
   confined polymerization, controlling the rate of shell formation, and
   manipulating the structure of the core-shell particle. Specifically,
   incorporating GOx in the precursor solution used to fabricate cores
   ranging from 100 to 200 mu m, and the remainder of the complementary
   initiating components and monomer in the bulk solution prior to
   interfacial polymerization yielded shells whose average thickness was 20
   mu m after 4 min of immersion and at a bulk iron concentration of 12.5
   mM. When the locations of glucose and GOx are interchanged, the average
   thickness of the shell was 15 or 100 mu m for bulk iron concentrations
   of 45 and 12.5 mM, respectively. The initial locations of glucose and
   GOx also determine the degree of interpenetration of the core and the
   shell. Specifically, for a bulk iron concentration of 45 mM, the
   thickness of the interpenetrating layer averaged 12 mu m when GOx was
   initially within the core, whereas no interpenetrating layer was
   observed when glucose was incorporated in the core. The polymeric shell
   formed by this technique is also demonstrated to be self-supporting
   following core degradation. This behavior is accomplished by fabricating
   the particle core hydrogel from monomers possessing degradable groups
   that can be irreversibly cleaved by light exposure following shell
   formation. When the coated particle was exposed to light, the shell
   remained intact while the core degraded as evidenced by a dramatic
   change in diffusion coefficient of fluorescent beads immobilized within
   the core.}},

Title = {{Optical generation, templating, and polymerization of three-dimensional
   arrays of liquid-crystal defects decorated by plasmonic nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{Defects in liquid crystals are used to model topological entities
   ranging from Skyrmions in high-energy physics to early-universe cosmic
   strings, as well as find practical applications in self-assembly of
   diffraction gratings and in scaffolding of plasmonic nanoparticles, but
   they are hard to control and organize into three-dimensional lattices.
   We laterally scan focused laser beams to produce periodic arrays of
   twist-stabilized defects forming either linear (fingers) or axially
   symmetric (torons) configurations in partially polymerizable liquid
   crystal films. Polymerization allows for stabilization of these
   structures and the formation of three-dimensional arrays of defects by
   stacking of the thin cholesteric films on top of each other. In the
   process of fabrication of such arrays, we polymerize the liquid crystal
   film with an array of torons or fingers and then sequentially produce
   and photopolymerize new liquid crystal layers on top of it, thus
   obtaining a three-dimensional structure of twist-stabilized defects in a
   layer-by-layer fashion. Templating by the polymerized layer
   spontaneously yields ordered organization of fingers and torons in the
   new cholesteric layer, thus enabling a three-dimensional ordered
   structure of defects. Nondestructive three-dimensional imaging of
   director fields by use of three-photon excitation fluorescence
   polarizing microscopy reveals the nature of topological singularities
   and physical underpinnings behind the observed templating effect.
   Three-dimensional patterning of defects templates the self-assembly of
   plasmonic nanoparticles into individual singularities and their arrays,
   laying the groundwork for potential applications in nanophotonics,
   plasmonics, metamaterial fabrication, and nanoscale energy conversion.

   measuring the 10 second-order moments of the power density distribution
   for the twisted beam produced by passage through multimode optical
   fiber. Our method measures the same M-2 values as the traditional
   variable-distance method for a wide range of laser beam sources,
   including nearly TEM00 (M-2 approximate to 1) and general astigmatic
   multimode beams (M-2 approximate to 8). The method is simple and
   compact, with no moving parts or complex apparatus and measurement
   precision comparable to the standard variable-distance method. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI) method is
   recognized as an effective domain decomposition tool to achieve
   scalability in the solution of partitioned second-order elasticity
   problems. In the boundary element tearing and interconnecting (BETI)
   method, a direct extension of the FETI algorithm to the BEM, the
   symmetric Galerkin BEM formulation, is used to obtain symmetric system
   matrices, making possible to apply the same FETI conjugate gradient
   solver. In this work, we propose a new BETI variant labeled nsBETI that
   allows to couple substructures modeled with the FEM and/or
   non-symmetrical BEM formulations. The method connects non-matching BEM
   and FEM subdomains using localized Lagrange multipliers and solves the
   associated non-symmetrical flexibility equations with a Bi-CGstab
   iterative algorithm. Scalability issues of nsBETI in BEMBEM and combined
   BEMFEM coupled problems are also investigated. Copyright (c) 2012 John

   nucleated, out-of-phase, or without clear phase correlation depending on
   the geometry and viscosity ratio between the two polymers. In stark

   in-phase breakup of confined polymer stripes was always observed when
   the alternating PS/PMMA stripes were formed, that is, without residual
   layer, regardless of the specific geometry.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We study the short time transient stress and pore pressure fields near
   the tip of a stationary crack when a sudden load is applied to a
   poroelastic solid. These fields are determined using a small scale
   ``yielding{''} (SSY) analysis where the stress relaxation due to fluid
   flow is confined to a small region near the crack tip. They are found to
   exhibit the usual inverse square root singularity characteristic of
   cracks in linear elastic solids. Analysis shows that these fields are
   self-similar; the region of stress relaxation that propagates outward
   from the crack tip is proportional to root D(c)t, where D-c is the
   cooperative diffusion coefficient and t is time. The pore pressure at
   the crack tip vanishes immediately after loading. The stress intensity
   factor at the crack tip is found to be reduced by a factor of 1/{[}2(1 -
   v)], where v is the Poisson's ratio of the drained solid. Closed form
   approximations are found for the pore pressure and the trace of the
   effective stress. These approximate analytical solutions compare well
   with finite element results.}},

   three-dimensional index structuring with large throughput}},
Journal = {{LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Photonic devices increasingly require three-dimensional control of
   refractive index, but existing fabrication methods such as femtosecond
   micromachining, multilayer lithography and bulk diffusion can only
   address a select scale range, are often limited in complexity or
   thickness and have low throughput. We introduce a new fabrication method
   and polymeric material that can efficiently create mm(3) optical devices
   with programmable, gradient index of refraction with arbitrary feature
   size. Index contrast of 0.1 is demonstrated, which is 100 times larger
   than femtosecond micromachining, and 20 times larger than commercial
   holographic photopolymers. This is achieved by repetitive microfluidic
   layering of a self-developing photopolymer structured by projection
   lithography. The process has the unusual property that total fabrication
   time for a fixed thickness decreases with the number of layers, enabling
   fabrication 10(5) faster than femtosecond micromachining. We demonstrate
   the process by sequentially writing 100 layers to fabricate a mm thick
   waveguide array.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal simulation of minimum and maximum temperature is a
   fundamental requirement for climate impact studies and hydrological or
   agricultural models. Particularly over regions with variable orography,
   these simulations are difficult to produce due to terrain driven
   nonstationarity. We develop a bivariate stochastic model for the
   spatiotemporal field of minimum and maximum temperature. The proposed
   framework splits the bivariate field into two components of ``local
   climate{''} and ``weather.{''} The local climate component is a linear
   model with spatially varying process coefficients capturing the annual
   cycle and yielding local climate estimates at all locations, not only
   those within the observation network. The weather component spatially
   correlates the bivariate simulations, whose matrix-valued covariance
   function we estimate using a nonparametric kernel smoother that retains
   nonnegative definiteness and allows for substantial nonstationarity
   across the simulation domain. The statistical model is augmented with a
   spatially varying nugget effect to allow for locally varying small scale
   variability. Our model is applied to a daily temperature data set
   covering the complex terrain of Colorado, USA, and successfully
   accommodates substantial temporally varying nonstationarity in both the
   direct-covariance and cross-covariance functions.}},

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{A parallel fully coupled implicit fluid solver based on a
   NewtonKrylovSchwarz algorithm is developed on top of the Portable,
   Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation for the simulation of
   microfluidic mixing described by the three-dimensional unsteady
   incompressible NavierStokes equations. The popularly used fractional
   step method, originally designed for high Reynolds number flows,
   requires some modification of the inviscid-type pressure boundary
   condition in order to reduce the divergence error near the wall. On the
   other hand, the fully coupled approach works well without any special
   treatment of the boundary condition for low Reynolds number microchannel
   flows. A key component of the algorithm is an additive Schwarz
   preconditioner, which is used to accelerate the convergence of a linear
   Krylov-type solver for the saddle-point-type Jacobian systems. As a test
   case, we carefully study a three-dimensional passive serpentine
   micromixer and report the parallel performance of the algorithm obtained
   on a parallel machine with more than one hundred processors.}},

   sputtering rate (including all species) peaks at the trailing hemisphere
   apex and decreases to about 1/3rd of the peak value at the leading
   hemisphere apex. O-2 and H-2 sputtering, by contrast, is confined almost
   entirely to the trailing hemisphere. Most sputtering is done by
   energetic sulfur ions (100s of keV to MeV), but most of the O-2 and H-2
   production is done by cold oxygen ions (temperature similar to 100 eV,
   total energy similar to 500 eV). As a part of the sputtering rate
   calculation we compared experimental sputtering yields with analytic
   estimates. We found that the experimental data are well approximated by
   the expressions of Fama et al. for ions with energies less than 100 keV
   (Fama, M., Shi, J., Baragiola, R.A., 2008. Sputtering of ice by
   low-energy ions. Surf Sci. 602, 156-161), while the expressions from
   Johnson et al. fit the data best at higher energies (Johnson, RE.,
   Burger, M.H., Cassidy, T.A., Leblanc, F., Marconi, M., Smyth, W.H.,
   2009. Composition and Detection of Europa's Sputter-Induced Atmosphere,
   in: Pappalardo, RT., McKinnon, W.B., Khurana, K.K. (Eds.), Europa.
   University of Arizona Press, Tucson.). We compare the calculated
   sputtering rate with estimates of water ice regolith grain size as
   estimated from Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) data,
   and find that they are strongly correlated as previously suggested by
   Clark et al. (Clark, IN., Fanale, F.P., Zent, A.P., 1983. Frost grain
   size metamorphism: Implications for remote sensing of planetary
   surfaces. Icarus 56, 233-245.). The mechanism responsible for the
   sputtering rate/grain size link is uncertain. We also report a surface
   composition estimate using NIMS data from an area on the trailing
   hemisphere apex. We find a high abundance of sulfuric acid hydrate and
   radiation-resistant hydrated salts along with large water ice regolith
   grains, all of which are consistent with the high levels of
   magnetospheric bombardment at the trailing apex. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{After an interplanetary cruise of almost seven years, the Cassini
   spacecraft arrived at Saturn on 30 June 2004. In 2005, Cassini completed
   three flybys of Enceladus, a small icy satellite of Saturn. Observations
   made during these flybys confirmed the existence of water vapor plumes
   in the south polar region of Enceladus. During an Enceladus flyby, plume
   jets imparted on the spacecraft resulted in small but visible attitude
   control errors. Using the known and unique transfer function between the
   disturbance torque and the attitude control error, the disturbance
   torque could be estimated. Furthermore, given good estimates of the
   spacecraft's projected area, center of pressure location, and spacecraft
   velocity, the time history of the Enceladus plume density could be
   reconstructed. Next, the density due to each plume jet as a function of
   both the radial distance of the spacecraft from the plume source and the
   angular distance of the spacecraft from the axis of symmetry of the jet
   was modeled. By comparing the reconstructed plume density with that
   predicted by the plume model, values of the plume model parameters are
   determined. The validity of this plume density model is confirmed using
   flight data obtained from four low-altitude flybys of Enceladus in
   2008-2011.}},

Abstract = {{Damage to cartilage caused by injury or disease can lead to pain and
   loss of mobility, diminishing one's quality of life. Because cartilage
   has a limited capacity for self-repair, tissue engineering strategies,
   such as cells encapsulated in synthetic hydrogels, are being
   investigated as a means to restore the, damaged cartilage. However,
   strategies to date are suboptimal in part because designing degradable
   hydrogels is complicated by structural and temporal complexities of the
   gel and evolving tissue along multiple length scales. To address this
   problem, this study proposes a multi-scale mechanical model using a
   triphasic formulation (solid, fluid, unbound matrix molecules) based on
   a single chondrocyte releasing extracellular matrix molecules within a
   degrading hydrogel. This model describes the key players (cells,
   proteoglycans, collagen) of the biological system within the hydrogel
   encompassing different length scales. Two mechanisms are included:
   temporal changes of bulk properties due to hydrogel degradation, and
   matrix transport. Numerical results demonstrate that the temporal change
   of bulk properties is a decisive factor in the diffusion of unbound
   matrix molecules through the hydrogel. Transport of matrix molecules in
   the hydrogel contributes both to the development of the pericellular
   matrix and the extracellular matrix and is dependent on the relative
   size of matrix molecules and the hydrogel mesh. The numerical results
   also demonstrate that osmotic pressure, which leads to changes in mesh
   size, is a key parameter for achieving a larger diffusivity for matrix
   molecules in the hydrogel. The numerical model is confirmed with
   experimental results of matrix synthesis by chondrocytes in
   biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels. This model may
   ultimately be used to predict key hydrogel design parameters towards
   achieving optimal cartilage growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The increasing interest in the extraordinary thermal properties of
   nanostructures has led to the development of various measurement
   techniques. Transient thermoreflectance method has emerged as a reliable
   measurement technique for thermal conductivity of thin films. In this
   method, the determination of thermal conductivity usually relies much on
   the accuracy of heat capacity input. For new nanoscale materials with
   unknown or less-understood thermal properties, it is either questionable
   to assume bulk heat capacity for nanostructures or difficult to obtain
   the bulk form of those materials for a conventional heat capacity
   measurement. In this paper, we describe a technique for simultaneous
   measurement of thermal conductivity. and volumetric heat capacity C of
   both bulk and thin film materials using frequency-dependent time-domain
   thermoreflectance (TDTR) signals. The heat transfer model is analyzed
   first to find how different combinations of. and C determine the
   frequency-dependent TDTR signals. Simultaneous measurement of thermal
   conductivity and volumetric heat capacity is then demonstrated with bulk
   Si and thin film SiO2 samples using frequency-dependent TDTR
   measurement. This method is further testified by measuring both thermal
   conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of novel hybrid
   organic-inorganic thin films fabricated using the atomic/molecular layer

   capacity can significantly shorten the development/discovery cycle of

Abstract = {{The African continent is facing the potential of a \$183.6 billion USD
   liability to repair and maintain roads damaged from temperature and
   precipitation changes directly related to predicted climate change
   through 2100. This cost is strictly to retain the current road
   inventory. This cost does not include costs associated with impacts to
   critically needed new roads. In many African countries, limited or
   non-existent funds for adaptation and mitigation are challenging these
   countries to identify the threats that are posed by climate change,
   develop adaptation approaches to the predicted changes, incorporate
   changes into mid-range and long-term development plans, and secure
   funding for the proposed and necessary adaptations. Existing studies
   have attempted to quantify the impact of climate change on
   infrastructure assets that will be affected by climate change in the
   coming decades. The current study extends these efforts by specifically
   addressing the effect of climate change on the African road
   infrastructure. The study identifies both total costs and opportunity
   costs of repairing and maintaining infrastructure due to increased
   stressors from climate change. Proactive and reactive costs are examined
   for six climate scenarios, with costs ranging, respectively, from an
   average of \$22 million USD to \$54 million USD annually per country. A
   regional analysis shows contrast between impacts in five areas of the
   continent, with impacts ranging from 22 \% opportunity cost to 168 \%.
   These costs have the potential to delay critical infrastructure
   development on the continent and present a challenge to policy makers
   balancing short-term needs with long-term planning.}},

Abstract = {{Settlement of soil layers during and after earthquake shaking is a major
   cause of damage to buildings and geotechnical structures. The available
   empirical design methods to consider seismically induced settlement
   focus on sands in dry or water-saturated conditions, and there is
   currently a gap in the basic understanding of the mechanisms of
   seismically induced settlements of partially saturated sands. An
   effective stress-based empirical methodology is proposed to estimate the
   seismically induced settlement of a free-field layer of sand in
   partially saturated conditions. This approach estimates the settlement
   by separately considering the volumetric strains caused by compression
   of void space during strong shaking (seismic compression) and
   dissipation of excess pore water pressures generated during earthquake
   shaking (postcyclic reconsolidation). A parametric evaluation of the
   methodology indicates that the small strain shear modulus, the
   parameters of the modulus reduction curve, the approach to estimate the
   upper bound on volumetric strain during liquefaction, and the pore water
   pressure generation parameter can have significant impacts on the
   predicted settlement. The model predictions were validated using results
   from a newly developed centrifuge physical modeling system that involved
   the use of steady-state infiltration to maintain a uniform degree of
   saturation with depth in the sand layer. Both the model and experimental
   results show a nonlinear trend in surface settlement with degree of
   saturation, with a minimum value obtained for sand at a degree of
   saturation between 0.3 and 0.6. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000774.

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the use of polynomial chaos expansions for the
   nonlinear, non-Gaussian propagation of orbit state uncertainty. Using
   linear expansions in tensor products of univariate orthogonal polynomial
   bases, polynomial chaos expansions approximate the stochastic solution
   of the ordinary differential equation describing the propagated orbit,
   and include information on covariance, higher moments, and the spatial
   density of possible solutions. Results presented in this paper use
   non-intrusive, i.e., sampling-based, methods in combination with either
   least-squares regression or pseudospectral collocation to estimate the
   polynomial chaos expansion coefficients at any future point in time.
   Such methods allow for the usage of existing orbit propagators. Samples
   based on sun-synchronous and Molniya orbit scenarios are propagated for
   up to ten days using two-body and higher-fidelity force models. Tests
   demonstrate that the presented methods require the propagation of orders
   of magnitude fewer samples than Monte Carlo techniques, and provide an
   approximation of the a posteriori probability density function that
   achieves the desired accuracy. Results also show that Poincare-based
   polynomial chaos expansions require fewer samples to achieve a given
   accuracy than Cartesian-based solutions. In terms of probability density
   function accuracy, the polynomial chaos expansion-based solutions
   represent an improvement over the linear propagation and unscented
   transformation techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This work develops a virtual rider that can be used to make a multi-body
   two-wheeled vehicle follow a specified ground path with a prescribed
   velocity profile. The virtual rider system is based on a simplified
   motorcycle model, the sliding plane motorcycle, which is composed of a
   single rigid body with two ground contact points. This reduced order
   nonlinear system was presented in an earlier work, together with a
   dynamic inversion procedure for computing a state-control trajectory
   corresponding to the desired task. This dynamic inversion procedure is
   combined in this work with a maneuver regulation controller to yield a
   nonlinear feedback control strategy. A transverse coordinate system that
   is consistent with the mechanical symmetries of ground vehicles is
   constructed and used in the development of the maneuver regulation
   controller. An inverse optimal control strategy, which also exploits the
   mechanical symmetries, is developed to shape the dynamic response of the
   closed loop system. Numerical results with the virtual rider driving a
   multi-body vehicle through a demanding maneuver with lateral
   accelerations reaching 1 g are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Graphite particles have been coated with Al2O3 via atomic layer
   deposition. Alumina content was measured via inductively coupled plasma
   spectrometry (ICP), LECO combustion analysis, and thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA). While alumina was present, adherence was limited, and
   nonconformal films were deposited on the graphite particles. Coatings
   produced changes in particle interactions and dispersability. These
   changes were observed via sedimentation rates of particle suspensions in
   water, Zeta potential values, and particle size distributions.
   Alumina-Graphite composites were sintered using coated and uncoated
   particles. Differences in bulk thermal properties are ascribed to
   enhanced dispersability of the coated particles in presintered powder
   mixtures. EDS mapping of the sintered composites confirms the enhanced
   dispersion of the coated graphite particles. Particle coating through
   atomic layer deposition provides a means to improve particle dispersion
   with low material loadings. It has been shown that changes in particle
   interaction characteristics can be achieved even without uniform and
   conformal coatings. These particle interaction changes can result in
   sintered composites with enhanced thermal properties.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption and the associated environmental impact are a
   pressing challenge faced by the transportation sector. Emerging
   electric-drive vehicles have shown promises for substantial reductions
   in petroleum use and vehicle emissions. Their success, however, has been
   hindered by the limitations of energy storage technologies. Existing
   in-vehicle lithium-ion battery systems are bulky, expensive, and
   unreliable. Energy storage system (ESS) design and optimization is
   essential for emerging transportation electrification. This paper
   presents an integrated ESS modeling, design, and optimization framework
   targeting emerging electric-drive vehicles. A large-scale ESS modeling
   solution is first presented, which considers major runtime and long-term
   battery effects, and uses fast frequency-domain analysis techniques for
   efficient and accurate characterization of large-scale ESS. The proposed
   design framework unifies design-time optimization and runtime control.
   This conducts statistical optimization for ESS cost and lifetime, which
   jointly considers the variances of ESS due to manufacture tolerance and
   heterogeneous driver-specific runtime usage. This optimizes ESS design
   by incorporating complementary energy storage technologies, e. g.,
   lithium-ion batteries and ultracapacitors. Using physical measurements
   of battery manufacture variation and real-world user driving profiles,
   our experimental study has demonstrated that the proposed framework
   effectively explores the statistical design space and produces
   cost-efficient ESS solutions with statistical system lifetime
   guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{Model checking is a formal method for verifying whether the system
   satisfies a user-defined specification. Compared to simulation, model
   checking is restricted in capacity. On the other hand, simulation is
   weak in detecting bugs that require long and complex sequences of events
   to be exposed. This paper combines model checking and simulation in an
   abstraction-refinement scheme to mitigate the problems of both methods.
   Abstraction refinement iteratively constructs a simplified model to
   verify the original model. While a simplified model mitigates the
   weakness of model checking, the set of simplified error traces model
   helps guide simulation toward deep bugs. In abstraction refinement,
   concretization-a process of deriving an error trace in the original
   model from the abstract ones-is used to invalidate spurious abstract
   error traces or to refute a property. In this paper, we describe a novel
   concretization algorithm that combines simulation with satisfiability to
   efficiently refute properties with very long error traces.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial exposures and sex hormones exert potent effects on autoimmune
   diseases, many of which are more prevalent in women. We demonstrate that
   early-life microbial exposures determine sex hormone levels and modify
   progression to autoimmunity in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model
   of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Colonization by commensal microbes elevated
   serum testosterone and protected NOD males from T1D. Transfer of gut
   microbiota from adult males to immature females altered the recipient's
   microbiota, resulting in elevated testosterone and metabolomic changes,
   reduced islet inflammation and autoantibody production, and robust T1D
   protection. These effects were dependent on androgen receptor activity.
   Thus, the commensal microbial community alters sex hormone levels and
   regulates autoimmune disease fate in individuals with high genetic risk.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the concept of using electrostatic forces for
   deployment of gossamer space structures. The Electrostatically Inflated
   Membrane Structure (EIMS) uses two conducting membranes that are
   interconnected through membrane ribs. An absolute electrostatic charge
   is applied to the structure through active charge emission. This causes
   repulsion between layers of lightweight membranes that inflates the EIMS
   system and tensions the membranes. Assuming positive tensions, the EIMS
   system is modeled as a rigid system. Typical orbital perturbations are
   considered such as solar radiation pressure, differential gravity, and
   atmospheric drag which may compress the structure leading to shape
   destabilization. Restricting the analysis in this paper to flat
   membranes, the minimum potentials required to exactly compensate for the
   worst case scenario of differential solar radiation pressure at
   geostationary altitudes are estimated to be on the order of hundreds of
   volts. In low Earth orbit, voltage magnitudes of several kilovolts are
   required to reach an inflation pressure to offset the normal compressive
   drag pressure. (C) 2012 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{New Findings center dot What is the central question of this study? Does
   hypoxia enhance blood flow to all parts of the brain uniformly? center
   dot What is the main finding and its importance? During hypoxia,
   internal carotid artery flow is maintained despite a reduction in
   (end-tidal) carbon dioxide tension, while vertebral artery blood flow
   increases. Only with maintained end-tidal carbon dioxide tension is
   there an increase in both vertebral and internal carotid blood flow
   during hypoxia. Hypoxia changes the regional distribution of cerebral
   blood flow and stimulates the ventilatory chemoreflex, thereby reducing
   CO2 tension. We examined the effects of both hypoxia and isocapnic
   hypoxia on acute changes in internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral artery
   (VA) blood flow. Ten healthy male subjects underwent the following two
   randomly assigned respiratory interventions after a resting baseline
   period with room air: (i) hypoxia; and (ii) isocapnic hypoxia with a
   controlled gas mixture (12\% O2; inspiratory mmHg). In the isocapnic
   hypoxia intervention, subjects were instructed to maintain the rate and
   depth of breathing to maintain the level of end-tidal partial pressure
   of CO2 () during the resting baseline period. The ICA and VA blood flow
   (velocity x cross-sectional area) were measured using Doppler
   ultrasonography. The was decreased (6.3 +/- 0.9\%, P < 0.001) during
   hypoxia by hyperventilation (minute ventilation +12.9 +/- 2.2\%, P <
   0.001), while was unchanged during isocapnic hypoxia. The ICA blood flow
   was unchanged (P= 0.429), while VA blood flow increased (+10.3 +/-
   3.1\%, P= 0.010) during hypoxia. In contrast, isocapnic hypoxia
   increased both ICA (+14.5 +/- 1.4\%, P < 0.001) and VA blood flows
   (+10.9 +/- 2.4\%, P < 0.001). Thus, hypoxic vasodilatation outweighed
   hypocapnic vasoconstriction in the VA, but not in the ICA. These
   findings suggest that acute hypoxia elicits an increase in posterior
   cerebral blood flow, possibly to maintain essential homeostatic
   functions of the brainstem.}},

Abstract = {{High temperature solar-thermal reaction processes can be carried out
   within closed-cavity solar receivers in which concentrated solar energy
   enters the cavity through a small aperture or window and is absorbed
   either directly by reactants or by tubes containing reactant mixtures.
   Accurate modeling of radiation transfer phenomena in the solar receiver
   is critical for predicting receiver performance and improving receiver
   design. The accuracy of the finite volume (FV) method is evaluated in
   comparison to Monte Carlo (MC) techniques for both the concentrated
   solar energy and the energy emitted by heated surfaces in a receiver
   with either absorbing/diffusely emitting or specularly reflective cavity
   walls. Models are solved for two-dimensional slices of each of two
   receiver configurations with four spatial grids ranging from 2300 to
   133,000 mesh elements, and three different angular grids. Solar
   radiative energy is described by a simplified uniform spatial profile at
   the receiver aperture that is either collimated or diffuse.
   Quantitatively accurate FV solutions for the solar energy either require
   highly refined angular and spatial grids, or are not possible on the
   mesh sizes investigated in this study. FV solutions for the emitted
   energy are sufficient even on coarse angular and spatial grids. FV
   solutions are least accurate when the cavity is highly specularly
   reflective or the absorber area is minimized, and tend to improve as the
   character of the incident solar energy changes from collimated to
   diffuse. Based on these results, a hybrid MC/FV strategy is proposed for
   use in combined radiation and convection/conduction heat transfer
   models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and mitigating particle formation in prefilled syringes
   are critical for ensuring stability of therapeutic proteins. In the
   current study, siliconized beads were used as a model for the
   siliconewater interface to evaluate subvisible particle formation and
   aggregation of a monoclonal antibody (IgG1). Agitation with siliconized
   beads greatly accelerated the formation of protein aggregates and
   particles, an effect that was enhanced at pH 7.4 relative to pH 5 and in
   the presence of 0.5 M sucrose or 150 mM NaCl. Aggregation and particle
   formation were minimal in samples agitated without siliconized beads or
   in quiescent samples with siliconized beads. At pH 5, 0.01\% (w/v)
   polysorbate 20 substantially inhibited aggregation during agitation with
   siliconized beads, but had minimal protective effect at pH 7.4.
   Transient exposure of IgG1 formulations to the siliconewater interface
   by flowing formulations through a column packed with siliconized beads
   led to the formation of subvisible particles, with increased levels
   observed at pH 7.4 compared to pH 5. Agitation of protein formulations

Abstract = {{Polymerized room-temperature ionic liquids (poly(RTIL)s) have garnered
   attention as new and interesting membrane materials for CO2/light gas
   separations because they combine the high CO2 affinity and thermal and
   chemical stability of RTILs, with the physical and mechanical properties
   of polymeric materials. Our group recently synthesized a new type of
   block copolymer (BCP) combining an imidazolium-based poly(RTIL) and an
   alkyl non-ionic polymer. These alkyl-b-ionic BCPs phase-separate into
   ordered nanostructures. Prior work investigating gas transport through
   phase-separated BCPs is very limited, and none has included RTIL-based
   BCP systems. However it has been shown that nanoscale phase-separation
   could facilitate gas transport via nanostructure orientation control or
   phase connectivity improvement. We have successfully made defect-free,
   thin-film composite membranes with these novel alkyl-imidazolium BCPs as
   a 3-20 mu m thick top layer, and determined their CO2/N-2 separation
   properties via single-gas permeability measurements and selectivity
   calculations. These new BCP materials were found to have distinct
   advantages over the analogous physical blends of the parent homopolymers
   with respect to membrane fabrication. The composition of the BCP top
   layer, which is directly connected to the type of nanostructure formed,
   was found to have a significant effect on CO2 permeability (i.e., it can
   increase CO2 permeability by two orders of magnitude up to an observed
   value of 9300 barrer). This improvement is mainly due to a large
   increase in the diffusion coefficient in the ordered nanostructures
   compared to amorphous BCP materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Absorbable Collagen Sponges (ACS) require excessive quantities of the
   active ingredient in INFUSE, recombinant human Bone Morphogenic
   Protein-2 (rhBMP2), to achieve physiologically relevant concentrations
   of the growth factor, driving up the cost of the product and increasing
   the likelihood of undesirable side effects in neighboring tissues. We
   demonstrate that a simple light-mediated, thiol-ene chemistry can be
   used to create an effective polymer delivery vehicle for rhBMP2,
   eliminating the use of xenographic materials and reducing the dose of
   rhBMP2 required to achieve therapeutic effects. Comprised entirely of
   synthetic components, this system entraps rhBMP2 within a biocompatible
   hydrogel scaffold that is degraded by naturally occurring remodeling
   enzymes, clearing the way for new tissue formation. When tested
   side-by-side with ACS in a critical-sized bone defect model in rats,
   this polymeric delivery system significantly increased bone formation
   over ACS controls. (C) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by

   This paper presents a simplified prediction model: Hourly Cooling Load
   Factor Method (HCLFM) that can provide quick and fair estimate of

   introduces the assumptions and principles of the proposed method, as
   well as discussing the implication and limitation of the approach. As a
   verification and demonstration, the method is applied to an office

   of the cooling load is reasonable. The study further analyzes the
   potential causes of prediction errors and the significance of various

Abstract = {{Highly structured porous alumina thin films have many practical uses,
   including membrane applications and catalyst encapsulation. One route to
   synthesizing these films that offers exceptional control over film
   thickness to several angstroms starts with the molecular layer
   deposition (MLD) of an aluminum alkoxide (alucone) film. Oxidizing the
   alucone film removes the organic component and produces the desired
   nanoporous alumina. The pore size can be controlled by selection of the
   length of the carbon chain in the polymer film. In this study, 500 nm
   silica nanoparticles were coated with 10-40 cycles of alucone using a
   three-step ABC MLD process. Trimethylaluminum, ethanolamine, and maleic
   anhydride were used as precursors. The organic component of the alucone
   films was removed in air by calcination at elevated temperature or in
   water at room temperature. It is shown that the pore size of the porous
   films can be increased from 0.6 to 0.8 nm by depositing an alucone film
   having longer carbon chains. Film surface area, composition, thickness,
   and pore size were measured, confirming that the ABC MLD process can
   produce high quality porous alumina films and provide a pathway to tune
   nanopore size in these films. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The new field of visual stylometry proposes to apply mathematical and
   statistical tools to high-resolution images of artworks to produce a
   quantitative description of each work's style, or of stylistic
   differences between works. Such quantitative evidence regarding artistic
   style can then assist in addressing open art historical questions,
   including those of a particular work's authorship or date of creation.
   In this paper, we develop a new technique for visual stylometry on
   impressionist and/or postimpressionist paintings. We focus on the
   background of each painting for our analysis, hypothesizing that only
   this bears the signature of the artist's hand. We then introduce a new
   wavelet-Hidden-Markov-Tree-based Fisher information distance as a metric
   of stylistic similarity between brushwork samples. Tests on two datasets
   consisting of over 100 impressionist and post-impressionist paintings by
   Van Gogh and contemporaries show that an unsupervised representation of
   the paintings according to this new metric tends to cluster the
   paintings by author and, within an author, by time period. Classifying
   paintings under leave-one-out cross-validation using coordinates in this
   unsupervised representation gave accuracies for artist classification of
   87.7\% and 85.0\% for the two datasets and for time period
   classification of 81.5\% and 75.4\%, a substantial improvement over
   previously developed stylistic distance metrics for paintings. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper describes our methods for repairing and restoring images of
   hidden paintings (paintings that have been painted over and are now
   covered by a new surface painting) that have been obtained via
   noninvasive X-ray fluorescence imaging of their canvases. This recently
   developed imaging technique measures the concentrations of various
   chemical elements at each two-dimensional spatial location across the
   canvas. These concentrations in turn result from pigments present both
   in the surface painting and in the hidden painting beneath. These X-ray
   fluorescence images provide the best available data from which to
   noninvasively study a hidden painting. However, they are typically
   marred by artifacts of the imaging process, features of the surface
   painting, and areas of information loss. Repairing and restoring these
   images thus consists of three stages: (1) repairing acquisition
   artifacts in the dataset, (2) removal of features in the images that
   result from the surface painting rather than the hidden painting, and
   (3) identification and repair of areas of information loss. We describe
   methods we have developed to address each of these stages: a
   total-variation minimization approach to artifact correction, a novel
   method for underdetermined blind source separation with multimodal side
   information to address surface feature removal, and two
   application-specific new methods for automatically identifying
   particularly thick or X-ray absorbent surface features in the painting.
   Finally, we demonstrate the results of our methods on a hidden painting
   by the artist Vincent van Gogh. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Chronic, heavy alcohol consumption may affect the concentration of
   neurometabolites assessed with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   (H-1-MRS). We investigated the largest sample reported to date (N=213)
   with the primary goal of determining how specific clinical features
   impact neurometabolite concentrations in an anterior cingulate gray
   matter voxel. This community-dwelling sample included both
   treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking individuals. A healthy
   control group (N=66) was matched for age and education. In multivariate
   analyses predicting neurometabolite concentrations, the heavy drinking
   group had greater concentrations overall. An age by group interaction
   was noted, as group difference across neurometabolites increased with
   age. More years drinking, but not more drinks per drinking day (DPDD),
   predicted greater concentrations of choline-containing compounds (Cho),
   creatine-phosphocreatine (Cre), glutamate-glutamine (Glx), and
   N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). The effects of other clinical variables
   (depression, cigarette smoking, marijuana use) were negligible. After
   controlling for DPDD and years drinking, treatment-seeking status had no
   impact on neurometabolites. In the very oldest portion of the sample
   (mean age=50), however, a negative relationship was seen between NAA and
   years drinking. These results suggest that the nature of neurometabolite
   abnormalities in chronic heavy drinkers may vary as a function of
   duration of abuse. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A major water quality concern in the Rocky Mountains is acid rock
   drainage (ARD), which causes acidic conditions and high metal
   concentrations in streams. The 30-year water quality record for the
   upper Snake River in Colorado, USA, shows that summer low-flow zinc
   concentrations have increased four- to sixfold concurrently with
   increases in mean annual and summer temperatures and a two- to
   three-week advancement in spring snowmelt. We found that the main source
   of zinc and other metal loads to the upper Snake River was a tributary
   draining an alpine area rich in disseminated pyrite. By conducting a
   tracer experiment in this tributary of interest, we demonstrated that
   30\% of the trace metal loading entered in an upper steep, rocky reach
   where the tributary of interest is fed by an alpine spring. Another
   increase in flow and metal loading occurred where the tributary of
   interest flows through a gently sloped wetland area. Analysis of the
   tracer experiment indicated a significant increase in hyporheic exchange
   along this wetland reach, from which metals appear to be mobilized.
   Several potential explanations are presented that might explain this
   phenomenon: decreasing pH in the tributary of interest may result in
   mobilization of metals from the wetland and hyporheic zone; the
   geochemistry of groundwater inflows to the wetland may be changing; and,
   wetland soils may be drying out with longer, warmer summers. This study
   illustrates how changes in hydrologic regime may cause changes in
   biogeochemical processes that exacerbate the danger to aquatic
   ecosystems associated with ARD. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{We evaluate predictions from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ
   version 4.7.1) model against a suite of airborne and ground-based
   meteorological measurements, gas-and aerosol-phase inorganic
   measurements, and black carbon (BC) measurements over Southern
   California during the CalNex field campaign in May/June 2010.
   Ground-based measurements are from the CalNex Pasadena ground site, and
   airborne measurements took place onboard the Center for
   Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Navy Twin
   Otter and the NOAA WP-3D aircraft. BC predictions are in general
   agreement with observations at the Pasadena ground site and onboard the
   WP-3D, but are consistently overpredicted when compared to Twin Otter
   measurements. Adjustments to predicted inorganic mass concentrations,
   based on predicted aerosol size distributions and the AMS transmission
   efficiency, are shown to be significant. Owing to recent shipping
   emission reductions, the dominant source of sulfate in the L. A. Basin
   may now be long-range transport. Sensitivity studies suggest that
   severely underestimated ammonia emissions, and not the exclusion of
   crustal species (Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+), are the single largest contributor
   to measurement/model disagreement in the eastern part of the L.A. Basin.
   Despite overstated NOx emissions, total nitrate concentrations are
   underpredicted, which suggests a missing source of HNO3 and/or
   overprediction of deposition rates. Adding gas-phase NH3 measurements
   and size-resolved measurements, up to 10 mu m, of nitrate and various
   cations (e.g. Na+, Ca2+, K+) to routine monitoring stations in the L.A.
   Basin would greatly facilitate interpreting day-to-day fluctuations in
   fine and coarse inorganic aerosol. Citation: Ensberg, J. J., et al.

Abstract = {{The CalNex 2010 (California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and
   Climate Change) study was designed to evaluate the chemical composition
   of air masses over key source regions in California. During May to June
   2010, air samples were collected on board a National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft over the South Coast
   Air Basin of California (SoCAB) and the Central Valley (CV). This paper
   analyzes six effective greenhouse gases-chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22),
   1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b), 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane
   (HCFC-142b), 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124),
   1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), and 1,1-difluoroethane
   (HFC-152a)-providing the most comprehensive characterization of
   chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement compound emissions in California.
   Concentrations of measured HCFCs and HFCs are enhanced greatly
   throughout the SoCAB and CV, with highest levels observed in the SoCAB:
   310 +/- 92 pptv for HCFC-22, 30.7 +/- 18.6 pptv for HCFC-141b, 22.9 +/-
   2.0 pptv for HCFC-142b, 4.86 +/- 2.56 pptv for HCFC-124, 109 +/- 46.4
   pptv for HFC-134a, and 91.2 +/- 63.9 pptv for HFC-152a. Annual emission
   rates are estimated for all six compounds in the SoCAB using the
   measured halocarbon to carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios and CO
   emissions inventories. Emission rates of 3.05 +/- 0.70 Gg for HCFC-22,
   0.27 +/- 0.07 Gg for HCFC-141b, 0.06 +/- 0.01 Gg for HCFC-142b, 0.11 +/-
   0.03 Gg for HCFC-124, 1.89 +/- 0.43 Gg for HFC-134a, and 1.94 +/- 0.45
   Gg for HFC-152b for the year 2010 are calculated for the SoCAB. These
   emissions are extrapolated from the SoCAB region to the state of
   California using population data. Results from this study provide a
   baseline emission rate that will help future studies determine if HCFC
   and HFC mitigation strategies are successful. Citation: Barletta, B., et

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, the widespread application of genetic and
   genomic approaches has revealed a bacterial world astonishing in its
   ubiquity and diversity. This review examines how a growing knowledge of
   the vast range of animal-bacterial interactions, whether in shared
   ecosystems or intimate symbioses, is fundamentally altering our
   understanding of animal biology. Specifically, we highlight recent
   technological and intellectual advances that have changed our thinking
   about five questions: how have bacteria facilitated the origin and
   evolution of animals; how do animals and bacteria affect each other's
   genomes; how does normal animal development depend on bacterial
   partners; how is homeostasis maintained between animals and their
   symbionts; and how can ecological approaches deepen our understanding of
   the multiple levels of animal-bacterial interaction. As answers to these
   fundamental questions emerge, all biologists will be challenged to
   broaden their appreciation of these interactions and to include
   investigations of the relationships between and among bacteria and their
   animal partners as we seek a better understanding of the natural world.}},

Abstract = {{Because rectifiers can convert a wide range of frequencies to dc it was
   thought that rectenna solar cells-antennas coupled to ultra-high speed
   diodes-could efficiently harvest the entire solar spectrum and exceed
   the Shockley-Queisser limit. We show that there are efficiency limits to
   broadband optical conversion and provide a quantitative analysis using
   the theory of photon-assisted tunneling. This quantum-based approach
   differs from classical rectification in lower frequency rectennas. The
   conversion efficiency approaches 100\% for monochromatic illumination.
   For broadband illumination at terrestrial solar intensities, the diode
   operating voltage plays the role that bandgap plays in conventional
   solar cells. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

   function and fate. To study cellular responses to biophysical cues,
   researchers have developed dynamic methods for controlling cell
   morphology; however, many of these platforms are limited to one
   transition between two predefined substratum topographies. To afford the
   user additional control over the presentation of microtopographic cues
   to cell populations, a photolabile, PEG-based hydrogel system is
   presented in which precisely engineered topographic cues can be formed
   in situ by controlled erosion. Here, the ability to produce precisely
   engineered static microtopographies in the hydrogel surface is first
   established. Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) response to topographies
   with features of subcellular dimensions (approximate to 5 to 40 m) and
   with various aspect ratios increasing from 1:1 to infinity (e.g.,
   channels) are quantified, and the dynamic nature of the culture system
   is demonstrated by sequentially presenting a series of topographies
   through in situ modifications and quantifying reversible changes in cell
   morphology in response to substratum topographies altered in real time.}},

Title = {{Search for Pair Production of Third-Generation Leptoquarks and Top

Abstract = {{Results are presented from a search for the pair production of
   third-generation scalar and vector leptoquarks, as well as for top
   squarks in R-parity-violating supersymmetric models. In either scenario,
   the new, heavy particle decays into a tau lepton and a b quark. The
   search is based on a data sample of pp collisions at root s = 7 TeV,
   which is collected by the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an
   integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb(-1). The number of observed events is
   found to be in agreement with the standard model prediction, and
   exclusion limits on mass parameters are obtained at the 95\% confidence
   level. Vector leptoquarks with masses below 760 GeV are excluded and, if
   the branching fraction of the scalar leptoquark decay to a tau lepton
   and a b quark is assumed to be unity, third-generation scalar
   leptoquarks with masses below 525 GeV are ruled out. Top squarks with
   masses below 453 GeV are excluded for a typical benchmark scenario, and
   limits on the coupling between the top squark, tau lepton, and b quark,
   lambda'(333) are obtained. These results are the most stringent for
   these scenarios to date. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.081801}},

Abstract = {{The supersonic gas plume of a landing rocket entrains lunar regolith,
   which is the layer of loose solids covering the lunar surface. This
   ejection is problematic due to scouring and dust impregnation of
   surrounding hardware, reduction in visibility for the crew, and spoofing
   of the landing sensors. To date, model predictions of erosion and
   ejection dynamics have been based largely on single-trajectory models in
   which the role of interparticle collisions is ignored. In the present
   work, the parameters affecting the erosion rate of monodisperse solids
   are investigated using the discrete element method (DEM). The drag and
   lift forces exerted by the rocket exhaust are incorporated via one-way
   coupling. The results demonstrate that interparticle collisions are
   frequent in the region immediately above the regolith surface; as many
   as 20\% of particles are engaged in a collision at a given time. These
   collisions play an important role both in the erosion dynamics and in
   the final trajectories of particles. In addition, a direct assessment of
   the influence of collisions on the erosion rate is accomplished via a
   comparison between a ``collisionless{''} DEM model and the original DEM
   model. This comparison shows that the erosion dynamics change
   drastically when collisions are considered and that the erosion rate is
   dependent on the collision parameters (coefficient of restitution and
   coefficient of friction). Physical explanations for these trends are
   provided. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.022205}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent challenges, conventional wisdom has held that heating
   over the Tibetan Plateau leads to increased Indian summer monsoon
   rainfall via enhancement of cross-equatorial circulation aloft, and a
   concurrent strengthening of both the Somali Jet and westerly winds that
   bring moisture to southern India. We show that such heating, quantified
   by monthly estimates of moist static energy in the atmosphere just above
   the surface, correlates with summer monsoon rainfall, but only in the
   early (20 May to 15 June) and late (September 1 to 15 October) monsoon
   season. Correlations during the main monsoon season (15 June to 31
   August) are small and insignificant. The positive correlations with
   early and late monsoon season, however, allow for heating over Tibet to
   modulate as much as similar to 30\% of the total rainfall. Furthermore,
   we demonstrate that heating over Tibet is independent of the El Nino
   Southern Oscillation, so that together they explain a substantial
   portion of variability in the early and late season rainfall, providing
   potential predictability. These links may also explain the wet
   conditions over India during early Holocene time and provide a
   quantitative link between a rise of Tibet and stronger Somali Jet.}},

Title = {{Alucone Interlayers to Minimize Stress Caused by Thermal Expansion
   Mismatch between Al2O3 Films and Teflon Substrates}},

Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Alucone films were employed as interlayers to minimize stress caused by
   thermal expansion mismatch between Al2O3 films grown by atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) and Teflon fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)
   substrates. The alucone films were grown by molecular layer deposition
   (MLD) using trimethylaluminum (TMA), ethylene glycol (EG), and H2O.
   Without the alucone interlayer, the Al2O3 films were susceptible to
   cracking resulting from the high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   mismatch between the Al2O3 film and the Teflon PEP substrate. Cracking
   was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
   images of Al2O3 films grown directly on Teflon FEP substrates at
   temperatures from 100 to 160 degrees C and then cooled to room
   temperature. With an alucone interlayer, the Al2O3 film had a crack
   density that was reduced progressively versus alucone interlayer
   thickness. For Al2O3 film thicknesses of 48 nm deposited at 135 degrees
   C, no cracks were observed for alucone interlayer thicknesses >60 nm on
   50 mu m thick Teflon FEP substrates. For thinner Al2O3 film thicknesses
   of 21 nm deposited at 135 degrees C, no cracks were observed for alucone
   interlayer thicknesses >40 nm on 50 mu m thick Teflon FEP substrates.
   Slightly higher alucone interlayer thicknesses were required to prevent
   cracking on thicker Teflon FEP substrates with a thickness of 125 mu m.
   The alucone interlayer linearly reduced the compressive stress on the
   Al2O3 film caused by the thermal expansion mismatch between the Al2O3
   coating and the Teflon FEP substrate. The average compressive stress
   reduction per thickness of the alucone interlayer was determined to be
   8.5 +/- 2.3 MPa/nm. Comparison of critical tensile strains for alucone
   films on Teflon FEP and HSPEN substrates revealed that residual
   compressive stress in the alucone film on Teflon FEP could help offset
   applied tensile stress and lead to the attainment of much higher
   critical tensile strains.}},

Title = {{Regional Contingencies in the Relationship between Aboveground Biomass
   and Litter in the World's Grasslands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Based on regional-scale studies, aboveground production and litter
   decomposition are thought to positively covary, because they are driven
   by shared biotic and climatic factors. Until now we have been unable to
   test whether production and decomposition are generally coupled across
   climatically dissimilar regions, because we lacked replicated data
   collected within a single vegetation type across multiple regions,
   obfuscating the drivers and generality of the association between
   production and decomposition. Furthermore, our understanding of the
   relationships between production and decomposition rests heavily on
   separate meta-analyses of each response, because no studies have
   simultaneously measured production and the accumulation or decomposition
   of litter using consistent methods at globally relevant scales. Here, we
   use a multi-country grassland dataset collected using a standardized
   protocol to show that live plant biomass (an estimate of aboveground net
   primary production) and litter disappearance (represented by mass loss
   of aboveground litter) do not strongly covary. Live biomass and litter
   disappearance varied at different spatial scales. There was substantial
   variation in live biomass among continents, sites and plots whereas
   among continent differences accounted for most of the variation in
   litter disappearance rates. Although there were strong associations
   among aboveground biomass, litter disappearance and climatic factors in
   some regions (e. g. U. S. Great Plains), these relationships were
   inconsistent within and among the regions represented by this study.
   These results highlight the importance of replication among regions and
   continents when characterizing the correlations between ecosystem
   processes and interpreting their global-scale implications for carbon
   flux. We must exercise caution in parameterizing litter decomposition
   and aboveground production in future regional and global carbon models
   as their relationship is complex.}},

Abstract = {{The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays an important role in middle atmospheric
   photochemistry, particularly in ozone (O-3) chemistry. Because it is
   mainly produced through photolysis and has a short chemical lifetime, OH
   is expected to show rapid responses to solar forcing {[}e.g., the 11-y
   solar cycle (SC)], resulting in variabilities in related middle
   atmospheric O-3 chemistry. Here, we present an effort to investigate
   such OH variability using long-term observations (from space and the
   surface) and model simulations. Ground-based measurements and data from
   the Microwave Limb Sounder on the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration's Aura satellite suggest an similar to 7-10\% decrease in
   OH column abundance from solar maximum to solar minimum that is highly
   correlated with changes in total solar irradiance, solar Mg-II index,
   and Lyman-alpha index during SC 23. However, model simulations using a
   commonly accepted solar UV variability parameterization give much
   smaller OH variability (similar to 3\%). Although this discrepancy could
   result partially from the limitations in our current understanding of
   middle atmospheric chemistry, recently published solar spectral
   irradiance data from the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment suggest
   a solar UV variability that is much larger than previously believed.
   With a solar forcing derived from the Solar Radiation and Climate
   Experiment data, modeled OH variability (similar to 6-7\%) agrees much
   better with observations. Model simulations reveal the detailed chemical
   mechanisms, suggesting that such OH variability and the corresponding
   catalytic chemistry may dominate the O-3 SC signal in the upper
   stratosphere. Continuing measurements through SC 24 are required to
   understand this OH variability and its impacts on O-3 further.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular layer deposition (MLD) is a useful technique for fabricating
   hybrid organic-inorganic thin films. MLD allows for the growth of
   ultrathin and conformal films using sequential, self-limiting reactions.
   This article focuses on the MLD of hybrid organic-inorganic films grown
   using metal precursors and various organic alcohols that yield metal
   alkoxide films. This family of metal alkoxides can be described as
   metalcones. Many metalcones are possible, such as the alucones and
   zincones based on the reaction of trimethylaluminum and diethylzinc,
   respectively, with various organic diols such as ethylene glycol. Alloys
   of the various metalcones with their parent metal oxide atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) films can also be fabricated that have an
   organic-inorganic composition that can be adjusted by controlling the
   relative number of ALD and MLD cycles. These metalcone alloys have
   tunable chemical, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties that
   may be useful for designing various functional films. The metalcone
   hybrid organic-inorganic materials offer a new tool set for engineering
   thin film properties.}},

Title = {{Identifying Multiple Populations from Single-Molecule Lifetime

Journal = {{CHEMPHYSCHEM}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{374-380}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{A major advantage of single-molecule methods over ensemble-averaging
   techniques involves the ability to characterize heterogeneity through
   the identification of multiple molecular populations. It can be
   challenging, however, to determine absolute values of dynamic parameters
   (and to relate these values to those determined from a conventional
   method) because characteristic timescales of various populations may
   vary over many orders of magnitude, and under a given set of
   experimental conditions instrumental sensitivity to various populations
   may be unequal. Using data obtained from the single-molecule tracking
   microscopy of fibrinogen protein adsorption and desorption, it is shown
   that by performing a combined analysis of molecular trajectories
   obtained using a range of acquisition times, it is possible to extract
   quantitative absolute values of multiple population fractions and
   residence times (with well-defined uncertainties), even when these
   values span many orders of magnitude. In particular, as many as six
   distinct populations are rigorously identified, exhibiting
   characteristic timescales that vary over nearly three orders of
   magnitude with population fractions as small as one part in a thousand.
   This approach will lead to better comparability between single-molecule
   experiments and may be useful in connecting single-molecule to
   ensemble-averaged observations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we had four primary objectives. (1) We reviewed a brief
   history of the Lissner award and the individual for whom it is named, H.
   R. Lissner. We examined the type (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and
   other) and scale (organism to molecular) of research performed by prior
   Lissner awardees using a hierarchical paradigm adopted at the 2007
   Biomechanics Summit of the US National Committee on Biomechanics. (2) We
   compared the research conducted by the Lissner award winners working in
   the musculoskeletal (MS) field with the evolution of our MS research and
   showed similar trends in scale over the past 35 years. (3) We discussed
   our evolving mechanobiology strategies for treating musculoskeletal
   injuries by accounting for clinical, biomechanical, and biological
   considerations. These strategies included studies to determine the
   function of the anterior cruciate ligament and its graft replacements as
   well as novel methods to enhance soft tissue healing using tissue
   engineering, functional tissue engineering, and, more recently,
   fundamental tissue engineering approaches. (4) We concluded with
   thoughts about future directions, suggesting grand challenges still
   facing bioengineers as well as the immense opportunities for young
   investigators working in musculoskeletal research. Hopefully, these
   retrospective and prospective analyses will be useful as the ASME
   Bioengineering Division charts future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of gas into stars is a fundamental process in
   astrophysics and cosmology. Stars are known to form from the
   gravitational collapse of dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds,
   and it has been proposed that the resulting star formation rate is
   proportional to either the amount of mass above a threshold gas surface
   density, or the gas volume density. These star formation prescriptions
   appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy's disc
   as well as in distant galaxies where the star formation rates are often
   much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone
   (CMZ), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surface density
   molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an environment where the
   validity of star formation prescriptions can be tested. Here, we show
   that by several measures, the current star formation rate in the CMZ is
   an order-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently
   accepted prescriptions. In particular, the region 1 degrees < l < 3
   degrees.5, vertical bar b vertical bar < 0 degrees.5 contains similar to
   10(7) M-circle dot of dense (> several 10(3) cm(-3)) molecular gas -
   enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters - but the present-day star
   formation rate within this gas is only equivalent to that in Orion. In
   addition to density, another property of molecular clouds must be
   included in the star formation prescription to predict the star
   formation rate in a given mass of molecular gas. We discuss which
   physical mechanisms might be responsible for suppressing star formation
   in the CMZ.}},

Abstract = {{The radial positioning of radiation belt electrons as a function of the
   Dst index and the controlling solar wind parameters for deep penetration
   of energetic electrons into the inner magnetosphere are investigated.
   Using 2-6 MeV electron data from the Solar, Anomalous, and
   Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) from January 1995 to June
   2004, we examine the L location of energetic electron deepest
   penetration, L location of the maximum flux, and L location of the
   maximum flux enhancement and variation over the duration of 119 moderate
   and strong isolated geomagnetic storms. We find that the L location of
   deepest penetration, L location of the maximum flux at the end of
   electron injections, and L location of the maximum flux variation have
   strong correlations with the minimum Dst index. Although the variation
   and radial positioning of radiation belt electrons is clearly associated
   with the Dst index, their deep penetration into the slot region (2 < L <
   3) is not directly correlated with the Dst index in an obvious way. It
   is also known that the Dst index can be accurately predicted based on
   solar wind parameters. Thus, the necessary and sufficient combination of
   solar wind conditions for the occurrence of injection events into the
   slot region, between L = 2-3, are also investigated. We find a total of
   23 injection events at L = 2.5 from 1995 to 2004 and that when certain
   solar wind conditions are met, an injection event at L = 2.5 is ensured.
   We also find that the electron flux preconditioning is an important
   factor influencing electron injections at L = 2.5. Citation: Zhao, H.,

Abstract = {{Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat are important processes in
   the surface energy balance that drives snowmelt. Modeling these fluxes
   in a forested environment is complicated because of the canopy effects
   on the wind field. This paper presents and tests a turbulent flux model
   developed to represent these processes in an energy balance snowmelt
   model. The goal is to model these processes using the readily available
   inputs of canopy height and leaf area index in a way that minimizes the
   number of parameters, state variables, and assumptions about hard to
   quantify processes. Selected periods from 9 years of eddy-covariance
   (EC) measurements at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were used to evaluate the
   effectiveness of this modeling approach. The model was able to reproduce
   the above-canopy sensible and latent heat fluxes reasonably with the
   correlation higher for sensible heat than latent heat. The modeled
   values of the below-canopy latent heat fluxes also matched the
   EC-measured values. The model captured the nighttime below-canopy
   sensible heat flux quite well, but there were discrepancies in daytime
   sensible heat flux possibly due to mountain slope circulation not
   quantifiable in this kind of model. Despite the uncertainties in the
   below-canopy sensible heat fluxes, the results are encouraging and
   suggest that reasonable predictions of turbulent flux energy exchanges
   and subsequent vapor losses from snow in forested environments can be
   obtained with a parsimonious single-layer representation of the canopy.
   The model contributes an improved physically based capability for
   predicting the snow accumulation and melt in a forested environment.}},

Abstract = {{Micro Cryogenic Coolers (MCCs) can achieve very small sizes and high

   refrigerants were tested as well. Without pre-cooling, each mixture
   exhibited considerably lower cooling power than the design value. With
   pre-cooling, the mixtures exhibited unsteady cooling temperatures
   accompanied by flow pulsations after a period of time. The low cooling
   power, unsteady temperatures, and time required for the pulsations to
   occur are analyzed in terms of composition change due to liquid hold-up

Abstract = {{Disaster recovery has been studied from a variety of perspectives
   including the fields of sociology, engineering, policy implementation,
   political-ecology, systems theory, geography, and urban planning,
   leading to a wide variety of definitions and indicators for measuring
   recovery. To assess what indicators can be used to measure both
   predisaster resilience and postdisaster recovery, an in-depth content
   analysis of recovery indicators in the existing literature was
   performed. Articles from 2000 to 2010 in four disaster-focused journals
   that include perspectives of engineers, social scientists,
   practitioners, and economists were analyzed. Articles were selected by a
   keyword search and analyzed for recovery indicators using an emergent
   coding scheme. Interestingly, many research articles never defined
   recovery. Recovery indicators were categorized as social, economic,
   environmental, and infrastructural. The indicators cited were analyzed
   based on the disciplinary affiliation of the author. Authors from
   different disciplines cited different indicators, suggesting that
   increased interdisciplinary collaboration may be needed. As a second
   step in this research, a multiround Delphi survey was used to obtain
   expert opinion on the recovery indicators. This process verified that
   the set of indicators identified through the content analysis were
   important and provided a rating of the importance of each indicator.
   Panelists also provided justifications for any ratings that differed
   from the median. Researchers can use these results as indicators of
   recovery in future studies. Similarly, practitioners will be able to use
   the condensed opinions of experts in the field of disaster recovery and
   planning. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000087. (C) 2013 American

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effect of clamping pressure on the actuation performance of ionic
   polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators is newly investigated by
   carefully considering changes of mechanical stiffness and electrical
   resistance due to the interfacial contacts between the IPMC and clamping
   devices. During the clamping process, the soft ionic exchangeable
   polymer membrane will be squeezed along the thickness direction in the
   clamping area, resulting in a change of the mechanical stiffness of the
   cantilevered IPMCs. Also, the electrical contact resistance between two
   electrodes of the IPMC and the clamping device will be greatly changed
   according to the change of clamping pressures. Present experimental
   results show that clamping pressures between the IPMC and the clamping
   device will strongly affect the actuation performance of the IPMC
   actuators. An exact electro-mechanical model is developed to fully
   describe dynamics of the IPMC actuators by considering structural
   damping, hydrodynamic loading and electro-mechanical force. This study
   shows that there exists an optimal clamping pressure to obtain the
   largest bending deformation of the IPMC actuator because of a trade-off
   between mechanical stiffness and electrical contact resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in hydrogel design have revolutionized the way biomaterials are
   applied to address biomedical needs. Hydrogels were introduced in
   medicine over 50 years ago and have evolved from static, bioinert

   direct specific biological responses such as cellular ingrowth in wound
   healing or on-demand delivery of therapeutics. Two general classes of
   mechanisms, those defined by the user and those dictated by the
   endogenous cells and tissues, can control dynamic hydrogel
   microenvironments. These highly tunable materials have provided

Abstract = {{A synthetic amino acid bearing a furan functionality was developed and
   incorporated into peptide sequences using solid phase synthesis.
   Peptides expressing the furan moiety were attached to poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) hydrogels through a thermally reversible covalent bond
   formed by a Diels-Alder reaction. Reactions of thiol and maleimide PEG
   macromers in an off-stoichiometric Michael addition were performed, such
   that the maleimide moiety was in excess, to create hydrogel networks
   with pendant Diels-Alder compatible tethering sites, that is, the
   maleimide. By making use of the Diels-Alder reaction, it was possible to
   control the release rate of reversibly bound moieties from the hydrogel
   by changing the temperature; higher temperatures favor a faster
   retro-Diels-Alder reaction and, therefore, a faster release from the
   polymer network. This concept was demonstrated by incorporating a
   fluorescently labeled furan-RGDS sequence into a hydrogel possessing
   excess maleimide functionalities and monitoring the subsequent
   liberation of RGDS at various temperatures, illustrating a Diels-Alder
   mediated release mechanism. The release profile was quantified at
   temperatures ranging from physiological (37 degrees C) to 80 degrees C.
   By changing the temperature, varying extents of release were attained
   over the time course of several days, ranging from 40\% release for
   lower temperatures to complete release for the highest temperature
   considered. Further confirmation of a reaction-diffusion controlled
   release mechanism was obtained through comparison of experimental
   release data to a reaction-diffusion model of the release. In addition
   to thermal modulation, tuning of the release rate was accomplished by
   altering the number of possible Diels-Alder tethering sites present in
   the hydrogel. Increasing the amount of free maleimide and, therefore,
   the number of potential Diels-Alder reaction sites, effectively slowed
   the release of peptide from the polymer. For instance, doubling the
   amount of maleimide sites present in the hydrogel system decreased the
   amount of peptide released from approximately 60\% to about 40\% in the
   same span of time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to reduce the size of low-frequency
   square-wave (LFSW) ballasts by using a single stage for resonant
   ignition and LFSW operation together with soft-saturation magnetic
   material and digital control techniques. Inductor design constraints are
   developed to leverage the nonlinear inductor behavior and achieve both
   size reduction and desirable performance in lamp ignition, warm-up, and
   normal operation modes. The digital controller provides multiple
   functions, including 1) a phase-controlled resonant sweep to achieve
   reliable lamp ignition and device protection with zero-voltage switching
   despite the nonlinear tank inductance, 2) lamp ignition detection and
   rapid transition to LFSW mode for lamp warm-up, 3) fast LFSW polarity
   transitions with optimal timing control for acoustic resonance free
   operation, and 4) two-loop feedback control. A fast current control loop
   limits and stabilizes the lamp current and rejects large ripple from the
   power factor correction (PFC) stage in order to reduce the size of the
   PFC output capacitor. A slow power control loop rejects variations in
   the lamp characteristics during warm-up and lamp aging. Experimental
   results are presented showing successful ignition and operation of a
   150-W high-intensity discharge lamp.}},

Title = {{Increased arterial stiffness and extracellular matrix reorganization in

Journal = {{PEDIATRIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{147-154}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) results in
   increased placental resistance to blood flow, fetal hypertension, and
   increased pulsatility stresses shown to lead to vascular remodeling. We
   tested our hypothesis that IUGR causes decreased compliance in the
   carotid and umbilical arteries due to altered extracellular matrix (ECM)
   composition and structure.
   METHODS:A sheep model of placental insufficiency-induced IUGR (PI-IUGR)
   was created by exposure of the pregnant ewe to elevated ambient
   temperatures. Umbilical and carotid arteries from near-term fetuses were
   tested with pressure-diameter measurements to compare passive compliance
   in control and PI-IUGR tissues. ECM composition was measured via
   biochemical assay, and the organization was determined by using
   histology and second-harmonic generation imaging.
   RESULTS: We found that PI-IUGR increased arterial stiffness with
   increased collagen engagement, or transition stretch. PI-IUGR carotid
   arteries exhibited increased collagen and elastin quantity, and PI-IUGR
   umbilical arteries exhibited increased sulfated glycosaminoglycans.
   Histomorphology showed altered collagen-to-elastin ratios with altered
   cellular proliferation. Increased stiffness indicates altered
   collagen-to-elastin ratios with less elastin contribution leading to
   increased collagen engagement.
   CONCLUSION: Because vessel stiffness is a significant predictor in the
   development of hypertension, disrupted ECM deposition in IUGR provides a
   potential link between IUGR and adult hypertension.}},

Title = {{Optimal reconfigurations of two-craft Coulomb formations along manifolds}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{108-118}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Coulomb formations refer to swarms of closely flying spacecraft, in
   which the net electric charge of each vehicle is controlled. Active
   charge control is central to this concept and enables a propulsion
   system with highly desirable characteristics, albeit with limited
   controllability. Numerous Coulomb formation equilibria have been
   derived, but to maintain and maneuver these configurations, some
   inertial thrust is required to supplement the nearly propellant-less
   charge control. In this work, invariant manifold theory is applied to
   two-craft Coulomb equilibria, which are admitted in a linearized
   two-body gravity model. The manifolds associated with these systems are
   analyzed for the first time, and are then utilized as part of a general
   procedure for formulating optimal reconfigurations. Specifically,
   uncontrolled flows along the manifolds are sought which provide near
   continuous transfers from one equilibrium to another. Control is then
   introduced to match continuity, while minimizing inertial thrusting.
   This methodology aims to exploit uncontrolled motions and charge control
   to realize the shape-changing ability of these formations, without large
   inertial control efforts. Some variations in formulating and
   parameterizing the optimal transfers are discussed, and analytical
   expressions are derived to aid in establishing control parameter limits,
   under certain assumptions. Numerical results are provided, as
   demonstrative examples of the optimization procedure, using relatively
   simple control approximations. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization, a
   novel stochastic method, is used with considerable success to solve the
   numerically difficult parameter optimization problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The performance of Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings for

   Coating both electrodes with approximate to 1 nm of alumina as well as
   coating only the LCO (positive electrode) enables improved performance
   when cycling at high voltage, where the LCO is known to degrade.
   However, we found that coating only the NG (negative electrode) also
   improves the performance of the whole battery when cycling at high
   voltage. Under these conditions, the uncoated LCO (positive electrode)
   should degrade quickly, and the NG should be unaffected. A variety of

Abstract = {{In high-latitude catchments where permafrost is present, runoff dynamics
   are complicated by seasonal active-layer thaw, which may cause a change
   in the dominant flowpaths as water increasingly contacts mineral soils
   of low hydraulic conductivity. A 2-year study, conducted in an upland
   catchment in Alaska (USA) underlain by frozen, well-sorted eolian silt,
   examined changes in infiltration and runoff with thaw. It was
   hypothesized that rapid runoff would be maintained by flow through
   shallow soils during the early summer and deeper preferential flow later
   in the summer. Seasonal changes in soil moisture, infiltration, and
   runoff magnitude, location, and chemistry suggest that transport is
   rapid, even when soils are thawed to their maximum extent. Between June
   and September, a shift occurred in the location of runoff, consistent
   with subsurface preferential flow in steep and wet areas. Uranium
   isotopes suggest that late summer runoff erodes permafrost, indicating
   that substantial rapid flow may occur along the frozen boundary.
   Together, throughflow and deep preferential flow may limit upland boreal
   catchment water and solute storage, and subsequently biogeochemical
   cycling on seasonal to annual timescales. Deep preferential flow may be
   important for stream incision, network drainage development, and the
   release of ancient carbon to ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, polymer-based microcryogenic cooler (MCC) cold stages,
   each with a footprint of 17 mm x 5 mm, have been successfully developed
   and tested. The MCC cold stage consists of a polyimide heat exchanger
   (HX) which is monolithically manufactured on a silicon substrate by
   using a polyimide/copper microelectromechanical systems process and a
   silicon/glass Joule-Thomson (J-T) valve which is formed with anodic
   bonding. Specifically, PI-2574 (HD MicroSystems) was used to make the HX
   in this work. The two parts are assembled together, forming a cooler
   which uses the J-T cycle. A cooling test with an optimized
   five-component mixture as the refrigerant was conducted to examine the
   performance of the cooler. The cooling temperature was able to reach 233
   K under an operating pressure ratio of 0.7:0.15 MPa. It is one of the
   world's smallest J-T cold stages and the first one fabricated and
   assembled based on wafer-level processes. {[}2012-0132]}},

Abstract = {{Artificial nanocomposite structures offer a pathway to the development
   of engineered materials with novel macroscopic properties. Manufacturing
   the composite materials in a highly efficient yet precise manner remains
   a challenge and self-assembly of functional nanomaterials offers an
   attractive solution. In this paper, shape-persistent three-dimensional
   cage molecules have been used, for the first time, for the self-assembly
   of gold nanoparticles. The modular construction of cage molecules allows
   for precise control of inter-particle spacing down to the molecular
   level. Furthermore, the ability to change the number and flexibility of
   binding sites provides a means to tune the self-assembly process. We
   have designed and synthesized two types of cage molecules equipped with
   different numbers of binding groups with different flexibility. A
   systematic analysis of the optical and structural characterizations show
   that the inter-particle spacing within the self-assembled structures are
   precisely controlled by the choice of the cage molecules. These results
   highlight that the new self-assembly approach based on molecular cage
   linkers provides nanometric control over the self-assembled structure.

   Accurate state plane modeling of the reverse recovery process is based

   possessing high sensitivity to diode characteristics, these
   generalizations are shown to be necessary to achieve accurate results

Abstract = {{Therapeutic proteins formulated in prefilled syringes lubricated with
   silicone oil come in contact with silicone oilwater interfaces for their
   entire shelf lives. Thus, the interactions between protein and silicone
   oil were studied to determine the effect of silicone oil on a monoclonal
   antibody's stability, both at the interface and in the bulk solution.
   The influence of ionic strength on these interactions was also
   investigated through the addition of various monovalent and divalent
   salts to sample formulations. The tertiary structure of the antibody was
   perturbed when it adsorbed to the silicone oilwater interface in
   solutions at low ionic strength. However, the tertiary structure of the
   antibody at the interface was not perturbed when the ionic strength of
   the formulation was increased. Even at low ionic strength, the secondary
   structure of the antibody adsorbed to the silicone oilwater interface
   was retained, suggesting that at low ionic strength, the adsorbed
   antibody assumes a molten globule-like conformation. This partially
   unfolded species was aggregation-prone, especially during agitation.
   Silicone oil-induced aggregation of the antibody was inhibited at higher
   ionic strength. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{This study describes the fabrication, assembly, and testing of a micro
   gas compressor. The compressor is formed by MEMS-based check valves
   coupled to a Kapton membrane driven by a mechanically amplified
   piezoelectric actuator. The valves are surface machined on a silicon
   substrate using polyimide as the structural material and copper as the
   sacrificial material. This design allows valves with low leak rates, low
   compressor dead volume, and the high compressible volume required to
   generate the pressure levels required of numerous applications including
   cryogenic cooling. The assembled compressor is tested with voltages over
   the range of 25-180V and frequencies over the range of 25-700 Hz. A
   maximum pressure ratio of 4.3:1 is found when the actuator provides a
   maximum displacement of 156 mu m, while the maximum flow-rate through
   the compressor of 51 standard cubic cm per minute (sccm) is observed
   when the compressor is operating at its resonant frequency. (C) 2012

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Significant amounts of ethanol are produced from biofuel crops such as
   corn and, in the future, likely switchgrass. The atmospheric effects of
   growing these plant species on a large scale are investigated here by
   measuring the plant-atmosphere exchange of volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs). Field grown corn and switchgrass emit VOCs at flux rates of 4.4
   nmol(C) m(-2) s(-1) (10(-9) mol carbon per square meter leaf area per
   second) and 2.4 nmol(C) m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Methanol contributes
   60\% to the molar flux but small emissions of carbonyls, aromatic
   compounds and terpenoids are relatively more important for potential air
   quality impacts. Switchgrass can act as a sink for carbonyls and
   aromatic compounds with compensation points of a few hundred pptv. In
   switchgrass moderate drought stress may induce enhanced emissions of
   monoterpenes, carbonyls and aromatics. Per liter of fuel ethanol
   produced, the estimated VOC emissions associated with the biomass growth
   of corn (7.8 g l(-1)) or switchgrass (6.2 g l(-1)) are in the same range
   as the VOC emissions from the use of one liter gasoline in vehicle
   engines. VOC emissions from the growing of biofuel crops can therefore
   be a significant contributor to the VOC emissions in the life cycle of
   biofuels. The VOC emissions from corn and switchgrass are small compared
   to those of tree species suggested as biofuel crops. Due to their
   reactivity with respect to OH the emissions from corn and switchgrass
   are not likely to have a significant impact on regional ozone formation.

Abstract = {{Detecting biofouling noninvasively in real-time has been a long-standing
   challenge in membrane processes. Ultrasonic Time Domain Reflectometry
   (UTDR) offers the potential to address this challenge when used in a
   `canary cell' that samples a slip stream from the feed to the membrane
   process. However, adapting UTDR to detect biofouling is problematic
   owing to the small difference in acoustic properties between a
   biofouling layer and water or a membrane. In this study UTDR has been
   adapted to detect biofouling by periodic dosing of colloidal silica as
   an `acoustic enhancer'. This novel UTDR technique was applied to detect
   biofouling on flat sheet polyethersulfone ultrafiltration (UF) and thin
   film composite polyamide reverse osmosis (RU) membranes in a canary cell
   flow configuration. The UTDR response correlates with the transmembrane
   pressure and off-line measurements of the biofilm thickness via confocal
   laser scanning microscopy, the bacterial count, and extra-polymeric
   cellular substances (EPS). The acoustic enhancer was shown to have no
   effect on the viability of the bacteria. Hence, UTDR can be used for the
   noninvasive real-time detection of biofouling in high pressure membrane
   processes such as RU by periodic dosing of an enhancer such as colloidal
   silica in a canary cell. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   on ultrafiltration membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{428}},
Pages = {{598-607}},

Abstract = {{Flux decline due to membrane fouling prevails in almost all
   pressure-driven liquid separations. The factors controlling fouling,
   ranging from surface chemistry to topographic roughness, have been
   extensively investigated. However, the role of surface patterns,
   particularly at a submicron scale, on membrane fouling remains unclear.
   Herein, we demonstrate that submicron patterns can be successfully
   imprinted onto a commercial polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane surface
   using nanoimprint lithography (NIL) without sacrificing its permeability
   properties. The presence of these patterns led to significantly improved
   deposition resistance during filtration of colloidal silica particle
   suspensions, as evidenced by a 19-45\% increase in the apparent critical
   flux, with the magnitude dependent on particle size. Post-filtration
   visualization reveals an intriguing anisotropy in the particle
   deposition, whereby the degree of anisotropy depends on the orientation
   angle between the surface pattern and the flow direction of the feed.
   These results suggest a chemical-free route to post-formation, membrane
   surface modification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Positive matrix factorization of a 32-month series of daily PM2.5
   speciation data with incorporation of temperature stratification}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{11-20}},

Abstract = {{This study presents source apportionment results for PM2.5 from applying
   positive matrix factorization (PMF) to a 32-month series of daily PM2.5
   compositional data from Denver, CO, including concentrations of sulfate,
   nitrate, bulk elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), and 51
   organic molecular markers (OMMs). An optimum 8-factor solution was
   determined primarily based on the interpretability of the PMF results
   and rate of matching factors from bootstrapped PMF solutions with those
   from the base case solution. These eight factors were identified as
   inorganic ion, n-alkane, EC/sterane, light n-alkane/polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon (PAH), medium alkane/alkanoic acid, PAH,
   winter/methoxyphenol and summer/odd n-alkane. The inorganic ion factor
   dominated the reconstructed PM2.5 mass (sulfate + nitrate + EC + OC) in
   cold periods (daily average temperature <10 degrees C; 43.7\% of
   reconstructed PM2.5 mass) whereas the summer/odd n-alkane factor
   dominated in hot periods (>20 degrees C; 53.1\%). The two factors had
   comparable relative contributions of 26.5\% and 27.1\% in warm periods
   with temperatures between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Each of the
   seven factors resolved in a previous study (Dutton et al., 2010b) using
   a 1-year data set from the same location matches one factor from the
   current work based on comparing factor profiles. Six out of the seven
   matched pairs of factors are linked to similar source classes as
   suggested by the strong correlations between factor contributions (r =
   0.89-0.98). Temperature-stratified source apportionment was conducted
   for three subsets of the data in the current study, corresponding to the
   cold, warm and hot periods mentioned above. The cold period (7-factor)
   solution exhibited a similar distribution of reconstructed PM2.5 mass as
   the full data set solution. The factor contributions of the warm period
   (7-factor) solution were well correlated with those from the full data
   set solution (r = 0.76-0.99). However, the reconstructed PM2.5 mass was
   distributed more to inorganic ion, n-alkane and medium alkane/alkanoic
   acid factors in the warm period solution than in the full data set
   solution. For the hot period (6-factor) solution, PM2.5 mass
   distribution was quite different from that of the full data set
   solution, as illustrated by regression slopes as low as 0.2 and as high
   as 4.8 of each matched pair of factors across the two solutions. (C)

Abstract = {{Genes encoding membrane proteins have been estimated to comprise as much
   as 30 of the human genome. Among these membrane, proteins are a large
   number of signaling receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes
   that are vital to cellular regulation, metabolism and homeostasis. While
   many membrane proteins are considered high-priority targets for drug
   design, there is a dearth of structural and biochemical information on
   them. This lack of information stems from the inherent insolubility and
   instability of transmembrane domains, which prevents easy obtainment of
   high-resolution crystals to specifically study structurefunction
   relationships. In part, this lack of structures has greatly impeded our
   understanding in the field of membrane proteins. One method that can be
   used to enhance our understanding is directed evolution, a molecular
   biology method that mimics natural selection to engineer proteins that
   have specific phenotypes. It is a powerful technique that has
   considerable success with globular proteins, notably the engineering of
   protein therapeutics. With respect to transmembrane protein targets,
   this tool may be underutilized. Another powerful tool to investigate
   membrane protein structurefunction relationships is computational
   modeling. This review will discuss these protein engineering methods and
   their tremendous potential in the study of membrane proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of voltage ripple on the power output of a photovoltaic panel
   is calculated and tested experimentally. Voltage ripple induces a much
   larger power reduction than would be predicted from a conventional
   small-signal model of the panel's I-V characteristic, even with small
   ripple amplitude. A simple expression is provided to calculate power
   reduction from rms ripple voltage, for any ripple waveform shape. The
   effect of ripple on power output can be much more severe under
   nonuniform irradiance as can result from partial shading. The results
   are important for
   1) consideration of double-line-frequency ripple in single-phase
   inverters;
   2) high-frequency switching ripple with any power converter in a
   photovoltaic system; and
   3) perturbations and tracking errors in maximum-power-point tracking
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental issue in the design and development of antimicrobials is
   the lack of understanding of complex modes of action and how this
   complexity affects potential pathways for resistance evolution. Bac8c
   (RIWVIWRR-NH2) is an 8 amino acid antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that has
   been shown to have enhanced activity against a range of pathogenic
   Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeast. We have
   previously demonstrated that Bac8c appears to interfere with multiple
   targets, at least in part through the disruption of cytoplasmic membrane
   related functions, and that resistance to this peptide does not easily
   develop using standard laboratory methods. Here, we applied a genomics
   approach, SCalar Analysis of Library Enrichement (SCALEs), to map the
   effect of gene overexpression onto Bac8c resistance in parallel for all
   genes and gene combinations (up to similar to 10 adjacent genes) in the
   E. coli genome (a total of similar to 500,000 individual clones were
   mapped). Our efforts identified an elaborate network of genes for which
   overexpression leads to low-level resistance to Bac8c (including biofilm
   formation, multi-drug transporters, etc). This data was analyzed to
   provide insights into the complex relationships between mechanisms of
   action and potential routes by which resistance to this synthetic AMP
   can develop.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of Halons, bromine-containing haloalkanes, to
   stratospheric ozone depletion is highly dependent on their atmospheric
   lifetime, which is primarily determined by UV photolysis. In this work,
   UV absorption cross-sections of the ozone-depleting substances CF2Br2
   (Halon-1202), CF2ClBr (Halon-1211), and CF2BrCF2Br (Halon-2402) were
   measured between 300 and 350 nm over the temperature range 210-296 K
   using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Rayleigh scattering cross-sections
   were also determined and utilized in the cross-section determination.
   Spectra parameterizations are presented and 2-D atmospheric model
   calculations were used to determine global annually averaged atmospheric
   lifetimes of 2.52, 16.4, and 28.3 years, ozone depletion potentials
   (ODPs) of 1.95, 8.1, and 18.4, global warming potentials (GWPs) of 175,
   1940, and 2270 (100-year time horizon), and associated uncertainties for
   CF2Br2, CF2ClBr, and CF2BrCF2Br, respectively. The revised lifetimes,
   ODPs, and GWPs differ from values currently reported in international

Abstract = {{Optical properties, including infrared (IR) extinction and visible light
   scattering of mineral dust aerosol, are measured experimentally and
   compared to modeling results using T-matrix theory. The work includes
   studies of complex, authentic field samples of Saharan sand, Iowa loess,
   and Arizona road dust (ARD). Particle size distributions and aerosol
   optical properties are measured simultaneously. These authentic dust
   samples are treated as external mixtures of mineral components. The
   mineral compositions for the Saharan sand and Iowa loess samples have
   been reported by Laskina et al. {[}2012], and the mineralogy for ARD is
   derived here using a similar method. T-matrix-based simulations, using
   measured particle size distributions and a priori particle shape models,
   are carried out for each mineral component of the authentic samples. The
   simulated optical properties for the complex dust mixtures are obtained
   by a weighted average of the properties of the mineral components, based
   on a given sample mineralogy. T-matrix simulations are then directly
   compared with the measured IR extinction spectra and visible light
   scattering phase function and linear polarization profiles for each
   sample. Generally good agreement between experiment and theory is
   obtained. Model simulations that account for differences in particle
   shape with mineralogy and include a broad range of eccentric spheroid
   shape parameters offer a significant improvement over more commonly
   applied models that ignore variations in particle shape with size or
   mineralogy and include only a moderate range of shape parameters.

Abstract = {{Surface-based temperature inversions (SBIs) are studied at Summit
   Station in central Greenland during the period spanning July 2010 to May
   2012. The frequency and intensity of SBI are examined using microwave
   radiometer (MWR) temperature retrievals, radiosonde profiles, and
   near-surface meteorological data. Using the MWRs' high temporal
   resolution, the diurnal, monthly, and annual cycles are investigated.
   Monthly mean values in SBI occurrence and intensity show that
   surface-based inversions are prevalent in the winter with decreasing
   values in the summer months. A case study on 20 February 2011 suggests
   that factors other than solar elevation angle influence the intensity of
   surface-based inversions. An increase in liquid water path corresponds
   to a decrease in SBI intensity, suggesting that liquid-bearing clouds,
   especially within the lowest 1 km, are associated with weaker
   surface-based inversions. Citation: Miller, N. B., D. D. Turner, R.

Abstract = {{Aerosol samples from the 2010 CalNex field study in Bakersfield (BF) and
   Pasadena (LA) were analyzed using positive mode nanospray-desorption
   electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Secondary organic aerosol
   (SOA) produced in a photochemical chamber by photooxidation of diesel
   (DSL) fuel and isoprene (ISO) under humid, high-NOx conditions, was
   analyzed for comparison. Three groups of organic compounds with zero,
   one, or two nitrogen atoms in their molecular formulas (0N, 1N, 2N) were
   compared in detail. The composition of ambient SOA exhibited greater
   overlap with DSL than with ISO. The overlap of the chamber experiments
   with the BF data was relatively consistent throughout the day while the
   overlap with LA data increased significantly in the noon to 6 P. M.
   sample, consistent with the SOA plume arriving from downtown Los
   Angeles. BF samples were more oxidized, contained more organic nitrogen,
   and had more overlap with the chamber data compared to LA samples. The
   addition of gaseous ammonia (NH3) to the DSL experiment was necessary to
   generate many of the 2N compounds observed in BF. This analysis
   demonstrates that DSL and ISO were important sources but cannot account
   for all of the observed ambient compounds indicating that other sources
   of organics were also likely important.}},

   challenges our results on the basis that we have misinterpreted some

   consist of only two locations over short atmospheric time periods. We
   address each of these arguments, acknowledging important issues and
   clarifying some misconceptions, and stand by our observations. We
   acknowledge that Jacobson identified one detail in our experimental
   technique that places an additional constraint on the interpretation of
   our observations and reduces somewhat the potential consequences of the
   stated implications.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to extract a Greenland ice core with a complete record of the
   Eemian interglacial (130,000 to 115,000 years ago) have until now been
   unsuccessful. The response of the Greenland ice sheet to the
   warmer-than-present climate of the Eemian has thus remained unclear.
   Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling ('NEEM') ice
   core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the strong warming in
   the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from folded ice
   using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and
   Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM
   surface temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago)
   peaked at 8 +/- 4 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium,
   followed by a gradual cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing
   summer insolation. Between 128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness
   of the northwest Greenland ice sheet decreased by 400 +/- 250 metres,
   reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 +/- 300 metres
   lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the NEEM site
   during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again
   at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional
   warming, surface melt might become more common in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Six vinyl-based, imidazolium room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)
   monomers were synthesized and photopolymerized to form dense poly(RTIL)
   membranes. The effect of polymer backbone (i.e., poly(ethylene),
   poly(styrene), and poly(acrylate)) and functional cationic substituent
   (e.g., alkyl, fluoroalkyl, oligo(ethylene glycol), and disiloxane) on
   ideal CO2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 membrane separation performance was
   investigated. The vinyl-based poly(RTIL)s were found to be generally
   less CO2-selective compared to analogous styrene- and acrylate-based
   poly(RTIL)s. The CO2 permeability of n-hexyl-(69 barrers) and
   disiloxane- (130 barrers) substituted vinyl-based poly(RTIL)s were found
   to be exceptionally larger than that of previously studied styrene and
   acrylate poly(RTIL)s. The CO2 selectivity of oligo(ethylene
   glycol)-functionalized vinyl poly(RTIL)s was enhanced, and the CO2
   permeability was reduced when compared to the n-hexyl-substituted
   vinyl-based poly(RTIL). Nominal improvement in CO2/CH4 selectivity was
   observed upon fluorination of the n-hexyl vinyl-based poly(RTIL), with
   no observed change in CO2 permeability. However, rather dramatic
   improvements in both CO2 permeability and selectivity were observed upon
   blending 20 mol \% RTIL (emim Tf2N) into the n-hexyl- and
   disiloxane-functionalized vinyl poly(RTIL)s to form solid liquid
   composite films.}},

Abstract = {{Novel fabrication, detection and analysis approaches were employed to
   experimentally demonstrate scattering reduction by a plasmonic
   nanostructure operating at 1550 nm. The nanostructure consisted of a
   silicon nanorod surrounded by a plasmonic metamaterial cover comprised
   of eight gold nanowires and was fabricated by a combination of electron
   beam lithography, focused ion beam milling and dry and wet etching. The
   optical standing wave pattern of the device in the near-field was
   obtained using heterodyne near-field scanning optical microscopy. It was
   found that the spatial curvature of the interference fringes of the
   optical standing wave pattern was directly related to the scattering
   reduction of the device. The experiments were in excellent agreement
   with the theoretical predictions and suggested that the device reduced
   the scattering by 9.5 dB when compared to a bare silicon nanorod of
   diameter 240 nm and by 6 dB when compared to a bare silicon nanorod of
   diameter 160 nm. (c) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Graphene recently emerged as a new two-dimensional material platform
   with unique optical, thermal and electronic properties. Single-or
   few-atom-thick graphene flakes can potentially be utilized to form
   structured bulk composites that further enrich these properties and
   enable a broad range of new applications. Here we describe optical
   manipulation of self-aligned colloidal graphene flakes in thermotropic
   liquid crystals of nematic and cholesteric types. Three-dimensional
   rotational and translational manipulation of graphene flakes by means of
   holographic optical tweezers allows for non-contact spatial patterning
   of graphene, control of liquid crystal defects, and low-power optical
   realignment of the liquid crystal director using these flakes. Potential
   applications include optically-and electrically-controlled
   reconfigurable liquid crystalline dispersions of spontaneously aligning
   colloidal graphene flakes and new electro-optic devices with
   graphene-based interconnected transparent electrodes at surfaces and in
   the bulk of liquid crystals. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{An Examination of the Generalizability of Motor Costs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Most approaches to understanding human motor control assume that people
   maximize their rewards while minimizing their motor efforts. This
   tradeoff between potential rewards and a sense of effort is quantified
   with a cost function. While the rewards can change across tasks, our
   sense of effort is assumed to remain constant and characterize how the
   nervous system organizes motor control. As such, when a proposed cost
   function compares well with data it is argued to be the underlying cause
   of a motor behavior, and not simply a fit to the data. Implicit in this
   proposition is the assumption that this cost function can then predict
   new motor behaviors. Here we examined this idea and asked whether an
   inferred cost function in one setting could explain subject's behavior
   in settings that differed dynamically but had identical rewards. We
   found that the pattern of behavior observed across settings was similar
   to our predictions of optimal behavior. However, we could not conclude
   that this behavior was consistent with a conserved sense of effort.
   These results suggest that the standard forms for quantifying cost may
   not be sufficient to accurately examine whether or not human motor
   behavior abides by optimality principles.}},

Abstract = {{We study the transverse expansion of arrays of ultracold Rb-87 atoms
   weakly confined in tubes created by a 2D optical lattice and observe
   that transverse expansion is delayed because of mutual atom
   interactions. A mean-field model of a coupled array shows that atoms
   become localized within a roughly square fortlike self-trapping barrier
   with time-evolving edges. But the observed dynamics are poorly described
   by the mean-field model. The theoretical introduction of random phase
   fluctuations among tubes improves the agreement with experiment but does
   not correctly predict the density at which the atoms start to expand
   with larger lattice depths. Our results suggest a new type of
   self-trapping, where quantum correlations suppress tunneling even when
   there are no density gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Smoke, fog, jelly, paints, milk and shaving cream are common everyday
   examples of colloids(1), a type of soft matter consisting of tiny
   particles dispersed in chemically distinct host media. Being abundant in
   nature, colloids also find increasingly important applications in
   science and technology, ranging from direct probing of kinetics in
   crystals and glasses(2) to fabrication of third-generation quantum-dot
   solar cells(3). Because naturally occurring colloids have a shape that
   is typically determined by minimization of interfacial tension (for
   example, during phase separation) or faceted crystal growth(1), their
   surfaces tend to have minimum-area spherical or topologically equivalent
   shapes such as prisms and irregular grains (all continuously
   deformable-homeomorphic-to spheres). Although toroidal DNA condensates
   and vesicles with different numbers of handles can exist(4-7) and soft
   matter defects can be shaped as rings(8) and knots(9), the role of
   particle topology in colloidal systems remains unexplored. Here we
   fabricate and study colloidal particles with different numbers of
   handles and genus g ranging from 1 to 5. When introduced into a nematic
   liquid crystal-a fluid made of rod-like molecules that spontaneously
   align along the so-called `director'(10)-these particles induce
   three-dimensional director fields and topological defects dictated by
   colloidal topology. Whereas electric fields, photothermal melting and
   laser tweezing cause transformations between configurations of
   particle-induced structures, three-dimensional nonlinear optical imaging
   reveals that topological charge is conserved and that the total charge
   of particle-induced defects always obeys predictions of the Gauss-Bonnet
   and Poincare-Hopf index theorems(11-13). This allows us to establish and
   experimentally test the procedure for assignment and summation of
   topological charges in three-dimensional director fields. Our findings
   lay the groundwork for new applications of colloids and liquid crystals
   that range from topological memory devices(14), through new types of
   self-assembly(15-23), to the experimental study of low-dimensional
   topology(6,7,11-13).}},

Title = {{Mechanism of Homogeneous Reduction of CO2 by Pyridine: Proton Relay in
   Aqueous Solvent and Aromatic Stabilization}},

Abstract = {{We employ quantum chemical calculations to investigate the mechanism of
   homogeneous CO2 reduction by pyridine (Py) in the Py/p-GaP system. We
   find that CO2 reduction by Py commences with PyCOOH0 formation where:
   (a) protonated Py (PyH+) is reduced to PyH0, (b) PyH0 then reduces CO2
   by one electron transfer (ET) via nucleophilic attack by its N lone pair
   on the C of CO2, and finally (c) proton transfer (PT) from PyH0 to CO2
   produces PyCOOH0. The predicted enthalpic barrier for this
   proton-coupled ET (PCET) reaction is 45.7 kcal/mol for direct PT from
   PyH0 to CO2. However, when PT is mediated by one to three water
   molecules acting as a proton relay, the barrier decreases to 29.5, 20.4,
   and 18.5 kcal/mol, respectively. The water proton relay reduces strain
   in the transition state (TS) and facilitates more complete ET. For PT
   mediated by a three water molecule proton relay, adding water molecules
   to explicitly solvate the core reaction system reduces the barrier to
   13.6-16.5 kcal/mol, depending on the number and configuration of the
   solvating waters. This agrees with the experimentally determined barrier
   of 16.5 +/- 2.4 kcal/mol. We calculate a pK(a) for PyH0 of 31 indicating
   that PT preceding ET is highly unfavorable. Moreover, we demonstrate
   that ET precedes PT in PyCOOH0 formation, confirming PyH0's pK(a) as
   irrelevant for predicting PT from PyH0 to CO2. Furthermore, we calculate
   adiabatic electron affinities in aqueous solvent for CO2, Py, and Py
   center dot CO2 of 47.4, 37.9, and 66.3 kcal/mol respectively, indicating
   that the anionic complex PyCOO- stabilizes the anionic radicals CO2- and
   Py- to facilitate low barrier ET. As the reduction of CO2 proceeds
   through ET and then PT, the pyridine ring becomes aromatic, and thus Py
   catalyzes CO2 reduction by stabilizing the PCET TS and the PyCOOH0
   product through aromatic resonance stabilization. Our results suggest
   that Py catalyzes the homogeneous reductions of formic acid and
   formaldehyde en route to formation of CH3OH through a series of
   one-electron reductions analogous to the PCET reduction of CO2 examined
   here, where the electrode only acts to reduce PyH+ to PyH0.}},

   Grafted Nanoparticles in a Polymer Matrix}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{We present an integrated theory and simulation study of polydisperse
   polymer grafted nanoparticles in a polymer matrix to demonstrate the
   effect of polydispersity in graft length on the potential of mean force
   between the grafted nanoparticles. In dense polymer solutions,
   increasing polydispersity in graft length reduces the strength of
   repulsion at contact and weakens the attractive well at intermediate
   interparticle distances, completely eliminating the latter at high
   polydispersity index. The reduction in contact repulsion is attributable
   to polydispersity relieving monomer crowding near the particle surface,
   especially at high grafting densities. The elimination of the midrange
   attractive well is attributable to the longer grafts in the polydisperse
   graft length distribution that introduce longer range steric repulsion
   and alter the wetting of the grafted layer by matrix chains. Dispersion
   of the grafted particles is stabilized by increased penetration or
   wetting of the polydisperse grafted layer by the matrix chains. This
   work demonstrates that at high grafting densities, polydispersity in
   graft length can be used to stabilize dispersions of grafted
   nanoparticles in a polymer matrix at conditions where monodisperse
   grafts would cause aggregation. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.018301}},

Abstract = {{GaN-on-SiC technology has been widely used in radiofrequency (RF) power
   amplifiers to achieve high power density at very high frequencies due to
   the enhanced power handling capabilities provided by the SiC substrate
   and very high transition frequencies of GaN High Electron Mobility
   Transistors (HEMTs). Along with other well-known advantages of GaN, such
   as high breakdown voltage and high temperature operation, these
   characteristics make GaN-on-SiC technology suitable for power
   electronics applications.
   This paper explores the use of GaN-on-SiC depletion-mode HEMTs in
   switched-mode power converters, targeting high efficiencies at switching
   frequencies in the tens of Megahertz range. The fundamental limits of
   the technology are analyzed, and design principles and guidelines are
   given to exploit the capabilities of the devices. Results are presented
   for a 10 W, 20 V synchronous Buck converter prototype operating at 10 to
   40 MHz. Measured efficiency peaks above 96\% at 10 MHz and remains above
   90\% over a wide range of operating conditions. To demonstrate the
   applicability of the technology, the Buck converter switching at 20 MHz
   is used as a supply modulator to track a 3 MHz envelope signal with
   greater than 90\% average efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine drivetrains consist of components that directly convert
   kinetic energy from the wind to electrical energy. Therefore,
   guaranteeing robust and reliable drivetrain designs is important to
   minimize turbine downtime. Current drivetrain models often lack the
   ability to model both the impacts of electrical transients as well as
   wind turbulence and shear in one package. In this work, the capability
   of the FAST wind turbine computer-aided engineering tool, developed by
   the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, is enhanced through
   integration of a dynamic model of the drivetrain. The dynamic drivetrain
   model is built using Simscape in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and
   incorporates detailed electrical generator models. This model can be
   used in the future to test advanced control schemes to extend life of
   the gearbox.}},

Abstract = {{Differential power processing (DPP) isolated-port architecture with
   submodule integrated converters (subMICs) enables improved energy
   capture in photovoltaic (PV) power systems. This paper describes a
   control scheme for flyback subMICs operating in discontinuous conduction
   mode (DCM). The duty-cycle is driven in proportion to a voltage error,
   with no further processing, thus eliminating the need to measure or to
   control the current explicitly. The approach is well suited for very
   simple, analog PWM controller implementation, but the resulting control
   loops become nonlinear. The system stability is demonstrated using the
   Lyapunov stability theorem. Experimentally measured module-level
   efficiency is greater than 95\% for a 72-cell PV module having 3
   substrings with solar irradiation of 80\%, 60\% and 40\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Palpating tissues and organs to identify hidden tumors or to detect
   buried vessels is not a viable option in laparoscopic surgery due to
   lack of force feedback. So far, research toward restoring tactile and
   kinesthetic sensations in minimally invasive surgery has focused on the
   distal sensing element or on the proximal rendering of haptic cues. In
   this work we present a pilot study to assess the feasibility of wireless
   tissue palpation, where a magnetic device is deployed through a standard
   surgical trocar and operated to perform tissue palpation without
   requiring a dedicated entry port. The setup consists of a wireless
   intra-body device and an external robotic manipulator holding a load
   cell and a permanent magnet. Embedded in the wireless cylindrical device
   (12.7 mm in diameter and 27.5 mm in height) is a sensing module, a
   wireless microcontroller, a battery and a permanent magnet. This
   preliminary study assessed the precision in reconstructing the
   indentation depth based on magnetic field measurements at the wireless
   device (i.e., 0.1 mm accuracy). Experimental trials demonstrated the
   effectiveness of wireless vertical indentation in detecting the elastic
   modulus of three different silicone tissue simulators (elastic modulus
   ranging from 50 kPa to 93 kPa), showing a maximum relative error below
   3\%. Finally, wireless palpation was used to identify differences in
   tissue stiffness from a lump embedded into a porcine liver. The reported
   results have the potential to open a new paradigm in the field of
   palpation devices, where direct physical connection across the abdominal
   wall is no longer required.}},

   micro-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The design of a four degree

   quantitative evaluation of the mobility method is presented. An
   empirical model for traction force as a function of slip ratio, robot
   speed and robot weight for micro-patterned PDMS on synthetic tissue is
   developed using data collected from the ATM platform. The model is then
   used to predict traction force at different speeds and weights, and is
   verified experimentally. The mean percent error between the empirical
   model and the data used to develop the model is 2.1\% (min 0.051\%, max
   6.5\%). The mean error between the traction force predicted by the model
   and the data used to verify the prediction is 5.9\% (min 0.0035\%, max

Abstract = {{There is widespread interest in the deployment of fleets of marine
   robots with the potential to roam the oceans freely and collect data at
   an unprecedented scale. This calls for the development of efficient
   algorithms for multiple vehicle motion planning that can take directly
   into account the capabilities of each vehicle as well as the
   environmental conditions and lend themselves to seamless integration
   with control and navigation systems. The latter connection is for the
   most part eschewed in the literature, in spite of the obvious fact that
   in order for the vehicles to execute the planned motions they must at a
   later stage navigate with great accuracy and follow the trajectories
   using control algorithms that take explicitly into account the dynamical
   constraints of the vehicles involved. Among the methods available for
   underwater vehicle navigation, terrain-based techniques have recently
   come to the fore. These techniques avoid the use of overly expensive
   inertial-like motion sensor units and hold considerable promise for the
   development of a new breed of affordable long range navigation systems.
   Motivated by these considerations, we tackle in the present paper the
   problem of multiple vehicle motion planning by taking explicitly into
   consideration inter-vehicle collision avoidance, together with a number

Abstract = {{This paper presents a two-stage numerical model for alkali-silica
   reaction (ASR)/stress analysis in concrete. The coupled analytical
   chemo-mechanical model developed by Suwito et al. was modified to
   include the effects of internal moisture and ion concentration on the
   transport properties of concrete. A finite difference model was used to
   simulate the coupled diffusion of alkali into concrete and subsequent
   ASR gel into pores surrounding the aggregates. A finite element model
   was then subsequently used to perform a nonlinear analysis. This model
   is invoked from the master finite difference model, resulting in a
   coupled chemo-mechanical simulation of ASR-affected concrete with
   aggregates of different shapes and sizes. Throughout this analysis, the
   authors keep track of the vertical and lateral expansions of the
   concrete with time which, in turn, are transformed into equivalent
   anisotropic coefficients of ASR expansion. Finally, the accuracy of the
   model is assessed through comparison with simulated laboratory tests.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an observer design for a spacecraft modeled as a rigid body
   in the proximity of an asteroid. The nonlinear observer is constructed
   on the nonlinear state space of motion of a rigid body, which is the
   tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions in
   three-dimensional Euclidean space. The framework of geometric mechanics
   is used for the observer design. States of motion of the spacecraft are
   estimated based on state measurements. In addition, the observer
   designed can also estimate the gravity parameter of the asteroid,
   assuming the asteroid to have a spherically symmetric mass distribution.
   Almost global convergence of state estimates and gravity parameter
   estimate to their corresponding true values is demonstrated
   analytically, and verified numerically.}},

Abstract = {{The modern cloud-based solutions are gaining the upper hand in the most
   common industrial areas. In the healthcare sector, cloud computing is
   starting to set foot on, and the major applications are about the
   possibility to collect and share medical data. One of the hot topics
   argued in the obstetrics and gynecologist community, is related to the
   fetal growth and, in particular, to the necessity to have updated
   standards, since the current references lack information like ethnicity
   and maternal biometric parameters (essential to evaluate the correct
   growing parameters). We believe that cloud computing could help the
   development of such a kind of dynamic and customized fetal growth
   curves, which in turn could improve the possible detection of anomalies
   and pathological states during the whole pregnancy period. The paper
   presents a proposal for resolving the problem of the fetal biometric
   data obsolescence and the inability to use them in a custom or adapted
   fashion giving the opportunity to manage clinical data which are
   dispensed ``as a service{''} on a global scale. The objective of the
   study is to create and validate a database collecting several fetal
   growth curves (obtained by means of the available results beginning from
   1963 until 2013).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a novel reduced-order car model that captures
   some key features for aggressive maneuvering of complex car vehicles.
   The proposed model, called RigidCar, consists of a rigid body
   interacting with the ground at four contact points (two-track car) and
   including tire models and load transfer. The model does not include
   suspension models, thus keeping a reasonable level of complexity. Load
   transfer (both longitudinal and lateral) is taken into account by
   explicitly imposing the holonomic constraints and computing the reaction
   forces of the ground at the four contact points. Since the vehicle
   interacts with the ground at four contact points, it results to be a
   hyper-static structure so that reaction forces are not uniquely
   determined. We use the Principle of Least Work to get a compatibility
   equation and thus resolving the indeterminateness. We provide numerical
   computations validating the proposed model with respect to a multi-body
   virtual prototype on an aggressive ISO lane-change maneuver.}},

Abstract = {{Isolating fault variables is a crucial step to provide the information
   that which variables are responsible for the fault for diagnosing the
   root causes of a process fault. In chemical processes, process faults
   rarely show a random behavior; on the contrary, they will be propagated
   to varying variables due to the actions of the process controllers.
   During the evolution of a fault, the task of isolating faulty variables
   needs to be concerned with the faulty variables decided in the previous
   data; in addition, the current decisions should influence the isolation
   results for the next sample when the fault is constantly occurring. In
   the presented work, an unsupervised data-driven fault isolation method
   was developed based on Bayesian decision theory. The proposed approach
   successfully located the faulty variables that were individually
   responsible for the simultaneous occurrence of multiple sensor faults
   and a process fault.}},

Abstract = {{An improved clause generalization procedure for IC3 is presented.
   Whereas standard generalization extracts a relatively inductive clause
   from a single state, called a counterexample to induction (CTI), the new
   procedure also extracts such clauses from other states, called
   counterexamples to generalization (CTG), that interfere with the primary
   generalization attempt. The motivation is to enable IC3 to explore
   states farther from the error states than are CTIs while remaining
   property-focused. CTGs are strong candidates for being farther but still
   backward reachable. Significant reductions in the maximum depth reached
   by IC3's priority queue-directed explicit backward search indicate that
   this intention is achieved in practice. The effectiveness of the new
   procedure is established in two independent implementations of IC3,
   which demonstrate an increase of 17 and 27, respectively, in the number
   of solved HWMCC benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the paucity of high-power sources along with strong
   electromagnetic absorption by water vapor at frequencies between similar
   to 100 GHz and similar to 10 THz, there are very few radar systems
   operating in the terahertz range of the spectrum. Source technology,
   however, is improving, thus facilitating radar systems operating in this
   gap. The Near-Millimeter Wave (NMMW) range typically refers to
   frequencies from 100 to 1000 GHz, or, wavelengths straddling the
   transition from millimeter to sub-millimeter (3 mm to 300 mu m). At the
   lower end of this range where components are more readily available and
   atmospheric attenuation is moderate an interferometric radar system for
   imaging surfaces up to several hundred meters has been designed and is
   being built. By scanning a fan beam and receiving at two displaced
   locations, three dimensional images of the surface topography (in range,
   azimuth and height) can be generated. This paper describes the design
   considerations for this radar and the prototype system.}},

Abstract = {{Despite an increasing focus on school-based water, sanitation and
   hygiene (WASH) interventions in less-developed countries, we lack an
   understanding of what combinations of conditions are sufficient for
   their continued maintenance post-implementation. We use a novel method,
   qualitative comparative analysis, to determine what pathways lead to
   well-maintained school toilets, as an indicator of continued maintenance
   of WASH services. Results from 15 case schools in Belize reveal five
   pathways to well-maintained school sanitation, and three pathways to
   poorly maintained services. Common conditions in the pathways to
   well-maintained toilets include local involvement upfront, quality
   construction, and the presence of a local champion; while conditions
   common in the pathways to poorly maintained toilets include the absence
   of the aforementioned conditions, in addition to vandalism and a lack of
   community support for maintenance. The familiarity of the technology is
   as common in the pathways to well-maintained toilets as poorly
   maintained toilets, suggesting that though technology choice is
   important, quality construction and social conditions may have a
   stronger influence on maintenance. Qualitative information is presented
   to support further discussion of the six conditions, including factors
   linked to their presence that may support improvements in Belize and
   have implications for school WASH services in other low-income}},

Abstract = {{With the growing demands for additional and diverse engineers, the
   atypical gender balance experienced by Engineers Without Borders-USA
   (EWB-USA) is a unique engineering education research setting. Exploring
   the gender balance of this organization could assist the field's efforts
   in better recruiting and retaining female engineers. In this
   work-in-progress study, a social cognitive career theory framework is
   used to explore the engineering outcome expectations of engineers both
   involved and not involved with the organization. Qualitative methods
   were used to gather outcome expectations of male, female, professional,
   and student engineers, and initial case-based and thematic coding was
   performed. Preliminary results suggest that EWB-USA members have unique
   engineering outcome expectations that are often influenced by their
   organizational involvement. This study may identify ways in which the
   larger engineering field can replicate similar alternative expectations,
   particularly to aid the recruitment and retention of a more gender
   balanced engineering population.}},

Abstract = {{Dictionary learning algorithms design a dictionary that is specifically
   tailored to enable sparse representation of a given set of training
   signals. In turn, the increased sparsity of the signals with respect to
   this dictionary enables significantly improved performance in a variety
   of state-of-the-art signal processing tasks, e. g. compressive sensing.
   However, while these algorithms typically assume that all training data
   is fully available, this may not be the case in practice. In fact, the
   high cost of acquiring each signal or the sheer amount of data to be
   acquired may motivate us to take a compressive sensing (CS) approach,
   taking only a few CS measurements of each signal. In this paper, we
   present a novel algorithm for learning a dictionary on a set of training
   signals using only compressive sensing measurements of them. Our
   proposed algorithm is a generalization of the well-known K-SVD algorithm
   and preserves its convergence properties. Experimental results on
   synthetically generated data verify that our proposed algorithm can
   recover the generating dictionary atoms from CS measurements alone (so
   long as enough measurements of enough training signals are available),
   even for the case of noisy measurements. Finally, we show that
   compressive K-SVD (CK-SVD) can also be used to aid in signal
   reconstruction and compressive classification on the CS measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Solving inverse problems in signal processing often involves making
   prior assumptions about the signal being reconstructed. Here the
   appropriateness of the chosen model greatly determines the quality of
   the final result. Recently it has been proposed to model images by
   representing them as sets of smaller patches arising from an underlying
   manifold. This model has been shown to be surprisingly effective in
   tasks such as denoising, inpainting, and superresolution. However, such
   a representation is fraught with the difficulty of finding the
   intersection of many presumably non-linear manifolds in high-dimensional
   space, which precludes much of its potential use. This paper proposes an
   efficient method of solving this problem using a kernel methods variant
   of the projection onto convex sets algorithm to quickly find the
   intersection of many manifolds while learning their non-linear
   structure. Indeed the final solution can even be expressed in closed
   form. We foresee our method allowing a patch-based regularization to be
   applied across a wide variety of inverse problems, including compressive
   sensing, inpainting, deconvolution, etc. Indeed, as a proof of concept
   of our approach, we show how it can be employed in the regularization of
   an image denoising problem. Here, it even outperforms a state-of-the-art
   denoising technique, non-local means.}},

Abstract = {{Culturing mammalian neurons in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments
   that more closely recapitulate critical biochemical and biophysical
   aspects of the developing or adult central nervous system (CNS) milieu
   remains a significant challenge in neurobiological studies and in
   regenerative medicine. Here, we aimed to exploit recent advances in
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel chemistries to define a synthetic
   niche capable of supporting the culture and axonal outgrowth of both
   aggregated and dissociated mouse embryonic stem cell-derived motor
   neurons (ESMNs). Using thiol-ene click chemistry to create peptide
   crosslinked PEG hydrogels, we identified a hydrogel formulation that
   promotes neuronal survival and axon outgrowth through cell-extracellular
   matrix interactions, such as those between the laminin-derived peptide
   YIGSR and its integrin, and that allows neurons to remodel their
   extracellular environment through matrix metalloproteinase
   (MMP)-mediated polymer network degradation. Our results demonstrate a 3D
   platform for culture of both aggregated and single mammalian motor nerve
   cells that not only permits cell survival over more than a week of
   culture, but also allows for the robust extension of motor axons. In
   addition, the optical transparency of the hydrogel allows simultaneous
   imaging of live cell functions, and as such, this material system should
   prove useful for studying fundamental aspects of neuronal development.}},

Abstract = {{In situ measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O-3) at the Pico
   Mountain Observatory (PMO) located in the Azores, Portugal, are analyzed
   together with results from an atmospheric chemical transport model
   (GEOS-Chem) and satellite remote sensing data (AIRS (Atmospheric
   Infrared Sounder) for CO, and TES (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer)
   for O-3) to examine the evolution of free-troposphere CO and O-3 over
   the North Atlantic for 2001-2011. GEOS-Chem captured the seasonal cycles
   for CO and O-3 well but significantly underestimated the mixing ratios
   of CO, particularly in spring. Statistically significant (using a
   significance level of 0.05) decreasing trends were found for both CO and
   O-3 based on harmonic regression analysis of the measurement data. The
   best estimates of the possible trends for CO and O-3 measurements are
   -0.31 +/- 0.30 (2-sigma) ppbv yr(-1) and -0.21 +/- 0.11 (2-sigma) ppbv
   yr(-1), respectively. Similar decreasing trends for both species were
   obtained with GEOS-Chem simulation results. The most important factor
   contributing to the decreases in CO and O-3 at PMO over the past decade
   is the decline in anthropogenic emissions from North America, which more
   than compensate for the impacts from increasing Asian emissions. It is
   likely that climate change in the past decade has also affected the
   intercontinental transport of O-3.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of optimizing controls for high-performance buildings to
   achieve energy savings while maintaining or improving occupant comfort,
   this study is aimed at finding incremental improvements in the existing
   control logic for an existing building. Through the use of parametric
   studies with a building energy simulation model that incorporates a
   stochastic model of occupant window use and automatic window control
   logic commensurate with the physical building, the performance of
   different natural ventilation control strategies is evaluated. Due to
   the inclusion of stochastic occupant behavior in the building model,
   results of simulations are presented as a distribution of potential
   outcomes, rather than a scalar value; however, the average of these
   distributions is used for simpler comparison between control strategies.
   The results show that annual HVAC electricity consumption can be reduced
   by 3\% to 15\%, depending upon the controls changes implemented.}},

Abstract = {{The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was originally
   designed for calculating long-range and mesoscale dispersion of air
   pollutants from point sources, such that occurring after an accident in
   a nuclear power plant. In the meantime, FLEXPART has evolved into a
   comprehensive tool for atmospheric transport modeling and analysis at
   different scales. A need for further multiscale modeling and analysis
   has encouraged new developments in FLEXPART. In this paper, we present a
   FLEXPART version that works with the Weather Research and Forecasting
   (WRF) mesoscale meteorological model. We explain how to run this new
   model and present special options and features that differ from those of
   the preceding versions. For instance, a novel turbulence scheme for the
   convective boundary layer has been included that considers both the
   skewness of turbulence in the vertical velocity as well as the vertical
   gradient in the air density. To our knowledge, FLEXPART is the first
   model for which such a scheme has been developed. On a more technical
   level, FLEXPART-WRF now offers effective parallelization, and details on
   computational performance are presented here. FLEXPART-WRF output can
   either be in binary or Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format, both of
   which have efficient data compression. In addition, test case data and
   the source code are provided to the reader as a Supplement. This
   material and future developments will be accessible at
   http://www.flexpart.eu.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) have become an integral tool for
   extrapolating local observations and understanding of land-atmosphere
   carbon exchange to larger regions. The North American Carbon Program
   (NACP) Multi-scale synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison
   Project (MsTMIP) is a formal model intercomparison and evaluation effort
   focused on improving the diagnosis and attribution of carbon exchange at
   regional and global scales. MsTMIP builds upon current and past
   synthesis activities, and has a unique framework designed to isolate,
   interpret, and inform understanding of how model structural differences
   impact estimates of carbon uptake and release. Here we provide an
   overview of the MsTMIP effort and describe how the MsTMIP experimental
   design enables the assessment and quantification of TBM structural
   uncertainty. Model structure refers to the types of processes considered
   (e.g., nutrient cycling, disturbance, lateral transport of carbon), and
   how these processes are represented (e.g., photosynthetic formulation,
   temperature sensitivity, respiration) in the models. By prescribing a
   common experimental protocol with standard spin-up procedures and driver
   data sets, we isolate any biases and variability in TBM estimates of
   regional and global carbon budgets resulting from differences in the
   models themselves (i.e., model structure) and model-specific parameter
   values. An initial intercomparison of model structural differences is
   represented using hierarchical cluster diagrams (a.k.a. dendrograms),
   which highlight similarities and differences in how models account for
   carbon cycle, vegetation, energy, and nitrogen cycle dynamics. We show
   that, despite the standardized protocol used to derive initial
   conditions, models show a high degree of variation for GPP, total living
   biomass, and total soil carbon, underscoring the influence of
   differences in model structure and parameterization on model estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate holographic optical trapping combined with
   step-and-repeat maskless projection stereolithography for fine control
   of 3D position of living cells within a 3D microstructured hydrogel.
   C2C12 myoblast cells were chosen as a demonstration platform because
   their development into multinucleated myotubes requires linear
   arrangements of myoblasts. C2C12 cells are positioned in the monomer
   solution with multiple optical traps at 1064 nm and then are
   encapsulated by photopolymerization of monomer via projection of a
   512x512 spatial light modulator (SLM) illuminated at 405 nm. High 405 nm
   sensitivity and complete insensitivity to 1064 nm is enabled by a
   lithium acylphosphinate LAP) salt photoinitiator. Use of a polyethylene
   glycol dimethacrylate PEGDMA) based monomer is compared to that of
   polyethylene glycol PEG) hydrogels formed by thiol-ene photo-click
   chemistry for patterning structures with cellular resolution, and for
   maintaining cell viability. Cells patterned in thiol-ene with RGD are
   shown to retain viability up to 4 days after the trapping and
   encapsulation procedure. Further, cells patterned in thiol-ene with RGD
   and a degradable ester link, are shown to fuse, indicating the initial
   stages of development of multi-nucleated cells.}},

Abstract = {{We study a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) cellular system where
   each base-station (BS) is equipped with a large antenna array and serves
   some single antenna mobile stations (MSs). With the same setup as in
   {[}1], the influence of orthogonal and non-orthogonal pilot sequences on
   the system performance is analytically characterized when each BS has
   infinitely many antennas. Using stochastic geometric modeling of the BS
   and MS locations, closed-form expressions are derived for the
   distribution of signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) for both uplink and
   downlink. Moreover, they are shown to be equivalent for the orthogonal
   pilots case. Further, it is shown that the downlink SIR is greatly
   influenced by the correlations between the pilot sequences in the
   non-orthogonal pilots case. Finally, the mathematical tools can be used
   to study system performances with other general channel estimation
   methods and transmission-reception schemes.}},

Title = {{Assessing remote polarimetric measurement sensitivities to aerosol
   emissions using the geos-chem adjoint model}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},

Pages = {{3441-3457}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainties in aerosol sources, microphysical properties, and global
   distributions undermine efforts to evaluate the radiative impacts of
   atmospheric aerosols. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of
   using remote polarimetric measurements for constraining aerosol and
   aerosol precursor emissions in light of these uncertainties. A model
   that incorporates a radiative transfer model with forward and adjoint
   chemical transport models has been applied to quantify the sensitivity
   of the reflectance at the top of atmosphere over land to aerosol
   emissions and microphysical properties. A set of simulated satellite
   observations, one intensity based and one capable of polarimetric
   measurements, are used to illustrate differences in the assimilation
   potential between the two. It is found that the sensitivity of the
   polarized reflectance to aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions tends
   to be significantly higher than that of the intensity for cases of
   non-absorbing aerosols. This is true even when the polarimetric sampling
   scheme is spatially sparser than that of the intensity sampling. This
   framework allows us to quantify upper limits on the uncertainties in the
   aerosol microphysical properties for which a 50\% change in aerosol
   emissions is detectable using these simulated observations. It was found
   that although typical current remote sensing instrumentation provides
   retrievals of the refractive index and effective radius with accuracies
   within acceptable limits to detect a 50\% change in emissions,
   retrievals of the effective variance contain uncertainties too large to
   detect these changes in emissions. These results may guide new
   applications of polarimetric measurements to constrain aerosol sources,
   and thus reduce uncertainty in our broader understanding of the impacts
   of aerosols on climate.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the agreement between measurements and models of net
   ecosystem exchange at different times and timescales using wavelet

   Site-Level Interim Synthesis}},

Abstract = {{Earth system processes exhibit complex patterns across time, as do the
   models that seek to replicate these processes. Model output may or may
   not be significantly related to observations at different times and on
   different frequencies. Conventional model diagnostics provide an
   aggregate view of model-data agreement, but usually do not identify the
   time and frequency patterns of model-data disagreement, leaving unclear
   the steps required to improve model response to environmental drivers
   that vary on characteristic frequencies. Wavelet coherence can quantify
   the times and timescales at which two time series, for example time
   series of models and measurements, are significantly different. We
   applied wavelet coherence to interpret the predictions of 20 ecosystem
   models from the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Interim
   Synthesis when confronted with eddy-covariance-measured net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE) from 10 ecosystems with multiple years of available data.
   Models were grouped into classes with similar approaches for
   incorporating phenology, the calculation of NEE, the inclusion of foliar
   nitrogen (N), and the use of model-data fusion. Models with prescribed,
   rather than prognostic, phenology often fit NEE observations better on
   annual to interannual timescales in grassland, wetland and agricultural
   ecosystems. Models that calculated NEE as net primary productivity (NPP)
   minus heterotrophic respiration (HR) rather than gross ecosystem
   productivity (GPP) minus ecosystem respiration (ER) fit better on annual
   timescales in grassland and wetland ecosystems, but models that
   calculated NEE as GPP minus ER were superior on monthly to seasonal
   timescales in two coniferous forests. Models that incorporated foliar
   nitrogen (N) data were successful at capturing NEE variability on
   interannual (multiple year) timescales at Howland Forest, Maine. The
   model that employed a model-data fusion approach often, but not always,
   resulted in improved fit to data, suggesting that improving model
   parameterization is important but not the only step for improving model
   performance. Combined with previous findings, our results suggest that
   the mechanisms driving daily and annual NEE variability tend to be
   correctly simulated, but the magnitude of these fluxes is often
   erroneous, suggesting that model parameterization must be improved. Few
   NACP models correctly predicted fluxes on seasonal and interannual
   timescales where spectral energy in NEE observations tends to be low,
   but where phenological events, multi-year oscillations in climatological
   drivers, and ecosystem succession are known to be important for
   determining ecosystem function. Mechanistic improvements to models must
   be made to replicate observed NEE variability on seasonal and
   interannual timescales.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a concurrent adaptive multiscale methodology in
   which both macroscopic and microscopic deformation fields strongly
   interact. The method is based on the balance between numerical and
   homogenization error; while the first type of error states that the
   element's should be refined in regions of high deformation gradients,
   the second implies that elements size may not be smaller than a
   threshold determined by the size of the representative volume element
   (RVE). In this context, we introduce a multiscale method in which RVEs
   can be embedded in the continuum region through appropriate macro-micro
   boundary coupling conditions. By combining the idea of adaptive
   refinement with the embedded RVE method, the methodology ensures that
   appropriate descriptions of the material are used adequately, regardless
   of the severity of deformations. We show that this method, in
   conjunction with the extended finite element method, is ideal to study
   the strong interactions between a crack and the microstructure of
   heterogeneous media. In particular, the method enables an explicit
   description of microstructural features near the crack tip, while a
   computationally inexpensive coarse scale continuum description is used
   in the rest of the domain. We illustrate the method with several
   examples showing its accuracy and relatively low computational cost and
   discuss its potential in relating microstructure to the fracture
   toughness of a diversity of heterogeneous media.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown the potential for reduction in wind turbine
   generator speed error and structural loads with the introduction of
   feedforward control using preview LIDAR measurements. Several sources of
   error exist in the estimation of the wind speeds that will interact with
   the turbine rotor, including LIDAR distortion and coherence loss due to
   wind evolution. If a feedforward controller is designed assuming perfect
   wind speed measurements, however, the error in the disturbance estimate
   may cause feedforward control to increase output errors. Here we derive
   the minimum mean square error feedforward controller for imperfect
   measurements using statistical descriptions of the wind. We show that
   the resulting controller is the ideal feedforward controller, assuming
   perfect measurements, in series with a Wiener prefilter to reduce the
   mean square error of the disturbance estimate. We derive the optimal
   filter in the frequency domain assuming infinite preview as well as the
   optimal filter in the time domain with preview time constraints.
   Examples illustrating the error reduction with optimal prefiltering are
   provided for simulated control and measurement scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results of closed-loop de-icing are presented using
   distributed optical ice sensors, temperature sensors, and resistive
   heaters on a stationary turbine blade part at a fixed pitch angle inside
   a custom icing chamber. Optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) is
   used for direct detection of ice on the blade. Distributed temperature
   sensors mounted at the leading edge of the blade are used for input to
   the closed-loop controller. Each resistive heater is surrounded by
   optical ice sensors which are used to inform a heater on/off decision.
   Scaling up, the experiments show that using combined OFDR with
   temperature sensing and distributed PID control uses a total power
   expenditure of less than 0.5\% of the rated power under light/medium
   icing conditions; de-icing could yield a larger percentage of power
   improvement and a longer turbine up-time in cold regions. The power
   consumption for this localized heating is only about 10\% of uniformly
   heating the blade. Furthermore, de-icing performance of high-intensity
   pulsed actuation versus continuous low intensity actuation is
   investigated. The results show that using high intensity pulse amplitude
   modulation (PAM) actuation achieves better de-icing performance than
   continuous PID control.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine control is typically feedback only, relying on measurements
   from a generator-speed sensor, and sometimes strain gauges and
   accelerometers. Recently, lidar and other technologies that provide a
   preview measurement of the incoming wind speed are also becoming
   available. This raises a question: How much benefit do these preview
   measurements provide?
   In this paper, we focus on answering this question for wind turbine
   collective blade pitch control in above-rated wind speeds, with the
   objective of minimizing a cost function that includes both
   generator-speed error and blade pitch actuation. We assume the
   International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Kaimal wind spectrum and
   the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) S-MW turbine model,
   linearized at various operating points (wind speeds). We then use H-2
   synthesis to design an optimal combined feedforward/feedback controller
   that depends on both the amount of preview time available in the wind
   speed measurement, and the coherence between the wind measurement and
   the wind that is actually felt by the turbine. Finally, we show how the
   resulting closed-loop cost decreases as a function of measurement
   quality (coherence bandwidth) and preview time. We include the special
   case where measurement coherence equals zero, which is equivalent to no
   feedforward (feedback-only) control. Results show the benefit of wind
   turbine preview control as a function of measurement coherence and
   preview time.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of mild traumatic brain injuries (mBTI's) occur in US football

   are an attempt to address this problem. Of interest is whether an active
   helmet design, employing feedback, can also reduce the indicidence of
   mBTI's in football. Medical evidence and research suggests that peak
   center of gravity (CG) head acceleration is well correlated with onset
   and severity of mBTI. In this paper, an active helmet design is
   introduced, modeled, and explored from the perspective of using control
   to reduce maximum CG head acceleration during a typical football impact.}},

Abstract = {{Wind penetration levels have increased dramatically in recent years.
   This has motivated the need for wind turbines and wind plants to provide
   grid frequency regulation services. Wind turbines do not inherently
   provide frequency regulation services in the same manner as conventional
   synchronous generators because modern wind turbines are decoupled from
   the grid via their power electronics. Consequently, active power control
   (APC) must be performed to allow wind turbines to participate in grid
   frequency regulation.
   In this paper, we consider a wind turbine APC system, which uses a
   generator torque controller to operate in a derated manner, allowing the
   turbine to maintain overhead power. Derated operation is achieved by
   operating the turbine at a higher-than-optimal tip-speed ratio. We show
   the stability of the APC torque controller and the asymptotic stability
   of the derated operating points for a constant input. Further, the
   control system is shown to be input-to-state stable for time-varying
   inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Control systems for wind turbines have become an active area of research
   over the past decade as the wind industry has grown and more turbines
   are installed. Properly sited turbines experience many transitions
   between below rated operation, where the goal is to extract maximum
   energy from the wind, and rated speed operation, where the goal is to
   regulate the power capture to the rated power of the turbine. Many of
   the largest structural loads are induced during the transition between
   these operating regions.
   This paper focuses on using preview wind speed measurements to schedule,
   optimize, and track a desired trajectory of the wind turbine states and
   inputs during region transitions between below-rated and above-rated
   operation. The goal of this control system is to reduce the structural
   loading on the turbine components through smoother region transitions.
   The wind speed preview measurements are used to generate an initial
   desired trajectory of the turbine. This trajectory is optimized by
   finding a regulation trajectory that lies on the turbine trajectory
   manifold which is close to the desired trajectory in a weighted L-2
   sense. The regulation trajectory is then used as a reference for a
   time-varying linear quadratic optimal controller.}},

Abstract = {{As wind turbines become larger and more flexible, the potential benefits
   of load mitigating control systems become more important to reduce
   fatigue and extend component life. In the last five years, there has
   been significant research activity exploring the effectiveness of
   preview control techniques that may be feasible using advanced wind
   measurement technologies like LIDAR (light detection and ranging).
   However, most control development tools use Taylor's frozen turbulence
   hypothesis. The end result is that preview measurements made up-stream
   from the rotor can be obtained with unrealistic accuracy, because the
   same wind velocities eventually arrive at the turbine. In this study, we
   extend the spectral methods commonly used to generate turbulent wind
   fields for controls simulation, but in a way that emulates wind
   evolution. This changes preview measurements made upwind from the rotor,
   in such a way that the differences- between the preview measurements and
   speeds arriving at the turbine- increase with distance from the rotor.
   We then evaluate the degradation in load mitigation performance of a
   controller that uses preview measurements obtained at various distances
   in front of the rotor.}},

Abstract = {{Adding feedforward controllers to feedback-only control systems can
   often improve the transient response performance. In the literature
   several architectures have been proposed, which combine feedback and
   feedforward controls together, such as Feedforward Closed-Loop Inverse
   (FFCLI) and Feedforward Plant Inverse (FFPI). In this paper, we
   investigate discrete-time feedforward control designs and show how some
   designs lead to large intersample ripple in the response of the
   continuous-time plant that is being controlled. If the feedforward
   controller cancels high frequency zeros with small damping factors in
   the discretized plant, large intersample ripple can result. Ignoring
   such zeros in the feedforward controller will suppress intersample
   ripple significantly, while slightly slowing the response. In this work,
   this phenomenon is demonstrated with a second-order plant and a
   fourth-order Torsional Disk System (TDS) plant.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing track densities on tape is a critical step to improve the
   areal storage capacity and the data transfer rate of tape storage
   technology. The tape industry envisions increasing track densities from
   5,000 tracks per inch (TPI) to more than 50,000 TPI in the next decade.
   The higher track densities reduce the track pitch significantly and
   require the tape head servo system to position the read/write head
   assembly more precisely. While tape transports longitudinally, the tape
   moves in the lateral direction as well and this motion causes
   displacements between the head and the desired track. In order to
   improve the performance of the head positioning servo system to meet the
   requirements of higher track densities, the disturbance due to the
   lateral tape motion (LTM) has to be addressed.
   This paper applies H-2 model matching methods to find an optimal
   feedforward controller that minimizes the norm of the transfer function
   from the disturbance to the position error. The existence of a
   non-trivial solution to the model matching problem is discussed,
   considering the dynamics of the plant and the disturbance. To constrain
   the size of the feedforward input to the tape head actuator, the H-2
   model matching problem is augmented to minimize the variance of the
   position error and the size of a weighted norm on the feedforward
   control simultaneously. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the feedforward control, provided a solution
   exists.}},

Abstract = {{Since LiMn2O4 spinel materials are inexpensive,
   environmentally-friendly, and safe, they are considered a promising
   cathode candidate for lithium ion batteries in EVs to replace
   commercialized materials such as LiCoO2, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 and
   LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2. However, LiMn2O4 spinel electrodes severely degrade
   at high temperature due to Mn dissolution. Also, the dissolved Mn2+ ions
   causes self-discharge where reduction of Mn2+ ions into Mn metals occurs
   on a graphite anode surface accompanied by oxidation of lithiated
   graphite at a charged state, and this results in severe capacity fading
   at high temperature. In this study, ion-exchangeable binders and a
   separator having functional groups of sodium carboxylate or sulfonate
   are, for the first time, examined to solve the Mn dissolution problem of
   LiMn2O4 spinel materials at high temperature. Ion exchange between Na+
   ions of the functional groups of the binders and the separator and
   dissolved Mn2+ ions of the LiMn2O4 electrodes inhibits self-discharge,
   resulting in improved cycle performance. This result is supported by the
   IR spectra of the binders, an ICP analysis of the electrolytes, and ex
   situ XRD patterns of lithiated graphite electrodes. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) is an effective approach
   for rejecting radio frequency interference. Conventionally, the
   dedicated CRPA antenna and hardware are usually precisely manufactured
   and calibrated carefully. The computational/processing requirement is
   always a major challenge for implementing a CRPA receiver. Even more
   demanding would be to incorporate the flexibility of the
   Software-Defined Radio (SDR) design philosophy in such an
   implementation. The Stanford University (SU) CRPA receiver development
   tackles these challenges to try to demonstrate the feasibility of a low
   cost commercial implementation by leveraging a SDR using Commercial
   Off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.
   This paper will discuss our real-time implementation of a COTS CRPA
   software receiver, its performance under numerous jamming conditions,
   and the lessons learned from these various trials. The developed CRPA
   receiver was tested in the live-jamming exercises in the US and Sweden.
   The scenarios include 1) dynamic jammers 2) static/multiple jammers in
   the various locations 3) different jammer types. This paper shows the
   test results including the C/No improvement. From these results, we can
   see the benefit of our implementation compared to a commercial receiver.
   We also ``replay{''} the signal from the collected data sets. With this
   replay functionality, the signal from a single antenna and the composite
   signals by MVDR/power minimization algorithms are transmitted to
   commercial high-sensitivity GPS receiver. The replay results give us a
   true comparison between different algorithms/platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Determining an appropriate delivery method for highway projects is a
   complex process. This paper presents a decision support approach to
   assist highway agencies in evaluating and selecting the most suitable
   delivery method for their projects. The approach uses a matrix to
   consider three fundamental delivery methods currently in use by the
   highway industry: design bid build, design build, and construction
   manager general contractor. The approach, which is in use by the
   Colorado Department of Transportation (DOT), includes four primary
   selection factors (delivery schedule, complexity and innovation, level
   of design, and initial project risk assessment) and four secondary
   selection factors (cost, staff experience and availability, level of
   oversight and control, and competition and contractor experience) in the
   delivery decision. These eight selection factors, along with
   opportunities and challenges for each delivery method, were identified
   through a literature search and were tested by discussions and workshops
   with innovative contracting leaders from the Colorado DOT, FHWA, the
   American Council of Engineering Companies, Associated General
   Contractors of America, and the University of Colorado. The approach
   enables an initial risk assessment to occur early in the project
   development process and before the project delivery decision. The
   project delivery selection matrix promotes a better understanding of
   project goals, risks, and opportunities and enhances alignment among
   project participants. The approach has been successfully tested and
   implemented through eight projects of varying scope throughout Colorado.
   This paper presents the project delivery selection matrix along with an
   illustrative case study to demonstrate the results. The research
   provides a defensible and repeatable process for highway agencies to
   select an appropriate delivery method for their projects.}},

Title = {{Project Quality Assurance Organization Selection for Highway Design and

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2347}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Abstract = {{The assignment of project quality roles and responsibilities in the
   highway industry makes up a project quality assurance organization
   (QAO). Historically, all project quality roles and responsibilities have
   been assigned to the state highway agency (SHA), an accepted and
   well-understood practice in the industry. However, increasing use of
   alternative project delivery methods and reductions in SHA staffing are
   having an impact on traditional QAO practices. In response, SHAs are
   increasingly selecting QAOs in an informal manner because of time
   constraints, limited staff knowledge and experience, and a lack of
   guidance from the research community. Most highway quality research
   focuses on inspections, observations, corporate quality, warranties, and
   materials testing, with a resulting gap in the research about shifts in
   roles and responsibilities in project QAOs. This research attempts to
   bridge this gap by investigating and identifying fundamental QAOs in the
   industry, identifying factors that influence the selection of QAOs,
   exploring relationships between QAOs and selection factors, and
   presenting a systematic process to assist SHAs in selecting QAOs. The
   process presented in this paper provides a consistent, efficient,
   justifiable, and defensible approach for selecting project QAOs. The QAO
   selection process also provides SHAs with opportunities for identifying,
   discussing, and understanding potential impacts of different QAOs on
   different projects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overview of a system for wireless far-field
   powering of unattended distributed wireless sensors, including the power
   reception device design and optimization, power transmission, power
   management and control. Design and measured data of implementations of
   the various parts of the system in the 2GHz cellular and 2.45GHz
   unlicensed bands will be shown. A design methodology for antennas
   integrated with rectifiers (rectennas) optimized for efficiency at low
   incident power levels (5-100uW/cm(2)) will be presented. Integration of
   rectenna elements and arrays with the electronic application (wireless
   sensing in this case) requires power management, and some approaches
   that consume very low power levels will be presented. Possible
   applications such as sensors for comfort, performance and security of
   commercial and residential buildings will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for wireless powering of multiple
   electronic devices placed in an over-moded 2.2-GHz shielded microwave
   cavity using watt-level high-efficiency sources. Two transmitters based
   on a 77\% efficient pHEMT PA to feed the cavity incoherently via
   strategically placed microstrip probes. The field patterns inside the
   cavity result from multiple excited modes ensuring a relatively uniform
   power density. Narrowband frequency modulation of the sources further
   improves uniformity. Each electronic device contains a rectenna, power
   management circuitry, and a rechargeable battery. A microcontroller
   performs power management and the available battery power is monitored
   using a low-power 900-MHz transceiver and communicated through a
   separate monopole probe and displayed external to the cavity. The
   approach is scalable in terms of power level, field profile, number of
   devices and overall size. Applications include personal electronics,
   powering of toys and powering of products in storage crates.}},

   Hypertension: A Computational Study with Validation Using Animal Models}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{We develop a simple computational model based on measurements from a
   hypoxic neonatal calf model of pulmonary hypertension (PH) to
   investigate the interplay between vascular and ventricular measures in
   the setting of progressive PH. Model parameters were obtained directly
   from in vivo and ex vivo measurements of neonatal calves. Seventeen sets
   of model-predicted impedance and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)
   show good agreement with the animal measurements, thereby validating the
   model. Next, we considered a predictive model in which three parameters,
   PVR, elastic modulus (EM), and arterial thickness, were varied singly
   from one simulation to the next to study their individual roles in PH
   progression. Finally, we used the model to predict the individual
   impacts of clinical (vasodilatory) and theoretical (compliance
   increasing) PH treatments on improving pulmonary hemodynamics. Our model
   (1) displayed excellent patient-specific agreement with measured global
   pulmonary parameters; (2) quantified relationships between PVR and mean
   pressure and PVS and pulse pressure, as well as studiying the right
   ventricular (RV) afterload, which could be measured as a hydraulic load
   calculated from spectral analysis of pulmonary artery pressure and flow
   waves; (3) qualitatively confirmed the derangement of vascular wall
   shear stress in progressive PH; and (4) established that decreasing
   proximal vascular stiffness through a theoretical treatment of reversing
   proximal vascular remodeling could decrease RV afterload.}},

   Household On-Site Wastewater Treatment Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{On-site sanitation systems experience a high failure rate with resulting
   environmental and public health implications. In the United States
   alone, the EPA estimates that 10\% of the 26million homes served by
   on-site systems have failed. If this failure rate is extrapolated to the
   8\% of the global population that the UN estimates have gained access to
   sanitation between 1990 and 2008, an additional 5million failed systems
   have been constructed. To address issues like this, development theory
   currently emphasizes a blend of hardware (e.g.,infrastructure,
   technology) and software (e.g.,knowledge, institutions, education) in an
   effort to achieve sustainable development. However, there is a lack of
   both theory that addresses this interaction and a definition of
   sustainable infrastructure. To begin to address this gap, an initial set
   of 40 factors that may contribute to sustainable on-site sanitation
   systems was identified from a literature review including the Web of
   Science, the Engineering Village, and the full record of ASCE from 2000
   to July 2011. A panel of 14 experts including academics, regulators,
   international development practitioners, operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) providers, and manufacturer/designers was then assembled to
   identify any additional factors that may lead to resilient on-site
   systems and to evaluate each one using the Delphi method. The panel
   evaluated each factor iteratively to develop a measure of its importance
   to the sustainability of on-site sanitation infrastructure. Experts were
   also invited to provide and review comments explaining or discussing the
   ratings they provided, and to identify the factors they perceived to be
   the most and least important. Of the initial list of factors, nine came
   to consensus as being important or very important, including factors
   such as owner occupancy, quality of installation or materials, and
   postconstruction follow-up programs. In addition, 10 factors provoked
   particularly diverse, or contentious, opinions with ratings that more
   than doubled the target criteria for consensus. These contentious
   factors are analyzed to identify trends and debates in expert opinion
   that showcase future research needs as well as issues that practitioners
   must address to build sustainable systems. (C) 2013 American Society of

Journal = {{NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{683-704}},
Abstract = {{We hypothesize that total hillslope water loss for a rainfall-runoff
   event is inversely related to a function of a lognormal random variable,
   based on basin-and point-scale observations taken from the 21 km(2)
   Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) in Mississippi, USA. A
   top-down approach is used to develop a new runoff generation model both
   to test our physical-statistical hypothesis and to provide a method of
   generating ensembles of runoff from a large number of hillslopes in a
   basin. The model is based on the assumption that the probability
   distributions of a runoff/loss ratio have a space-time rescaling
   property. We test this assumption using streamflow and rainfall data
   from GCEW. For over 100 rainfall-runoff events, we find that the spatial
   probability distributions of a runoff/loss ratio can be rescaled to a
   new distribution that is common to all events. We interpret random
   within-event differences in runoff/loss ratios in the model to arise
   from soil moisture spatial variability. Observations of water loss
   during events in GCEW support this interpretation. Our model preserves
   water balance in a mean statistical sense and supports our hypothesis.
   As an example, we use the model to generate ensembles of runoff at a
   large number of hillslopes for a rainfall-runoff event in GCEW.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{10095-10112}},
Abstract = {{In order to understand the aging and processing of organic aerosols
   (OA), an intensive field campaign (Campaign of Air Pollution at Typical
   Coastal Areas IN Eastern China, CAPTAIN) was conducted March-April at a
   receptor site (a Changdao island) in central eastern China. Multiple
   fast aerosol and gas measurement instruments were used during the
   campaign, including a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass
   spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) that was applied to measure mass
   concentrations and non-refractory chemical components of submicron
   particles (PM1nr). The average mass concentration of PM1(PM1nr+black
   carbon) was 47 +/- 36 mu g m(-3) during the campaign and showed distinct
   variation, depending on back trajectories and their overlap with source
   regions. Organic aerosol (OA) is the largest component of PM1 (30\%),
   followed by nitrate (28\%), sulfate (19\%), ammonium (15\%), black
   carbon (6\%), and chloride (3\%). Four OA components were resolved by
   positive matrix factorization (PMF) of the high-resolution spectra,
   including low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA),
   semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and a
   coal combustion OA (CCOA). The mass spectrum of CCOA had high abundance
   of fragments from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (m/z 128, 152,
   178, etc.). The average atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon in OA (O/C) at
   Changdao was 0.59, which is comparable to other field studies reported
   at locations downwind of large pollution sources, indicating the
   oxidized nature of most OA during the campaign. The evolution of OA
   elemental composition in the van Krevelen diagram (H/C vs. O/C) showed a
   slope of -0.63; however, the OA influenced by coal combustion exhibits a
   completely different evolution that appears dominated by physical
   mixing. The aging of organic aerosols vs. photochemical age was
   investigated. It was shown that OA/Delta CO, as well as LV-OOA/Delta CO
   and SV-OOA/Delta CO, positively correlated with photochemical age.
   LV-OOA accounted for 73\% of the OA secondary formation (SOA) in the
   oldest plumes (photochemical age of 25 h). The kOH at Changdao, by
   assuming SOA formation and aging as a first-order process proportional
   to OH, was calculated to be 5.2x10(-12) cm(3) molec.(-1) s(-1), which is
   similar to those determined in recent studies of polluted air in other
   continents.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic sensors are being employed on airborne platforms, such as
   Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) and Persistent Ground
   Surveillance System (PGSS), for source localization. Under certain
   atmospheric conditions, airborne sensors offer a distinct advantage over
   ground sensors. Among other factors, the performance of airborne sensors
   is affected by refraction of sound signals due to vertical gradients in
   temperature and wind velocity. A comprehensive experiment in source
   localization with an aerostat-mounted acoustic system was conducted in
   summer of 2010 at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG). Acoustic sources on the
   ground consisted of one-pound TNT denotations and small arms firings.
   The height of the aerostat was approximately 1 km above the ground. In
   this paper, horizontal, azimuthal, and elevation errors in source
   localization and their statistics are studied in detail. Initially,
   straight-line propagation is assumed; then refraction corrections are
   introduced to improve source localization and decrease the errors. The
   corrections are based on a recently developed theory {[}Ostashev, et.
   al, JASA 2008] which accounts for sound refraction due to vertical
   profiles of temperature and wind velocity. During the 2010 YPG field
   test, the vertical profiles were measured only up to a height of
   approximately 100 m. Therefore, the European Center for Medium-range
   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used to generate the profiles for July of
   2010.}},

   anode active material is a Si-Ti-Ni alloy with good ionic and electronic
   conductivity that attains a stable specific capacity of 400 mAh g-1
   based upon the total mass of the composite anode. To our knowledge, this
   is the highest stable Si-based all-solid-state anode specific capacity
   reported to date. To utilize both a lithium free anode and cathode, we
   adopt a pre-lithiation technique involving stabilized lithium metal

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{We present a high-resolution Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment
   (GRACE) mascon solution for Gulf of Alaska (GOA) glaciers and compare
   this with in situ glaciological, climate and other remote-sensing
   observations. Our GRACE solution yields a GOA glacier mass balance of
   -65 +/- 11 Gta(-1) for the period December 2003 to December 2010, with
   summer balances driving the interannual variability. Between
   October/November 2003 and October 2009 we obtain a mass balance of -61
   +/- 11 Gta(-1) from GRACE, which compares well with -65 +/- 12 Gta(-1)
   from ICESat based on hypsometric extrapolation of glacier elevation
   changes. We find that mean summer (June-August) air temperatures derived
   from both ground and lower-troposphere temperature records were good
   predictors of GRACE-derived summer mass balances, capturing 59\% and
   72\% of the summer balance variability respectively. Large mass losses
   during 2009 were likely due to low early melt season surface albedos,
   measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   and likely associated with the 31 March 2009 eruption of Mount Redoubt,
   southwestern Alaska. GRACE data compared well with in situ measurements
   at Wolverine Glacier (maritime Alaska), but poorly with those at Gulkana
   Glacier (interior Alaska). We conclude that, although GOA mass estimates
   from GRACE are robust over the entire domain, further constraints on
   subregional and seasonal estimates are necessary to improve fidelity to
   ground observations.}},

Abstract = {{The aqueous outflow system (AOS), including the trabecular meshwork
   (TM), the collector channels (CC) and the Schlemm's canal (SC),
   regulates intraocular pressure (IOP) through the drainage of the aqueous
   humor (AH). Abnormal IOP elevation leads to increased pressure stress to
   retinal ganglion cells, resulting in cell loss that can ultimately lead
   to complete loss of eyesight. Therefore, development of imaging tools to
   detect abnormal structural and functional changes of the AOS is
   important in early diagnosis and prevention of glaucoma. Multiphoton
   microscopy (MPM), including two-photon autofluorescence (TPAF) and
   second harmonic generation (SHG), is a label-free microscopic technique
   that allows molecular specific imaging of biological tissues like the
   TM. Since the TM and other AOS structures are located behind the highly
   scattering scleral tissue, transscleral imaging of the TM does not
   provide enough optical resolution. In this work, a gonioscopic lens is
   used to allow direct optical access of the TM through the cornea for MPM
   imaging. Compared to transscleral imaging, the acquired MPM images show
   improved resolution as individual collagen fiber bundles of the TM can
   be observed. MPM gonioscopy may have the potential to be developed as a
   future clinical imaging tool for glaucoma diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{For many years, it has been suggested that mitigation of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be achieved by Fixing CO2 as algal
   biomass. New EPA regulations limit greenhouse gas emissions from new
   power plants, and thus power plants have additional impetus to decide if
   co-location with algal ponds is a feasible strategy for CO2 mitigation.
   Herein we provide some illustrative benchmarking calculations based on
   fundamental relationships to highlight the general concerns for
   algae-utility co-location. We introduce our own life-cycle and
   techno-economic analysis software to analyze utility-specific concerns,
   such as total pond area, the percentage of CO2 in the flue gas, and the
   CO2 utilization efficiency. The results indicate that localized
   strategies should be pursued to reduce the excessive energy requirements
   for long-distance CO2 delivery. Furthermore, research should focus on
   improving the ability of growth reactors to efficiently utilize CO2.
   Improvements in CO2 delivery methods, such as absorption of CO2 into
   liquid media, could greatly reduce energy inputs and thus improve the
   process economics and sustainability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A potential method of improving the performance of geotechnical systems
   involving unsaturated soils is to induce water flow away from heat
   exchangers embedded in the soil, with the goal of maintaining
   unsaturated conditions. The mechanical response of an unsaturated,
   compacted silt layer with a heat exchanger embedded at mid-height is
   investigated in this study using a plate load test. Plate load tests
   after different stages of heating indicate an increase in stiffness of
   the soil layer with increasing temperature. Further, the soil layer was
   observed to exhibit irreversible contraction during heating which led to
   a greater stiffness upon subsequent cooling. The results from this
   preliminary study indicate the potential for using embedded heat
   exchangers for the mechanical improvement of geotechnical systems
   incorporating unsaturated soils.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a new triaxial cell which was developed to measure
   the shear strength of unsaturated soils under elevated temperatures and
   high suction magnitudes. Suction control is implemented by circulating
   vapor through a soil specimen having an initially low degree of
   saturation. The relative humidity in the vapor is controlled using an
   automated humidity system which uses a probe in the bottom platen of the
   triaxial cell to partition wet and dry Nitrogen gas through the
   specimen. The temperature of the soil specimen is controlled using
   heating elements in the cell fluid. This paper also presents the
   experimental procedures used to calibrate the temperature effects on the
   deformation response of the cell and the suction control system under
   elevated temperatures. The results from this study indicate the
   versatility of this new device in measuring the shear strength and
   volume change of soils under high temperature and suction magnitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The Uintah Basin in northeastern Utah, a region of intense oil and gas
   extraction, experienced ozone (O-3) concentrations above levels harmful
   to human health for multiple days during the winters of 2009-2010 and
   2010-2011. These wintertime O-3 pollution episodes occur during cold,
   stable periods when the ground is snow-covered, and have been linked to
   emissions from the oil and gas extraction process. The Uintah Basin
   Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS) was a field intensive in early 2012, whose
   goal was to address current uncertainties in the chemical and physical
   processes that drive wintertime O-3 production in regions of oil and gas
   development. Although elevated O-3 concentrations were not observed
   during the winter of 2011-2012, the comprehensive set of observations
   tests our understanding of O-3 photochemistry in this unusual emissions
   environment. A box model, constrained to the observations and using the
   near-explicit Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3.2 chemistry scheme, has
   been used to investigate the sensitivities of O-3 production during
   UBWOS 2012. Simulations identify the O-3 production photochemistry to be
   highly radical limited (with a radical production rate significantly
   smaller than the NOx emission rate). Production of OH from O-3
   photolysis (through reaction of O(D-1) with water vapor) contributed
   only 170 pptv day(-1), 8\% of the total primary radical source on
   average (primary radicals being those produced from non-radical
   precursors). Other radical sources, including the photolysis of
   formaldehyde (HCHO, 52 \%), nitrous acid (HONO, 26 \%), and nitryl
   chloride (ClNO2, 13 \%) were larger. O-3 production was also found to be
   highly sensitive to aromatic volatile organic compound (VOC)
   concentrations, due to radical amplification reactions in the oxidation
   scheme of these species. Radical production was shown to be small in
   comparison to the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), such that NOx
   acted as the primary radical sink. Consequently, the system was highly
   VOC sensitive, despite the much larger mixing ratio of total non-methane
   hydrocarbons (230 ppbv (2080 ppbC), 6 week average) relative to NOx (5.6
   ppbv average). However, the importance of radical sources which are
   themselves derived from NOx emissions and chemistry, such as ClNO2 and
   HONO, make the response of the system to changes in NOx emissions
   uncertain. Model simulations attempting to reproduce conditions expected
   during snow-covered cold-pool conditions show a significant increase in
   O-3 production, although calculated concentrations do not achieve the
   highest seen during the 2010-2011 O-3 pollution events in the Uintah
   Basin. These box model simulations provide useful insight into the
   chemistry controlling winter O-3 production in regions of oil and gas
   extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic nanometrology using coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
   light detection is a unique and powerful tool for probing ultrathin
   films with a wide range of mechanical properties and thicknesses well
   under 100 nm. In this technique, short wavelength acoustic waves are
   generated through laser excitation of a nano-patterned metallic grating,
   and then probed by diffracting coherent EUV beams from the dynamic
   surface deformation. Both longitudinal and surface acoustic waves within
   thin films and metallic nanostructures can be observed using EUV light
   as a phase-sensitive probe. The use of nanostructured metal transducers
   enables the generation of particularly short wavelength surface acoustic
   waves, which truly confine the measurement within the ultrathin film
   layer of interest, to thicknesses < 50 nm for the first time.
   Simultaneous measurement of longitudinal and transverse surface wave
   velocities yields both the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the
   film. In the future, this approach will make possible precise mechanical
   characterization of nanostructured systems at sub-10 nm length scales.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{14862-14867}},
Abstract = {{Photoinhibited superresolution (PInSR) lithography is a two-color,
   one-photon scheme that promises high throughput far-field patterning at
   deep subwavelength scales. The technique requires that active species
   are confined for some minimum time to the illuminated area where they
   are generated. We investigate here the extent to which this condition is
   met for published materials. Using spatial and temporal control of
   focused beams as well as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
   (FRAP), we probe the dynamics of photoinhibition in the PInSR material
   system. Our results indicate fast out-diffusion of unreacted
   photoinhibitor from the submicron optical spot during the polymerization
   interval, resulting in uniform rather than structured inhibition.
   Published results are consistent with this mechanism, indicating that
   superresolved polymer confinement with PInSR has not yet been shown with
   structured inhibition. To address the issue, we propose modifications to
   the material and exposure to slow inhibitor out-diffusion and accelerate
   polymer gelation.}},

Abstract = {{Three water-soluble polysiloxane benzophenone photoinitiators
   (W-Si-HBP2-A/B/C) with various silicon content used for preparing a
   gradient polymer were synthesized based on the traditional
   photoinitiator 4-hydroxybenzophenone (HBP) and aminopolysiloxane. The
   structures were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1
   NMR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The water solubility of
   the photoinitiators, the effect of the silicon content on their triplet
   state lifetimes and photopolymerization property and the self-floating
   ability in the water system, and the internal connection between the
   surface morphology and property of the gradient polymer and film
   initiated by the photoinitiators were investigated. All three
   photoinitiators showed relatively good solubility in water, and longer
   triplet lifetimes and a smaller rate constant than HBP. It is found that
   the photoinitiator with the highest silicon content had the best
   floating capability due to lower surface tension and energy of
   polysiloxane. By using this photoinitiator, the gradient polymer with a
   significant molecular weight gradient was obtained. In addition, the
   polysiloxane-based photoinitiators can decrease the dispersion surface
   energy of the gradient polymer, and the increase of photoinitiator
   content can change the microstructure of the gradient polymer film. The
   new green method for preparing gradient polymeric material by using the
   polymerization technology and the water-soluble polysiloxane-based
   photoinitiators may have potential applications in the green chemical
   industry.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{10267-10273}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate here that coupling specific amino acid ``R{''} groups to
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains through amide bonds and adsorbing them
   to platinum (Pt) black improves oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
   catalysis over a bare metal, even at high polymer loadings. Through our
   studies, we first show that the presence of PEG on the Pt nanoparticles
   increases half-wave (E-1/2) potentials, most likely by preventing Pt
   oxidation or Pt-OH formation. We also show, however, that increases in
   E-1/2 did not necessarily correlate with gains in mass activities, and
   that while commercial PEG-OH in fact lowered mass activities,
   conjugation of PEG to alcohol-containing amino acid R groups connected
   by amide bonds led to 100-200\% gains in reactivity. This work presents
   evidence that counters the common conception that organic capping
   ligands decrease catalytic activity; in fact activity may actually be
   improved over the bare metal through judicious choice and design of
   ligands that inhibit Pt oxidation and control chain packing at the Pt
   surface. These studies therefore show that it may still be possible to
   have ligands on a nanoparticle surface that allow the particles to be
   well-dispersed on an electrode surface while simultaneously enhancing
   catalysis without further particle treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we set forth a detailed analysis of the mechanical
   characteristics of anthropomorphic prosthetic hands. We report on an
   empirical study concerning the performance of several commercially
   available myoelectric prosthetic hands, including the Vincent, iLimb,
   iLimb Pulse, Bebionic, Bebionic v2, and Michelangelo hands. We
   investigated the finger design and kinematics, mechanical joint
   coupling, and actuation methods of these commercial prosthetic hands.
   The empirical findings are supplemented with a compilation of published
   data on both commercial and prototype research prosthetic hands. We
   discuss numerous mechanical design parameters by referencing examples in
   the literature. Crucial design trade-offs are highlighted, including
   number of actuators and hand complexity, hand weight, and grasp force.
   Finally, we offer a set of rules of thumb regarding the mechanical
   design of anthropomorphic prosthetic hands.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{7361-7379}},
Abstract = {{This study characterizes the spatial and temporal patterns of aerosol
   and precipitation composition at six sites across the United States
   Southwest between 1995 and 2010. Precipitation accumulation occurs
   mostly during the wintertime (December-February) and during the monsoon
   season (July-September). Rain and snow pH levels are usually between
   5-6, with crustal-derived species playing a major role in acid
   neutralization. These species (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) exhibit their
   highest concentrations between March and June in both PM2.5 and
   precipitation due mostly to dust. Crustal-derived species concentrations
   in precipitation exhibit positive relationships with SO42-, NO3-, and
   Cl-, suggesting that acidic gases likely react with and partition to
   either crustal particles or hydrometeors enriched with crustal
   constituents. Concentrations of particulate SO42- show a statistically
   significant correlation with rain SO42- unlike snow SO42-, which may be
   related to some combination of the vertical distribution of SO42- (and
   precursors) and the varying degree to which SO42--enriched particles act
   as cloud condensation nuclei versus ice nuclei in the region. The coarse
   : fine aerosol mass ratio was correlated with crustal species
   concentrations in snow unlike rain, suggestive of a preferential role of
   coarse particles (mainly dust) as ice nuclei in the region.
   Precipitation NO3-:SO42- ratios exhibit the following features with
   potential explanations discussed: (i) they are higher in precipitation
   as compared to PM2.5; (ii) they exhibit the opposite annual cycle
   compared to particulate NO3- : SO42- ratios; and (iii) they are higher
   in snow relative to rain during the wintertime. Long-term trend analysis
   for the monsoon season shows that the NO3-:SO42- ratio in rain increased
   at the majority of sites due mostly to air pollution regulations of
   SO42- precursors.}},

Title = {{Positive matrix factorization of PM2.5 - eliminating the effects of
   gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{7381-7393}},
Abstract = {{Gas-phase concentrations of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were
   calculated from gas/particle (G/P) partitioning theory using their
   measured particle-phase concentrations. The particle-phase data were
   obtained from an existing filter measurement campaign (27 January 2003-2
   October 2005) as a part of the Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH)
   study, including 970 observations of 71 SVOCs (Xie et al., 2013). In
   each compound class of SVOCs, the lighter species (e. g. docosane in n
   alkanes, fluoranthene in PAHs) had higher total concentrations
   (gas+particle phase) and lower particle-phase fractions. The total SVOC
   concentrations were analyzed using positive matrix factorization (PMF).
   Then the results were compared with source apportionment results where
   only particle-phase SVOC concentrations were used (particle only-based
   study; Xie et al., 2013). For the particle only-based PMF analysis, the
   factors primarily associated with primary or secondary sources (n
   alkane, EC/sterane and inorganic ion factors) exhibit similar
   contribution time series (r = 0.92-0.98) with their corresponding
   factors (n alkane, sterane and nitrate+sulfate factors) in the current
   work. Three other factors (light n alkane/PAH, PAH and summer/odd n
   alkane factors) are linked with pollution sources influenced by
   atmospheric processes (e. g. G/P partitioning, photochemical reaction),
   and were less correlated (r = 0.69-0.84) with their corresponding
   factors (light SVOC, PAH and bulk carbon factors) in the current work,
   suggesting that the source apportionment results derived from
   particle-only SVOC data could be affected by atmospheric processes. PMF
   analysis was also performed on three temperature-stratified subsets of
   the total SVOC data, representing ambient sampling during cold (daily
   average temperature < 10 degrees C), warm (>= 10 degrees C and <= 20
   degrees C) and hot (> 20 degrees C) periods. Unlike the particle
   only-based study, in this work the factor characterized by the low
   molecular weight (MW) compounds (light SVOC factor) exhibited strong
   correlations (r = 0.82-0.98) between the full data set and each sub-data
   set solution, indicating that the impacts of G/P partitioning on
   receptor-based source apportionment could be eliminated by using total
   SVOC concentrations.}},

   shape and molecular architecture through covalent bonds that are
   ubiquitous throughout the network structure. These materials, in
   particular in their swollen gel state, have been widely used as stimuli
   responsive materials with their ability to change volume in response to
   changes in temperature, pH, or other solvent conditions and have also
   been used in shape memory applications. However, the existence of a
   permanent, unalterable shape and structure dictated by the covalently
   crosslinked structure has dramatically limited their abilities in this
   and many other areas. These materials are not generally reconfigurable,
   recyclable, reprocessable, and have limited ability to alter permanently
   their stress state, topography, topology, or structure. Recently, a new
   paradigm has been explored in crosslinked polymers - that of covalent
   adaptable networks (CANs) in which covalently crosslinked networks are
   formed such that triggerable, reversible chemical structures persist
   throughout the network. These reversible covalent bonds can be triggered
   through molecular triggers, light or other incident radiation, or
   temperature changes. Upon application of this stimulus, rather than
   causing a temporary shape change, the CAN structure responds by
   permanently adjusting its structure through either reversible
   addition/condensation or through reversible bond exchange mechanisms,
   either of which allow the material to essentially reequilibrate to its
   new state and condition. Here, we provide a tutorial review on these
   materials and their responsiveness to applied stimuli. In particular, we
   review the broad classification of these materials, the nature of the
   chemical bonds that enable the adaptable structure, how the properties
   of these materials depend on the reversible structure, and how the
   application of a stimulus causes these materials to alter their shape,
   topography, and properties.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a synoptic climatology for Lake El' gygytgyn, Chukotka
   Russia, and explored modern climate trends affecting air temperatures
   there to aid in paleoclimate reconstructions of a 3.6 million-year-old
   sediment core taken from the lake. Our self-organized mapping (SOM)
   approach identified 35 synoptic weather patterns, based on sea level
   pressure, that span the range of synoptic patterns influencing the study
   domain over the 1961-2009 NCEP/NCAR analysis period. We found strong
   seasonality in modern weather patterns, with summer weather primarily
   characterized by weak low pressure systems over the Arctic Ocean or
   Siberia and winter weather primarily characterized by strong high
   pressure over the Arctic Ocean and strong low pressure in the Pacific
   Ocean. In general, the primary source of variation in air temperatures
   came from the dominant patterns in each season, which we identify in the
   text, and nearly all of the dominant weather patterns here have shown
   increasing temperatures. We found that nearly all of the warming in mean
   annual temperature over the past 50 yr (about 3 C) occurred during
   sub-freezing conditions on either side of summer (that is, spring and
   fall). Here we found that the most summer-like weather patterns (low
   pressures to the north) in the shoulder seasons were responsible for
   much of the change. Finally, we compared the warmest 15 yr of the record
   (1995-2009) to the coolest (1961-1975) and found that changes in
   thermodynamics of weather were about 3 to 300 times more important than
   changes in frequency of weather patterns in controlling temperature
   variations during spring and fall, respectively. That is, in the modern
   record, general warming (local or advected) is more important by orders
   of magnitude than changes in storm tracks in controlling air temperature
   at Lake El'gygytgyn. We conclude with a discussion of how these results
   may be relevant to the paleoclimate reconstruction efforts and how this
   relevancy could be tested further.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue fusion is a complex, poorly understood process which bonds
   collagenous tissues together using heat and pressure. The goal of this
   study is to elucidate the role of hydration in bond efficacy. Hydration
   of porcine splenic arteries (n=30) was varied by pre-fusion treatments:
   24-48 hour immersion in isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic baths.
   Treated arteries were fused in several locations using Conmed's Altrus
   thermal fusion device and the bursting pressure was then measured for
   each fused segment. Artery sections were then weighed before and after
   lyophilization, to quantify water content. Histology (H\&E, EVG
   staining) enabled visualization of the bonding interface. Bursting
   pressure was significantly greater (p=4.17 E-11) for the hypotonic group
   (607.6 +/- 83.2mmHg), while no significant difference existed between
   the isotonic (332.6 +/- 44.7mmHg) and hypertonic (348.7 +/- 44.0mmHg)
   treatment groups. Total water content varied (p=8.80 E-24) from low
   water content in the hypertonic samples (72.5\% weight +/- 0.9), to high
   water content in the hypotonic samples (83.1\% weight +/- 1.9), while
   the isotonic samples contained 78.8\% weight +/- 1.1. Strength
   differences between the treated vessels imply that bound water driven
   from the tissue during fusion may reveal available collagen crosslinking
   sites to facilitate bond formation during the fusion process. Thus when
   the tissue contains greater bound water volumes, more crosslinking sites
   may become available during fusion, leading to a stronger bond. This
   study provides an important step towards understanding the chemistry
   underlying tissue fusion and the mechanics of tissue fusion as a
   function of bound water within the tissue.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{215}},
Pages = {{467-479}},
Abstract = {{Laser altimetry (lidar) is a remote-sensing technology that holds
   tremendous promise for mapping snow depth in snow hydrology and
   avalanche applications. Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of
   applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological
   improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and
   ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights
   and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical
   vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order
   1 m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide
   millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1 m to
   several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse
   rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require
   specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested
   and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric
   scattering component, requiring different considerations for error
   estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published
   estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative
   transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar
   mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow
   surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and
   recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric mineral dust particles exert significant direct radiative
   forcings and are important drivers of climate and climate change. We
   used the GEOS-Chem global three-dimensional chemical transport model
   (CTM) coupled with the Fu-Liou-Gu (FLG) radiative transfer model (RTM)
   to investigate the dust radiative forcing and heating rate based on
   different vertical profiles for April 2006. We attempt to actually
   quantify the sensitivities of radiative forcing to dust vertical
   profiles, especially the discrepancies between using realistic and
   climatological vertical profiles. In these calculations, dust emissions
   were constrained by observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD). The
   coupled calculations utilizing a more realistic dust vertical profile
   simulated by GEOS-Chem minimize the physical inconsistencies between 3-D
   CTM aerosol fields and the RTM. The use of GEOS-Chem simulated vertical
   profile of dust extinction, as opposed to the FLG prescribed vertical
   profile, leads to greater and more spatially heterogeneous changes in
   the estimated radiative forcing and heating rate produced by dust. Both
   changes can be attributed to a different vertical structure between dust
   and non-dust source regions. Values of the dust vertically resolved AOD
   per grid level (VRAOD) are much larger in the middle troposphere, though
   smaller at the surface when the GEOS-Chem simulated vertical profile is
   used, which leads to a much stronger heating rate in the middle
   troposphere. Compared to the FLG vertical profile, the use of GEOS-Chem
   vertical profile reduces the solar radiative forcing at the top of
   atmosphere (TOA) by approximately 0.2-0.25 W m(-2) over the African and
   Asian dust source regions. While the Infrared (IR) radiative forcing
   decreases 0.2 W m(-2) over African dust belt, it increases 0.06 W m(-2)
   over the Asian dust belt when the GEOS-Chem vertical profile is used.
   Differences in the solar radiative forcing at the surface between the
   use of the GEOS-Chem and FLG vertical profiles are most significant over
   the Gobi desert with a value of about 1.1 W m(-2). The radiative forcing
   effect of dust particles is more pronounced at the surface over the
   Sahara and Gobi deserts by using FLG vertical profile, while it is less
   significant over the downwind area of Eastern Asia.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{The wideband modes of multiarmed spiral antennas are studied, with the
   goal of obtaining insight into their potential for stable pattern
   nulling over extremely wide bandwidths. Using the mode theory, it is
   found that for stable and extremely wideband operation, a maximum of N -
   2 nulls may be inserted into an N-armed spiral's pattern. Single and
   multiple null insertions are demonstrated numerically and
   experimentally, using three-, four-, and eight-armed spirals. Spiral
   mode theory is also utilized to determine limitations imposed by the
   unequal mode impedances of the multiarmed spiral. Techniques for
   compensation of frequency-dependent null rotation are also discussed,
   where it is shown that a simple delay-line compensation technique is
   satisfactory for stabilizing the null locations over modest bandwidths.
   It is also shown that the number of nulls that can be practically
   inserted in the pattern is limited not only by the number of arms, but
   also by the size of the antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Novel ABC triblock copolymers containing hydrophobic, imidazolium ionic
   liquid (IL)-based ionic, and non-charged hydrophilic blocks were
   synthesized by direct sequential, ring-opening metathesis polymerization
   (ROMP) of three chemically immiscible norborene monomers. The resulting
   ABC triblock copolymers were found by small-angle X-ray scattering to
   phase-separate into different nanostructures in their pure melt states,
   depending on their block sequence and compositions. Supported composite
   membranes of these triblock copolymers were successfully fabricated with
   defect-free, <= 20 microns thick top coatings. Preliminary CO2/light gas
   transport studies demonstrated the potential of this new type of
   IL-based block copolymer material for gas separation applications.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic/thermodynamic shallow-ice model SICOPOLIS is applied to the
   Greenland ice sheet. Paleoclimatic spin-ups from 125 ka BP until today,
   as well as future-climate experiments 500 years into the future, are
   carried out with three different grid spacings, namely 20,10 and 5 km.
   The scenarios are a subset of those specified by the SeaRISE (Sea-level
   Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) community effort. The bed topography
   includes improved troughs for Jakobshavn Isbrae, Helheim,
   Kangerdlugssuaq and Petermann glaciers, processed by an algorithm that
   preserves shape, orientation and continuity of the troughs on the 5 km
   scale. Comparison of simulated and observed present-day surface
   velocities shows that these ice streams and outlet glaciers are resolved
   with different accuracies, ranging from poor (20 km grid) to reasonably
   good (5 km grid). In the future-climate experiments, the simulated
   absolute ice volumes depend significantly on the resolution, while the
   sensitivities (ice volumes relative to the constant-climate control run)
   vary only by a few centimeters of sea-level equivalent.}},

   as an approach to map deformation stages and surge progression}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},

Pages = {{279-286}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of a surge is manifested in the crevasse patterns:
   literally, deformation state frozen in ice. This basic observation is
   utilized as the concept of an automated approach to map and analyze
   deformation stages and progression of surge kinematics. The
   classification method allows imagery to be used as geophysical data and
   is applied to aerial observations (photographic and video imagery, GPS
   data) collected in September 2011 during the surge of the Bering
   Glacier-Bagley Ice Valley system, Alaska, USA. As the third dimension
   that complements two-dimensional imagery, ice-surface elevation is
   observed using aerial laser altimetry. The classification method builds
   on concepts from signal processing, geostatistical data analysis and
   neural networks. Steps include calculation of generalized directional
   vario functions from image data and composition into feature vectors.
   The vario function operates as an information filter that retains
   spatial characteristics at an intermediate scale that captures crevasse
   spacing, anisotropy and other generalized roughness properties.
   Association of feature vectors to crevasse classes and hence deformation
   types employs a connectionist algorithm. In general, the
   connectionist-geostatistical classification allows the mapping of
   kinematic changes in crevassed glaciers.}},

Pages = {{9235-9245}},
Abstract = {{The response of polycrystalline SrTiO3, fabricated by the flash
   sintering method, to ion beam irradiation was investigated by means of
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic scale modeling. The
   samples were implanted with 250 keV Ne ions at fluences between 1.11 x
   10(16) and 2.25 x 10(16) ions per cm(2) at room temperature and then
   characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy and high
   voltage TEM. We observed that this material has a large number of
   Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) faults, related to the non-stoichiometry of the
   material, in a random and sometimes complicated arrangement. These
   faults have a significant impact on the radiation damage evolution of
   the material. In particular, the faults amorphize more quickly than the
   surrounding SrTiO3 matrix. We examined the interaction of point defects
   with the RP faults using atomistic modeling and determined that both the
   thermodynamic and kinetic properties of defects are significantly
   influenced by the presence of the faults, providing insight into the
   experimental observations. We conclude that planar defects such as RP
   faults can have a significant impact on the radiation damage evolution
   of SrTiO3 and might be one avenue for controlling radiation tolerance in
   complex materials.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the design and execution of the BORTAS (Quantifying the
   impact of BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic
   using Aircraft and Satellites) experiment, which has the overarching
   objective of understanding the chemical aging of air masses that contain
   the emission products from seasonal boreal wildfires and how these air
   masses subsequently impact downwind atmospheric composition. The central
   focus of the experiment was a two-week deployment of the UK BAe-146-301
   Atmospheric Research Aircraft (ARA) over eastern Canada, based out of
   Halifax, Nova Scotia. Atmospheric ground-based and sonde measurements
   over Canada and the Azores associated with the planned July 2010
   deployment of the ARA, which was postponed by 12 months due to UK-based
   flights related to the dispersal of material emitted by the
   Eyjafjallajokull volcano, went ahead and constituted phase A of the
   experiment. Phase B of BORTAS in July 2011 involved the same atmospheric
   measurements, but included the ARA, special satellite observations and a
   more comprehensive ground-based measurement suite. The high-frequency
   aircraft data provided a comprehensive chemical snapshot of pyrogenic
   plumes from wildfires, corresponding to photochemical ( and physical)
   ages ranging from < 1 day to greater than or similar to 10 days, largely
   by virtue of widespread fires over Northwestern Ontario. Airborne
   measurements reported a large number of emitted gases including
   semi-volatile species, some of which have not been been previously
   reported in pyrogenic plumes, with the corresponding emission ratios
   agreeing with previous work for common gases. Analysis of the NOy data
   shows evidence of net ozone production in pyrogenic plumes, controlled
   by aerosol abundance, which increases as a function of photochemical
   age. The coordinated ground-based and sonde data provided detailed but
   spatially limited information that put the aircraft data into context of
   the longer burning season in the boundary layer. Ground-based
   measurements of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m ( PM2.5) over
   Halifax show that forest fires can on an episodic basis represent a
   substantial contribution to total surface PM2.5.}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has
   recently been developed to surpass the diffraction limit by roughly an
   order of magnitude. These methods depend on the ability to precisely and
   accurately measure the position of a single-molecule emitter, typically
   by fitting its emission pattern to a symmetric estimator (e.g. centroid
   or 2D Gaussian). However, single-molecule emission patterns are not
   isotropic, and depend highly on the orientation of the molecule's
   transition dipole moment, as well as its z-position. Failure to account
   for this fact can result in localization errors on the order of tens of
   nm for in-focus images, and similar to 50-200 nm for molecules at modest
   defocus. The latter range becomes especially important for
   three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule super-resolution techniques,
   which typically employ depths-of-field of up to similar to 2 mu m. To
   address this issue we report the simultaneous measurement of precise and
   accurate 3D single-molecule position and 3D dipole orientation using the
   Double-Helix Point Spread Function (DH-PSF) microscope. We are thus able
   to significantly improve dipole-induced position errors, reducing
   standard deviations in lateral localization from similar to 2x worse
   than photon-limited precision (48 nm vs. 25 nm) to within 5 nm of
   photon-limited precision. Furthermore, by averaging many estimations of
   orientation we are able to improve from a lateral standard deviation of
   116 nm (similar to 4x worse than the precision, 28 nm) to 34 nm (within
   6 nm).}},
